        "summer 's almost over and the seasons nearly here , hopes are high in denver this time of roster is set and our direction seems clear , will the nuggets make the playoffs and hit another gear ? we ca n't stand to be mediocre so we handed the keys over to the joker . nikola 's money like a stock broker , he 'll light you up like a chain move with the righty hook , reading defenses like picture books . hitting defenders with the no-looks , leaving defenses confused and we got jamal who can ball , confidence like he 's ten feet tall . ",
        "be careful steven adams or you might `` trip '' and fall . he 's going to get his buckets in flurries like a young stephen plays with this fiery fury , yeah that 's jamal murray . we got the one and the five , so who 's manning the two ? hello gary harris , it 's a pleasure to meet you . basket cuts to the hole will likely take a toll . but hitting game winners will surely steal your the three we have the thrill , changing speeds like a treadmill . his moves will give you headaches leaving you begging for advil . ",
        "shifting gears like he 's driving stick , he 's crafty and he 's quick . hits you with the cross leaving defenders feeling have our young core , but in the west you need paul millsap , our savvy vet at the four . his game might make you snore and fall asleep on the floor , but every young team needs a veteran west is going to be a fight and the standings are going to be your voice heard ? join the nugg love team ! we may not win a ring but our futures looking bright .
