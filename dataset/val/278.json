        "august has arrived , yet there 's still no end in sight for major-league teams , especially one like the white 's a young mix , and players know the only race they 'll have is the one to avoid setting a franchise record for losses . but it 's an important time for development and evaluation , which is why dylan covey was so disappointed after allowing seven runs in 41/3 innings on wednesday night , why yoan moncada was bummed to follow his 14th homer with his 16th 10-5 loss to the royals was the 107th game for the sox , which means they have 55 left . ",
        "they 're on pace to go 56-106 , matching their 162-game low-water mark from 1970 , and they 'll play 13 of their next 30 games against the yankees , red sox and said the problem against the royals was his lack of command , not the time of the year . `` i feel like at this level it 's tough all throughout the year , '' said the right-hander , who is 4-7 with a era . `` i feel good physically . i feel strong mentally . i 've just had an up and down last few outings . '' ",
        "`` you 're getting to a point in the season where you 've been driving and working , doing everything you can to put yourself in a good position , '' manager rick renteria said . `` as a club , always pushing to try to contend . we 're not in that situation . we 're in a ` continuing-to-develop ' mode . these guys now are seeing a little bit of what it is to still have two months of the regular season . `` twelve white sox players have yet to spend a full season in the major leagues . ",
        "they are in uncharted territory , gaining experience that should help them when top prospects and free-agent additions arrive and rebuilding ideally turns into contending . `` hopefully in the near future they 're not looking to just finish at the end of september but continue to push , '' renteria said . `` they 've got to find ways to put themselves in a position to continue to finish . i think they 're learning about that . `` tim anderson was back in the lineup after being yanked in the sixth inning tuesday when he did n't leave the batter 's box on a ball that turned into a bizarre fielder 's choice . ",
        "he made a great play to start the game , ranging far to his right and firing a long , accurate throw to retire the royals ' whit merrifield -- but that was one of very few sox moncada 's leadoff home run provided some false hope . the story of the game was the 10 runs the royals put on the board between the third and sixth innings , making fans wonder if renteria would bring in matt davidson for another save-the-bullpen are going to be a lot more of these nights between now and 2020 or 2021 -- whenever the white sox become a threat to the american league 's better teams -- so renteria will monitor the team 's approach as much as anything . ",
        "he sent a message when he benched anderson on tuesday but remains pleased that his players do a good job of pushing themselves and each said he 'll make a concession to the time of the season by backing off on some drills and side work but expects players to seek more work , not less . `` a lot of these guys are still pushing , '' renteria said . `` they 're still wanting to come out to do some extra stuff . so we 'll do what we need to do to accommodate them but also let them know they still need to get their rest and make sure they can finish the season .
