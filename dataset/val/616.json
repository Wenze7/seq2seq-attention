        "president trump has lashed out on twitter . now he is lashing out at a tweet thursday morning , trump attacked his social network of choice : `` twitter ` shadow banning ' prominent republicans . not good . we will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once ! many complaints . '' `` shadow banning '' refers to a practice that predates the birth of twitter : hiding or downgrading a user 's posts instead of banning the user , so that most people in an online forum can not see the president was likely referring to a report by vice news , which said wednesday it found that some republican lawmakers , the republican national committee chair and donald trump jr. 's spokesman no longer appeared in twitter 's auto-populated drop-down search reached thursday , a twitter spokesman said he would have no comment about the president 's tweet . ",
        "but he did address the shadow-banning charges : `` as we have said before , we do not ` shadowban . ' we are aware that some accounts are not automatically populating in our search box , and shipping a change to address this . the profiles , tweets and discussions about these accounts do appear when you search for them . `` kayvon beykpour , twitter 's head of product , tweeted wednesday that the disappearance of some of the republicans from the drop-down menu in search was a side effect of the company 's push to improve discourse on twitter by cracking down on trolls , an effort it outlined in may . ",
        "it involves taking into account user accounts ' behavioral signals , including how they interact with other twitter users . `` to be clear , our behavioral ranking does n't make judgements based on political views or the substance of tweets , '' he said . `` we 're always working to improve our behavior-based ranking models -- their breadth and accuracy will improve over time . `` a check thursday morning confirmed that the names mentioned in the vice article are once again appearing automatically in twitter 's search box , including that of rnc chair ronna mcdaniel , rep. devin nunes , r-california , rep. matt gaetz , r-florida , plus trump jr. 's spokesman , andrew that 's that , right ? ",
        "no , because it 's 2018 . ",
        "the president 's tweet , plus other republican outrage over the report , is just the latest complaint in what has become conservatives ' refrain : that silicon valley 's tech giants are biased against them -- despite the fact that it has become increasingly clear that disinformation on the very platforms they complain about were a factor in trump and the republicans ' victories at the polls in , the republican congressman , told the hill he felt `` victimized '' by two separate congressional hearings in april about facebook 's latest privacy scandal , which involved cambridge analytica -- a data consulting firm founded by conservatives that was used to help conservatives during the 2016 election -- several conservative lawmakers asked facebook ceo mark zuckerberg about what they perceived to be anti-conservative bias on the social , representatives from twitter , facebook and youtube were summoned to appear at a hearing last week before the house judiciary committee on capitol hill .",
        "they had to explain their content-filtering policies , and denied again that they are biased against that hearing , nick pickles , twitter 's global lead for public policy strategy , testified , `` our success as a company depends on making twitter a safe place for free expression and a place that serves healthy public conversation . `` the tech giants have sometimes had wildly divergent approaches to content example , in a discussion about fake news on its platform , facebook recently defended conspiracy theory-laden infowars ' right to free the other hand , youtube this week reportedly deleted four videos from the channel of alex jones -- who runs the infowars website and is perhaps most famous for popularizing the conspiracy theory that the 2012 mass school shooting at sandy hook was a hoax -- and issued a `` strike '' against him . ",
        "the verge reports that two of the videos contained hate speech against muslims , one contained hate speech against transgender people , and one -- titled `` how to prevent liberalism '' -- showed a child being pushed to the ground by an adult . `` we have longstanding policies against child endangerment and hate speech , '' a youtube spokesperson said thursday . `` we apply our policies consistently according to the content in the videos , regardless of the speaker or the channel . we also have a clear three strikes policy and we terminate channels when they receive three strikes in three months .
