        "big ten media days are in the rearview . fall camps open late next week . here are five takeaways from the conference 's annual gathering in chicago : prepare the can of wormsbig ten coaches have n't exactly embraced the idea of submitting names for a weekly player availability/injury report . but none was outwardly opposed . even michigan 's jim harbaugh , who has gone to comical lengths to hide his roster , said he would be `` fine with '' reporter was dying for ohio state defensive tackle dre'mont jones to invoke privacy concerns , but jones instead said : `` i am not opposed to disclosing my injury . ",
        "if i have an injury , you can tell whoever you want . `` and that 's the point . because coaches have been free to lie or omit information about injuries , players get heat from friends and fellow students making wagers . an official injury report would theoretically get bettors off the backs of are still major questions , including these : would a player be listed as probable/questionable/doubtful , and would the injured body part be specified ? and the biggest ones : who is in charge of administering the list ? the big ten ? the ncaa ? ",
        "what 's the penalty for subterfuge ? would schools have to specify if a player is suspended -- and for what infraction ? many coaches would rather dip their legs into boiling lava than deal with this . but commissioner jim delany left little doubt it will happen , saying , `` it 's something we should have done before and certainly should do now . `` nothing bothers the badgerswisconsin coach paul chryst did n't take the bait on a question about the relative weakness of the big ten west , saying , `` i do n't spend a lot of time trying to figure out narratives . ",
        "`` another narrative is that wisconsin is a mortal lock to win the big ten west . asked if his crew feels like the team to beat , safety d'cota dixon replied : `` i do n't care . whoever is on the schedule , get out the way . i just think of it like : line up . play football . whoever 's in front of me , beat 'em . `` that sounds like something chryst would say . `` does it ? '' dixon responded . `` that 's a good thing then . `` iowa 's quarterback is quietand that 's just fine with coach kirk ferentz , who said of nate stanley : `` he 's not a loud guy , a look-at-me guy . ",
        "almost shuns that . but on the things that count , he is so solid . mentally tough . he cares a lot about his performance -- and his teammates ' performance . he cares about them as people . all the that people respond to , he possesses them . `` stanley is from small-town wisconsin and sounds like he could be steve stricker 's son . stanley also excelled in basketball and baseball before taking the advice of his father , jay , who pointed out that schools offer many more football scholarships than they do for other one point tuesday , stanley was asked a question that should have made him chuckle : do you trash-talk on the field ? ",
        "`` not a whole lot , '' he used to an east and a westas long as delany is commissioner , the conference will not try to manipulate the obvious imbalance of power . `` we 've had two experiences with divisions , '' delany said . `` the first one was based on competitive balance over the last 20 years . and to be honest with you , it was n't received that well . `` that was delany 's diplomatic dissing of legends and leaders , which the public embraced as warmly as the kale burger . delany can also point to how the sec east once ruled the west , going 10-4 in conference title games from 1993 to nebraska returns to its bob devaney/tom osborne form and if jeff brohm can be the second coming of joe tiller at purdue , the complaints will go away . ",
        "two big 's intrigue at ohio state and michiganwith barrett having left columbus and shea patterson having moved to ann arbor , there 's quarterback uncertainty in the land of woody and bo . ohio state could very well have the best tandem in the conference in dwayne haskins and tate martell , a new version of chris leak and tim tebow , who shared time for urban meyer 's 2006 national champions at florida . `` dwayne has a high ceiling and can launch the ball 100 yards off the knees , '' said jones , the ohio state lineman . ",
        "`` he kind of reminds me of cardale , but he 's not as goofy . tate is super-fast but needs to get a little stronger , like everyone else . `` michigan insiders believe patterson , who transferred from ole miss , is a cinch to win the starting job over brandon peters , who was at the helm last season for wins over rutgers , minnesota and maryland -- and losses to ohio state and south carolina . also potentially in the mix are redshirt freshman dylan mccaffrey and true freshman joe milton .
