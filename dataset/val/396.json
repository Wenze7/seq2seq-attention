        "the baltimore ravens and the chicago bears are going to give us the watered down football that comes with the preseason . it 's important to take it seriously , as the process is actually quite important . the thing that we must not do is over analysis on the first of five preseason games : the baltimore ravens are going to play the chicago bears in the pro football hall of fame game . that being said you wo n't see joe flacco or much of the starters . you wo n't be able to read into the play-calling too much . ",
        "you wo n't be able to see what the 2018 ravens are actually going to look like . this is a game much more like a fourth preseason game than the standard opener . this game is for backups , bubble players and young studs to number one thing the ravens are going to display in canton , ohio is their depth . the ravens have more depth than they had last year . the secondary for example added deshon elliott and anthony averett and tavon young is back from injury . the ravens could n't find seven viable receiver options last year , that is n't the case this back-end of the ravens receiving depth chart has a chance to make things interesting . ",
        "the ravens started the 2017 preseason with an already makeshift offensive line . in 2018 , the ravens are much more healthy along the offensive line . marshal yanda wo n't play thursday night , be he probably would n't even if he was at full strength . the ravens depth will be the first thing we actually get a glimpse of . if the ravens look strong throughout the contest , it is a positive sign about the stuffed nature of their camp ravens will also get to see which players are ahead of schedule . if for example , a player like jordan lasley steals the show , it is a sign that he is ready for bigger opportunities . ",
        "the ravens and their fans go into the game with certain expectations for their players . if players exceed those expectations , it does n't mean they are the next big thing . it does however mean that they are ahead of where they were expected to be . some players are gamers who will shine more in a game than they ever will in practice . that 's why we could be in for some fans will get their first glimpse at lamar jackson . while his first nfl action is incredibly important , we must not overreact to what we see . ",
        "if jackson lights chicago up , it changes nothing . if jackson fails to excite , it changes nothing . he is vying to be the backup and he is a developing quarterback getting important reps. ravens fans will get their first tease of the jackson era , but no grand prognostication can come from jackson 's play against the bears . that same thought could be applied to any rookie in this will not find out what changes are coming from the defense . don martindale is n't trying to put on a show before the real games even start . ",
        "martindale 's job is to get young players in a position to be successful . he will want to test his young players , but he 'll be restrained with what he does n't mean that he wo n't be more aggressive than dean pees was as defensive coordinator , just do n't expect to see that aggressiveness on thursday night . play-calling this early in the preseason is calculated so the ravens can evaluate what they want to evaluate . it 's also very early into the preseason , especially because the ravens and bears get a head start to the exhibition affairs . ",
        "many of the players who will be on the field , are n't totally up to speed with the entire scheme . the same exact things can be said about marty mornhinweg and the offense . "
