        "outfit : ralph lauren hatforever twenty one long sleve shirttopshop jeansnike air force 1 ' sthis is my favorite outfit from my how to style sneakers lookbook . i really love how simple this outfit is , but it 's still very cute . i added a baseball hat to make it a little more sporty . also , because i was going for a `` blue '' theme , i thought it went nicely with the rest of my outfit . the top is actually a long sleeve shirt from forever 21 that i cut and styled myself . ",
        "i cut it at an angle for a more interesting detail . i think this shirt looks so cute off the shoulder too ! thank you mama for my nice collarbones ! i wore this shirt with slightly ripped light washed denim . i wanted to continue the theme of a little skin showing but not too much . a rule i sometimes follow that i made up myself ... is skin on top and no skin on bottm and vise versa . i am showing some skin on top so i decided to keep it casual on the bottom . ",
        "these ` jamie ' jeans from topshop are my all time favorite fit . they are slightly high waisted and so flattering on the butt . they are also very stretchy even though they do n't look it . to complete the look i went with my white air force 1 's . i wanted to keep the outfit very neutral in terms of the color palette and let the pieces stand on their own . i definitely have to keep this outfit in mind for future outings !
