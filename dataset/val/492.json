        "there is still one unrestricted free agent forward that i would like to see the toronto maple leafs shore is his name and he would be an excellent addition to the toronto maple leafs in the role of fourth line centre or depth the leafs fourth line centre role could go to any number of players : frederick gauthier , per lindholm , adam brooks , or josh jooris . none of those guys really screams out for the job , but per linholdm is 26 and coming off a point-per-game season in the swedish elite league . he may have the inside track , and he might even be better than nick 've never seen him play and i do n`t have any advanced stats to go by , but lindholm is a definite option . ",
        "it would n't hurt to have a few options , shoreshore is 25 and spent most of his career with the kings , but also played with the senators and flames last season . he has scored less than one point every four games throughout his career , so he ` s not a scorer , and that is probably why he ` s three seasons in la , shore was consistently a positive possession player relative to his team , and he is known for his excellent at the leafs roster , you do n`t see many defensively minded players . ",
        "that is a good thing -- the best defense is a great offense , but it would n't hurt to have a strong defender or two . the leafs allowed way too many shots against last season and they also went through the season without a strong defensive centre . the best they could offer was the shadow of of tomas plecanek 's former self and a very aged dominic brings something the team is clearly missing , and he could be signed cheaply since he currently is without an nhl job . the toronto maple leafs made a similar move earlier when they signed tyler enis to a risk free deal with almost no cap hit . ",
        "or when they made this move of complete and baffling brilliance . if they could pull off the same move with shore they 'd have a nice back-up option if per lindholm ca n`t make the team , or in the case of toronto maple leafs have only three spaces left on their 50 contract limit , but signing nick shore would be a good use of one of those slots . he is a solid nhl player that could be had for almost nothing and who can fill a role and a position that the leafs are weak in .
