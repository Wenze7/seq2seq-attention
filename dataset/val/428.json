        "first of all , eres is doing 14-foot python became something of a rock star this week up in redding when he/she went missing as the carr fire closed in on the northern california town . sandra dodge-streich , owner of redding reptiles where eres hung out , says the snake was placed in a plastic bin and brought to a home as flames moved closer . and then , a few days ago , the lavender albino reticulated python slithered out of the bin and went authorities warning residents of south redding to keep their pets indoors while the search for eres unfolded , dodge-streich insisted that the only animals with anything to fear were chickens , for which eres apparently has a sweet fang .

        "on monday , searchers found eres coiled up in a milk that happy ending to our story , let 's look at some other snake-and-wildfire stories out there : rattlers in the burned-out zoneresearchers at central washington university wondered what became of critters who had fled a fire zone . what happens after the fire is put out ? joey chase , a graduate student with a keen interest in how wildfires affect rattlers , started tracking two male northern pacific rattlesnakes , each about 10 years old . he found them in an area where fire had burned 36 square miles in kittitas county , according to a report in the yakima herald . ",
        "chase wants to know if the snakes , whom he 's embedded with small radio transmitters and data loggers to gauge their body temperature , will stay away from the burned area . he planned to track the snakes ' movements a couple of times a week until the devices were removed . `` this is going to be the first study seeing how rattlesnakes are going to be affected by these large-scale events , which are getting more frequent and intense , '' said chase . he 's hoping the snakes come back to the fire areas , because removing one animal from such an intricate ecosytem , he said , could have negative effects on other members of that system , including eagles , owls , and badgers who feed on the in a charred landscapeother scientists are trying to find out if wildfires might actually be a good thing for snakes , opening up a tree canopy and creating more sun-basking opportunities for rattlesnakes . ",
        "penn state postdoctoral researcher chris howey has been looking into it and watching how snakes respond to wildfires . howey and his colleagues say timber rattlesnakes bask in sunny areas in order to absorb the heat they need to thrive . fire can wreak havoc on that forest canopy , they say , and therefore the mosaic of light and temperatures on the forest floor affects snakes in different ways than before the fire thinned out the foliage snake escapewriting in her blog , tough little birds , uc berkeley researcher katie labarbera has explored how various animals do when wildfire consumes their habitat . ",
        "`` most of the evidence suggests that animals can handle fire just fine , '' she writes . `` birds , larger mammals , and snakes move away from fire . frogs are safe if they can get to water . the animal you might most expect to be in big trouble , the turtle , has been frequently found in perfect health immediately after burns : they hide in burrows underground . smaller mammals may move or hide in burrows . '' labarbera says studies of a wildfire 's effect on different animals have shown that `` in a population of eastern diamondback rattlesnakes , the only mortalities were individuals in the midst of shedding their skin , which may have impaired their ability to sense or escape from the fire . ",
        "`` one snake 's wildfire disaster is another snake 's salvationsnakes and wildfires is a tale of two habitats . an article on the wildlife society 's website says that `` while the drought-stricken western united states is doing all it can to prevent wildfires , in the eastern portion of the country fire prevention spells doom for the once-thriving eastern diamondback rattlesnake . '' in a study several years ago published by jennifer fill in plos one , the university of south carolina graduate writes that forest fire prevention in the savannas of the southeast has led to loss of habitat for the rattlesnake . ",
        "`` fire is so important to the eastern diamondback 's habitat that fire exclusion is a serious barrier to diamondback conservation , '' fill writes . she says that eastern diamondbacks have lost close to 100 percent of their original habitat and continue to decline in number . `` in fact , '' says the article , `` eastern diamondbacks are considered endangered in north carolina , and the last verified sighting of the snake in louisiana was in 1995 . '' in the past , wildfire ensured a staple habitat for the snake , `` which prefers the open-canopy pine forests and savannas that are disappearing throughout its territory . ",
        "longleaf pines are the characteristic trees of these environments and are highly fire resistant . these trees are an integral part of habitat recovery after forest fires . '' suppress the fires , and you potentially remove a key element of the rattlesnake 's out for fleeing critterswhen wildfires strike , especially near urban and residential areas , many of the wild animals take off running -- or , in the case of an 8-foot-long rattlesnake fleeing the spring fire last month in southern colorado , slithering . evacuation centers are quickly set up for domestic animals when their owners have to quickly flee their homes , and stories abound about everything from cattle to horses to parakeets being rescued by animal-loving good samaritans . ",
        "the spring fire sent this rattler fleeing for its life , which created challenges for homeowners living on its flight path . some species easily escape a wildfire , some perish and others may even thrive as a result of the flames . birds take to the air , mammals run , and many smaller creatures burrow into the ground to escape the fire . snakes have been known to suddenly show up in residential subdivisions , which is why residents still in their homes near a wildfire are encouraged to keep their pets indoors and their eyes open for any new visitors sliding through the backyard .
