        "one of the more notable moments at the inaugural lollapalooza in 1991 arrived when jane 's addiction 's perry farrell joined forces with rapper ice-t to perform an explicit , button-pushing sly stone was a symbolic union of underground rock and gangsta rap , two outlaw genres that found common ground at sold-out amphitheaters across america that summer . it also represented a relative rarity in the early years of farrell 's festival : a hip-hop artist on the main stage . for much of lollapalooza 's early years , rap was a rarity save for token acts such as ice-t , ice cube and a tribe called quest . ",
        "the album charts reflected rock 's dominance that year , with only one hip-hop album inside the top 40 . but in the decades since , hip-hop has not only surged on the charts , it has become an increasingly larger presence at lollapalooza , which arrives thursday for its 14th year as a destination festival in grant park . veteran lolla fans lamenting that the festival `` is n't what it used to be '' are correct . the festival is no longer dominated by guitar-based bands as it was during the alternative-rock era that was the '90s . ",
        "this year 's bill also has a substantial hip-hop presence , a reflection of what 's not only selling on the pop charts but also streaming in record numbers on a variety of digital platforms , including post malone ; lil uzi vert ; logic ; travis scott ; tyler , the creator ; gucci mane ; lil pump ; and chicago 's g herbo , valee and dj 's `` beerbongs & bentleys '' is the year 's best-selling album so far , and his song `` psycho '' is the second most popular on in-demand streams , according to nielsen music .",
        "overall , the r&b / hip-hop genre is seeing a 26 percent increase in total album equivalent consumption , an amalgam of sales and streaming data , and widening its dominance as the most-consumed genre . overall , r&b and hip-hop have expanded their lead over rock , the next biggest genre , to percent this year over percent last music is most avidly consumed by young people who came of age as hip-hop became synonymous with pop in the last 20 years and as streaming on cellphones became the primary form of music distribution . lollapalooza reports that 70 percent of its patrons last year were between the ages of 18 and 34 , and 62 percent were women -- a 10 percent increase over numbers underline that lolla is drifting away from the rock that built its '90s `` brand , '' and embracing the music of a new generation of potential festivalgoers . ",
        "little wonder that the festival played an integral role in the recent rise of dance music in america . it initiated the perry 's stage as a platform for djs and hip-hop acts when it relaunched in grant park in 2005 . as edm boomed in recent years , lolla was booking the biggest djs and electronic artists , including daft punk , avicii , calvin harris , kaskade , bassnectar , dj snake and that 's not your thing , then you 're looking in the wrong direction . in many ways , riot fest -- which returns sept. . ",
        "14-16 to douglas park -- has usurped lollapalooza 's position as the premier rock festival in town . the top of this year 's lineup -- beck , elvis costello , incubus , interpol , liz phair , superchunk -- likely would 've played lollapalooza a decade 's a matter of perspective . at lollapalooza , those may be perceived as nostalgia acts that mean little or nothing to a good portion of its audience . at riot fest , they 're legends who can still draw a crowd .
