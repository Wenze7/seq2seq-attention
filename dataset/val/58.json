        "if the bears allowed optics to influence their decisions , they could use thursday night 's nationally televised hall of fame game as a commercial for rookie linebacker roquan bears would acquiesce in the complex contract dispute keeping smith out of training camp , announce a deal before kickoff and introduce him to america during a three-hour celebration of inside linebackers . the symmetry of the bears signing smith and the hall inducting brian urlacher , with dick butkus and mike singletary looking on in gold jackets , would maximize the moment for a franchise that takes pride in its tradition at the , the ongoing staredown between smith and the bears threatens to thwart all the progress made during a productive offseason . ",
        "smith remains the only unsigned draft pick among the 256 players selected in april . in a collision sport , the bears ' quest to avoid precedent and perhaps make the game safer has clashed with the need to far , the biggest casualty is common manager ryan pace has more to lose the longer this drags than smith , a major reason the bears need to make whatever concessions necessary . pace , beginning his fourth season after the bears went 14-34 in his first three , must give new coach matt nagy every resource possible for his first season -- and that includes the potential leader of the defense who 's capable of starting week sides have valid reasons for their respective stances on an issue too open for interpretation , a bridge no draft pick had to cross a year ago . ",
        "the woebegone bears , who gradually changed the vibe around halas hall since firing john fox and hiring nagy , have a bigger impetus to end the impasse . that does n't make smith more right than the bears . that merely recognizes the player is more likely than the team to emerge from a public debate unscathed . the bears have n't won a playoff game since 2010 , let alone the benefit of the doubt in holdup revolves around contract language affecting the bears ' ability to void smith 's guaranteed money if he gets suspended under the nfl 's new rule legislating helmet contact in the name of player rule prohibits `` using any part of a player 's helmet to butt , spear or ram an opponent . '' ",
        "nobody doubts that players who violate it will be flagged for unnecessary roughness , ejected and possibly suspended . but nobody knows what criteria officials will use to apply the provision , ambiguity that led draft picks such as bills outside linebacker tremaine edmunds and jets quarterback sam darnold to get their teams to acknowledge formally they would n't go after guaranteed , the bears refuse to budge . smith 's agents want the front office to stipulate it wo n't void any guarantees if he gets suspended . a linebacker as explosive and aggressive as smith figures to engage his helmet often making tackles or taking on blocks . ",
        "a source said the bears assured smith they would n't seek any guaranteed money in the event of a suspension , and they have history to back up their word : they did n't try to recoup money when linebacker danny trevathan was suspended one game for his hit on packers receiver davante adams . that qualifies as a good-faith why would the bears balk at putting that in writing the way other teams have ? the answer remains unclear , a strategy so defining that you suspect chairman george mccaskey and president ted phillips helped devise the bears ' stubbornness has been persuaded by the player safety movement sweeping through all levels of football . ",
        "it might seem noble if the bears held steadfast on the smith matter because they objected to protecting a player from the consequences of making illegal hits . but such a stance also would be naive in a bottom-line organization that has n't had a winning season since 2012 ca n't afford to take a philosophical stand that hurts the team as much as keeping smith out of the huddle does . the bears defense needs smith making plays more than the nfl needs the bears setting an example for safety comparing smith 's plight to the 31-day standoff in 2016 between the chargers and pass rusher joey bosa , the no . ",
        "3 pick that year . bosa missed the first four weeks of that season because of a pulled hamstring , the kind of soft-tissue injury players who miss camp often suffer . at 6-foot-5 and 280 pounds , bosa also had one job : get to the contrast , smith communicates with every layer of the defense and relies on athleticism as much as instinct , which only improves with repetition . ideally , smith will play in three exhibition games and start sept. . 9 against the taking such a hard line , the bears have allowed themselves to be ruled by the exception .
