        "taaaxi . it 's history in the making . today , nasa announced the first commercial astronauts who will be piloting the first crewed test-flights aboard spacex and boeing spacecraft . two teams of astronauts will be boarding a boeing starliner spacecraft launched on top of an atlas v rocket and a dragon capsule atop spacex 's falcon 9 , crews are made up of nine high-ranking engineers , nasa astronauts , marines , and air force pilots . among them is doug hurley , a marine corps test pilot who piloted the iconic space shuttle one last time back in july fact , if all goes according to plan , these missions would be the first time american astronauts are launching from soil since the retirement of the space shuttle in , abort . ",
        "it 's a momentous occasion that is setting the groundwork for the future of commercial space travel . but there 's an elephant in the room that is somewhat souring the occasion . just a day earlier , boeing announced it had to delay the first uncrewed test flight after an abort engine issue forced a test to be cut short back in june -- although it 's still unclear if it was the main cause for the delays . as a result , the first crewed test had to be pushed back to the summer of 2019 as commercial space race is really starting to heat up .

        "amazon and blue origin founder jeff bezos is aggressively increasing the funding of his spaceflight company , according to reuters . blue origin 's primary objective right now : get a new heavy-launch vehicle called new glenn into space within the next two traveling in style . despite these delays , astronauts have a far more comfy ride to the international space station to look forward to -- way more comfy than the cramped soyuz spacecraft still in service today , despite the fact that its designs date back to the received $ billion for its commercial crew transportation capability program in 2014 , while spacex got $ billion at the same time . ",
        "the goal : to develop the first generation of commercial spacecraft , finally bringing space travel into the 21st boeing 's starliner and spacex 's dragon can fit up to seven astronauts -- the soyuz spacecraft still in use today can only carry three . the starliner is even equipped with wireless internet for some in-flight entertainment . it can even stay docked to the iss for 210 days , giving it the potential to serve as astronaut in good time . it 's still not entirely clear when spacex 's dragon spacecraft will go on its first manned test flight . ",
        "in fact , spacex 's official website still predicts the first manned test flight to take place `` as early as 2018 . '' but when the time comes , astronauts will be able to enjoy environmental control and chose comfy onboard temperatures between 65 and 80 degrees fahrenheit . even in the worst case scenario , the dragon 's emergency escape system will gently push astronauts out to safety `` experiencing about the same g-forces as a ride at disneyland '' according to spacex 's official future of commercial space travel is looking bright , but not all systems are go . ",
        "engineers have their work cut out to ensure the safety of the first nine brave astronauts . but the clock is ticking . "
