        "the recent closing of kingsbury street cafe was largely unheralded , but for those who knew better , it marked the end of a distinguished career of a chef who influenced and changed chicago 's baking and pastry scene , ultimately changing how we eat met hoa tuy dong in 1980 , after she opened work of art , a bakery on north lincoln avenue that was reinventing sweets , pushing back against dry layer cakes loaded with too much kirshwasser and buttercream . i had baked my own first cake at age 37 in an effort to build a surprise birthday cake delivery service . ",
        "figuring out how to bake was a challenge , but trying to decorate cakes was impossible . i read in the chicago tribune that work of art was offering cake decorating classes ; i signed first vision of hoa was exotic : i remember her dressed in a long grey dress that had free flowing panels , front and back . her hair was long and black and tied in the old-fashioned gibson girl style , soft and poofy with a bun on the wall behind the counter hung framed photographs of elaborate , breathtakingly gorgeous wedding cakes , alongside proclamations of awards she had the class , i was a miserable failure . ",
        "i learned a few border designs , but never mastered the called hoa whenever i needed real butter cookies , sweet rolls , fruit galettes and croissants for came a devastating fire that destroyed work of art . her spirit prevailed , though , and she reopened on west diversey , not far from the storefront i turned into a kitchen . we helped each other whenever the call came -- whether it was about ingredients , equipment , deliveries , advice or simply moved again , to halsted near division , because she needed a huge production kitchen when she took on all the croissants for starbucks midwest . ",
        "that was right after margaret sheridan called from the tribune to say , `` get ready . you were named the best croissant in chicago ! `` when she got the starbucks contract , hoa did n't have a sheeter -- the machine that literally sheets the dough so it can be cut , which she did by hand . so she went to an equipment vendor , explained what she needed and why , and he gave her the sheeter that day and let her pay it off over could identify with that . i , too , had worked with kind and understanding vendors who had `` seen it all , '' in the words of one produce man , and knew we could be trusted to pay . ",
        "hoa and i shared stories of those fourth - and fifth-generation vendors who saved our businesses and , in essence , our day , hoa delivered 3,000 croissants a day , shipped on pallets to a central distribution center . and if the driver did n't show up , a family member drove the starbucks wanted doughnuts , so she made also was supplying food and baked goods to a small specialty store in the west loop , called cyd and depano 's . several people from oprah winfrey 's harpo productions ate there and recommended hoa to make the food for the studio 's 400 the new work , hoa was able to stop the starbucks madness after five years . ",
        "from 2006 until harpo productions left chicago , she supplied the company 's 's voice softens when she speaks of that time , because her father had arrived in chicago by then , got very sick and died , leaving her with enormous hospital bills . she dabs her eyes and says , `` i wish i could thank miss winfrey for the harpo contract , because that 's what paid those bills . `` hoa tuy dong , her sisters and daughters had come to the united states after leaving vietnam in 1975 on one of the last ships out after the war . ",
        "they went first to a refugee camp in guam and then to new york of her memories is striking : she grew up in saigon and knew that her parents , who were both good students , went to france as part of their education . she does n't know the details of their time there , and like so many of us who never asked the elders for their stories , merely accepted that part of their family meals was kugel and challah . `` i never had a recipe for challah , '' she said , `` i just remember how it felt and tasted . '' ",
        "now she thinks that her mother might have lived with , or worked for , a jewish mother was a wonderful cook , and hoa loved to bake . when hoa arrived in new york , she taught herself to make and decorate cakes . the wilton company offered her a job designing cakes for the wilton celebration books and moved her to their headquarters in she felt ready , hoa opened work of last stop was opening the kingsbury street cafe in 2011 , while maintaining work of art bakery as part of it , across from the lincoln park whole foods . ",
        "it was a beautiful space with delicious food and baked goods . i went regularly after my own restaurant , ina 's , went to see hoa on the last day , friday , may 25 , understanding what goes into a decision to close , and was able to sit and listen to her talk . her words were the same ones i 'd spoken when i made that same said , `` the business is harder . the staff does n't care enough , and i worked so hard to earn a good reputation . '' she also added , `` the body tells you when it 's time . ",
        "`` hoa was a relatively unknown chef who gave so much to chicago , via wilton , starbucks , harpo and her shops and restaurant , and i can only hope she received what she needed and deserved in years she has sent funds to care for children in vietnam and will now make her home in the mountains between saigon and da nang . she 'll spend her time watching over a garden and those my friend hoa : i love and respect you , and will think of you happy in those mountains . never forget how much change you were a part of and how many people you made pinkney , aka the breakfast queen , owned iconic west loop breakfast spot ina 's for more than 30 years and now writes `` breakfast with ina '' monthly for food & dining .
