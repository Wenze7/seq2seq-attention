        "in an effort to protect its business users from hacking , google is rolling out a new feature for g suite users that will let organizations know if any of their users have been targeted by a government-backed attack . by default , the warning feature is disabled , but administrators can turn on the feature to receive an email alert if google detects any state-sponsored hacking attempts have been made , google said in a blog post detailing the update . these hacking attempts can range from phishing , malware , or other enable the alerts , g suite administrators can navigate to the admin console , click on reports , select manage alerts , and go to the government-backed hack if an administrator receives an alert , it does n't mean that the user 's account has been compromised , google cautioned . ",
        "however , if an administrator feels that more action is necessary , google also provides some simple tools to take action . administrators can alert the user , share more details about the hacking attempts with the user , secure the user account , and manage alerts within the administrator the alert gives organizations more insight into potential cyberattacks on their users , the feature is n't new . google has been warning gmail users of government-backed hacks for years . `` since 2012 , we 've warned our users if we believe their google accounts are being targeted by government-backed attackers , '' google said . ",
        "`` we send these out of an abundance of caution -- the notice does not necessarily mean that the account has been compromised or that there is a widespread attack . rather , the notice reflects our assessment that a government-backed attacker has likely attempted to access the user 's account or computer through phishing or malware , for example . '' these alerts are usually sent when google detects phishing emails , attachments with malware , or brute-force 's g suite announcement comes after the company experienced criticism for gmail 's new confidentiality mode , with the department of homeland security expressing concern that protected email links may have the unintended consequence of leading to more phishing the rising number of cyberattacks , microsoft also recently launched similar protections for its users through a new accountguard pilot program . ",
        "unlike google 's efforts , microsoft 's accountguard is only available at this time for accounts from political organizations , according to a report from bleeping computer . `` this service is part of microsoft 's ` election defense technologies ' and is offered on a non-partisan basis by invitation only , '' the site reported .
