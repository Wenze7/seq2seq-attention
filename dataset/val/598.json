        "a year ago , edouardo jordan was a locally renowned seattle chef and owner of two restaurants : salare , a restaurant specializing in french and italian cuisine , and the three-month-old junebaby , a more deeply personal project featuring food anchored in the black southern experience . the florida native knew his new restaurant was special , but even he could n't have predicted what would unfold next , including appearances on several national best new restaurants lists , two james beard awards , and a three-star review from times critic pete wells , the first such review for a black chef in 20 years . ",
        "grub caught up with the jordan -- who is in new york -- to discuss his newfound fame , the continued lack of diversity in food media , and that life-changing times review that seemingly came out of nowhere . it 's been a very big year for you . junebaby was been named best new restaurant by esquire , food & wine , and eater . you won two james beard awards , including best new restaurant . it 's just wild . nothing 's changed . same ol' thing . just running . nothing has changed besides the speed of the run . ",
        "everything really culminated with the james beard awards , which took place just after junebaby 's one-year anniversary . how did you feel in that moment ? when my name was announced first for the regional , the first thing i thought was , ` holy shit , i just won ! ' then i was like , ` holy shit , we 're gon na probably win two ! ' i felt really good about junebaby , but my chances were fifty-fifty for the regional award because we 've got a lot of talented chefs here doing a lot of talented things . ",
        "at the same time , i was freakin ' bust my butt and i 'm glad i got recognized . since then , everyone seems to want a piece of you . they always wanted a piece . i just never gave them anything . but yeah , there 's some cooler , exciting things that have come around , like offers and events and things . it 's a blessing . also a curse because it keeps me extremely busy . you 're doing a pop-up dinner at olmsted . and you 're bringing your son along , right ? ",
        "yeah , he 's coming with me to new york . it 's summertime so it allows me to get him out . i want to be a good father to him . i want him to see the world that i did n't get to see . my food allows me to see things that i would have never seen before in my life , so i need to share that with my little offshoot . he 's my right-hand man . he 's my boss . this trip is more about him than it is about me . ",
        "i was excited to talk to you again because a few months ago grub asked `` where are the black restaurant critics ? '' and your success at the james beard awards played a big part . is the lack of representation in food media something you care about or are you just trying to focus on your mission ? i care about all of that . i care about doing my thing because i decided to open up my own business , and business comes first , beyond ethical and moral things that happen along the way . ideally , i need to protect and take care of myself and my investors and my investment . ",
        "but i do care about the fact that we do n't have many people of color that are actually out there and have opinions beyond a blog or their own personal website about the foods that have shaped america . it does resonate with me how broken our critic system is as well . we ca n't say the culinary world is great yet . we had one stellar year and that was just the james beard awards . that does n't mean next year 's going to be great . let 's look at some of the other magazines and other publications that do the top ten every year . ",
        "we might be surprised . we 're still at percent . james beard did do their part this year . great . hopefully , they can do it next year or follow suit in some way . hopefully , they 're purposely taking the time to get out there and explore and discover . who 's going to give a real opinion of some of the foods that black people grew up on or even just knew ? i do n't know . it 's a different opinion from a different perspective of what food is and what food should be . ",
        "you said last year that for a long time you avoided opening a restaurant like junebaby because you did n't want to get pigeonholed as a soul-food chef . how do you feel about the fact that junebaby still earned you more attention and recognition than the french and italian food at salare ? i mean , salare was in probably 70 percent of the publications that junebaby was in . i think just the importance of junebaby allowed it to have a bigger voice . salare can get mixed up with any other restaurant that was opened during that same period . ",
        "there are plenty of french restaurants , there are plenty of italian restaurants , there are plenty of european restaurants out there . but there were n't any southern restaurants opening at the same caliber , the same chef , and the same mind-set as junebaby . so , it 's hard to compare that to anything .
