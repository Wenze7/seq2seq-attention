        "before the electroshock-therapy finish of thursday 's 7-6 walk-off triumph over the diamondbacks , there was little for the cubs to like about the day 's began with kris bryant going on the disabled list again and tyler chatwood staging another walkathon , adding six more walks to his major-league-leading total in only 4 2/3 by the end of the afternoon david bote 's game-tying home run in the ninth made bryant 's absence a little less worrisome , while chatwood 's control problems were put on the back burner with the deal that brought veteran left-hander cole hamels to the cubs for two the rangers ' hamels is n't the same pitcher who no-hit the cubs nearly three years ago to the day at wrigley field , he could become rejuvenated if inserted into a pennant at least that 's the reality , it 's going to take a major turnaround for hamels , 34 , to get back to being the dominant pitcher he was in his prime with the phillies .",
        "hamels already had served up 23 home runs as of thursday , tied for the second-worst total in the majors , with a era . and over his last four starts he 's 1-3 with an era , so he 's not exactly trending hamels also has a era on the road , compared with era at home , so perhaps the cubs can count on a better performance now that he has escaped texas . of course , they also counted on chatwood pitching better after leaving coors field , and that has n't worked out so hamels can find his mojo by returning to the national league , he at least would be an upgrade over chatwood , who does n't look as if he 's ready for prime time even as the cubs keep giving him chance after chance to figure things , they keep on winning , seemingly immune from his walk-heavy outings . ",
        "one thing we know about these cubs is we do n't know anything . who would have thought they would have the best record in the nl at the end of july with almost no help at all from yu darvish or chatwood ? `` i think the best is yet to come for our starting rotation , '' said anthony rizzo , whose walk-off homer ended the game . `` even jonny , i think , i do n't know how , can start throwing better . ... when you get to the playoffs , it 's a bounce here , a bounce there . ",
        "anything can happen . `` but i like our guys . i like our chances every single time our starting pitcher takes the mound . `` manager joe maddon played with the media by lauding hamels during his postgame briefing , after being informed that president theo epstein was seen smiling while walking into the clubhouse . `` did he just have a good italian beef sandwich ? '' maddon said before making an r-rated was a fitting analogy . hamels is more like a good italian beef sandwich at this point of his career after being prime-grade steak throughout most of as the soundtrack from `` a night at the roxbury '' blared from the nearby clubhouse , rizzo sat at the podium in the interview room and said with a straight face the players were n't paying much attention to the hamels rumor . ",
        "`` you see it , you hear about it , but supposedly we were getting manny machado april 2 , '' he said . `` i do n't think that worked out for us . that 's the nonsense that happens , so until it 's a done deal ... `` everyone knows it 's too much . ` oh , we 're getting cole hamels now ' because someone said we 're talking to the rangers . it happens , it happens , and that 's just the way it is . `` a couple of hours later it happened . ",
        "now we will see how much hamels has left in the has the feel of the cubs ' 2015 deadline deal for dan haren , who was acquired from the marlins for a couple of minor prospects who never panned was 34 and on his last legs but was good enough to insert at the back end of the rotation . he wound up making 11 starts for the cubs , going 4-2 with a era . he was n't used in the postseason and retired after the would seem to be a good fit in the clubhouse and , of course , he has postseason experience . ",
        "he 's probably the best available option left in a trade market that lacks quality . and the cubs did n't have to give up a valuable piece , making it a decent now will have to make a tough decision . do they send chatwood to the bullpen , a demotion he has earned ? demote mike montgomery to his old relief spot -- which he does n't deserve -- to beef up the pen ? go with a six-man rotation and put lester off his routine ? hamels could be a godsend to a rotation that has n't lived up to expectations . ",
        "or he could be a bad gamble if he remains inconsistent down the stretch . epstein has earned the benefit of the doubt after building a championship team in five years , and maybe this move is the perfect audible to get the cubs back to the world way , the season just got more interesting .
