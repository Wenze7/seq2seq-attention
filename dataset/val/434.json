        "after getting a crash course in handling jake arrieta and company in helping lead the cubs to the 2016 world series title , catcher willson contreras is eager to learn from newcomer cole hamels . `` for me , the most exciting thing is the experience he has in the big leagues , '' contreras said after the cubs traded for hamels , a four-time all-star . `` that 's going to help me and the starters a lot . i think a lot of guys can pick his brain . `` contreras will listen closely to hamels ' preferences in order to accelerate the learning process , and he does n't see four left-handers in the rotation as a problem . ",
        "`` the most important thing is the communication and to find out what he wants to do and how much he pitches to the scouting report , '' contreras said . `` i think the communication will make the difference . i have to learn a lot of things about him , and i have a lot of questions . `` hamels , 34 , sounded just as eager to work with contreras . `` that will be exciting in itself , '' hamels said saturday . `` we 'll try to get our lingo down , our mannerisms and the anticipation of what we want to do . ",
        "`` hamels added that he often watched video of jon lester when scouting a team he was about to face . '' cliff lee showed me the way , '' hamels said . `` i 'm sure lester and i can play off each other . '' "
