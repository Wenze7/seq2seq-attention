        "with tuesday 's 3 trade deadline growing near , here are a few important factors involving the cubs ' efforts to upgrade : any trade partners besides the rangers ? if the cubs are looking for more relief help , the marlins and rays are obvious targets . a debate among the marlins may be when the value of relievers kyle barraclough and adam conley , both arbitration-eligible next season , is teams could decide to become sellers instead of buyers , which could flood the market . but the marlins could try to get more teams involved if they wait until the cubs do n't appear to have the right mix of high-ceiling prospects who are nearly ready for the majors to satisfy any deal involving starter chris archer of the rays . ",
        "but brad ziegler of the marlins or sergio romo of the rays , each a submarine-style reliever , could be an effective short-term , affordable cubs examined the padres ' roster even after left-hander brad hand was dealt to the indians , and a source confirmed several teams are interested in relievers kirby yates and craig stammen , as well as outfielders hunter renfroe and travis 's the timetable for in-house reinforcements ? president theo epstein and general manager jed hoyer are mindful of the injuries that struck the red sox around or after the 2006 trade deadline , so they do n't want to waste an expectation is that reliever anthony bass could return first from the 10-day disabled list in a week . ",
        "the pain in closer brandon morrow 's right biceps virtually has vanished , but he likely will need at least two weeks to show he 's sharp and baseman kris bryant likely will follow a timetable similar to morrow 's to ensure there 's no recurrence of left shoulder 's no rush to bring back left-hander drew smyly or reliever justin hancock from their arm injuries before sept. . about the schedule ? the cubs ' three scheduled off days aug. . 9 , 13 and 20 are just as crucial as their stretch of 23 daily games starting aug. . ",
        "21 . the days off apply to players such as anthony rizzo and ben zobrist as much as a rotation that must maximize the extra days of rest before the grueling an original off day aug. . 30 to a makeup game with the braves prevents the cubs from setting up their rotation for 14 consecutive games against the braves , phillies , brewers and nationals . but with so many left-handers in the rotation , this might not sept. . 9 , the cubs leave chicago for only three games , sept. . 17-19 at arizona . but their final seven games at home are against the resurgent pirates and the wacky factors : would the cubs be tempted finally to trade one of their young position players for a starting pitcher under team control ? ",
        "the pursuit of young , controllable starting pitching via trade has been a goal since utility player emilio bonifacio and left-hander james russell were dealt to the braves four seasons ago for catcher victor caratini -- their last trade of the rebuilding emergence of versatile infielder david bote adds depth to the cubs , although they might need to keep their young position players until they receive confirmation bryant should be healthy for most of the remainder of the regular season . zobrist is playing younger than his 37 years , so keeping him fresh is a would n't hurt the cubs to add a speedster before sept. . ",
        "1 , when all players eligible for the postseason must be in the organization . for example , epstein and hoyer added dave roberts to the red sox to help them win the first of the team 's three world series rings this century . the as dave roberts helped epstein and hoyer receive their first of three world series rings in 2004 with the red chris gimenez or another catcher to the 40-man roster before sept. . 1 would be a wise decision , as the acquisition of alex avila last summer really became significant after willson contreras missed a month because of a strained hamstring nine days after the 2017 trade deadline .
