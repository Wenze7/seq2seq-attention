        "had it not been for three errors , cole hamels might have been allowed to provide quantity as well as quality wednesday night in his cubs with reinforcements such as brandon kintzler to fortify a fatigued bullpen , the cubs gladly accepted a nine-strikeout performance from hamels in only five a fastball in the mid-90 mph range and an effective changeup , hamels provided the cubs with much-needed optimism as they coasted to a 9-2 victory over the pirates . `` a great first start , '' cubs manager joe maddon added hamels ' changeup and curveball looked as sharp as they did when he beat maddon 's rays in the 2008 world series and when he pitched a no-hitter at wrigley field in will pitch on bigger stages than the pnc park mound , but the sharpness on many of his pitches validated the observations president theo epstein and his staff made before deciding to surrender two pitchers and a player to be named or cash to the rangers for hamels on friday . ",
        "`` all year my changeup has been horrendous , '' said hamels , who was 5-9 with a era in 20 starts with the rangers . `` i think that was the focus i had these last couple of weeks , to get back to what i know was comfortable . the reason i made the league when i was so young , was my changeup . `` hamels ' changeup more than compensated for a 95 mph fastball that occasionally lacked command , but the cubs envision more polished starts after hamels cooled off a pirates team that lost for only the fifth time in its last 21 games . ",
        "`` we got some thoughts from watching him , '' maddon said . `` he 's really easy to speak to . i 'm looking forward to this . i think you 're going to see he 's very capable of getting on a nice roll with high end stuff . `` hamels allowed three hits , his second lowest total this season , and his nine strikeouts were his most since he struck out 11 in five innings against the athletics on april 3 in his second addison russell 's throwing error on pirates leadoff man jordan luplow in the the first led to francisco cervelli 's two-out rbi single during a 27-pitch inning . ",
        "but hamels pitched at a brisk tempo the rest of the way . `` this team is awesome , '' said hamels , who was the beneficiary of a four-run first . `` they have some great guys , the young personalities , and the veterans keeping a good team morale , and the energy is up . `` that 's something you fully enjoy . when games matter , everybody is focused and having a good time . you lose , they know how to bounce back and keep it positive , and when they win , it 's much sweeter . ",
        "`` kintzler , acquired from the nationals an hour before tuesday 's non-waiver trade deadline , hired a personal driver to take him 41/2 hours to pnc park , and maddon did n't hesitate to use him for 11/3 innings . `` for any contending team to ever want you is a privilege , '' kintzler said . `` i do n't take that lightly , either . a couple of years ago i could barely get a minor-league job , and now i 've been on two contending teams . `` as i get older , the window gets shorter to get in the world series , so i 'm here to do whatever i can and play my part . ",
        "`` the large lead enabled maddon to employ demoted tyler chatwood in relief , and chatwood gave up a single and a walk in pitching a scoreless ninth . "
