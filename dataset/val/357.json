        "the most common sexual fantasy among american adults involves bringing a third person into the mix , according to the largest-ever survey of the his new book , `` tell me what you want : the science of sexual desire and how it can help you improve your sex life '' , social psychologist and kinsey institute research fellow justin lehmiller spells out the findings of a massive survey involving 350 questions posed to 4,175 americans ranging in age from 18 to participants , he writes , had occupations spanning everything from cashiers at mcdonald 's to homemakers to physicians to lawyers .",
        "they included all sexual and gender identities , political and religious affiliations , and relationship types , from single to married to each of the participants did have in common was a willingness to talk about sex . `` because this survey called for uninhibited discussion of sexual fantasies , '' lehmiller writes , `` the people who chose to take part tended to have positive views about sex in general and were willing to openly report on their sex lives . `` so . the results . ninety-seven percent of surveyed americans reported having sexual fantasies , which lehmiller defines as `` any mental picture that comes to mind while you 're awake that ultimately turns you on . '' ",
        "more than a third of respondents described group sex as their favorite fantasy . in fact , just 5 percent of men and 13 percent of women said group sex never crossed their were the most common group sex fantasy , lehmiller found , with the gender ratio of partners varying quite a bit . straight women frequently described threesome fantasies with another woman or two , while straight men tended to prefer two women to their one man . `` the appeal of threesomes has more to do with the fact that this activity creates a state of sensory overload than anything , '' lehmiller writes . ",
        "`` it 's really about amping up our arousal by bringing in another body that we can look at , touch and experience in an overpowering way that allows us to get lost in sensations . `` bdsm -- bondage , discipline , dominance , submission , sadism and masochism -- is the second most popular fantasy , lehmiller found , with more than a quarter of participants conjuring scenarios that involve physical restraints , giving and receiving pain , and role playing with power . the third most popular fantasy -- the go-to image for one in five americans -- involves novelty , adventure and variety : sex in a public place , new positions , bringing food into the mix . ",
        "`` perhaps not surprisingly , whipped cream , chocolate , ice cubes and strawberries were the foods of choice for most , '' lehmiller writes . `` the rest had some rather interesting tastes , including blue cheese dressing , corn on the cob , dog food and gum from the ` willy wonka ' movie . `` now seems an appropriate time to mention that lehmiller wants readers to receive his book with an open mind about their own and other people 's fantasies . `` we are taught only what people are supposed to want , not what people actually want when it comes to sex , '' he writes . ",
        "`` the end result is that when most americans start having sex , their knowledge about it , and about which sexual feelings and practices are ` normal , ' tends to be very low . `` that 's due in part , he writes , to our lack of comprehensive sexual education in many schools . `` our reluctance to teach students any sexual communication skills other than ` just say no ' has led to an odd state of affairs in which americans find it more challenging to talk about sex -- even with their own spouse or partner -- than to actually have it , '' he studying and revealing what americans really have on their minds about sex , he hopes to chip away at some of the taboos surrounding people 's desires . ",
        "`` my bigger hope is that you will walk away with a greater understanding of the nature of sexual desire and , potentially , use that information to enhance your own sexual and romantic life . `` he encourages readers to share their fantasies with their partners . `` self-disclosure builds trust , '' he writes . `` when someone reveals a major secret to us , it shows that they 're putting a lot of faith in us -- and we tend to reciprocate by trusting them right back . `` he even spells out ways to break the ice : watch a steamy movie and discuss it afterward , visit a sex toy shop together , turn date night into an erotic q&a . ",
        "`` ultimately , '' lehmiller writes , `` all of us stand to benefit from having a better understanding of each other 's desires . `` my goal is to help break down the barriers to discussing sexual fantasies that exist in your own life , so that you might allow those fantasies -- the ones that are safe , legal and consensual -- to become part of your sexual reality . `` happy reading .
