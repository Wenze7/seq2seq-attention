        "uber and lyft have long advertised their ride-hailing services as deterrents from traffic congestion in dense cities . ",
        "but a new study found the services -- even their shared rides -- leading to at least a 160 percent increase of cars driving on urban study from new york city-based firm schaller consulting examined published reports , news articles , a national travel survey and trip data from the past 18 months to deliver a report on the impact of transportation network companies -- better known as ride-hail or ride share , such as uber and study published wednesday concluded that without wide-reaching public policy regulations , `` big american cities are likely to be overwhelmed with more automobility , more traffic and less transit . ''",
        "and once ride share enters the self-driving arena , the study forecasts , these cities will grow even more overwhelmed in the future . `` tech companies , automakers and others are currently racing toward an autonomous future that envisions shared , door-to-door ride services weaning people from personal autos and combining the convenience of tncs with the space efficiency of shared trips , '' reads the report . `` today 's tnc experience , however , calls into question theviability of the door-to-door shared service model . `` uber and lyft , in statements to this news organization , pushed back on the study , saying it was `` fundamentally flawed . '' ",
        "lyft spokesperson campbell matthews called bruce schaller , the study 's author , a `` known taxicab consultant , '' who works in an industry most adversely affected by the advent of ride-hailing companies . schaller previously worked for new york city 's department of transportation and the city 's taxi and limousine pointed to various studies contradicting schaller 's findings . one was from the public-interest organization shared-use mobility center , which earlier this year found `` no clear relationship between the level of rush-hour tnc use and longer-term changes in public transit usage . '' `` these studies also show that lyft users are more likely to use public transportation , not less , '' matthews spokesperson matthew wing said the company `` wholeheartedly agree with several of mr. schaller 's proposed public policies , '' but said the study ignored important facets , such as the mobility benefits ride shares provide to low income groups in traditionally underserved neighborhoodsfor years , uber , lyft and other companies argued their services -- particularly shared rides -- can drastically help reduce traffic in urban cities . ",
        "in a 2017 online essay titled `` the end of traffic '' , lyft co-founders john zimmer and logan green argue that if all new york city single-occupancy taxi rides were replaced with lyft line shared rides , it would cut 75 percent of vehicles off the the number of cars in urban centers , the study went on to say , is the only way to reduce traffic congestion . the study proposed limiting parking supply and limiting or banning low-occupancy vehicles from certain streets ; mandating tncs meet certain occupancy levels or time with passengers during trips to increase efficiency ; and provide frequent bus service and rail service wherever available . ",
        "`` the overall vision is thus for less traffic and greater ease of movement for everyone regardless of mode for a given trip , '' reads the shared rides in nine of the densest metropolitan areas in the united states , tncs added new miles of traffic for every 1 mile it took off from personal cars -- a 160 percent increase . private rides were slightly worse for traffic , as tncs added new miles of study argues lofty goals set by tncs to increase share rides wo n't reduce traffic . for example , lyft will add new miles of traffic , even if it met its goal of share rides composing at least 50 percent of all lyft rides by traffic miles are added as most users switch from non-auto modes of transportation , such as public transportation , walking and bicycling , to use tncs and drivers often face long distances to reach their pick-up location , according to the study . ",
        "and even at times , shared rides involve just one passenger , inflating the continue to grow in popularity in the united states . tncs transported billion passengers in 2017 , a 37 percent increase from billion a year prior , according to the study . and 70 percent of uber and lyft trips occurred in nine metropolitan areas , including san the growth of tnc riderships , the demographics of riders remain limited , according to the study . people living in or nearby city centers , aged between 25 and 34 , college-educated and making more than $ 50,000 used tncs at least twice as much as their less wealthy , suburban and older counterparts .
