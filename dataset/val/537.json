        "as reported previously , you can now see the health inspection scores of restaurants on national rollout of the local inspector value entry specification program uses independent company hdscores to glean data from records violations , doling out demerits to restaurants depending on the results of the chicago does not give out scores or letter grades , hdscores assigns a number between 1 and 100 to 10,000 restaurants in chicago that will have this score displayed on their yelp than 600 bots pull data from public records and health inspection reports , and assign scores based on the number of violations and the history of the restaurant , said andy phillips , chief technology officer of hdscores .",
        "each week , the bots comb through new data to adjust the scores which are weighted historically . restaurants with systematically poor records will have a score that reflects that . if a restaurant makes appropriate adjustments , the score will reflect that as example , a restaurant could receive 2 demerits for a critical violation and 1 demerit for a noncritical violation , but if multiple inspections have resulted in the same critical violation , additional demerits will be given . if a violation is corrected on-site , half a demerit point will be scoring is based on each jurisdiction and how it applies the food code , phillips said . ",
        "for example , a score of 81 in a city with a more lenient code could be a score of 50 in a city with a stricter one . typically , it takes about two weeks for the score to update after the inspection has been made public . `` we take our data integrity seriously , '' phillips said . `` we ca n't say we 're perfect , but we have very low instances of where we 've made a mistake . if there 's a concern , we ask people to reach out directly , although we wo n't take complaints against restaurants . ",
        "if there is anything feels is incorrect , we take it seriously . `` in instances when there have been mistakes , whether it 's incorrect data or even a typo , philips said hdscores has worked with the jurisdiction and the restaurant to rectify updates are in the works , so consumers can better understand what the score means . currently , the format conforms with yelp 's lives program , but phillips said changes may be coming because not all jurisdictions report violations the same company was founded by six people who were concerned with foodborne illnesses and allergies , and some of the founders had children who suffered from sensitivities . ",
        "`` we had a common concern when you go out to eat in the evening , you 're always worried about food contamination , '' said glynne townsend , chief marketing officer of hdscores . `` we wanted to try to come up with a way to understand how clean the restaurants were and how well they 're operated . `` yelp executives met hdscores founders at a data event four years ago , and trials began shortly afterward in san diego county , then the state of florida a year later before beginning a national rollout in 2016 . ",
        ". the data collected are also provided to insurance companies and other food-reviewing companies , townsend said . he said he hopes to continue building the database and is looking forward to hearing feedback on the numbers they 're assigning . but most of the time , he 'll be sending people with questions or complaints about the reason behind the scores to their local health departments . `` this is n't data we 're creating , '' townsend said . `` it 's data that has been generated by own health department professionals in the town and the cities . ",
        "`` incidentally , chicago already provides detailed food code rules and information about business inspections online , so consumers can check a restaurant ahead of time to see if a violation was something minor like a leaky hose or more egregious like a rat they can operate , restaurants in chicago have to complete a number of licensing requirements , and once the business is up and running , random visits from the department of public health ensure that it 's still operating up to code . while the scores on yelp only split things into `` critical '' and `` non-critical '' violations , chicago divides its violations into three categories : critical , serious and minor . ",
        "these assess whether a restaurant can stay open or if it poses a serious public health violations include inadequate storage temperatures , inappropriate food handling practices , improper personal hygiene , rodent and/or insect infestation or lack of hot running water . if a business fails to correct the issue immediately , it fails the inspection , receives a citation and has its business license suspended . it can only reopen after the department of public health does another violations include potentially hazardous food improperly thawed , re-serving food previously served to another customer and food not properly protected from contamination during storage , preparation , display , service and transportation . ",
        "if not immediately corrected , the business fails the inspection but does not have its business license suspended . there will simply be an automatic re-inspection scheduled by the department of public health . however , the inspection could be upgraded to critical if the original violations are not violations include poorly constructed , unclean or dilapidated walls , ceilings or floors , improper storage of soiled and clean linens , coats and aprons , and unauthorized personnel in the food-prep area . these violations can be upgraded to a serious violation if not corrected before the next townsend 's claims that the data are neutral , mike simmons , chef and owner at cafe marie-jeanne , sees a potentially negative impact on restaurants . ",
        "`` as a restaurant , you 're already required to post your health inspection reports in your restaurant in a place that is visible to all your guests , '' simmons said . `` it just makes me wonder , is this yelp has found another way to profit from terrorizing restaurants ? `` the city of chicago already has strict guidelines and restaurants are either compliant or not , simmons said . if the restaurant is not compliant , it will not be allowed to stay open . a restaurant that is open signifies that the people who run it have spent the time , money and training required to be compliant , he said . ",
        "`` i 'm not sure what yelp is adding to the conversation , '' simmons said . `` they 've found yet another way to extract the very soul and assign a number metric . one more way for people to give us comments on how bad we 're failing the public . it stings to me . `` yelp has never been there to help restaurants , '' he said . `` yelp is there to help yelp . `` simmons said he is n't sure what the effect of publishing the health scores will be on businesses , but he 's concerned that a simple number could turn people away from a restaurant they 've been going to for years . ",
        "he also pointed out that restaurants do n't sign up for a yelp page and that they 're even created without their knowledge and consent sometimes . as of press time , cafe marie-jeanne did not have a health buckner , a manager at crisp that does have a health score , said he thought the new information was `` weird '' and that he is n't sure if it 's helpful to remembered a time when the health department gave the restaurant a $ 300 fine for having a 1-inch gap in the front door despite everything else on the food side of the restaurant being `` perfect . '' ",
        "`` obviously it 's a good thing when you want to know how clean a place is that you 're eating , but sometimes the health department screws some people over , '' buckner said . `` i have mixed feelings about it . it 's good and bad . `` in response to people who defend the scores on the basis of food allergies , simmons said they should n't try to push responsibility onto restaurants when diners themselves should be paying attention . `` when i hear people saying that , they 're trying to defer the responsibility , '' he said . ",
        "`` we 're here to serve food to people , and we 're going to take food and provide you with a good time , and we 'll bend over backwards to make sure your kids are n't eating food they 're allergic to , but it 's not our responsibility . it 's your responsibility . `` there will be a financial impact from his , simmons said , which will not only force restaurants to make less money , but also make it harder to pay employees what they should be paid . `` i hate it , '' simmons said of the numerical rating . ",
        "`` the more i think about it , the more i hate it . i 'm by no means an expert on this new yelp situation . all i can say is that we will continue to work the way we 've always worked , and we 'll maintain our own standard , which i find much higher than the city of chicago . the city of chicago should be the baseline , and it 's already pretty readable in every restaurant you walk into .
