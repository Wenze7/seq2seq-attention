        "photo by joe robbins/getty imagestennessee football is loaded at wide receiver for 2018 . here is a preview of the volunteers for the season at that was a time when was considered wide receiver u . that title , however , has faded in recent years due to a combination of the clemson tigers emerging and the vols misusing their five years of butch jones , the vols began a process of limiting their elite playmakers in the passing game as much as possible . jones had an obsession with running a five to six-man rotation , even if one receiver was the dominant year , with tennessee football transitioning back to a pro-style offense under tyson helton and jeremy pruitt , vols fans are hoping to see a few receivers with their talents maximized . ",
        "that was the tradition that built guys like robert meachem , donte stallworth , cedric wilson , peerless price , marcus nash and joey back to the johnny majors days , it created guys like corey fleming , alvin harper , carl pickens , and willie gault . simply put , the vols always maximized their top guys . and with helton , it looks like they should get back to unique thing about helton 's system , if you look at what he did with the western kentucky hilltoppers , is that he likes to move around his go-to receivers . ",
        "it 's something that allows for slot guys to thrive . but wideouts can do so as well . it all depends on the this post , we 're going to take a look at that personnel as we preview this position . we 'll give our projected starters at wideout , our projected slot receivers and our projected backups . as always with our previews , we 'll then give our final take on the position heading into this year . so with the offense in question , here is our analysis on the state of tennessee football at the wide receiver spot .
