        "`` the spy who dumped me '' gets by , barely , thanks mainly to kate mckinnon . her crazily fluid and unpredictable comic timing , and her willingness to go big -- well past madeline kahn-big and very near eddie cantor-big -- has saved several movies . she salvaged the `` ghostbusters '' reboot , rescued parts of `` rough night , '' and wrung what she could out of the damp rag `` office christmas party . '' working with a game mila kunis , mckinnon takes care of this one , too , whether with some screwy verbal aside or pulling a pop-eyed , slaw-jacked , weirdly delighted reaction to whatever the plot is up the plot 's up to people getting impaled , or kicked in the face , or tortured by sinister enemy gymnasts . ",
        "co-writer/director susanna fogel 's action comedy about best friends caught up in international espionage is stupidly , relentlessly violent . this makes it hard for the audience to relax and enjoy . yet mckinnon 's apparent improvisations and inventions , create a second , better movie in the : why have action comedies turned into a series of grisly `` kills '' barely making room for the `` comedy '' part ? the influences go back a generation or two , when the first `` beverly hills cop '' or `` 48 hrs . '' came out . audiences went crazy for the eddie murphy banter within those action thriller confines . ",
        "also those films were really sharp ; the mixtures worked , though it took `` beverly hills cop '' exactly one sequel to screw it recently , and more pertinent to the blueprints used for `` the spy who dumped me , '' the melissa mccarthy vehicle `` spy '' clicked despite an overreliance on mayhem . in the mccarthy movie , we got a hugely funny accidental-shooting sight gag in the first minute , the setup bouncing off the tropes and conventions of bond/bourne / `` mission : impossible . '' it takes `` the spy who dumped me '' far longer to get going , toggling as it does between intrusive flashbacks and present-day 's script , co-written by david iserson , starts with audrey , an la clerk at a trader joe 's - type store , smarting over a breakup text she 's received from razor-sideburns boyfriend drew . ",
        "allegedly the host of an npr podcast combining `` jazz and economics , '' in reality he 's a cia agent in possession of a flash drive full of valuable and dangerous information . others want it , and when drew shows up at audrey 's apartment , with assassins on his tail , `` the spy who dumped me '' ropes audrey and her best pal , morgan , the aspiring actress played by mckinnon , into the chase to vienna , paris , prague and could do worse than that premise , and mckinnon and kunis bring a can-do spirit to the material . ",
        "sam heughan 's charming british agent presents a love interest for audrey , and a handy bookend for theroux 's character . ace character man fred melamed pops in as a smooth , cultured friend of audrey 's father , enticed by morgan , though he 's barking up the wrong tree . but promising bits , such as mckinnon infiltrating a cirque du soleil-style show and trying to fake her way through it , go nowhere . and somewhere around the 40th act of brutality , played straight , i just wanted mckinnon to chase a better movie .

        "see this one for what 's going on in the margins . "
