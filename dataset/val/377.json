        "in an effort to end the contract impasse with first-round draft pick roquan smith , the bears conceded they wo n't go after his guaranteed money if the linebacker gets suspended under the nfl 's new rule legislating helmet contact , the tribune has bears made this concession even before the recent public disclosure of the major sticking point , according to a source with knowledge of the situation . they are one of eight nfl teams willing to include contract language protecting a first-rounder 's guaranteed money if he 's suspended for an illegal hit , a source smith remains away from training camp because his representatives at caa football have insisted the bears go even further and include contract language protecting the player from discipline for behavior outside the realm of a football play .
