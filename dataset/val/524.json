        "each week nina metz and darcel rockett recap and discuss the second season of `` claws , '' which airs sundays on : spoilers aheadin `` crossroards , '' desna sits in a jail cell realizing she `` stayed on the ride too long , '' while jen and bryce have their own unwelcome complication to deal with in the form of hank , the deranged rabbi . and then there 's ann and polly , who both make the wise decision to kick their significant others to the the rabbi goes roguenina metz : `` claws '' has now devised two ways to help bryce find his way back to his marriage : first a near-death gunshot wound and now a deranged hank attempting to kidnap jen and the kids to israel . ",
        "look , i 'm a believer in these two -- that was n't always the case , but something about this goofy jen-bryce dynamic works and they 're the most stable couple on the show at the moment , which is kind of hilarious . bryce 's morphine-induced ted talk hallucination was yet again another sharp pop cultural parody ; i ca n't think of another series at the moment that keeps returning to this type of in-narrative spoofery on such a consistent basis . it 's such an inspired idea to come out of season rockett : rabbi hank finally snaps and goes full stalker this week , making himself at home in jen 's house cooking and putting pictures of his face pasted over bryce 's around the house -- creepy , much ? ",
        "when bryce wakes up to see hank over him with a needle , all i could think was : he 's going to kill bryce after all he 's been through ? but then he does n't . no smothering and no air bubble in his . granted , if bryce had died , he would never have been able to rescue jen . and their babies do need their parents , especially now that they 're both sober and have plans to be normal . let 's hope the rabbi and mandy get together after their stint in jail -- he 's in need of a love interest and mandy needs someone to love her . ",
        "it 's like but i digress , what do you think , nina ? nm : i 'm intrigued with all the ways `` claws '' is playing around with traditional soap opera tropes . the idea of salting every installment with melodrama for the sake of melodrama can feel like a cheat in terms of storytelling . but what 's interesting here is that the writers on `` claws '' have found a way to embrace these tropes as a way to up the stakes while also subverting them through a winking , candy-colored , parody-loving filter . there 's something genius about zlata and des are die or ride dr : to quote the kool-aid man on this plot line : oh yeah ! ",
        "about dang time . zlata comes to the aid of desna after she 's charged with racketeering and money laundering . and then she reveals what desna already knew -- the betrayal that she and dr. g have been putting down on her . say what you will about the russians , zlata knows that the tides are turning and she has to hustle to make sure she stays on g 's mama knows this too and is the bug in her son 's ear on it . so now the race is on : desna has started the war she wanted and if all works out , the two evils will take each other out and leave des and the palmghetto girls still standing . ",
        "now , we just have to get rid of the ditzy mafia and get the feds off their scent . hmmm ? i wonder if roller would do a stint in prison for desna ? if she gets a record , all bets are off for her money-making : let 's talk about how desna went about explaining the fallout after her arrest because as we say in the news business , she buried the lead . she should have led with : `` ann , your girlfriend is still a cop and she 's the one who arrested me . ",
        "`` but desna 's slowly getting savvier . arriving at the hammer & pickle in that space-age olive-colored catsuit she was finally in the right state of mind . negotiating with zlata the terms of their collaboration , she was all poker face . we have to assume zlata is n't taking desna at her word though , right ? zlata may be severe , but she 's nobody 's show also brought back mandy . who among us honestly remembered this character ? anyone ? oh right , she was desna 's realtor back in season 1 who , we learn , now subsists on a diet of cocaine and la croix due to the `` constant pressure to make the commissions . ",
        "to be that girl with that hair and that body and those coral palazzo pants . '' desna 's no-nonsense reply : `` go to therapy . work out . eat chocolate '' -- anything but this . even in the clink , desna 's maternal instincts are still intact . her brief interlude with mandy was indeed random but it was also a pretty decent snapshot of a woman falling apart , florida smile still plastered on her else to consider : it 's only now , in jail , that desna becomes introspective about and finally questions her decisions . ",
        "desna might benefit from a little therapy herself , no ? 3 . dean makes like billy joel : he 's moving outnm : the emotional turmoil -- the instability -- that dean 's been feeling is real . he 's handled it pretty well , all things considered . but i give him credit for deciding to make a break ; that ca n't be easy , not when he 's lived with desna his entire life . it 's his bond with virginia that likely made the choice possible . i take back what i said earlier -- it 's dean and virginia who are the most stable couple on this show . ",
        "it 's not often that we see a romantic relationship between a person on the spectrum and a person who is neurotypical and i like that `` claws '' does n't overthink it or infantilize dean , even if this is probably his first serious was virginia 's rock when she had the abortion earlier this season and she 's returning the favor now that he ca n't rely on : dean has been on a roller coaster this season -- from baby daddy , to exotic dancer , to new home , to new fianc\u00e9e ... and then des gets arrested .",
        "for every other thing , he has risen to the occasion . but the separation of their family unit is his undoing and i ca n't blame him for that . providing a stable environment is key to his daily living and des provides anything but . it 's heartbreaking to see him take his hammer & pickle money to the police station to get her released only to be turned away very rudely by the officer on duty . come correct ladies and dean will polly 's family bubble popsdr : marnie 's mom returns and dr. ken confesses to polly about his wire-tapping ways . ",
        "the former forces marnie to make a choice that we all hope she makes in favor of polly . but on the flipside , marnie ca n't be polly 's end-all and be-all . she 's a teen girl . let her be young . do n't put her in the role of your missing sister , polly . but alas , that 's the road we 're going down now that dr. ken is revealed as the snitch to the feds . his role was more reprehensible than that of a terrorist and a pedophile . that 's low . ",
        "so now polly is ken-less and desna is dean-less and yep , quiet ann is arlene-less . there is a saying : i can do bad all by myself . and unfortunately the ladies will have to walk the walk on this one . but when the chips are down , your girls rally and i have a feeling when these women stop the tears , they will lay waste to the landscape full of betrayers and backstabbers and it will be glorious ! nm : something i think worth noting about `` claws '' is how deeply loyal the women are toward one another , even when they they 're at odds . ",
        "i found it notable that polly did n't tear into ken because he 's a wimp or because he could n't put enough brain cells together to let everyone know about arlene . i mean , yes , she 's exasperated about all of that . but the final straw is this : `` you do n't know the first thing about loyalty . '' she 's right . there 's a good bit of emphasis on loyalty on this show . even clay husser talks a big loyalty game . but ultimately it 's the esteemed nail artisans of palmetto county who understand what the concept really knows loyalty , but establishing appropriate parental boundaries , not so much . ",
        "crying on marnie 's shoulder is just bad judgment , even if polly does make her a plate of snicky-snacks once she pulls herself together more thing i want to mention about polly : the barely here breadcrumbs about her estranged twin sister we got a few episodes back are are a good example of the show 's minor flaws this season . what should have been a major narrative thread for this character -- and let 's note , yet another soap opera trope ; a long lost twin sister ! -- has been treated as an after-thought . ",
        "i 'm not saying we need every bit of info laid out all at once , but there 's not even a slow built here ; the show introduced this tidbit weeks ago and then all but abandoned arlene is `` sorry , not sorry `` nm : why do we think `` claws '' showed us this confrontation ? i 'm trying to figure that out , because we learn nothing new from it . a colder person than ann might have ghosted arlene the moment she found out the truth -- but maybe she had to see it on arlene 's face to finally realize her dream of building a cabin together in vermont was all for 's the problem with arlene as a character : she 's completely undeveloped . ",
        "we know nothing about her aside from her profession and her willingness to use ann as an unwitting informant . so the emotional stakes exist only for ann , which seems like a missed opportunity . also : what was with that look on desna 's face in the van -- that `` i 'm plotting something '' look -- when ann went in to confront her lady love ? by the way , non-lawyer here but this keeps bugging me : it 's one thing to bring desna in for questioning based on something the police heard on a wiretap . ",
        "my `` law & order '' legal degree tells me this is one way cops get judges to sign off on search warrants , and that 's probably what led to the fbi raid on the salon . but do n't prosecutors need actual evidence of said laundering and racketeering to even charge her ? dr : i could just scratch arlene 's eyes out . she does n't have any qualms throwing ann and her friends under the bus to save her job . and when ann confronts her and asks her if any of it was real , arlene 's response is : does it matter ? ",
        "does it matter ? ! ann was a true soldier when she walked out , because i would have at least slapped her until she saw stars . no remorse , none at all . even the hussers show they have feelings , despite all their sinning . she 's just become another hurdle for the women to jump over for freedom . so do n't look back ann , just leave her in the , i 'm ready for arlene to go bye-bye , but i 'm ready for hank to say so-long , too . will i get what i want ? ",
        "i thought i might -- and then the writers brought mandy back ... so now i 'm a little skeptical that the writers will kill off the outliers faster than later . "
