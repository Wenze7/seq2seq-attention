        "orlando campos was tired of carrying around his bulky mexican passport everywhere and thought getting a chicago municipal id , similar in size and appearance to a driver 's license , might be easier to tote , 39 , spent an hour in line on a recent morning waiting for the id , formally known as a citykey card . his time in the queue at city hall is but one snapshot of how sluggish the pace has been to issue the the program -- touted by mayor emanuel as an option for immigrants and others -- rolled out in may , more than 11,200 cards have been issued , which translates to less than 1 percent of the city 's million residents ; anyone from babies on up are eligible for the ids . ",
        "that also means that it 's likely the city wo n't reach its goal of handing out 100,000 free cards for at least a city clerk 's office is tasked with overseeing the program , and employees have made changes in an effort to streamline and speed up the process , said jose sanchez molina , a spokesman for the department . you can apply for the card either at city hall or one of the roving mobile sites , though the latter sees the longest lines . to curb those lines , the office now puts an estimate online of how many cards can be printed that day . ",
        "that way , when applicants arrive they can quickly calculate whether they have a shot that day or should try some other time , sanchez molina from 75 to 300 cards can be printed in a day depending on how many specialized printers are available , said kwadwo anane , the newly hired director of the program . the office has a total of six specialized city hall , appointments made online are now in 30-minute increments rather than 5-minute windows , the latter was too short and contributed to the wait times or , in some cases , prompted those who thought they were tardy to skip the appointment altogether , sanchez molina like adriana velazquez , 27 , of back of the yards have seen some hiccups . ",
        "she recently went with her mother -- also a citykey card holder -- to an area bank , but her mother was n't allowed to use the card as a form of identification because they did n't recognize molina said the clerk 's office is working with the city 's business affairs and consumer protection department to send out materials to familiarize businesses with the card and educate them about how it could be used as a form of the id has gotten velazquez back in a library -- the card serves as a library card , too . she said she had n't wandered into one for years , though she was welcomed back with a bill for overdue fees . ",
        "`` i had n't been back in awhile , '' said velazquez , a community organizer for the southwest organizing project , which was part of a citykey pilot program . `` so this was an opportunity to get back and pull out some books . `` she said the municipal cards have helped those who could be nervous to pull out an id card issued by their home country 's local consulate -- a giveaway that they 're an immigrant . although chicago is considered a sanctuary city , she 's heard of cases where people still routinely get asked about their immigration status . ",
        "`` it 's very scary , '' velazquez said . `` it becomes ` who can i trust ? ' no person can ask you for documents , but it still happens . `` anane said the office has also worked to issue cards to populations that might not have any form of identification such as homeless people and people who have recently finished serving time in prison .
