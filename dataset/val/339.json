        "on the southwest corner of logan square 's haas park playground , next to a state-of-the-art soccer field where kids in cleats run daytime scrimmages and families spread blankets for nighttime movies , a tiny , beautiful garden has taken bears the name of a girl who used to play there , back when there was no soccer field . back when a baseball diamond took up most of the play space and home plate sat in that same southwest corner , the one where purple coneflowers and blue lupine plants now grow . `` sofia khan garden , '' reads a little blue sign -- unassuming in stature , extraordinary in purpose . ",
        "`` it has sofia 's name on it , '' said sheri khan , sofia 's mom , `` but i want it to be for everyone . `` sofia died in 2010 when she was 9 years old . her family was on vacation near holland , wis. , when sofia drowned in lake michigan during a kayaking accident . `` i lived in a bubble where horrible things happened to other people and not me , '' khan told me . `` i lived that way for a very long time , until something happened to my family that really shook my worldview . ",
        "it shook everything . it shook my foundation . it shook my faith . it shook my everything . `` friends told her she 'd be ok ; her family would be ok . she was n't sure she believed them . but she made a choice , she said , to try . `` it 's an intentional choice , '' she said . `` every day . every day i choose to believe we 're going to be ok . my kids are going to be ok . my family 's going to be ok . `` she wants sofia 's garden to help others make that same choice . ",
        "`` holding onto that hope that you can heal is huge , '' she said . `` and the worst mistake we can make is to think we 're alone . the moment we start thinking that , it makes it even harder to make that choice to heal . `` haas park was sofia 's second home . she and her two older brothers , noah and zane , would walk outside , cross the alley and run through the dirt to the old playground . sofia attended the summer camp . she played on the softball team . ",
        "`` she was like a bubbling fountain , '' said joe henry , longtime haas park supervisor . `` just such a joy and pleasure to be around . she 'd be out there playing football with the boys , soccer , you name it . `` henry pushed to have the playground named after sofia , but bureaucratic red tape kept stalling that endeavor . `` we just wanted something that would fit the personality of our little friend , '' henry said . `` something to add to her memory and her legacy . `` bridget montgomery , a neighbor whose son used to play with sofia at the park , had the idea for a garden . ",
        "she launched a gofundme page to raise money for plants and a bench , maybe a few boulders , a raised a little more than $ 3,000 and , along with henry , attended haas park advisory council meetings for years to advocate for the june 30 , it finally came to be . the park hosted a small dedication ceremony . `` we want to make it a little sanctuary , '' montgomery , a chicago pubic schools counselor , said . `` i want people to be able to go there and be peaceful and reflective . `` she wants people to know who sofia was . ",
        "`` a whole crop of new folks have moved to logan square who do n't even know the khans , '' montgomery said . `` i want to keep adding to the garden and expanding the garden , so people know sofia and know the garden 's purpose . `` sofia 's body was never recovered from lake michigan . the coast guard searched for her . four separate dive teams searched for her . all to no avail . `` we do n't have a gravesite , '' khan said . `` when i see her name on something , that 's very important to me . ",
        "she has a plaque at st. helen , where she went to school . i get to see her name on a brick wall , and that 's important . i think that 's why something like this garden means so much to our family . `` noah is 21 now . zane is 18 . khan and her husband , omer , had another daughter in 2012 . emaan , which means faith , is now 6 . she attends day camp at haas . `` emaan knows the park is special , '' khan said . `` she knows there 's a special place for all of us here . ",
        "`` on sept. . 9 , khan is planning to host a remembrance ceremony at the garden . `` for anyone who 's lost anyone , '' she said . `` we 'll have river rocks that you can paint your loved one 's name on , and we 'll place them in the garden . it 's a community . it 's important for people to know they 're not the only ones going through something hard . `` a few years after sofia died , when khan learned to make room for sorrow , but also glimpses of joy , as part of her daily routine , she enrolled at depaul university to earn a master 's degree in education with a focus on mental health . ",
        "she wants to better understand her own grief and help others through graduated on the eighth anniversary of sofia 's death . she carried sofia 's picture . `` i 'm called to help people when they go through something like this , '' she said . `` i had no clue what to expect . i had no clue how to help myself . i 'm called to provide people hope in whatever form that looks like . to ignore that calling would be the death of my soul . `` the garden helps . and it hurts . ",
        "`` it 's bittersweet , '' she said . `` it 's still very difficult to see her name like that . `` she paused . `` but it 's very kind , '' she said . `` the fact that they 've done this and they continue to welcome us in . i can never find the words to say enough gratitude . i do n't feel like we have the words in our language to express deep gratitude for people 's kindness . `` sofia loved dirt . `` dirt , dirt , dirt , '' khan said . ",
        "`` she was always digging and playing . she was very spirited . she was just the light of our worlds , for sure . `` it 's meaningful , i think , that hope and growth would take root in her name . `` if my story , my family 's story , sofia 's story can help even one person , i have to share it , '' khan said . `` i have to do that in her honor .
