        "before anyone on the north side dismisses alex rodriguez as a pot-stirring interloper , remember that a-rod has been prescient before regarding cubs pitcher yu the midst of the astros annihilating darvish for four earned runs in 1 2/3 innings against the dodgers in game 7 of the world series last nov. . 1 , rodriguez immediately tweeted that houston hitters ' body language suggested `` perhaps he was tipping his pitches . `` a month later , an anonymous astros hitter confirmed as much to sports illustrated , explaining that the way darvish re-gripped the ball in his glove determined whether he was throwing a slider or a this for rodriguez : love him or hate him as a broadcaster , spending 22 years in the majors as a player qualifies him to interpret nuances at the ballpark not everybody notices . ",
        "so it figures that rodriguez 's controversial comments about darvish 's rehabilitation methods sunday on espn came either from observation , experience or -- more likely -- an individual in the cubs organization who maintains a relationship with one of the sport 's most polarizing personalities . `` when you have a guy that signed an enormous contract and is sitting down and you walk in the training room and he 's got two trainers working on him , you should be in arizona somewhere getting treated , '' rodriguez said about darvish , seemingly out of the suggested that cubs teammates upset with the coddling of darvish , who has missed more than two months with right triceps tendinitis , threatens to cause a rift in the clubhouse . ",
        "during a nationally televised broadcast , rodriguez gave voice to whispers that began locally shortly after the cubs placed darvish on the disabled list in may with the flu . ",
        "he said something more unexpected than outrageous , wondering aloud whether darvish 's feelings were as tender as his right arm , a lingering question since the former japanese star arrived in rodriguez intimated rings true in every professional sport ; injured players are best to stay away from the guys fighting through aches and pains every day to stay in the , rodriguez also might have done darvish a player best known for having a fragile psyche since signing a six-year , $ 126 million free-agent contract suddenly became the cubs player most likely to be defended this week .",
        "even if some cubs quietly have rolled their eyes over darvish or privately questioned the pitcher 's approach to rehab , as rodriguez hinted , publicly teammates will have his back . the winning culture created by three straight national league championship series appearances all but assures that kind of protection throughout the cubs enjoyed an off day monday , but the first time a teammate responds to rodriguez 's assertion , darvish likely will receive the unqualified support he craves . teammates typically rally around a player outsiders question . that 's the way championship teams limit distractions . ",
        "this gives the cubs a chance to proclaim their faith in darvish to anybody who doubts it , a potential boost of confidence for a pitcher who appears to lack it . just look at how quickly cubs manager joe maddon sprung to darvish 's defense . `` i totally disagree with that , '' maddon said sunday night after a reporter relayed rodriguez 's comments made during the cubs-cardinals broadcast . `` everyone knows what 's going on . we know there is an injury there . we support his recovery . everybody in there knows and everyone in the coaches room knows also , throughout the organization . ",
        "it 's unfortunate that it was relayed that way , but it 's not true . `` cubs president theo epstein has sounded just as supportive of darvish at every turn . the only evidence to the contrary came when the cubs traded for cole hamels , a proven left-hander acquired to give the starting rotation stability the cubs know darvish no longer offers . the cubs did the right thing in demoting tyler chatwood to the bullpen and leaving mike montgomery in the rotation -- for now . they would be wise to continue surveying the pitching market until tuesday 's trade deadline passes and not necessarily count on darvish , who has n't pitched in a major-league game since may 20 . ",
        "anything darvish provides at this point should be considered a , only darvish and his doctors can say where he is after a 23-pitch bullpen session friday . psychologically , the pitcher can get stronger by being portrayed as weak on national television . nobody really knows how much of darvish 's rehab includes recovering from the shoulders up . what irony it would be if a-rod 's insinuations coincide with darvish 's the cubs can curse a-rod now as long as they 're willing to thank him later .
