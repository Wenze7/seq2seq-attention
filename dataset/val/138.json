        "as residents in and around the northern california city of redding scrambled early friday to escape the deadly carr fire encroaching from the west , social media platforms lit up with desperate messages , offers of help , and calls for more press coverage of the devastating wildfire . you can actually hear the panic and fear in tweets like this : the explosive wildfire tore through the small towns of shasta and keswick before crossing the sacramento river on thursday . it 's now burning in redding , a city of about 91,000 straddling the river at the junction of interstate 5 and highway 299 . ",
        "the fire has already left a trail of tragedy and destruction : two firefighters have been killed and dozens of structures have been destroyed , prompting panicked residents to flee their homes with little more than what they can carry in their carr fire is `` taking down everything in its path , '' said scott mclean , a calfire spokesman for the crews battling the in the western part of redding who had n't been under evacuation orders were caught off guard and had to flee with little notice , causing miles-long traffic jams as flames turned the skies orange .",
        "`` when it hit , people were really scrambling , '' mclean said . `` there was not much of a warning . `` meanwhile on social media , the anxious conversation unfolded : readers of this newspaper also weighed in . `` thurs ' breezes picked up mid-afternoon thru evening and will again today , '' wrote `` jay cupertino . '' `` quiet mornings give a false sense of security , as if redding 's crisis has passed : not . btw , get used to an age of catastrophic wildfires . even now , with just a modestly warmer earth , and much worse in your kids ' lifetime . ",
        "`` another reader wondered why `` the us govt or california is not buying up those big nearly obsolete 747 's and the like that sit in the arizona desert and them to firefighting tankers . they could be bought relatively cheaply for scrap prices . these monster fires are with us every year , and we seem hopeless and helpless . `` buy them up and have them at the ready , '' the commenter wrote . `` these fire losses are devastating and preventable , and likely to increase .
