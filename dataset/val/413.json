        "chicago police union president kevin graham blasted the proposed consent decree released friday as `` illegal and invalid , '' calling it `` politically motivated '' while vowing to fight the plan in attorney general lisa madigan and mayor rahm emanuel held a joint press conference friday afternoon announcing the reform plan for the city 's embattled police department , encompassed in a 232-page draft . the proposal is not a done deal and will be open to public scrutiny before it 's filed with judge robert dow , who will then hold hearings involving stakeholders and eventually rule on a final consent a comparison with the los angeles police department , which for more than a decade had operated under a consent decree , graham said the agreement will cost taxpayers hundreds of millions . ",
        "`` it is important to know that we at the fop have tried to work with the attorney general of the state of illinois , and they 've refused to listen to us , '' graham said during a press conference at the police union 's headquarters . `` on the other hand , the attorney general was more than willing to listen to groups that were anti-police such as the aclu and black lives matter . `` involving those groups in the policy 's creation is `` a disaster , '' graham said . `` the city and the attorney general have set a dangerous precedent by granting these groups influence into the policy of the chicago police department , '' graham said . ",
        "`` their willingness to do so reveals much about the true nature of this agreement and the magnitude of the threat that it imposes . `` graham cast the officers ' objection as a reflection of their commitment to public safety . `` we will continue to fight the consent decree to protect our officers and to protect the public because some of our public officials have failed to do so , '' graham coalition of civil rights organizations suing the city , including black lives matter chicago , the chicago urban league and the naacp , in may released their own 10-point plan that called for a number of other things , the plan called for overhauling the police department 's use of force policy and additional officer training in de-escalation strategies . ",
        "the group also asked to remove officers from public schools and to reserve police intervention for `` real and immediate '' , when it comes to officers ' use of tasers , the group called for limitations such as prohibiting their use at schools and on pregnant women , children , elderly people , anyone in medical distress and those who are handcuffed or coalition also called for the city to step up its efforts to divert people from the formal justice system by , among other things , limiting arrests for victimless the coalition 's proposal , training on fair and unbiased policing would be required , and the department 's hiring efforts would have to maintain diversity .",
        "the group also called for providing incentives to officers who do n't use excessive force , reduce their number of arrests and treat people sheley , an attorney with the aclu of illinois , in a statement called the proposed consent decree `` an important step in the long process of reform , '' but said it likely needs more work before it 's presented in court . `` today , the organizations who have sued to bring about reform , including the aclu , have started to examine the draft to see whether it is designed to meet the needs of chicago residents . ",
        "there is no simple and quick fix , and this document deserves our careful attention . incredibly , this draft still does not require officers to record when they point a weapon at someone . the city of chicago just settled a case for $ million where police held a gun to the chest of a 3-year-old child . given the absence of this provision , we need to examine this draft very closely . the movement toward reform of cpd did not culminate today -- but it has moved one step forward . we must all review and respond comprehensively to the draft to ensure a revised decree will successfully bring about the reform we have been waiting for . ",
        "`` sheila bedi , a professor with northwestern university 's macarthur justice center and an attorney who helped lead one of the lawsuits that lead to the consent decree proposal , said such a policy needs input from `` those most impacted by police brutality and violence . '' in a statement , bedi said the community coalition 's demands in may `` must be the measure of whether this ... will truly reduce the harm caused by the racism and violence that permeates the cpd . `` during a question-and-answer session with reporters friday , graham expressed concerns with the timing and some of the plan 's said he was notified `` less than 24 hours ago '' that the document would be released . ",
        "the attorney general , he said , had recently indicated to them `` this was far off in the distance and they were far from having this completed . `` graham said he thinks the city and madigan 's office are trying to `` box in '' the federal judge to accept the if he feels heard by the mayor 's office and like they 've been a partner , graham said he has n't had `` much contact '' with the mayor 's office . `` i have been president of lodge 7 for more than a year , and i have never had a meeting with the mayor , '' he about increased mental health support , graham said he brought that up to the police superintendent in their first meeting together , and the superintendent was supportive . ",
        "he also said his group has `` never been opposed to training . `` graham said the fop does n't believe the attorney general has standing in federal court as there 's `` never been '' a state attorney general who 's filed a consent decree in federal court . `` when you add it up , it 's going to cost a lot of money , and that money should really be spent on officers insurance , retiree health insurance , a new police academy , '' he said . `` to hand a bill to the taxpayers , that 's just wrong .
