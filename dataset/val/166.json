        "oakland -- looking to add a spark in the outfield , the a 's called up hot-hitting ramon laureano from triple-a , 24 , is hitting . 297 with 14 home runs , 35 rbis and 11 stolen bases over 64 games in what is his first year at the triple-a level . but it 's the last month where laureano has really started to turn it on , having hit . 373 in the month of july with eight home runs , 18 rbis and six stolen bases . he arrives to oakland on an 11-game hit streak , with seven multi-hit performances over that manager fran riordan pulled laureano to the side during wednesday 's game to inform him he had been called up to oakland . ",
        "though laureano said he was `` shocked '' at the time , he knew his numbers were deserving of a promotion . `` i 'm just trying to stay patient and control what i can control . i 'm just gon na play hard , '' laureano said . `` i always get a little hot in july , so i knew if it was gon na come , it was gon na come now . `` it 's been a nice bounce back for laureano , who had to miss the first month of the season after breaking his left hand march 12 in a spring training game on a pitch from san francisco giants reliever roberto is considered an athletic outfielder with plus-speed and bat speed who has impressed the a 's with his defense this season . ",
        "the majority of his playing time has come in right field this season , but laureano can play all three outfield spots . `` we 'll start him in center and see how it goes , '' a 's manager bob melvin said . `` he moves around really well and has a plus-arm . i think he leads triple-a in assists . i knew at some point in time if he overcame the injury that he would be here . `` once an astros prospect expected to patrol the houston outfield alongside george springer and kyle tucker for years to come , struggles at double-a made laureano an expendable piece . ",
        "he was traded to the a 's in november 2017 in exchange for minor league pitcher brandon it was a tough 2017 for laureano as he lost his status as one of the top prospects in houston 's farm system , the outfielder said the poor season may end up a blessing in disguise when he looks back at it now that he 's getting a shot with the a 's . `` i knew everything was gon na be okay and i was gon na learn from it , '' laureano said . `` it 's in the past so hopefully one day i can say that was the best year of my life . ",
        "`` with the a 's facing left-handers in four of the next five games starting friday night , melvin said laureano will get a good chance to show what he can do at the big league level with plenty of action over the next week . `` when we acquired him i know billy and david were talking about how he was basically untouchable with the astros just a year before and tough to get . when we finally did acquire him he made a great impression in spring , '' melvin said . `` he 's handling left-handed pitching really well , so i think the timing to get him here now is good . ",
        "`` dustin fowler was sent down after wednesday 's game in order to make room for laureano on the roster . batting just . 231 overall and . 176 in july , the a 's would like the outfielder to get his confidence back up by playing every day in nashville , something that diminished over the past month with the emergence of nick martini . `` i think he got to a point where he needs to be a little more aggressive in everything he does , whether it 's stealing bases or in the outfield , '' melvin said of fowler . ",
        "`` we still feel like he 's gon na be the center fielder of the future , but we were n't doing him any favors here by not playing him . he was basically inactive last year and needs consistent at-bats . we will see him back here at some point . '' "
