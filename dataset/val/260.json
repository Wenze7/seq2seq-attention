        "the los angeles dodgers scored a staggering 21 runs off the milwaukee brewers on thursday and enter friday 's world series rematch with a ton of los angeles dodgers set a dodger stadium record by scoring 21 runs on thursday against the milwaukee brewers . with the three touchdowns the team scored in runs , they also added a touchdowns-worth of home a slow stretch of hitting , the dodger bats are understandable confident heading into the most anticipated matchup of the is a world series rematch and a potential preview to a second act . it is the los angeles dodgers vs. houston astros . ",
        "opposing the dodgers is the dominant justin angeles got hot at the right time as they head into tonight 's contest against the best pitcher in the american league . luckily for the dodger pitchers , carlos correa , jose altuve , brian mccann and potentially george springer may all be out of the correa and altuve are both great , it is springer that manhandled the dodgers in the world series . at least yu darvish is n't in our dodgers beat the streak series we are concerned with la 's bats , who obviously extended our streaks last night . ",
        "both of our picks , justin turner and brian dozier , went deep to add a game to our 's pick -- current streak 2 : my pick for today is cody bellinger . last night bellinger broke out of his slump in the most momentous way possible and dodger fans could n't be happier . i think that tonight , as the dodgers face an old foe in the houston astros , bellinger will be one of the guys leading the charge , just like last astros have been great this season , and there 's really no way to ignore that . ",
        "the dodgers , however , seem to be just getting started and last night 's offensive outburst may be their greatest advantage going into tonight 's 's pick -- current streak 4 : justin verlander has been so great all season long and pitched fairly well against the dodgers in the world series last year . thus , i am going with a bat that was not on the team during the world series and actually has the most hits off verlander out of all the dodgers -- manny has not had a ton of success against verlander , he is hitting . ",
        "257 lifetime with seven hits in 27 at-bats . his nine strikeouts are a bit , machado did not join the rbi parade last night and has been ok at the plate for the dodgers thus far . after seeing brian dozier slug two home runs in two games , machado is going to want to remind the fans that he was the huge trade acquisition of the is launching a ball into the seats tonight and i would not be surprised if it is early to get the ball rolling for the boys in blue .
