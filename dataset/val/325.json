        "- like its neighbor yukon , alaska is on the verge of a mining and exploration boom , this according to frazer tabeart , managing director of polarx ltd . the prospect of a second gold rush in the north has prompted several australian miners , including polarx , to set up shop there , despite the harsh climate . tabeart said that the last two year saw the most mining activity in alaska in the last decade , which has caught the attention of australian miners . `` we certainly think it 's got potential to grow substantially , '' tabeart said , speaking on polarx 's gold and copper projects in alaska . ",
        "`` the goal for the rest of the year is to continue drilling that with the view that if double or triple the size of that , which is very plausible , we then think we 've got something that 's going to be of a mineable scale . '' alaska has a reputation for being a safe , reliable jurisdiction , but mining during the winters can pose a challenge , said tabeart . `` drilling in winter is difficult . we would typically , in our exploration phase , restrict our drilling activities to the may to october period , '' tabeart told kitco news on the sidelines of the noosa mining & exploration conference in australia .
