        "they will go into the 2018-2019 season with the team in place now . however , they were/are leaving themselves enough cap room to make a move during the season probably closer to the carolina hurricane turned buffalo sabre jeff skinner , logically speaking , was going to be a top target . the 26-year-old forward was on the top of everyone 's list . carolina made it known he was available , and a litany of teams had been bidding for his would really have helped the san jose sharks . in fact , he would have put them over the top . ",
        "is skinner a difference maker in the same class as an artemi panerin , no , but adding another 50-60 point player to their top six would have made this team as formidable as any in the western 's style of play would have fit right in here with the san jose sharks and would have made the top two lines as competitive as any in the pacific division , and frankly , the entire nhl . skinner would have added over 20 goals , as he 's averaged over that during his nhl i would have loved to have seen what a guy like jeff skinner can do when paired with tomas hertl and logan your voice heard ? ",
        "join the blades of teal team ! skinner could be the first domino that falls in what will be a wave of trades heading into training camp . there are still major stars on the block all around the nhl , guys like erik karlsson , max pacioretty , and `` the bread man '' artemi panarin are all reportedly available , and this could be the first of many deals made before puck drop on the 2018-2019 season .
