        "one day closer to the weekend . before we tackle apple inc. . earnings , arguably the biggest earnings of the day , let me break down the top stories from tuesday , july 31 . the forbidden fruit of faang realmoney 's martin cassidy tackles apple 's services segment of its business . `` we still expect services to be the most important part , '' said aap portfolio analyst zev fima . `` if services are strong it will be enough to offset any third-quarter disappointment in unit sales . '' analysts on tuesday reiterated their bullish valuations on the tech giant , expecting apple to issue earnings of about $ a share , according to factset . ",
        "cfra research 's angelo zino wrote that the expected introduction of an apple television streaming platform would help drive services growth for the company , predicting the segment would comprise nearly 20 % of sales and a third of profits by 2019 , with services revenue of $ 50 billion in 2020 . apple is expected to release earnings right after the bell on tuesday . the tech company will be the final faang stock to announce earnings , so it 'll be the apple of everyone 's eye if it can manage to avoid tanking like facebook did after its earnings . ",
        "and , no , i 'm not sorry for that pun . apple is a holding in jim cramer 's action alerts plus member club . want to be alerted before jim cramer buys or sells aapl ? learn more now . eyeroll please ... lauren simmons , the youngest and only full-time female stockbroker at the nyse , sat down with thestreet 's anders keitz and katherine ross . she discussed a lot of interesting topics . and , when asked whether she thinks millennials do n't invest she -- drumroll , please -- scoffed and rolled her eyes . ",
        "so there you have it , folks . on a more serious note , simmons tackled some tough subjects , most importantly financial literacy . she has some thoughts on financial literacy . `` learning credit and savings accounts and what investing can or ca n't do for you , that should be 1,2,3 , courses that should be given at some point while you 're younger -- definitely by the time you graduate high school , '' simmons said . `` from there , it as a platform to learn more but it definitely is important . '' talking tesla ah , yes . ",
        "tesla inc. . is slated to release earnings on wednesday , aug. . 1 . thestreet 's eric jhonsa has listed some of the top things to look for when the earnings are released . of course , the earnings will heavily rely on model 3 numbers . any fresh comments on model 3 production rates and targets are worth paying close attention to . as are any remarks about model 3 reservations -- they stood at about 420,000 at the end of q2 -- and order activity . during the second week of july , more than two years after it began taking reservations for the car , tesla opened the model 3 order process to the general public , albeit while continuing to give reservation holders order priority . ",
        "also : will tesla offer any update on when it plans to start making the $ 35,000 standard battery version of the model 3 , and in what volumes ? musk previously said the $ 35,000 model 3 would enter production in early 2019 . for now , tesla is only taking orders for versions of the model 3 that cost $ 49,000 or more . while model 3 output clearly picked up in q2 , it 's still unknown what kind of margins tesla saw on delivered cars , amid all of the extraordinary measures it took to hit its production target . ",
        "tesla reported in may its model 3 gross margin was slightly negative in q1 , and forecast it would be `` close to breakeven '' in q2 before becoming `` highly positive '' in q3 and staying that way in q4 . keep an eye out for the earnings . "
