        "one thing blackhawks president john mcdonough has made clear since taking over the franchise 11 years ago is that he is n't interested in modest success on the ice , the goal is to win stanley hawks have won three cups during his tenure , so this never has been idle chatter , and with several core pieces still around there 's no indication anything resembling a full rebuild is on the horizon . talk of the championship window being closed is for other take a look around the elegant ballrooms of the chicago hilton , where the blackhawks have been conducting their annual convention this weekend , and here 's what you do n't see : 's that for a hawks have demonstrated the kind of sustained success about which most professional sports franchises only can dream . ",
        "the organization , once infamously dubbed the worst franchise in sports , underwent a complete resurrection over the last team that was once not even an afterthought became synonymous with success . but nothing lasts sharp is retired , marian hossa is done playing and the other core pieces of the three stanley cup championships are all older than 30 , save for patrick kane , who reaches that milestone in november . and they 're coming off a last-place the question must be asked : is the hawks ' championship window still open ? `` absolutely , '' blackhawks coach joel quenneville said . ",
        "`` as a staff , as a team , as individual players that 's what drives us in this business : you think that you can win . we all saw a team last year , probably not a person in the world would have thought vegas had a real legitimate chance of being a champion . colorado , non-playoff team last in the league , all of a sudden makes the playoffs and anything can happen . `` quenneville , who turns 60 in september , has two years left on his contract . he has been a head coach in the nhl for 22 seasons and last year was the first time one of his teams did n't finish above . ",
        "500 . `` we all should accept some of the responsibility of improving , '' he said . `` individually , we need our top guys to be as good as they ever have been . `` but can they ? jonathan toews , 30 , needs to be much better than last season when , statistically , he had the worst season of his career . duncan keith , 35 , did n't receive any votes in the norris trophy voting for the first time since the 2006-07 crawford 's health will be a concern until he proves he can get back on the ice after suffering a season-ending injury in december . ",
        "perhaps the biggest issue going forward is what to do with brent seabrook , who is only 33 but is n't anywhere near the player he was at his peak and still has six years left on his contract with a $ million annual cap has no doubt the hawks still can contend for championships over the next few years , including this season . `` i do n't see why not , '' kane said . `` you can talk about age and different things but a lot of us probably will tell you we felt as good as we ever had , whether it 's from what has happened the last few seasons with not having really deep playoff runs and just the knowledge you gain as you get older . ",
        "and being mature and how to take care of yourself and get yourself as best as possible . `` if the window is n't closed , it 's closing . but as long as it 's open even a little bit , these players who have won so much will believe another stanley cup run is possible . "
