        "an appeals court on friday said donald trump supporters can move ahead with a lawsuit claiming san jose police forced them to walk from a 2016 campaign rally into a mob of violent protesters who assaulted them while the officers stood city had argued the case should be dismissed because the officers enjoy `` qualified immunity '' from liability in doing their a three-judge panel of the 9th circuit court of appeals upheld a district court ruling last year in favor of more than a dozen rally attendees who alleged the officers violated their civil rights . `` we find the officers violated clearly established rights and are not entitled to qualified immunity at this stage of the proceedings , '' said the opinion by judge dorothy w. nelson , joined by judges andrew j. kleinfeld and william a. attorney rick doyle said `` we 're reviewing the decision '' and will discuss next steps with the city council . ",
        "those could include asking a full 11-member panel of the 9th circuit to review the decision or appealing to the supreme court , he lawsuit , hernandez v. san jose , involved a june 2 , 2016 campaign rally for then-candidate trump at san jose 's mcenery convention center . `` the attendees alleged sufficiently that the officers increased the danger to them by shepherding them into a crowd of violent protesters and that the officers acted with deliberate indifference to that danger , '' the 9th circuit opinion said . `` the district court therefore correctly denied the officers qualified immunity . ",
        "`` the suit initially named mayor sam liccardo and police chief eddie garcia as defendants . but district judge lucy koh last year dismissed claims against garcia . the attendees dropped claims against liccardo in november suit proceeds against seven named city officers . but the 9th circuit opinion did not uphold liability claims against the city itself that were based on the assertion that the police chief , in comments supporting his officers after the rally , effectively ratified their allegedly unconstitutional conduct . `` we decline to exercise jurisdiction over it , '' the court opinion said , because `` the city 's liability is not inextricably intertwined with the officers ' liability '' and `` the qualified immunity issue .
