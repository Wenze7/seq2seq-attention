        "since the white sox drafted zack collins in the first round of the 2016 draft , his knack for getting on base has been his signature , and his patient approach has been a refreshing sight for an organization with its share of free collins has begun to figure out the double a level this season , he has his eyes are set on accomplishing a feat no white sox player has in 20 years . `` i 'd love to lead the big leagues in walks and on-base , '' collins sox 's top catching prospect is leading the minor leagues in walks , on-base percentage , and walk rate and sported a career-high . ",
        "833 ops in his first 96 games for double-a birmingham this season . `` zack is one of those hitters that when you challenge him to do something , he has it set in his mind that he 's going to do it , '' said birmingham barons manager ryan newman . `` i absolutely think that is a goal that he can reach with his ability . `` the last white sox player to lead the majors in on-base percentage was frank thomas in 1997 , the hall of famer 's third and last time doing it during his 16-year career with the white sox . ",
        "thomas also led the league in walks four times . `` people always ask me about my approach . in my opinion , your eyes are n't perfect enough to look for the outside pitch or the inside pitch , '' collins said . `` so i look for something i can drive and if it 's not there , i do n't swing . '' `` sometimes i let pitches go that look drivable because they are n't perfect and that 's just part of it . it happens . guys are throwing nasty pitches . guys are throwing hard . ",
        "when you 're looking for the perfect pitch , sometimes it does n't work out . `` as a hitting instructor himself before joining the white sox organization , newman would see young hitters struggle to toe the line of patience and aggressiveness . watching his catcher 's ability to do that in just his third professional season has impressed him . `` it 's an exceptional eye in such a young hitter , '' newman said . `` zack has a well-above-average knowledge of the strike zone . when he was struggling earlier in the season , he was actually too selective . ",
        "when he expanded , not the strike zone , but what he wanted to hit , that 's when he really took off . he looks comfortable . `` the university of miami product went back to his old stance because of a lack of comfort . despite his . 248 batting average , combining his patient approach with his old stance , the numbers have proven the change to be effective . he has doubled his line drive percentage to 26 percent , which has translated to consistent success at the offensive prowess may get him to the big leagues , but the progress he makes on the defensive side may determine how soon that promotion comes . ",
        "white sox catchers have ranked 29th or worse in defensive runs saved the last three seasons and they have been one of baseball 's worst pitch framing teams in 2018 . `` i 've seen some comments made about that i took to heart . i 'm looking to get better at every aspect of my game , '' he said . `` hopefully i can help the big league team in chicago soon .
