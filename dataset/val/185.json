        "oakland -- a flight touched down here wednesday morning with kevin durant 's face and outstretched arms slathered across almost the entirety of the boeing 737 . it 's part of a campaign by alaska airlines , which is using durant 's likeness on its fleet while helping to back the warriors star 's charity endorsements are nothing new , but this was a lot bigger than a wheaties box . there is being on a plane and actually being on a plane . once durant de-boarded , i asked the nba finals mvp what it was like to see his face at that scale . ",
        "`` all i could think about was how i grew up and where i came from , '' the warriors star said , referring to his family 's poverty in seat pleasant , maryland . `` nobody knew who i was . none of my friends would ever think this would happen to me . it 's pretty dope to see . `` how he grew up is why he is here : durant discovered his childhood salvation in basketball . and this stopover at oakland international airport was designed to help other kids do the nine-time all-star filled the plane with 80 youth basketball players , including teams from the bay area , in order to whisk them to las vegas for the bigfoot hoops classic . ",
        "`` the main goal is to help the kids flourish , '' said durant , 29 , who is headed to las vegas for a pair of team usa practices . `` as a young kid playing aau , i know how important that is . it 's just a transition from being a kid and loving the game to possibly doing this as a professional . `` durant has a history of this kind of thing . last year , he pledged more than $ 13 million to mostly education-oriented organizations en route to winning the nba 's `` community assist '' award . ",
        "now , he feels like he can do more . earlier this month , durant signed a two-year contract that will pay him $ 30 million next season with a player option worth $ million for durant plane -- dubbed `` flight 35 '' after his jersey number -- was n't the only notable arrival in oakland recently . demarcus cousins held his introductory press conference last week after signing with the reigning nba champions for the taxpayer mid-level exception worth $ is out indefinitely with an achilles injury . but when he returns , the center will make the warriors the first team since the 1975-76 boston celtics to play five all-stars from the previous season at the same hopes his new teammate recovers quickly . ",
        "`` oh , i 'm so excited to have demarcus on the team , '' durant said . `` i think he 's going to be amazing . i think he 's going to help us just as much as we help him . i ca n't wait for him to get back from his injury so he can get back to what he loves to do . `` cousins has a checkered past because of a reputation for clashing with coaches , teammates and media . durant says this will be a perfect fresh start . `` i know he 's going to love the bay area and the fans in oakland -- specifically oakland , '' he said . ",
        "`` that town , that community . his personality fits perfectly . i 'm excited to see how he fits with the organization and with the city . `` durant made fitting in look easy wednesday . dozens of high-school aged kids pressed against the glass to watch the 7-footer make his way down the jetway and into the waiting area . durant arranged for all of them to get a pair of his latest signature shoe with nike , the morales , a post player for the san jose cagers , called it a `` once-in-a-lifetime '' opportunity . ",
        "she 's a big warriors fan who tries to emulate durant 's style of play . `` i try to incorporate the way he runs down the floor and gets out on the break , '' said morales , who also plays for archbishop mitty high . `` when he gets a rebound , he sprints down the floor . ... i make sure i 'm always hustling . `` for jhaylon martinez , a 6-foot-10 forward from fairfield , the appeal was obvious : `` i like how he 's so tall and can shoot . `` durant was happy to have them aboard . ",
        "he serves as an adviser to the ceo at alaska airlines , working alongside brad tilden to help develop opportunities for kids in the bay area . durant joked that he wants more executive power . `` i tell that i have an ` in ' to the streets as a millennial , '' he said . `` so he may need to lean on me a little more . `` for now , he was glad just to have an airplane full of kids . face on the side or not , durant just wants their dreams to take flight .
