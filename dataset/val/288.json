        "this one in particular -- give their devotees a sense of coherence that is lacking in everything trump does . qanon presents donald trump as the character he plays on tv ; bold , commanding , strategic , and brilliant ... as opposed to the real donald trump , who displays the dignity , intelligence , and honesty of a strip-club tout with tertiary syphilis . in q 's world , donald trump is courageously leading an effort to round up and punish -- i 'm not exaggerating -- tens of thousands of child predators who occupy the highest reaches of government . ",
        "q and don , side by side , doling out the secret knowledge to the new elite . instead of getting a clearance , all you need to do is check out 4chan , reddit , or even believe q composes these messages for their eager consumption and interpretation at trump 's direction , the amanuensis to an orange nostradamus whose quatrains appear on the same image boards that feature bronie porn , hentai spank-bank material , and tween neo-nazi shitposter incels , instead of penned on parchment . they 're desperate to believe `` q '' is a senior official cleared at the highest levels who busily leaks cryptic messages to them . ",
        "set aside that the q clearance is a department of energy designation , and is for access to particular nuclear weapons matters , not the bondian highest-reaches-of-government shenanigans to which q claims access ; this entire thing reeks of enough bullshit to fertilize claims of q-anon make nostradamus look like hemingway . naturally , they 're elliptical , variable , and impossible to cross-check . hundreds of youtube videos , blog posts tweets , facebook items , and speculation follow each post , a confederacy of dunces that ramifies this idiocy out into dumber and dumber dead ends . qanon asks its believers to `` follow the breadcrumbs '' and fill in the blanks . ",
        "those blanks get filled with epic glee with which the followers of this absurdity latch on to imaginary deportations of hillary clinton , john podesta , and others to gitmo is notable . several times , q has promised them that any moment now the rest of the deep state will occupy the darkest holes of the american prison system . qanon tells them that retribution is at hand , and they 're ravenous for more . lurid and exciting for the rubes , but as of yet , hillary clinton walks free . if that even is hillary clinton , and not a shapeshifting reptilian of us with the unfortunate awareness of the clownishly risible qanon conspiracy cult have been reveling in the comedy gold , lavishly overwrought , dangerously stupid proclamations of q for months . ",
        "we 've alternated between laughter and wide-eyed shock at how credulous trump 's army of cletuses must be to fall for such an obvious , ludicrous con . then again , donald trump put the `` con '' in `` conspiracy '' as far back as his embrace of birtherism . if the puzzle surrounding qanon is a fever dream wrapped in an enigma , coated with nougat , rolled in nuts and filled with a creamy center of delusional paranoia , trump 's own role in fostering it is right out of the lil tots ' first book of authoritarian actual authoritarians and the merely dictator-curious , building a separate , hermetic truth defined only by the dear leader is 101 stuff , and goes hand in hand with the relentless attacks on the free press an enemy of the people . ",
        "of course , it 's just trolling . it 's just a prank by some chan-autists . it makes me shake my head to explain to people that the idea of a conspiracy this grand and elaborate has as much chance of working as skeeter 's plan to cook meth in the walmart has q eaten the trump-right 's minds ? why does it work on them when it 's so obviously , evidently a gigantic pyramid of digital horseshit ? it works because stupid people are stupid and because donald trump 's administration loves what qanon does to stoke the fires of paranoia , resentment , and division . ",
        "qanon works for trump because people who are not knowledgeable of the world , politics , government , the intelligence community and reality more broadly are desperately looking for confirmation that they 're on the winning team . q tells them that they 're on the right side of history and that for once in their dreary little lives they and only they possess the secret , hermetic knowledge from inside the esoteric cult . q represents where the former gop has gone in the era of trump ; possessed the desire to have a private space that makes even fox news look mild in comparison , grasping desperately for a different even aggressive conspiracy-pusher faux-journalist loons and alt-lite thought leaders mike cernovich and jack posobiec find qanon too crazy to promote , it should make you pause . ",
        "both men were aggressive promoters of the pizzagate theory , in which a washington restaurant was falsely alleged to be the center of a global child sex-trafficking , cannibalism and prostitution ring . both were all-in on the cruel and false seth rich story , and a raft of other pro-trump efforts to mainline fantasy conspiracies into the american body politics . if it 's too crazy for those edge cases , it 's too , trump fans , the storm is n't coming . there is no great awakening . `` where we go one we go all '' is a path to disappointment and madness , not to some brave new future where donald trump 's genius and his army of secret soldiers purge america of a vast , secret deep state of hostile insiders and pedophiles . ",
        "q is a meta-hoax , a recursive scam in service of a scam called the trump presidency . the `` drops '' are meaningless claptrap , noise without real signal , and most certainly not the signs of the new reality its eager marks desire . "
