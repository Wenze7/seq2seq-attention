        "the toronto raptors have been waiting for lebron james to leave the conference . with his departure , did toronto need to make the kawhi leonard trade ? last season , the toronto raptors were the best team in the eastern conference before being swept by lebron james . the team won 59 games and looked good in the first-round of the enjoyment was brief . in the second round , lebron imposed his will once again . he embarrassed the toronto raptors with a four game is now gone . with the best player in the league out of their conference , did toronto really need to risk demar derozan in the kawhi leonard trade ? ",
        "the answer is the moment the raptors were eliminated from the 2018 playoffs , masai knew something needed to change . last season 's `` culture reset '' , although only being tested for a year , had no impact on toronto 's goalsonce the rumors started , several people were looking forward to a future without lebron in the was n't enough for the raptors . they were n't just going to sit still and see how next season played out . they wanted to be able to compete and play the type of basketball the rest of the nba has been playing for years . ",
        "trading for kawhi leonard and danny green seemed like the best option to make this definitely would be an accomplishment for the raptors to finally make an nba finals , but the ultimate goal is to compete for a championship . the team needed to be built to compete with not only the eastern conference but every single team in the , lebron is in the western conference . but if your goals are big enough , he is still an team needsthe raptors defense fell apart in the postseason . it was one of the reasons they played so poorly in the series vs the cavaliers . ",
        "it 's something that kawhi and danny green both bring to the both players with the defensive abilities of og anunoby , pascal siakam , and fred vanvleet and the raptors should be one of the best defensive teams in the , toronto should be fine . nick nurse was hired to build on what he started last year , and although losing demar derozan and jakob poeltl puts a dent in last year 's system , adding one of the league 's best scorer 's kawhi makes up for the long run demar 's contract only lasted two or three more years . ",
        "if the raptors were not able to produce once his contract came to an end , there is no doubt that masai would have begun a rebuild , with the expiring contracts of kyle lowry and serge ibaka as well . kawhi may only be guaranteed for a year but that 's a gamble the raptors needed to make .
