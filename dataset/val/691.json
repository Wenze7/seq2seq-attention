        "on a thursday afternoon , madison beer is taking a break from a photo shoot in downtown hollywood . `` it 's the least glamorous place in the world , '' she sighs . given her 11 million instagram followers and the constant barrage of paparazzi headlines , you 'd think beer was a model , bored by routine photo beer is a singer who 's been working her fendi-clad butt off . she moved to california -- her family stayed in new york -- at age 13 to pursue a singing career after justin bieber posted a video of her singing on twitter . ",
        "the pop star helped get her signed to island records , his label at the time . after parting ways with island in 2015 , beer independently released her debut ep `` as she pleases '' in february through access records . the seven-track release mixes acoustic pop with r&b . it 's a raised middle finger to the labels who thought the 19-year-old could n't release her own music , the boys who think she 's coming home with them , mean girls . the ep 's single `` home with you , '' currently sits at no . ",
        "27 on billboard 's top 40 charts , and her 30-city international `` as she pleases '' tour sold out . we caught up with beer , who has attended lollapalooza , before she makes her debut at the : how do you feel about returning to lollapalooza as a performer instead of an attendee ? a : i love festivals . i 've been lucky enough to go to lolla twice , and perform with mako on the lolla stage during their set in 2015 . but i 'm still nervous ! having my own set time is great , it 's a cool switch . ",
        "as someone who attends a lot of festivals , i think i can relate to festivalgoers and give them the energy they want during the : the songs on `` as she pleases '' are more intimate -- and the tracklist is pretty short -- so how will you scale up your show for lollapalooza ? a : people can expect a few covers and old singles , similar to my tour shows . except , very unlike my headlining tour , i know not everyone in the crowd is going to be my fan , so i hope i attract those people , too . ",
        "but i 'm not going to change much from my tour show , just spice it up , maybe with some new covers -- i 'd never compromise myself or my music just to please a : as a musician , how do you feel when news coverage just focuses on your appearance , or your outfits ? a : it 's ... kind of aggravating when i wear a shirt that shows some cleavage and it becomes a news story ; meanwhile , guys walk down the street with no shirt on , and no one says anything . ",
        "paparazzi will be like `` look ! she just turned 18 and she 's already acting like this ! '' it 's like , give me a break ! i have more to offer than my face and boobs . if something happened to my face , i hope people would have the same love and respect for me : how has your social media following helped your career ? do the thousands of fan accounts ever feel overwhelming ? do you feel pressure to project a certain image on instagram , twitter for your fans ? a : no , the only reason i 'm able to be successful independently is because of my fan base and how supportive of me they are . ",
        "`` home with you '' is 27 on the billboard charts , like it 's crazy ! i 'm just grateful people are recognizing that i 'm doing this independently . times have changed in the industry . with social media , you can do it on your own , how you please . with image ... i wan na be a role model , i 'm not out here posting a -- shots . on my stories and live streams , i try not to wear makeup or look like a million bucks , but just be genuine and act goofy . ",
        "i do n't want people to think beauty is everything , but that you should have a good heart and be a good person : so what 's next for you after lollapalooza , when you finally catch a break from touring ? a : straight to the studio . i 'm working on my next album already , i 've been sporadically at studio sessions near my house . music is my escape from it all , it 's where i 'm most comfortable ... happy .
