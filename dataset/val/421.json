        "san francisco -- matt cain , ryan vogelsong and brian wilson were all right-handed pitchers , all-stars and key members of pitching staffs that led the giants to world championships , but they took distinctly different paths to their new place on the giants ' wall of was a first round draft choice , a player whose first taste of big league action came before his first legal sip of alcohol . ",
        "a well-respected workhorse who was often the victim of his team 's poor offensive outputs , cain spent all 13 seasons of his career in san vogelsong a journeyman would n't do justice to the road he traveled , but his voyage through the baseball universe took him to japan and back before he became a steadying force in giants cain was seemingly destined for greatness and vogelsong a lovable underdog , wilson earned a reputation as one of the sport 's most colorful characters for the anti-establishment , rebellious vibe he gave are few ways to contextualize their place in giants history together , but there is one common thread among the three pitchers whose plaques on the wall of fame will be unveiled all pitched on the same staffs as madison 's road through the organization was most similar to cain 's , so it should be no surprise the two became fast friends when the left-hander arrived on the scene .",
        "`` right from the start when i got here , he was somebody that you wanted to be around and you gravitated towards , '' bumgarner 2005 , cain and bumgarner are the only two players to throw a pitch for the giants before their 21st birthday . it 's a reminder of how quickly they achieved success in the major leagues , which vogelsong ca n't relate well-traveled righty was out of a big league job after 2006 , as his career era to that point was n't attractive to major league suitors . five seasons later , after stops in japan , the venezuelan winter league and lehigh valley with the phillies ' triple-a affiliate , vogelsong reemerged with the giants and represented the club in the 2011 all-star game . ",
        "`` it takes a different breed of guy to be able to do that , '' bumgarner said . `` not many people could do that . i 'm sure the road he took makes him all the more appreciative of the success that he had and the things he got to experience and be apart of . it 's pretty special . `` the giants won all seven of vogelsong 's postseason starts , feeding off the competitive energy and unmatched intensity he brought to the park each day . `` i think stories like that are more special than a guy that just comes up and he 's here and has a good career or whatever , '' bumgarner said . ",
        "`` that kind of story i think is way cooler . `` while cain and vogelsong possess a number of common traits , it 's impossible to compare them to wilson , whose four-season stint as the giants closer was often as entertaining as it was nerve-wracking for fans to collected 171 regular season saves with the giants , but his finest moment came in the postseason when he struck out nelson cruz to clinch the club 's first world series title since the franchise moved west to san francisco . `` he had a different lifestyle and that was no secret , '' bumgarner said . ",
        "`` i do n't know if me and him had a whole lot in common , but here at the field he was just as good of a teammate as you could have . a great teammate . `` wilson 's inclusion in the ceremony suggests the giants have sorted out any differences between the former closer and the franchise . while playing for the dodgers , wilson appeared to yell at team president larry baer in the stands before a game , but after throwing out the first pitch on opening day this season wilson said the duo was simply having a hard feelings that may have existed certainly did n't carry over into the giants clubhouse , as bumgarner praised wilson for his dedication to his craft . ",
        "`` he showed up every day and worked really hard , '' bumgarner said . `` as hard as anybody can work . during the game , he was always in the game and helping guys . the ultimate competitor too . all the stuff you would want from a guy . `` the trio of honorees may have led different lives inside and outside of baseball , but they all contributed to the most successful run in franchise history . though they are n't in the giants clubhouse anymore , one player they all pitched with still will sit in the audience for saturday 's ceremony , but he knows he 'll eventually be reunited with old friends . ",
        "a plaque is in his future , regardless of what happens from here . "
