        "the calendar says it 's the first of august . but an unforgiving early wave of heat means that california 's landscape feels as dry as september , igniting a deadly wildfire season up and down the and dry as a powder keg , recent weather has accelerated the normal drying of western landscapes , turning vegetation into kindling , say weather experts . even nights are warm . `` fuels are really really dry . ",
        "it 's closer to what we should get by late summer or early fall , '' said professor craig clements , director of the fire weather research lab at san jose state `` fuel moisture level '' of shrubs , trees and grasses -- the single largest factor for how primed an area is to burn -- is below average throughout the state , including the bay area , data , the mean fuel moisture content of vegetation in mendocino county , where the mendocino complex fires are raging , is percent ; now it 's less than 11 percent .",
        "in shasta county , the site of the huge carr fire , moisture content has fallen from an average of percent to 7 percent , according to a web-based climate tool , developed with google by john abatzoglou , associate professor of geography at the university of idaho . the `` climate engine '' tool assesses how wet or dry a landscape 's vegetation is -- and how likely it is to ignite and carry a bay area 's vegetation also is dry , it shows . in santa clara county , moisture content at this time of year normally is percent -- now it 's percent ; in alameda county , normally percent , it 's fallen to percent ; in contra costa county , normally percent , it 's nine percent ; and san mateo county has fallen from an average of percent to that 's just part of the story : nights have been warm , as well , with everywhere from eureka to death valley above normal . ",
        "at san jose airport , july 's average low temperature is 58 degrees ; last month it was 61 . `` when it 's a couple degrees warmer overnight , you already have a head start on the next day , '' said steve anderson , meteorologist with the national weather service in golden state always has been a thirsty land -- even before you factor in the hazards of a worsening climate . with a mediterranean climate , nearly all of our rain falls from november to april . and last winter 's precipitation was below normal . by august , we 've gone four months without receiving a drop of a persistent high pressure system makes it feel like a training ground for hades , unless you live in foggy san has this month 's heat been more brutal than in death valley , where july 's average high reached 121 degrees -- four degrees above the annual over the state , the departure from average temperatures ranges from two to eight degrees . ",
        "down in riverside county , alfalfa grower grant chaffin reported that crops are being hit with `` summer slump , '' with high nighttime temperatures causing yields to drop by half , according to the california farm san francisco and parts of marin county are celebrating by a team lead by abatzoglou shows that these hot conditions , which dehydrate our vegetation , are contributing to fire recent years , human-caused increases in temperature have dried out western forests , accounting for about half of the increase in tinder-dry conditions , he found . the other half of problem is driven by natural temperature change is projected to increase to potential for fires across this western landscape , according to his research . ",
        "it estimates that human-caused climate change contributed to an additional million acres of high-risk forest fire areas between 1984 -- 2015 . ",
        "`` the effect is one of warming -- and also decreases in humidity , '' he , there is growing recognition that warming temperatures can worsen a stanford team previously reported that the conditions behind our 2011-2017 drought -- a high pressure system parked over the pacific ocean , diverting storms away from california -- are much more likely to occur amid concentrations of greenhouse warn that there could be be even worse heat waves , droughts and fire risks in the future -- as the planet endures increasingly volatile weather patterns that will make dry places , like much of california , dangerously drier ."
