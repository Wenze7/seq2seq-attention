        "outfit : gucci bagtopshop shirtfive and two necklacelevi 's skirtsobeyo heelsshop this look : summer outfits are here ! my outfits in the summer tend to be on the simpler side by focusing on quality pieces . i 'm ready for the heat and breezy clothing . i find myself gravitating towards linen and denim for my choice of material . denim goes well with a lot of summer ensembles . i picked up this levi 's denim skirt a year ago and it 's been my go to for summer outfits always . it 's the perfect shade of light blue and hangs just right . ",
        "i went for a afternoon bunch look by pairing this outfit with stilettos sandals and my new bougie micro bag from gucci . i love these sobeyo heels . they look great with a casual outfit or dressed up with a dress . they are also super comfortable to walk in . to keep the beige theme going , i matched my shoes with my new gucci dionysus super mini was in dire need of a summer bag . sadly my options for summer included black bags . i did n't want to spend a lot after recently purchasing my chanel boy . ",
        "i felt a micro bag would be the perfect way for me to get away with a non-black trendy : i had always loved the gucci print and felt i was making a better choice getting the smaller size than the larger sizes available . i love how much is going on with this bag . between the print , suede , silver buckle and hardware i could n't resit ! i chose the black suede or the taupe because i wanted to get use out of this bag in the fall/winter as : this of course is not the most practical bag , but who said it was supposed to be . ",
        "i think this bag is meant to be fun . for an event or going out for drinks at night when you only need to carry a cardholder and your phone . i personally do n't carry much ever , i never got why women carry so much . on a regular basis , i carry no more than a phone , my wallet , car keys and a lipstick or perfume . these are my bare essentials i ca n't leave the house without . so to me , this bag is practical . i also love how many ways you can wear this bag . ",
        "you can watch my full in depth review of this bag here and see the many ways to wear this : this bag is at a good price point if you 're looking to spend under $ 1k on a designer bag . when it comes to understanding if designer bags are worth it , you need to calculate your cost per wear . if you are looking to use this bag everyday , you 'll have a lower cost per wear . if you do n't plan to use a designer bag much , it might not be worth the investment . ",
        "there are bags i invest in long-term because i know they 'll be in my collection forever . i do n't buy bags impulsively . every bag i 've purchased , i 've sat on for a year or two . doing this helps me know if i 'll get tired of thoughts : i think this is a great bag if you 're looking to add a little luxury into your life , but you do n't want to commit to a larger size designer bag . i wanted to get a bag that was fun and i think i achieved that . ",
        "i am super happy about my purchase and ca n't wait to share with you guys how i style and wear it . i will be going to cabo san lucus , mexico in a week and will definitely have this on my hip ! "
