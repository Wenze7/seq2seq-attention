",
        "the insurer is proposing one average increase , to its bluecare direct plans , but only by insurers that sell plans on illinois ' obamacare exchange are proposing increases in next year 's premiums , but not of the magnitude of years past . celtic insurance co. . is proposing increases of about 1 percent or less . cigna is proposing an average increase of percent . and health alliance medical plans is proposing average increases of about 10 percent or this time last year , average proposed rate increases ranged from 5 percent to 43 proposals released wednesday are the result of a complex series of calculations made by insurers and will likely be finalized in coming months . ",
        "open enrollment to buy coverage through the exchange will begin nov. . 1 , for coverage beginning jan. . proposals come as the trump administration continues to try to weaken obamacare , more formally called the affordable care act . the administration has already taken a number of steps to offer consumers alternatives to purchasing exchange plans , and congress passed a tax bill last year that will , starting in 2019 , eliminate obamacare 's requirement that everyone buy insurance or pay a consumers get health insurance through their employers or through government programs such as medicare and medicaid .

        "but this year , more than 300,000 illinois residents are covered by insurance plans purchased on the its rate filings , blue cross said it took a number of factors into account when proposing rates , including the administration 's changes . `` we know that health coverage still remains out of reach for many , '' miller said in an email . `` it 's critical that we find the right balance of affordability for consumers and stability in the market so premiums do n't vary dramatically from year to year . `` cigna took into account customer claims , expected medical costs and overall market performance , among other things , said cigna spokeswoman holly fussell in an email . ",
        "`` the long-term success of the individual health insurance market starts with rational , competitive pricing , as reflected in our filing , '' fussell , blue cross and celtic all offered exchange plans in cook county , among other places , this is one of a number of states where insurers are actually proposing price decreases after years of double-digit hiked rates for this year amid uncertainty over changes to obamacare at the time they were setting their rates . in some cases , however , insurers might have set rates too high , and they 're now correcting for that , said sabrina corlette , a research professor at georgetown university 's center on health insurance reforms . ",
        "`` i think the worst of it was felt this year and , in many cases , was actually an overshooting on the part of the carriers , and i think maybe some of the carriers may feel they 've weathered the worst of the storm , '' corlette other cases , such as in minnesota , states got permission from the federal government to set up reinsurance programs , in which the state and the federal government kicked in to help insurers handle high cost claims -- a strategy that helped lower premiums this year , she information released wednesday by the federal government shows only by how much insurers plan to increase or decrease premiums for exchange plans for next year , on average .",

",
        "the short-term plans could be used for only three months at a time , but the trump administration will allow them now to be used for a year and renewed for up to three are generally cheaper than plans offered on the exchange , but they often do n't cover things like maternity care , pre-existing conditions or prescription lawmakers recently passed bills that would limit short-term plans ' use to six months in the state , amid concerns that their lower levels of coverage could leave consumers on the hook for pricey medical care and that they could attract large numbers of healthy consumers , leading to higher premiums for those who continue buying insurance on the bills are now before gov. bruce rauner ."
