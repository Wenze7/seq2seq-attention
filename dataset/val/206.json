        "shortly after terrell owens was elected to the pro hall of fame , in his third year of eligibility , former 49ers executive carmen policy called with congratulations . it was a delightful chat . `` he was bubbly , '' policy said . `` forgive my use of the term , but he was adorable in our conversation . `` the two reminisced about owens ' early days as a painfully quiet third-round pick in the 1996 draft . but because he knows owens ' longtime knack for torching relationships , policy also offered some advice . he told the receiver to embrace the hall of fame community because it offered him a chance at a new football family , one that would grow with each new induction class . ",
        "`` let it be a steppingstone to make your life better , '' policy such luck . owens doused the good vibes in lighter fluid and struck the match even before this saturday 's induction day . stung by not being a first-ballot selection , the nfl 's all-time second leading receiver will forego his own hall of fame ceremony , the first inductee ever to reject an , owens arranged a podium for himself at his alma mater , the university of tennessee-chattanooga , where he will make an induction speech on his own terms . as he tweeted monday : `` it means i 'm in control and not the media or anyone else that feels slighted or i 'm doing something wrong . ",
        "`` the decision left hall of fame officials taken aback . they will counter by limiting the focus saturday to the honorees who actually show up in canton , ohio . owens , who caught more touchdown passes than anyone except jerry rice and randy moss , will be reduced to a footnote . the hall of fame will send him his gold things would combust like this for '' '' is no surprise . was the tempestuous showboat who angered opponents , danced on the dallas star , berated coaches and clashed with teammates . such behavior is why it took him so long to get elected to the hall of fame in the first for those who know terrell owens , the sensitive and shy kid from rural alabama , the state of affairs remains shocking . ",
        "you see , in his early days , before the persona bulldozed his reputation , terrell owens was actually one heck of a sweet guy . `` he burned all of his bridges and now no one can get to him . and he ca n't get to anyone else to enjoy this great , great honor in his life , '' policy said . `` he just did n't have a human compass to point him in the right direction . `` gary plummer , a veteran linebacker , watched the entire transformation . he met owens back when the 89th overall pick was an ego-free rookie willing to play special teams . ",
        "`` he was an introverted , well-mannered nice kid when he first came in . he ended up being an extroverted , angry , bitter human being , '' plummer said . `` he clearly experienced wealth that he never could have imagined growing up in alabama . he was able to do things for family and friends that he never dreamed of . `` and instead of showing appreciation for that , it 's just a middle finger to the world . that 's a bad legacy . i think it 's just a big f -- you to the nfl and f -- you to philly and f -- you to san francisco and f -- you to every coach . ",
        "it 's just who he 's become . `` still , plummer remains sympathetic . he believes owens ' sheltered and traumatic childhood in alexander city , alabama , left the receiver unprepared for the machinery of fame , money and media . plummer cited the trend of bankruptcy among ex-nfl players as evidence that even savvy city-slickers can get derailed by the league 's trappings . owens , with his naivet\u00e9 , never stood a chance . `` i absolutely feel like this is something that happened to him , '' plummer said . `` i could see his edge just start to harden the longer he was a starter . ",
        "and , of course , getting the money and things like that . then it was not this gradual descent into darkness . it was full-on conspiracy mode -- ` gather the troops and circle the wagons . everybody is against me . ' and once he got into that , it was over . nothing was going to change that . '' # # #owens ' bitter ending with the 49ers makes for a difficult hagiography . these hall of fame induction preview stories typically overflow with fond memories and vivid accounts of old glory . with owens , the phone barely rings . ",
        "there 's a veritable `` who 's who '' of who did n't call back . other members of 49ers family , like former coach steve mariucci , `` respectfully declined '' to discuss owens ' time in san tension is mutual . when tmz asked owens which team he would represent in canton , he said : `` well , it wo n't be the 49ers . '' the receiver later elaborated in a tweet : `` there 's no loyalty with organizations , so why should i have any . i gave 181 percent to that organization with no reciprocity . ",
        "`` but a handful of his 49ers teammates remain loyal , including at least two , junior bryant and derrick deese , who plan on traveling to owens ' celebration in chattanooga this weekend . `` i want to go back and support him , '' bryant owens certainly fit into the team 's inner circle on wednesday at a memorial for dwight clark at grace cathedral in san francisco . clark , the former 49ers receiver later who became the team 's general manager , drafted owens with a late-third round pick . so owens paid his respects , then stuck around for the private reception , chatting amiably with joe montana and jerry rice , now his fellow hall of , in a phone interview , said owens was a role model for work ethic during his 49ers days . ",
        "he said while many players pay lip service to giving it their all in practice , owens actually did it . and in doing so , owens earned his place among top players ever to play a star-studded position . `` my attitude is that he played hard and he wanted to win , '' bryant said . `` i just know what he did and what he brought . ... anybody who thinks he does n't belong in the hall of fame is just being intellectually dishonest . `` as for those antics ? bryant noted that star receivers , as a demographic , are n't exactly shrinking violets . ",
        "and he said the mild-mannered terrell owens is the one he still sees most often , even now that the cameras are off . when bryant and deese organized a benefit in the bay area for the navy seals foundation last sept. . 11 , owens was there . '' is going to do whatever he can to help former teammates , especially when it comes to a worthy charity , '' said deese , a 49ers offensive lineman from 1994-2003 . `` that 's a side that people do n't know about . he gives a lot . ... if people spent three or four days with him , they would find out that so many of the things that are said or written about him are n't true . ",
        "`` ray brown , now the offensive line coach for the arizona cardinals , blocked for owens from 1996-2001 and had an uncommon bond with the receiver . `` he was from the south , which i liked , '' said brown , an arkansas native , recalling their first meeting . `` he was just a wide-eyed , bushy-tailed dude , ` yes , sir , ' ` no , sir ' dude . `` like bryant , brown realized owens played with an edge . but brown was one of the few players on the team who could get to take it down a notch . ",
        "`` i 'd just appeal to him with kindness and buttered him up , '' brown said by phone monday . `` i 'd just say , ` come on , man , you ca n't do that . ' i thought he was a great teammate . i enjoyed him . worked his butt off and he produced . he should have been a first-ballot guy . '' # # #the hall of fame arranged for this year 's induction class to speak to the media via conference call , another ritual that owens declined . but the six-time pro bowl selection did speak by phone with longtime 49ers beat reporter matt maiocco , now of nbc bay area , who wrote the owens profile for the official induction weekend helps that maiocco knew the shy kid , too . ",
        "in his first full-length profile of owens , for the oakland tribune on aug. . 7 , 1996 , maiocco wrote largely about the receiver 's down-to-earth personality . under the headline , `` mom taught 49ers rookie well , '' he penned these lines : `` owens is n't the sort to blow a large chunk of change on fancy sports cars or other luxuries . he knows not to take instant wealth for granted . ... owens addresses elders as ` sir . ' instead of being an exception , the rookie believes the way he was taught should be a standard for the younger generation . ",
        "` i feel like it 's respectful , ' owens said . `` by 1998 , the kid who eschewed flashy purchases rolled into the 49ers ' practice facility with a white cadillac escalade and the personalized license plate : xposur . but maiocco remembers at least one thing that never changed , no matter whether it was terrell owens or `` he never lied , '' he said . `` he did n't have a diplomatic bone in his body . he was n't going to sugar coat it . he would n't use a filter . `` over the years , owens emerged an extreme case , a player whose behavior was so outrageous that it threatened to undermine his hall of fame talent . ",
        "even eight years after his last snap , his havoc-to-yardage ratio still prevents him from taking a proper did it come to this ? it 's never easy to find answers with someone as complicated as owens , but those who witnessed his personality change during his 49ers days generally choose from the same menu of life-altering events : the jerry rice dynamicowens wore no . 80 while at chattanooga because he idolized the greatest receiver of all time . the 49ers front office saw the connection , too , and it was no coincidence owens ended up in san francisco . ",
        "clark and personnel chief vinny cerrato understood that rice had also been a small-school standout , at mississippi valley state , and figured he 'd be ideal to mentor another diamond in the the most part , it was an ideal pairing . owens had the fire and the discipline to work just as tirelessly as rice , which was no small feat . `` and that 's where you need to give the credit , '' policy said . `` he had this innate sense of wanting to be at the top of the game . he was bent on becoming the next jerry and he never , ever showed a disrespectful side to jerry . ",
        "jerry maintained , shall we say , an almost a fatherly image to him . `` but there was a downside , too . rice was a superstar receiver with an ego to match . at times , he demanded the ball , yelled at his quarterback and fumed at his coaches . as espn the magazine writer , tom friend observed : `` and noticed rice was never vilified for it . he watched rice sign autographs and drive away in a bentley . that 's who wanted to be , dammit . the sooner the better . `` by the time owens took over as the 49ers primary receiver , he 'd learned from his mentor how to grab the spotlight in good times and how to unleash his frustration when things went bad . ",
        "but he lacked rice 's charm and diplomacy , his ability so smooth things out after an outburst . `` exactly , '' policy said . `` to rise to the top takes hard work and talent . but there 's a third element that goes into it in order to maintain your position and bring others along with you . jerry had that third element . call it `` it '' -- call it whatever you want -- but never seemed to have it or develop it . '' taking on the role of the no . 1 guy started a transformation that lacked control , structure , discipline and balance . ",
        "and that 's when things started to head south for him . `` it 's comical now to look back on what owens said in his first camp without rice in the fold . the 49ers saved $ million against the cap by releasing rice and allowing him to go to the raiders in 2001 , and owens practically breathed a sigh of relief that his hero was gone . it could n't have been easy for either man when , in rice 's final home game with the 49ers , it was owens who played the starring role , breaking a 50-year-old nfl record with 20 catches for 283 yards . ",
        "`` i think it was to a point with a lot of his outbursts and the way he wanted the ball a lot , it had become a distraction , '' owens said , as quoted in a san jose mercury story on aug. . 1 , 2001 . `` there were incidents where he got in coach 's face , this and that . that kind of thing happens in the heat of battle . you know , had some frustrations , too . but he made his point in a more subtle way . `` the dallas starin dallas , on sept. . ",
        "24 , 2000 , the receiver twice made infamous runs to the midfield star after a touchdown . the second time , cowboys safety george teague rammed him from behind . it started a melee on the field -- and a team-wide cringe along the 49ers the aftermath of the 41-24 victory , mariucci told the team : `` we 're not going to play that way . we 're not going to win that way . we 're not going to lose that way . '' but owens considered any criticism a betrayal . in his mind , scoring two touchdowns over the dreaded rivals represented a triumph for the 49ers organization -- and now he felt as if no one had his ultimately suspended owens for a week and fined him $ 24,294 , one week 's pay . ",
        "as the coach explained later , he did so as a pre-emptive strike before the nfl office could level even more severe penalties . as deese said : `` mooch was trying to step in and stop something that could have been a lot worse . if it 's the league , it 's maybe three or four games . ... but still did n't like it . he took it personally . `` mariucci told the nfl network in 2017 that he made a tactical error in not having the punitive moves come from the front office or ownership . ",
        "he did it personally , as a coach : `` we had friction from then on , '' he said on the rich eisen fact , 18 years later , owens is still steamed . `` the relationship that i had with mariucci , it was fractured , i think , the day after he suspended me for going to the star , '' owens told maiocco for a added : `` there was so much hoopla and so much media attention around what i did when i went to the star that he felt pressured or compelled to suspend me . ",
        "it was n't that the league suspended me . he suspended me . `` owens ' demeanor was noticeably more surly after that , in the locker room and in the press . ` the $ 10 million catch ` in a playoff game against the green bay packers on jan. . 3 , 1999 , owens dropped four passes and also lost a fumble . but he found young along the sidelines and pleaded , `` steve , believe in me . `` and when the game was on the line , with three seconds left , young found owens at the goal line just as two packers crunched him like wrecking balls . ",
        "the 49ers won 30-27 as owens cried tears of joy under an avalanche of giddy teammates . `` at the bottom of the pile , '' owens said that day , `` i was just saying , ` thank you , jesus . ' `` for owens , it was a boost to his confidence -- and his pocketbook . by the start of the next season , he had a $ million deal that included a $ million signing bonus . `` i called it the $ 10 million catch , '' said his agent at the time , david joseph , `` and the residual may be more than that . ",
        "`` terrell jones , the former strength coach , recalls sitting outside the 49ers defensive meeting room on the day owens attended a press conference to announce the contract extension . jones said he was chatting with conditioning coach mike barnes when owens blew by without saying hi to either of them . they teased him about the snub . '' turned around and he said , ` i hate the way that my money changes people , '' ' jones said . `` we looked at him like , ` what ? we 're just busting your balls for not saying hi . ' ",
        "he turned around and kept walking . we were both like , ` well , this is interesting . '' ` it only got worse from there . `` it seemed like after he signed that contract , that 's when he went downhill , '' jones said . `` he was getting into fights with players . he was getting into fights with coaches . in my eight years , i never saw one player get in more fights with his teammates . there were times when i saw players chase him out of the locker room because they wanted to fight him . ",
        "`` friend , in his profile for espn the magazine , wrote that after the green bay catch , owens began craving attention . the receiver got his teeth fixed , for possible endorsements . he bought stylish clothes . he got a new personalized license plate : catch ii . to a lot of people in the organization , the touchdown had changed the kid forever . `` before the catch , he was terrell owens , '' one source said . `` after the catch , he became `` policy , in our phone interview , also identified the green bay catch as a seminal moment . ",
        "`` now you 've got money , the elevation from a stellar performance in a particular high-profile game , and that combination is all kicking in , '' he said . `` so he had all that energy . it 's kind of like having nuclear energy without any proper controls and safeguards . he just had all of that energy spreading out and it created some significant negative fallout . `` more than one source said that in the wake of stardom and money , owens wanted to operate under a different set of rules , rebelling against guidelines large and small . ",
        "in 2003 , the 49ers struggled with an outbreak of staph infections after a game against the st. louis rams . the centers for disease control advised the 49ers to scrub down their weight room twice daily . along with other safeguards , players were required to wear shirts while working out . `` so was in there one day and i said , ` hey , , you have to put a shirt on . it 's policy , ' '' jones recalled . `` he said , ` well , this is n't 24 hour fitness . ' ",
        "i said , ` yeah , you 're right , but you have to wear a shirt and put a towel down . so he huffed and puffed and started calling me names . ' `` owens eventually relented , but jones said the receiver confronted him again when the workout was over . jones said he let it slide when owens called him an `` uncle tom '' but nearly came to blows when started saying things about his parents . `` my dad died when i was 2 years old , '' jones said . `` and he knew this because i 'd told him before . ",
        "you can say anything you want about me , but do n't say anything about my parents . and i came out of that door and i was pissed ... teammates came to my defense , but that 's the kind of guy he was . if he did n't get his way , he would verbally assault you . `` the media burnplummer said what really flipped owens ' switch was the way the media delved into his early childhood . owens later shared the harrowing details on his own terms , in his autobiography , `` catch this ! '' ",
        "he was born in alexander city , alabama , and mostly raised by a grandmother who was so protective that she allowed terrell to leave the yard only to attend church or school . even when he got a bicycle , he was not allowed to ride it past the his book , he does not recall hearing the words `` i love you '' from his mother or anyone else . most devastatingly , when he was 11 he had a crush on the girl across the street . but the girl 's father instructed him to stay away . ",
        "why ? because that was his half-sister . `` it took me a while to understand that i was talking to my father , '' owens wrote . when he asked his mother why she 'd never told him that the man across the street was his father , she said that `` it was n't necessary to explain everything to me . `` the way plummer remembers it , that story first surfaced in the media after owens divulged the information in a conversation he considered off-the-record . but a writer ran with it anyway , and other outlets followed suit . ",
        "suddenly , the naive and trusting kid was shattered forever , according to plummer . `` he was furious , '' plummer said . `` that was the genesis of his hatred toward the media . i will always believe that had that not happened , would have been a completely different guy . it 's sad . and literally -- for him -- it was n't a bell curve . it was like dropping off of a cliff . `` outside the halldavid baker , the president and ceo of the pro football hall of fame , told that owens ' image will be on banners hanging around the hall 's campus and on the video boards of the main stage . ",
        "baker also said the he welcomes owens any time he 's ready . `` the hall of fame and my successor 's successor will always guard his legacy , just like every hall of famer , '' baker then , owens ' friends from a more innocent time with the 49ers can barely fathom how this joyous occasion turned so sour . in a 2012 interview with gq , owens said that almost all of the $ 80 million he made during his career was gone , swallowed up by bad investments . in a recent tweet , owens said that he did n't `` blow '' through that amount of money but rather `` those that i hired ` mismanaged and misappropriated ' funds . ",
        "through my experiences i continue to share with athletes in and entering into the league to avoid similar circumstances . `` policy , meanwhile , alluded to 's financial situation in recounting his congratulatory phone call . `` i wished him the best and i felt really , really terrible about his state of personal affairs . because he 's kind of up against it , '' he said . `` things are n't going well for him in any way , shape or form . i think he 's kind of depressed and he 's certainly dejected . `` but deese struck a more optimistic note . ",
        "`` i believe this is his day , it 's his honor , and the way he chooses to celebrate it is totally up to him , '' he said . `` i 'm going to support him in any way i can , regardless of where it is . '' "
