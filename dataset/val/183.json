        "santa clara -- coach kyle shanahan and general manager john lynch spent 30 minutes wednesday fielding questions from the media , then for the next hour the 49ers offered up jimmy garoppolo , richard sherman , joe staley and deforest buckner . here are the top three highlights : 1 . the sherman plan : 1 . the sherman plan : sherman is cleared to come back from achilles repair , and the 49ers plan to practice him back-to-back days and then let him recover the next day . sherman said he is 100 percent , adding : `` i never had any doubt . ",
        "... it 's one of those things you allow yourself to really see what you 're made of when you go through things like this , and i appreciated the journey . `` sherman reportedly had a $ 2 million bonus kick in by being medically cleared for camp . he credited not only the 49ers training staff for his rehabilitation but also former los angeles lakers star kobe bryant , who also overcame an achilles tear and gave sherman pointers on how to get a jump on the healing process . `` we trust what he thinks and how he works , '' shanahan said . ",
        "`` a lot of it is up to richard . if he 's being too aggressive , it 's our job to pull him back . `` sherman eased into workouts in june as the offseason program drew to a close , when the seattle seahawks castoff was restricted to individual position drills . `` he 's one of the most intelligent football players i 've ever been around , the way he understands concepts and offense , '' general manager john lynch said . `` he has n't been on the field much but he 's already had a huge impact on the guys around him . ",
        "`` added jimmy garoppolo : `` he 's a very smart , savvy football player . he was here all summer so we got time to talk to each other . just a great mind to get into . `` 2 . offseason headliners : jimmy garoppolo and reuben foster made the most waves this offseason , and both received votes of confidence from shanahan in how they comported for how garoppolo is handling his fame -- see : last week 's tmz report of him dating an adult-film actress -- shanahan blushed and downplayed the matter . `` i 've never in my life commented on a player 's date in july , so i wo n't start today . ",
        "because i do n't think it really matters to us , '' shanahan said . `` but it is a good example that sometimes you have to learn how under the microscope we all are . it 's not just the quarterback ; it 's all players . the quarterback definitely gets more than anyone else . but it 's a good learning experience for him . `` said garoppolo : `` life is different now . my life off the field , i 've never been very public with things . even social media , i 'm not out there a ton . ",
        "but my life 's looked at differently . i 'm under a microscope and , like kyle said , it 's a good learning experience . you just have to take it in stride . it is what it is . `` sherman slid in a joke about garoppolo 's social life when asked what they 've talked about as teammates . said sherman : `` we talk about a lot : the strength and weaknesses of certain defenses , passes that he likes , people he likes to take on dates . . no , we just talk ball and got to know each other better . ",
        "`` in foster 's case , his career was in peril until a san jose judge in april dismissed domestic-violence charges against him , following testimony from his accuser that she fabricated her claim . `` he 's done a great job just handling it , '' shanahan said . `` what they originally charged him with is as bad as a thing you can imagine . that would mess a lot of people up . i was very impressed how reuben handled it , and after it got dropped , how he handled himself since . `` foster has not spoken to the media since his offseason arrests , which resulted in a two-games malcolm smith among injured : within the last week , linebacker malcolm smith sustained an unspecified leg injury and will start camp on the non-football injury list , lynch announced . ",
        "smith missed all of last season after tearing a pectoral muscle a week into training camp . `` something popped up , '' lynch said . `` we 're not concerned about it . we 've looked into it . prudent thing is to give him a couple days at the start to make sure he feels good . `` three players will start on the physically-unable-to-perform list : guard jonathan cooper , wide receiver trent taylor and outside llinebacker dakoda watson . none of the injuries appear major and it sounds as if all three could be activated within the first week . ",
        "by starting camp on pup , they ca n't practice until medically cleared and could miss the first six weeks of the season if they are still on pup come week 1 : also on the nfi list are two draft picks : safety marcell harris and defensive tackle kentavius street , the latter of whom will be out all his rookie year . * * * extra points : -- guard flynn , a favorite among many veterans while he spent last season on injured reserve , re-signed on a two-year deal . defensive linemen willsutton and cedric thornton also were signed . ",
        "waived were safety don jones , offensive lineman jamar mcgloster and defensive lineman blaine woodson . -- lynch does n't sound like he 's actively shopping for a veteran wide receiver in free agency or via trade , stating : `` we 're always looking and trying to improve our team . but we 've been steadfast in that we like our receiving corps . we like having pierre back and working with marquise , trent , kendrick , dante . '' -- all players were due to report wednesday for training camp , ahead of a 1:30 conditioning drill and 6:30 team meeting . ",
        "the first 20 days of which will be held in santa clara before it wraps with two days of joint practices in houston ahead of an aug. . 18 exhibition against the texans . -- wide receiver dante pettis , a second-round pick , is expected to sign wednesday , lynch said . all other 49ers draft picks are under contract . -- sherman , who is on the nfl players association board , said they had a conversation tuesday with nfl officials about the league 's national anthem policy leaving potential discipline up to individual teams . `` we 've started to get suggestions from players and the league has been very open to hearing those suggestions and been amicable to potentially making adjustments to that policy , '' sherman said . ",
        "-- left tackle joe staley , on entering his 12th camp : `` no one in that locker room is saying we 've arrived . we know we have a ton of work to do . we were a 6-10 football team last year . we were pleased how we finished but that 's in the past . '' -- right guard and punter are two starting spots up in the air , shanahan confirmed . whereas joshua garnett and mike person will eventually battle cooper at right guard , the punter competition is a bit of a surprise , as incumbent bradley pinion must stave off jeff locke , who 's apparently more than just a left-footed camp leg . ",
        "-- deforest buckner declined to disclose his sack-total goal , after producing three last season . `` we 're striving for the feeling we had at the end of last year , '' buckner said . `` it 's always a great feeling when you win . we had a taste of it last year and we want it again . '' -- one factor that led to left guard laken tomlinson 's recent contract extension was the need to counter the los angeles rams inside tandem of aaron donald and ndamukong suh , lynch said . . "
