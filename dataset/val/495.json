        "as reporters and admirers swarmed chicago mayoral candidate willie wilson at the cook county building recently , a woman and her son stood near the elevators headed to the second floor . that 's where they would pick up a check from wilson 's charity to help offset their property tax bill . `` it 's a blessing , '' said 80-year-old arlener donaldson who has owned a two-story home in the englewood community since 1979 . wilson 's foundation would be giving her $ 500 toward her property taxes , which were a little less than $ 1,000 . ",
        "on a fixed income and raising foster kids , donaldson manages her finances by juggling . `` i just let some things go until i pay the taxes , '' she said , keeping an eye on the elevators . `` after i pay the taxes , i catch up with the other bills like the water bill and the gas bill and stuff like that . `` easing the pressure of property taxes on homeowners should be a top priority of the next mayor of chicago and governor of illinois . a recent study by attom data solutions , one of the nation 's largest analysts of property tax data , found that illinois residents pay the second-highest property tax rates in the country , behind new jersey residents . ",
        "and despite taxpayers ponying up , hundreds of school districts and other local governments have accumulated billions of dollars in 's got to give . illinois lost more residents last year than any state in the country . property taxes are a primary reason for the property tax system in illinois , and particularly in cook county , needs an overhaul . voters are likely in november to sweep in a new county assessor , frederick `` fritz '' kaegi , who has promised to address the regressive nature of the county 's assessment process . but government spending , which drives property tax levies , is outside his , house republican leader jim durkin , r-western springs , introduced legislation in june that would sunset the state 's property tax code on july 1 , 2019 . ",
        "if his legislation gets signed into law , the next governor and legislature would have about six months to come up with a replacement system . helping local governments deal with pension costs would have to be part of the springfield needs deadlines . yet only a handful of republicans signed on as co-sponsors and no democrats . hello ? is anybody there ? property taxes should not be a partisan issue . all public officials should be working toward a solution . indiana legislators put a question on the november 2010 ballot to amend the state constitution . homeowners are now charged 1 percent of their primary home 's market value unless they approve a referendum to raise taxes higher . ",
        "the caps keep government spending in , the legislature has done little to address local property tax pressure . lawmakers failed to tackle the complex issues that drive local spending -- including pension costs and unfunded mandates -- while sending less money to school districts . school boards then relied on property taxes to fund education . talk about year , harvey became the first municipality to have state revenue owed it garnished because the city was n't making payments to its retiree funds as required . more villages and cities are expected to follow ; a recent report from found more than 200 municipalities failed to make proper payments into their police and fire pension rep. mark batinick , r-plainfield , has suggested local governments consolidate pension funds to reduce administrative costs . ",
        "that idea deserves a harder a new school funding formula approved last year that directs more state money to school districts , local property taxpayers should get some relief . that is , if their districts recognize the duty to ensure new money does n't provoke a spending spree . we 'll , local governments need to streamline , consolidate and shrink . example : mchenry county officials are considering a proposal to reduce the size of the county board from 24 members to 18 . that 's in addition to an percent cut in the tax levy approved last year . ",
        "chairman jack franks also is pushing school districts to reduce their levies . this is leadership that officials in other counties should be his mayoral campaign , wilson has tapped into frustration over property taxes that is gaining traction . people are fed up . handing out checks from his charity is a generous gesture . but it does n't solve the underlying problem of governments over-promising , overspending and over-borrowing . nor does it fix the property tax officials -- state and local , democrats and republicans -- need to prioritize property tax reform as they march toward state and city elections .
