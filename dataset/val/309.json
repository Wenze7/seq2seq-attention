        "san jose -- deputy don morrissey 's resignation was a long-sought victory for embattled sheriff laurie smith , who is seeking her sixth term in office without the support of the rank-and-file officers who belong to the deputy sheriffs ' association . several african-american deputies , as well as the president of the local chapter of the naacp , had called on morrissey to will lose the $ 800 a month stipend that the union paid him to serve . the current vice president of the dsa , roger winslow , will serve as interim president until an election is held later this year . ",
        "in a brief written statement , winslow said the leadership of the group will `` be guided by a steadfast commitment to the safety and security of our members , accountability across our department , and responsive engagement with the diverse community we are privileged to serve . `` in a letter to dsa members late thursday , morrissey said he hoped his resignation would pave the way for the group to win back community trust `` on which every one of our deputies depends . '' `` within our association and the broader law enforcement community , leaders must not only set an example , but demand accountability when we fall short , '' he wrote . ",
        "`` that accountability must start with me . `` the statement was met with strong words late thursday by the sheriff , who criticized morrissey for failing to fully own up to his misconduct . `` mr. morrissey continues to deflect , distort , and distract from his complicity racist , homophobic , and sexually assaultive text messages , '' smith said . `` his latest attempt at reputational self-preservation disparages the entire sheriff 's office with its reckless and unfounded accusation of institutional bias . unbelievably , he then appoints himself as the individual to rebuild trust with the community , trust that he , as an individual , has broken . ",
        "`` give me a break -- the public is a hell of a lot smarter than mr. morrissey gives them credit for , '' the statement concluded , `` and they will see right through his latest smoke screen . `` smith fired lance scimeca , former president of the correctional officers union , shortly after the racist texts first surfaced in 2015 during an unrelated investigation for sending some of the most explicit had been cleared by an independent african-american investigator of sending overtly racist texts , but smith stripped him of his sergeant 's stripes in 2016 on the grounds that he failed to stop the guards and scimeca from sharing the bigoted messages both on the job and off duty . ",
        "morrissey did admit to chiming in -- without using any racist language -- to two strings of messages riddled with racist slurs against vietnamese and texts referred to vietnamese as `` g -- , '' jews as `` k -- , '' and black people as `` n -- '' and `` yard apes . '' in one batch , scimeca and others made numerous references using slurs against blacks and other thinly veiled bigoted remarks like `` happy birthday , buckwheat . '' they also used homophobic and transphobic slurs , as well as images of swastikas and ku klux klan members in pointy white was the second time smith demoted morrissey . ",
        "about five years ago , she knocked him down a notch from lieutenant to sergeant after investigators concluded he had spent more than an hour a day looking at pornography on a work computer and had tried to persuade an employee to conceal the jethroe moore , president of the local chapter of the naacp , said thursday he was pleased morrissey resigned but said more work had to be done to reduce prejudice in the sheriff 's office . the pastor and morrissey had met to discuss the situation prior to his resignation , moore said . morrissey also met with other community leaders . ",
        "`` i 'm glad he stepped down for the sake of the union and the community , '' moore said , adding that he plans to ask county supervisors to institute sensitivity training for sworn officers in the agency . `` it 's a dire need for many of them . `` this news organization first reported the existence of the texts in 2015 , touching off a wave of outrage and horror in the community , which was already reeling from the death of a mentally ill inmate at the hands of three jail guards who were ultimately convicted of murder . ",
        "a trove of new texts surfaced earlier this year and was reported by metro , prompting morrissey to resign as secretary of the peace officers research association of organization had sent out a statement faulting him for not disclosing his involvement in the text scandal , claiming they learned of it through the metro story , even though the information had been readily available since this news organization reported on the arbitration battle six months ago . ------ here are two letters . the first was sent by morrissey to all members of the deputy sheriff 's association about 4 thursday . ",
        "the second was an earlier draft that appears to have gone just to the local branch of the naacp , not the dsa dsa member , over the last several years , our association , indeed all of law enforcement , has been engaged in a long overdue discussion on the need to combat racism , sexism , homophobia and other forms of bias and harassment in our the frontline professionals entrusted to protect and serve a proud and diverse community , i recognize that we must hold ourselves to the highest standard . within our association and the broader law enforcement community , leaders must not only set an example , but demand accountability when we fall accountability must start with me . ",
        "and that 's why today i am announcing my resignation as your association media reports about shameful conduct at our jail have resurfaced in recent weeks , it has been a very emotional time for many of us . at the general membership meeting on the tenth , i was moved by members ' very personal stories , concerns , anger , and left this meeting even more committed to addressing systemic issues regarding bias and the lack of reporting within our department . ",
        "i met with our dsa board in an effort to identify potential procedural reforms , and engaged prominent community leaders for input and assistance in not only addressing issues of bias , but rebuilding the community trust on which every one of our deputies , i believe that each of those steps is not nearly enough , without also giving our department and our association the opportunity to turn the page with new i regret the unfortunate events that brought us to today , i am hopeful that this association will keep working to realize the highest ideals of public service at the heart of our mission , to include eliminating all forms of discrimination and harassment from our department and to improve the level of communication with members and the community as a , don morrissey ------ here is the previous letter : the past few weeks have been very emotional for me and for many of you .",
        "at the general membership meeting on the tenth , i heard the very personal stories , concerns , anger , and frustrations of several of our members . i also heard the complicated feelings of both disappointment and support that moved me the light of the meeting i was even more committed to doing what i could to heal the issues that arose . i met with the dsa board and identified what i thought was an answer to the systemic issues regarding biases and the lack of reporting that still remain at the department . furthermore , i met with prominent community leaders to discuss the issues , my proposed program , and asked for their that said , i have revisited my decision and feel that resigning as president of the dsa may best serve the membership at this am proud of the accomplishments your board and i have made over the past several year . ",
