        "san francisco -- the baseball gods did n't toss him any funky hop on a seemingly-routine ground ball to first opened the door to a two-run eighth inning that played a key role in the milwaukee brewers 7-5 win over the giants at at&t park . the loss dropped the giants back to . 500 as they 're trying to chase down the los angeles dodgers , arizona diamondbacks and colorado rockies in the national league west with 58 games left on the yelich got credited with a hit on the eighth inning grounder , exonerating slater from any blame . ",
        "`` the ball took a bad hop , '' giants manager bruce bochy , who 's played `` 10 to 15 games '' at first with triple-a sacramento this year , got penciled in at the position because the giants sent belt to the 10-day disabled list to recover from a bone bruise in his right knee suffered in seattle said there was n't any structural damage to his knee , which got hyperextended as he was legging out an infield single . `` as far as that goes , that was a win , '' belt was n't necessarily a win for slater , who second guessed whether he made the right play after the game . ",
        "`` i think if i charged it i might have still have had an in-between hop , '' slater said . `` you can always second guess yourself . obviously , what i did was n't the right play . `` after the strange hop , travis shaw , ryan braun and erik kratz strung together consecutive singles off reliever mark melancon , bringing in a pair of runs that broke a 2-2 followed up his blown save in oakland sunday by picking up the loss , surrendering two earned runs on four hits and a walk in 2/3 inning of stratton did n't fair any better in his first appearance since he got recalled from triple-a sacramento earlier in the day . ",
        "stratton allowed the brewers to break the game wide open in the ninth by giving up three earned runs on three hits , including a home run to giants mounted a comeback effort in the eighth , scoring a run before hunter pence struck out with runners at the corners to end the rally . they added two more runs in the also grounded into a double play in the second with no outs and the bases loaded , driving in a run but hindering the giants chances of putting a crooked number on the said the idea of using the last batter on his bench to pinch hit for pence in the eighth never crossed his mind . ",
        "at that point , pablo sandoval was the only option available because the giants added another pitcher to their roster thursday by recalling stratton and sending kelby tomlinson down to triple-a sacramento . `` hunter 's had some pretty big hits , '' bochy said . `` he 's been finding a way to come through when we need him . `` the loss spoiled another quality start from rookie right-hander dereck rodriguez and a respectable showing from evan longoria , who was reinstated from the disabled list thursday . rodriguez surrendered two earned runs off five hits in six innings of work , making him 3-0 with a era over his last seven only eye-popping mistake came in the sixth when yelich led off the inning with a home run on the first pitch to tie the game up at 2-2 . ",
        "`` i was not expecting him to swing , '' rodriguez said . `` he got a good pitch to hit and put a good swing on it . `` longoria , who missed 34 games with a fractured hand , singled in his first two at bats since june 14 , scoring off a steven duggar single in the brewers opened the scoring in the first when eric thames led off with a double and scored on back-to-back ground ball outs to the right side of the pitcher josh hader made his first road appearance since racist and homophobic tweets that he sent out as a high schooler surfaced during the all-star game . ",
        "the left-hander received a round of scattered boos as he replaced starter wade miley with two outs in the sixth , a contrast from the standing ovation he received at miller park saturday . but the response was relatively mild considering that san francisco is the home of the gay rights movement and a bastion of liberal took extra precaution with hader , protecting him with a police officer and a security guard as he warmed up in the bullpen along the right field to the game , hader insisted he 'd be ready for whatever giants fans throw at him , saying he would n't allow his past or the crowd to become a distraction . ",
        "he backed up his words , inducing a ground out to end a giants rally in the sixth before tossing a hitless seventh with two strikeouts . `` i 'm not really expecting anything , '' hader said thursday afternoon . `` whatever they want to say to me , if it 's good or bad , i 'm ready for anything . `` i really do n't know how they will react . i 'm here to do my job and not let any distractions get to me , whether it 's my past mistakes or the crowd .
