        "santa clara -- `` he 's got size , he 's got power and he 's been playing real well , '' coach kyle shanahan said tuesday of taylor . `` so , we were going to do that anyway : give him a chance , because he 's earned it by some of the reps he 's doing . it made it easy with what happened to arik . `` armstead 's prognosis is `` week to week . '' he ended the last two seasons on injured reserve and missed 18 of the past 24 games . three months ago , the 49ers picked up his fifth-year option for 2019 at over $ 9 's insertion to the first-string defense at the `` big end '' spot was a bit surprising -- he leapfrogged ronald blair -- and he handled himself well . ",
        "`` i was , of course , nervous , but it was more of an honor to do that for the organization , '' taylor said . `` i think i did pretty well , with some rookie mistakes . `` the 49ers drafted taylor in the seventh round out of temple , where he played only one full season . he only played one year of high school ball in new jersey . `` i did what i had to do my senior year and i 'm grateful for the 49ers drafting me to show my potential to the world , '' said taylor , noting that veteran earl mitchell is helping him immensely with year ago , the 49ers used a seventh-round pick on another prospect with a limited college film : adrian colbert , who opened his rookie camp as a cornerback before evolving into the starting free safety by year 's taylor this year 's colbert-type success story ? ",
        "`` i did n't come in and say i 'm going to be the next adrian colbert , but big-ups to him for getting a starting spot , '' taylor answered . `` i 'm here to just pave my own way . `` here are nine other items from niners camp : 1 . dominant pass rush ? : taylor 's first-string debut was enhanced by deforest buckner 's dominance in only his third camp . also , pass rushers jeremiah attaochu and cassius marsh are showing their speed , and 2017 top pick solomon thomas has had strong bursts into the confirmed the pass rush has excelled the past two practices after a sluggish debut saturday . ",
        "as for buckner 's improvement , he added : `` he 's taken huge steps forward this year , watching how he moves and his different pass rushes with different tools to use . he has what he was born with : size and power , and that 's where it starts . '' buckner could emerge as the 49ers ' best edge rusher , even though his base-defense spot is on the bucs model : thomas said the 49ers defensive front is `` as close as it 's ever been , as high as it 's ever been , '' and their camaraderie is something they 're trying to mimic from the 2002 tampa bay buccaneers ' super bowl-winning defense that included john lynch . ",
        "`` it 's more of seeing how they rush together and how their chemistry was perfect , '' said thomas , who played hurt tuesday after someone stepped on his left garoppolo picked : it took 58 passes for jimmy garoppolo to have a pass intercepted in team drills this camp , and that theft came tuesday when adrian colbert nabbed a pass over the middle intended for marquise goodwin and returned it for a would-be , 75-yard said the 49ers tinkered with that play-action rep by moving pierre garcon into a different spot . `` the one time we did it , colbert did n't back up , made a great key , '' shanahan said . ",
        "`` he was flat-footed because of the run fake -- then shot his guns , made the catch and got a pick-six , so it was a helluva play by him . `` garoppolo , pressured repeatedly tuesday , still went 14-of-17 and is now 41-of-58 in full-team drills . he fared best in a red-zone drill when targeting running backs jerick mckinnon and matt sherman revisited : beat by marquise goodwin to open sunday 's drills , richard sherman bounced back tuesday with an interception covering pierre garcon in one-on-ones . as for sunday 's video , shanahan replayed it to the team as a lesson , without disparaging sherman 's effort . ",
        "`` he used that as a coaching point , '' fullback kyle juszczyk said . `` he did n't get up there and bash on sherman , like ` we paid you this much and you give us that ? ' it was nothing like that . he actually complimented him , because it was his very first rep in one-on-ones since he was injured , he was aggressive and did n't hesitate . i tried to take that into my one-on-ones and be aggressive . `` 5 . foster dinged : linebacker reuben foster , who battled an assortment of injuries last year as a rookie , dinged his right quadriceps early in tuesday 's session but practiced through the pain . ",
        "he got hurt when colliding on a spin move with juszczyk in a pass-protection drill . `` with charley horses and stuff , guys get banged in their quads a lot . nothing too concerning , '' shanahan health watch : wide receiver trent taylor , guard jonathan cooper , safety marcell harris and linebackers malcolm smith and dekoda watson came off injury lists and participated in position drills but no full-team action . also out for team drills , after tightening up in warmups , were defensive back jimmie ward and linebacker brock guard competition : joshua garnett missed his second straight practice and is `` day to day . '' ",
        "with cooper yet to enter team drills , mike person remained the starter at right guard , and flynn was his person seize the starting job the way brandon fusco did a year ago as an unheralded signing ? person played under shanahan with the atlanta falcons in 2015 . `` he 's familiar with the system , was versatile and was best of the , '' shanahan tight end move : cole hikutini 's impressive camp is on hold after a groin injury , which will keep him out this week . the 49ers thus signed tight end wes saxton , who produced a touchdown catch in red-zone juszczyk on rbs : juszczyk figures to be lead blocking a lot for mckinnon , who he helped recruit in free agency . ",
        "juszczyk has `` a soft spot for a multi-faceted guy '' and says mckinnon sets up blocks well . as for backup breida , juszczyk raved about how he 's become more decisive and better balanced as a rusher . "
