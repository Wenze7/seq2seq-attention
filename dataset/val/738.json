        "there has been a lot of talk about the washington redskins picking either samaje perine or rob kelley for their 53-man roster . realistically , that should n't even be a of the moment , it does n't seem like both samaje perine and rob kelley will make the final roster . the redskins , and jay gruden , in particular , seem content to keep four running backs this offseason . as of right now , two are locks : derrius guice and chris the beginning of the offseason , it seemed possible that both perine and kelley could make the roster , but the redskins are likely to keep a true backup to thompson this year . ",
        "the receiving backs byron marshall , kapri bibbs , and martez carter are all fighting for that role , and it appears that marshall has the upper hand right now . so , with one of those players likely to occupy the fourth running back role , perine and kelley will duke it out for the no . 3 , if that ends up being the competition , the choice should be easy for the redskins . perine should be the choice over kelley barring a massive change during training a rookie , perine had some solid showings . the fourth-round pick earned the starting role halfway through the 2017 season after kelley suffered an injury . ",
        "perine fared well in his first couple of starts before tapering off down the stretch . all told , he had back-to-back 100-yard games and appeared to have the makings of a good power/short yardage back in the those pointing at perine 's lackluster stat line that is a sensible argument . however , it has to be noted that the line perine was running behind was far from full strength , as the redskins were decimated by injuries by the time he got on the field . that definitely cost him some potential yardage , and it stands to reason that he would improve with better 's also worth noting that perine is three years younger than kelley , and that factor ca n't be underestimated given the short shelf life of running backs , especially the very physical for kelley , there 's no doubting that he can be a quality backup option . ",
        "in his first year with the redskins as an undrafted free agent , he ran for 704 yards and six scores and always was able to gain a few yards on every , he regressed badly in his second season , dealing with numerous injuries and averaging yards per carry . even worse , in his final five games , he only totaled 86 yards on 40 carries . and when he was on the field , he looked sluggish and lacked explosive ability . perine is n't particularly explosive either , but his vision is better than kelley 's and he will have a chance to improve with another year in the and perine are n't too different from each other . ",
        "i 'll admit that . but even if all things were equal , perine is younger and has more upside than kelley . that 's not to say that kelley ca n't be a good backup on an nfl team , but perine is just a better fit right now . perine should earn the backup role for the redskins and unless kelley vastly outperforms him in the preseason , nothing will change that .
