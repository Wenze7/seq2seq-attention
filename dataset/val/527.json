        "since it took a pretty big hit back in february with the rest of the market , horton has been mainly flat in 2018 . but that 's all about to change . horton and the rest of the homebuilders have been very bouncy this year . they all took a hit when data showed that home sales in the had fallen . but that data was completely misunderstood . and the hit gave investors a great opportunity to buy shares at a discount . you see , the headline was all investors noticed : `` home sales drop . '' ",
        "but the information in the brief was actually extremely bullish for real estate prices , home sales , and homebuilders . the reason home sales had fallen was because inventories were shrinking . there were n't enough homes to sell to all the buyers . that has continued to be the theme all year , too . and the supply shortage is driving prices up all across the country . those higher prices mean that homebuilders like horton can sell their products for a premium . costs have n't really risen to keep pace with prices . so , that means more profit for the homebuilders on every house they sell . ",
        "and those rising prices and this supply shortage is bringing the builders back online in a big way . as the builders start building , prices will stabilize some . and buyers who 'd been driven out by a lack of choices and extreme competition will step back in . and we 'll start seeing steady growth in home sales , real estate prices , and shares of horton . freddie mac just released its predictions for the second half of 2018 -- and they 're pretty rosy . total home sales are expected to rise by % this year . ",
        "that 's impressive when you consider low supply , high prices , and rising mortgage rates have constrained the market for the first half of the year . but more impressive is that the average sales price is expected to rise by almost 7 % within the last six months of 2018 . that 's a massive increase when you 're factoring in the entire market . and it 'll drive shares in well-positioned homebuilders straight up the charts . so , before the headlines start reading `` home sales soaring '' and the buyers drive horton up , i recommend adding to your position or starting one if you have n't already . ",
        "this stock will erase the loss from earlier this year . and it 'll keep heading up as long as the housing market stays hot . i see at least a few more years of rising demand and prices before things cool off again . let 's make as much as we can while we can . make hay while the sun shines . and make money while the market runs . horton is a `` strong buy '' under $ 45 and the stock should be well above $ 50 by year 's end . by : jason williams in the wealth advisory .
