",
        "as head coach mike zimmer spoke to the media this morning , he made it clear that he 's seen all that he needs to see to know that he 's back . `` i 'll probably see him in the preseason , '' zimmer said . `` it will depend on the situation and where we 're at and things like that . we 've banged him pretty good the last few days so he 'll get some reps.

'' despite cook 's enthusiasm to get on the field next saturday , its unsure how much work cook will get during the team 's full squad workout at tco performance stadium tomorrow night . ",
        "for now , it 's clear that cook is n't holding anything back anymore and is ready to get back on the field for the minnesota vikings . "
