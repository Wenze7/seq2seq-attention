        "a female colorado avalanche fan does n't understand why no one questions her about her favorite colorado avalanche are my team . i love to talk hockey , and i have a couple second-tier favorite teams . however , i 'm an avs fan through and too long ago , a male sports fan sent out a tweet about whether female sports fans were ever dismissed for their opinions . the resounding answer was `` yes . '' woman after woman told stories that pretty much relied on the same theme -- when they expressed their fandom , male fans would quiz them . ",
        "often these quizzes came in the form of `` name five players on that team . '' i 've been involved in the reverse . i challenged a denver post peddler to name one colorado avalanche player if he wanted me to buy the newspaper for its sports coverage . when he came up with `` peter forsberg , '' i told him it needed to be a current player . he was unable to do so , and i walked away without a , i dream about being quizzed . one woman detailed a scenario in which she asked the bartender to turn the tv to a hockey game , and he stated he 'd only do so if she could , you guessed it , `` name five players on the team . '' ",
        "i 've walked into a local sports bar after clothes shopping -- with copious shopping bags in hand -- and asked the bartender to change the television to `` any hockey game . '' when asked which one , i remarked that i did n't care because the avs were n't playing . i got the nhl network highlights , which was good enough because this was a football-centric why-oh-why did n't the bartender , or other male hockey fans , challenge me ? to be clear , you do n't have to worry about challenging me in the comments section -- that 's happened plenty of times . ",
        "i do n't get challenged on twitter so much as dismissed -- though tom hunter of mile high hockey `` helps '' me via dms every now and again . but ... i dream about a man asking me in person to name five players on the colorado avalanche . imagine ! i could move down the lines , adding anecdotes and opinions along the way : `` the first line consists of nathan mackinnon , mikko rantanen and gabriel landeskog . mackinnon -- who does n't like to be called mack -- and rantanen had career seasons . landeskog 's was his second-best , after the golden why not us year . ",
        "now , the second most consistent line was the checking line consisting of ` long beach native ' matt nieto , carl soderberg and blake comeau , now of the dallas stars ... '' somewhere along the lines i 'd transition to prospects : `` right now our most promising prospect who 's actually signed with the team is conor timmins , who is not suffering from concussion syndrome , but that upper ankle sprain is worrisome . well , timmins is n't going to win any skating contests , but if he can score at even a quarter of the rate he did at major juniors ... '' i might even get a little pugnacious and challenge , `` can you name all seven pieces we received in the matt duchene trade ? '' ",
        "a few years ago , i did get the question , `` who 's your favorite player ? '' like i 'm a kid . i 'm prepared even for that question now : `` all around , my favorite player is erik johnson . he 's the cornerstone of the avs ' defense . however , if we 're talking favorite rookie , i 'm going with tyson jost . on any given night , the colorado avalanche suited up four or five rookies last ceiling . i just think jost 's ceiling is the highest . now , if the avs are down by one or two late in the third period , i 'm all for playing mr. clutch , tyson barrie . ",
        "on the power play , he 's swiss cheese , though , and i prefer mr. cool-as-a-cucumber sam girard ... '' i dream so much about these situations recurring that i 've even tried to trigger them . for example , on memorial day a non-hockey friend of mine and i walked into local hockey bar sobo . it was the first game of the stanley cup finals . i was n't geared up as a hockey fan , though , because my friend and i had just been doing memorial day , i cozied up to the bar and spied a caps fan . ",
        "i nodded at him and asked , `` are your boys going to get it done tonight ? '' he gave me a serious answer . he was wrong -- the caps lost game 1 -- but he gave me a serious tried even harder later . i introduced the topic of hockey in the most vacuous approach , by commenting on players ' hair . the marine-looking dude i was talking to grunted and asked , `` do you think las vegas is going to win the stanley cup ? '' i went off on a rant about why washington 's winning was the better story until the marine acquiesced and changed the topic to a while , i had thought that male sports fans in colorado were simply more enlightened . ",
        "i placed credit with the denver broncos . i figured that , since broncos fandom was something of a religion here in colorado , male sports fans just expected female fans to be conversant in , i asked some of my female avalanche friends if that was their experience . it was not . for the most part , guys who knew them valued their opinions . but random guys did , why is my experience so different ? well , i think a large part of the reason is my work on this site . believe it or not , i actually do a lot of research on the colorado avalanche for posts here . ",
        "i retain that knowledge , and i can spout it off whenever . in other words , i 'm as ranty in public as i am on this think a lot of it is my approach , too . i 'm the one bringing the topic up , so dudes figure it 's a topic i like and can talk about . and , to be fair , i may have a pretty active resting bitch , it could just be that i do n't notice any condescension . i 'm getting to talk hockey , so i do n't care if the dude is taking me seriously or not . ",
        "in fact , more often than not , i go into so much detail , that the male fan backs off and states , `` i 'm really more into football . '' i 've gotten so used to that situation that , recently , when i started talking about going to the colorado avalanche 's prospect development camp , the male fan went straight to shane bowers . i perked up , thinking , `` finally ! an in-depth conversation ! '' he may well have been challenging me , but i did n't care -- i had opinions i wanted to about it , though , dear reader ? ",
        "would you like me to name five players on the colorado avalanche or tell you who my favorite is ? please ? i 've been studying for this pop quiz for some time . "
