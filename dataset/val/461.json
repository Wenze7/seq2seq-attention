        "he has excelled at every job he 's ever held at papa john 's -- from being an hourly customer service rep , to a delivery driver , store general manager , director of operations , franchisee and most recently president . '' olivia kirtley was unanimously elected as the board chair , replacing you . did you vote for kirtley , and what do you think of her ? schnatter : yes , i did vote for her , but i have some concerns about olivia . i think the board 's behavior is reckless . it 's hasty , i do n't think it 's well thought-out , i do n't think it 's in the shareholders best interest and not in the board 's best interest . ",
        "i 'm very concerned that olivia kirtley and mark shapiro will do to papa john 's what shapiro did to six flags . note : according to news accounts in the deal , the sister publication of thestreet , as six flags inc. . ceo , shapiro inherited the problem of significant debt at six flags as a result of an acquisition spree in the 1990 's . the company tried to avert a bankruptcy filing , but could not . it emerged from bankruptcy in april 2010 and changed its name to six flags entertainment corp. . shortly thereafter , shapiro was abruptly replaced as ceo and no explanation for his departure was given , according to a reuters story . ",
        "according to a source close to the company , schnatter recruited shapiro to be a board member . he 's been an independent director for seven years . a ` bro ' culture , a hostile workplace toward women , at papa john 's was reported in a july 19 forbes article . is that true ? schnatter : when i was there up till the end of ' 16 , i did n't see anything that was close to what the forbes article said . after digging into this , and by the way , i would n't have tolerated it , not for one second . ",
        "everyone in the building knows i would n't have tolerated the nonsense that was going on . where that 's coming from is that there 's a department called ost , operation specialists training , run by edmond heelan . and therein lies the problem . edmond is steve ritche 's right-hand man . you look at the vulgar language , the disrespect toward women , the promiscuous behavior , the nefarious behavior , it all comes out of edmond heelan . ost was an arm away from anything i would have seen . should i have seen it ? ",
        "yes . did i sense something was going on ? yes , but i had no idea it was to the degree of just bad behavior , rude , crude and unacceptable that it was . externally , it 's called ost . internally , it 's called the club . they have a bond that they will protect each other no matter what . it 's a clique , it 's a frat , a fraternity , mostly made up of men , with some women , and all are papa john 's employees . note : attempts by thestreet to reach heelan were unsuccessful . ",
        "any regrets ? schnatter : any regrets ? i do n't like this situation any more than anyone else does . i would have done anything in my power to keep this from happening because it 's not good for my employees . what 's the upside in all this for you ? schnatter : i 'm not real worried about me right now . if i take care of the employees , the franchisees , the customers , and i 'm good to my communities , i 'll be fine . is there an upside for the company ? ",
        "i sure hope so , because i own 30 % of the company . papa john 's declined thestreet 's request to speak with ritchie , kirtley , shapiro and heelan or to respond to schnatter 's comments . "
