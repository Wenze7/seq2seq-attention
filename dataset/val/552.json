        "she 's the character many love to hate on orange is the new black . but piper chapman has gotten an undeserved bad you look on any number of orange is the new black websites , you wo n't see a lot of love for piper . in fact , some have gone so far as to say she should n't even be on the show ! depending on your own life experience , piper may seem at times whiny and privileged , which is pretty for some of us , she 's a very relatable character . for some of us who struggle with the simplest things -- like , say , germs , insects and anything gross -- piper 's difficulty adjusting to prison life without no flip-flops makes perfect sense . ",
        "of course , those of us who relate to her may be whiners too and not even realize aside , piper has many good qualities . despite what some have said , the series would n't be the same without point of view factortoday , oitnb features a diverse ensemble cast , where many different perspectives are represented . but in the beginning , the story was about a white yuppie woman having to leave her comfortable life of diet cleanses and bath products to go to prison . based on the true story of piper kerman from her book , orange is the new black , the show took us into prison life from her point of view . ",
        "just as it would be different if everything had been told from tasha 's point of view , this is piper 's if oitnb were n't based on a true story , her privileged background makes sense . from a writer 's point of view , this type of character would seem to have the most difficult time adjusting , creating endless opportunities for conflict and even could have been shopping at pottery barn one day and then found herself suddenly being strip-searched by a no-nonsense prison guard the next . piper helps those of us who would have never given it a second thought to understand the isolation and dehumanization of prison own brand of intelligencein the very beginning , piper makes an off-handed critical remark about red 's food . ",
        "so red begins to starve her . meal after meal , piper is n't a result , piper tries the only approach that has ever worked in the world she comes from : talking it out and apologizing . but this wo n't work here . red explains why , even feeling somewhat sorry for her . once piper 's perceived as weak , she will be piper has to do something nice for her , something that will show red 's followers why she deserves to be back in red 's good graces . and piper is resourceful . ",
        "using chewed up jalapenos , she 's able to make a lotion for red 's sore back , something similar to what piper had sold in her artisanal bath product line . it 's a long shot , but it have to admit that a woman whose biggest concern is the size of her engagement ring does n't seem a likely candidate to survive prison . but as with everything else , piper is an she tries on the tough persona to survive . yeah , she goes overboard , but she 's what she thinks she has to . ",
        "speaking of overachieving , say what you want about her , but when piper commits to something , she goes all , the nasty underwear business may have been ill-advised , but it does work ! you have to admire her pluckiness . even in season 6 , she 's still trying to make the best out of a bad straight society often only sees women who love women as butch , it 's nice to see a character who could be on the cover of better homes and gardens . nothing teaches mainstream society more about lgbt characters than to turn stereotypes upside-down . ",
        "granted , piper seems closer to being bisexual . the object of piper 's affection , the jet-setting lesbian alex , might also not show up on anyone 's gaydar . alex is a beguiling character who leans a little on the goth side . piper and alex 's relationship is sweet , twisted , and frustrating , like so many real-life matter what anyone says , the sparks between these two generate enough heat to power the entire series , even if sometimes they make you want to bang your head against a gatewaypiper is the intro character in season 1 . ",
        "because of her , we go on a journey in subsequent seasons that includes characters not seen enough on either the big or small screen : black women , hispanic women , women over the age of 40 , lgbt women , and women with mental and terminal is so important because we 're living in a pack-like society where your social media tends to be filled with friends who look like you and who share your political views . granted , for some of us it would be too stressful to argue politics every day when all we want is to play candy because of these packs , we tend to live in a bubble where our own ideas are constantly reinforced . ",
        "those of us who could relate more to piper have had our eyes opened to others ' life experiences that differ from our even though piper is sometimes the over-the-top cheerleader amidst inmates who are trying to fashion weapons out of toothbrushes , remember that she has opened many viewers ' eyes to the realities not only of prison , but also of minorities trying to survive in this all of that , she 's a character worth rooting for .
