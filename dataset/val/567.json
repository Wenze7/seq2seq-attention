        "the bears returned to training camp saturday morning at olivet nazarene university while the hall of fame celebration for brian urlacher crescendoed 400 miles away in canton , days removed from the exhibition opener , coach matt nagy detected a lull in his team , noting that 27 players who were held out of the game effectively had three days without football . `` this is n't an offense where you can skip days , '' nagy said . `` you 've got to stay in it , stay on your details . otherwise you come out and have a sloppy practice , and i thought today was a little sloppy . ",
        "`` apparently , having a dj mix hip-hop music throughout practice was n't enough for players to summon sharp play . although it might have been even sloppier if the mix had its usual share of sugar ray and lenny kravitz . for what it 's worth , the dj was a welcome change and significant are five observations from practice . keep in mind these are just snapshots of players ' work to improve . they 're trying new techniques and testing themselves in competitive situations , all in the pursuit of mitch trubisky was out of rhythm at times and inconsistent with his ball registers under nagy 's description of practice . ",
        "early on , trubisky checked down to the flat but threw it at the feet of jordan howard , who had to go to the ground to catch it . several dropbacks would have been sacks if contacting the quarterback were permitted . the ball did n't always come out on time . trubisky was not available to reporters , but nagy implied a general lack of sharpness due to the overthrew tarik cohen deep down the left sideline during seven-on-seven drills . he stayed after practice to work on his deep throws . the important fundamental on the deep ball is a balanced base , nagy has said . ",
        "that enables a proper shoulder swing and was intercepted twice , although neither pick seemed to result from an ill-advised or poorly executed throw . both passes hit tight end daniel brown in the hands . one drop was intercepted by danny trevathan . on the other , safety eddie jackson got his hand in the catch point , ripped the ball out , and john timu caught the floating eddie jackson continues to flash around the line of second-year safety is equipped with instincts and range to be a major contributor to the pass defense , as evidenced by his breakup that resulted in an interception . ",
        "but he also is flashing more in the box this summer , a relatively new layer to his team drills saturday , he would 've sacked trubisky on a bootleg attempt if he were allowed to tackle the quarterback . last week during live tackling drills , he was aggressive fitting against the run . `` i 'm more comfortable -- aware of the playbook , formations and different adjustments , '' jackson said . `` i just want to be a player that can work on both , with the ball in the air and also when it 's on the ground . ",
        "`` his increased comfort and broader knowledge base enables him to read things better , he said . `` timing up snaps , timing up blitzes . run fits -- when the guard pulls , different fits against that . it 's coming more naturally now . `` jackson is most valuable in pass defense because his skills are relatively rare compared with those of a box safety . but the more he can do near the line of scrimmage , the more the bears could vary his positioning and increase the unpredictability of his leonard floyd showed up in team drills with a has had a quiet camp . ",
        "he has been on the field consistently -- a significant check mark -- but there has n't been a surplus of explosive plays to make him stand out . of course , floyd missed almost all of spring practices recovering from right knee surgery . even though he insisted july 27 that he 's fully healthy , it was helpful tuesday to hear defensive coordinator vic fangio 's perspective when he said , `` leonard is fighting through his recuperation . `` with that as the subtext , floyd 's game performances merit close attention during the preseason . the bears ca n't afford to have him at less than full strength . ",
        "not only are they not deep enough at outside linebacker , but they need players of his pedigree to perform up to those it was encouraging for the bears that floyd used an outside speed rush to get around the right side of the offensive line and disrupt trubisky in team drills . on a rep before that , floyd tried to swim inside right tackle bobby massie and did so with a noticeable burst , but massie rode floyd into right guard kyle long while trubisky got the ball what it 's worth , floyd seems to be moving ok in coverage too . ",
        "there 's a month until the season , so let 's see if the explosive plays start to slot receiver allen robinson made a catch on an out-breaking route , but not before he ran into another receiver intermediate-level throw from trubisky and catch by robinson were positives . but robinson ran into the back of a teammate 's legs , and it disrupted both . here 's guessing the route combination was n't drawn up that benny cunningham 's patience produced a long veteran running back set up pulling center eric kush 's block by slowing his outside run and letting kush get out in front of him . ",
        "cunningham then hit the hole with some burst and got to the second 30-yard run around the left edge in thursday 's game against the ravens was a bit different . he captured the edge partly because receiver benny fowler won his block from a tight split . also , the safety vacated the area downfield because of end-around play-action to josh 's value as a running back is important to the offense 's personnel puzzle because it will allow nagy to deploy cohen as a receiver . when jordan howard needs a break , the bears wo n't necessarily hand the ball to cohen . ",
        "they can mix it up by bringing cunningham into the backfield and letting cohen continue doing his thing as a report : cornerback cre'von leblanc , safety deon bush , center hroniss grasu and linebacker aaron lynch sat out . center james daniels and linebacker joel iyiegbuniwe were said there 's nothing new to report regarding rookie holdout roquan smith . the bears have only two full-speed practices before their next exhibition game thursday against the bengals .
