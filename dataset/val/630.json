        "las vegas -- because even while playing down his latest riff , this time with cj mccollum of the portland trail blazers , the warriors star made it clear he will fiercely defend his reputation . `` i say something back and i 'm the sensitive one ? '' durant said after a spirited team usa practice at unlv . `` i mean , i know you 're all trying to make me look crazy and strip me of my credibility . i see what you 're doing . but i 'm going to keep standing . `` durant and mccollum mixed it up on twitter on wednesday , with mccollum questioning durant 's decision to leave the oklahoma city thunder to sign with the warriors in 2016 . ",
        "the blazers guard called it `` soft '' and compared it to switching sides in a fight . he 'd already told durant that personally when he was a guest on the `` pull up with cj mccollum '' fired back on twitter with : `` u think that low of me cj ? i just did your podcast . snakes in the grass boy , i tell ya . '' he capped off that exchange with a laughing his informal press gathering thursday , things began on a lighthearted note . the question referenced `` the incident yesterday with cj . '' ",
        "`` cj who ? '' durant replied . `` oh , mccollum . what happened yesterday ? `` thus began something of an abbott & costello routine , with the reporter dancing around the subject while durant let him : is that all in fun ? durant : what did you think it was ? reporter : it seemed a little more : why ? reporter : just because it seemed like you were : why me ? reporter : because of what he had : so why is n't he upset ? reporter : he does n't seem to be : so why am i upset then ? ",
        "this went on for quite some time . finally , the nine-time all-star vented some frustration over a repeated pattern . the way durant sees it , everybody else can take potshots at will . but if durant pipes up ? it 's a media sensation , with him in the villain 's role . `` i go about my business , '' the nba finals mvp said , `` but every time i say something , house of highlights and bleacher report run with it . ... everybody runs with it . `` now people come to me and say , ` damn , man . ",
        "i did n't know you were so cool ' when they meet me in person . why ? because of what y ' all say . and that goes for everybody around here . ... i just talk . i say how i feel . but i guess i 'm the bad guy . `` mccollum is on the team usa roster but was among a handful of players who did not participate in the 2-hour practice thursday . many of durant 's warriors teammates also chose to miss this two-day camp , for various reasons . stephen curry earlier this month announced that he would spend this time with his family , including his newborn thompson and draymond green , meanwhile , made the late decision to not participate .
