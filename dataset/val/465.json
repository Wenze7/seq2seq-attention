",
        "`` it just speaks to how revolutionary the iphone 's been . `` while wall street and the world watched for apple to reach the $ 1 trillion market capitalization early thursday , the company apparently managed to get a little ahead of itself in marking the milestone . apple 's own stocks app inadvertently reported apple hitting a $ 1 trillion market cap before its shares actually reached the $ level that made that historic market value a reality . the cause of the glitch reportedly was that the app did n't reflect the latest company filing showing that apple had bought back more of its shares , which meant its stock price had to hit a higher share-price threshold than was necessary under the previously reported count of outstanding shares . ",
        "apple 's stocks app , which is built in to the company 's iphones , reportedly pulls data from yahoo finance as its source of stock price apple did get to the $ 1 trillion market value soon afterward , it was n't the first corporation worldwide to reach that market capitalization . chinese oil giant petrochina co. . did it first in 2007 . but petrochina 's trillion-dollar market capitalization was short-lived , and it 's now trading at a market value of around $ 214 billion , forbes reported petrochina 's speculative explosion that propelled the oil company to the trillion-dollar pinnacle , apple 's climb has been a slow , steady advance built on consecutive quarters of solid growth .

        "the final push followed apple 's strong fiscal third-quarter earnings and good revenue guidance for the fourth quarter on has paved the way for other technology companies , like amazon , to reach the summit , according to analysts . `` silicon valley would n't be what it is today without apple , '' said ives .

        "`` they extracted more revenue and more profit from the most incentivized customers in the market , '' said keybanc capital markets analyst andy hargreaves . `` as for the wearables , after early stumbles and not knowing quite what to do , apple hit its stride . they added increments of growth surrounding the iphone . `` however , geopolitical risks in the near term have the potential to derail some of apple 's momentum .

        "`` my proof points are south korea and their increase in tax of a few years ago and russia , where there was a crackdown on import duties between 2010 and 2012 , '' said milanesi . `` in both occasions , prices grew , and the market slowed down for a few quarters before picking back up . `` analysts suggested apple 's new market cap record will have almost no impact on the company 's day-to-day operations or its consumers . furthermore , they said they do n't expect the milestone to galvanize investors to sell or buy more apple shares . ",
        "`` from a day-to-day perspective i am sure it is business as usual , '' said milanesi . `` does it matter for apple ? sure , it proves that investors believe in the path they are on , especially given some of the bets they made with iphone x pricing and the focus on services . `` but analysts noted that apple reaching the trillion-dollar market capitalization does have some significance . `` i 'd be a fool to say there is literally no importance to it , '' said hargreaves . `` it is a notable moment .
