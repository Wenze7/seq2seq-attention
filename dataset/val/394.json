        "with the opening practice of dallas cowboys camp taking place this evening , it 's only fitting to predict the standout players of the the camp standouts would seem like a cut and dry exercise . the natural tendency is to choose the most accomplished player in each position , the reality is not always so black and white . playing time differences , veteran rest days , and added competition often provide performance practices and preseason games have different attributes , a more productive way to handle this is naming the position standouts for each further ado , let 's jump right into predicting which players will shine in mvp -- dak prescottpreseason mvp -- cooper rushanalysis : will get the bulk of practice snaps . ",
        "he 's yet to become a consistently accurate practice player , but neither have his back-ups . in preseason games , rush and rookie mike white will split the majority of snaps . rush proved to be a gamer lighting up the preseason last august . expect more of the same throwing to a deeper , more competitive receiver backpractice mvp -- ezekiel elliottpreseason mvp -- darius jacksonanalysis : again the running back starter is far more talented than the substitutes . even with limited snaps , ezekiel elliott will steal the show in practice . just as rush excelled last year , jackson was the preseason rushing star in 2016 . ",
        "behind a shuffling offensive line , the more complete , veteran back-up will outperform bruising rookie bo receiverpractice mvp -- cole beasleypreseason mvp -- michael gallupanalysis : covering cole beasley has been the most grueling task in camp practices for two years running . without the defense scheming to stop him , the single coverage beatings will continue . with key veterans allen hurns , beasley , tavon austin and terrance williams receiving limited snaps , a new face will emerge in games . gallup will get ample work to prepare for a regular season role . the rookie will deliver with excellent route running and great endpractice mvp -- blake jarwinpreseason mvp -- rico gathersanalysis : jarwin is the best receiving threat of the group and will produce the biggest receptions . ",
        "geoff swaim ` s blocking will be huge for the season , but that aspect rarely gets much fanfare in summer practice . august is do or die for gathers in dallas . he should receive ample game opportunities to produce as the cowboys decide whether to continue the project or cut linepractice mvp -- zack martinpreseason mvp -- marcus martinanalysis : both starting defensive tackles will miss much or all of camp . zack martin will have the advantage to rule practice . jihad ward may provide a test , but he 'll wreck the lesser subs . ol starters play a decent amount in games , but back-ups get the bulk of work . ",
        "former 49ers starter martin will prove to be a road grader against inexperienced linepractice mvp -- demarcus lawrencepreseason mvp -- kony ealyanalysis : demarcus lawrence will be the most talented defensive lineman at practice by far . his franchise player designation says as much . war daddies do n't retreat in practice . newly signed kony ealy will get heavy game snaps to cement a reliable rotational role . with 15 sacks in 19 career starts , he should whip opposing backup mvp -- jaylon smithpreseason mvp -- chris covingtonanalysis : sean lee will receive limited snaps , while jaylon smith will be blinded by spotlights . ",
        "fortunately , he 's got everything to prove and will do so loudly . some caution will be used with leighton vander esch 's game minutes , so i 'll go with the wildcard rookie covington to lead in game mvp -- chidobe awuziepreseason mvp -- duke thomasanalysis : jourdan lewis is the best cover corner , but will face receiving mvp beasley often in the slot . chidobe awuzie will draw easier outside match-ups to nudge out lewis . thomas excelled with extended game snaps last summer and will turn heads mvp -- xavier woodspreseason mvp -- xavier woodsanalysis : xavier woods will take a big step and emerge as the best safety on the team . ",
        "well , unless no big names are added soon . with only three safeties good enough to make the final cut , woods will outshine all others even on limited game snaps . "
