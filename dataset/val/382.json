        "the prolific rogue one writer was queried about a number of subjects for jedi news in recent whitta is a busy man . he is known to most of us as a co-writer on the movie rogue one : a star wars story . his contributions to the star wars cannon run further however ; he has written episodes of the animated series star wars : rebels , has contributed to the anthology novel star wars : from a certain point of view , and most recently turned his talents to the marvel comics adaptation of star wars : the last was recently interviewed by mark alders of -- and held forth on many subjects of interest to us fans . ",
        "as we all know here , the series has different appeals to different people , and entwine with personal histories in unique ways . when asked what star wars means to him , whitta had this to say : for me it 's always been a boundless source of creative inspiration and just sheer magical escapism and joy . the first time i saw the original star wars i had the same reaction that so many film-makers of my generation had ; that beyond being transported by the film , i immediately knew that whatever it was making me feel -- that sense of awe and wonder -- i wanted to pursue a career that would allow me to give that to other pull that these outsized and mythic tales holds on the popular consciousness has created a devoted and mobilized fan base . ",
        "the overall effect of this , in my opinion , is a net positive exchange between the creators and devotees . however , every now and again differences in expectations can lead to friction . the most recent -- and discussed -- fandom friction is that of the function of the last jedi in the context of the sequel trilogy , a subject on which whitta does not mince words on : i suspect that i would have written a more fan service-driven film that would have appeased some of that noisy minority but ultimately would have been a lesser and less important film because of it . ",
        "frankly i 'm disgusted by the treatment that rian has received , he 's not just one of the most talented film-makers working today but one of the nicest people you could ever hope to meet in any walk of life , and both he and the film he made deserve far words from a writer deeply embedded in the creation and mythos of star wars . having been accepted into the lucasfilm family whitta now turns his attentions to bringing the last jedi from the silver screen to the sequential art format . ",
        "when asked what that process is like -- and what freedoms he felt he could take -- he answered : lucasfilm were very insistent that the comic not just be a straight replay of the movie in comics form , but that i try to find different ways to approach the existing material and to add new things that would give readers a different experience than the film itself ... a lot of the stuff i 've added or interpreted is really very minor but because it 's star wars even little things are a big deal so something as minor as giving admiral ackbar a final moment before he died was received in a major -- and i 'm glad to say very positive -- way by the entire interview is deeply interesting and well worth a read for the insight hungry fan .",
        "in the run up to the concluding chapter of the star wars saga , any and all insider information will prove wars : the last jedi comic adaptation is in stores now . "
