        "you 're taking a 12-question biology test . you get 10 questions right and 2 questions wrong . you decide , `` i 'm stupid . '' you tell a joke that your friends do n't quite get . you decide , `` i always play the fool . '' your boyfriend breaks up with you . you decide , `` i 'm unlovable . '' when we lack self acceptance we bully ourselves into a rigid pursuit of perfectionism . we mercilessly judge , critique and flog ourselves into an impossible quest that dooms us to failure , guarantees unhappiness , and even induces physical and mental health problems . ",
        "according to richard holden 's book , `` happiness now ! '' , `` happiness and self acceptance go hand in hand . '' here are some suggestions for finding self acceptance : laud your strengthsmany people scrutinize perceived weakness and are dismissive of their strengths . the more we think about these shortcomings , the more ingrained they become , until they cast a long shadow over our merits . you can focus on your virtues and abilities by writing them down . if you 're struggling to write a list , simply write down one thing a day . ",
        "you can begin with something simple , such as , `` i 'm compassionate . '' as the list grows , the old script withers . you 'll start recognizing your strengths , such as intelligence , creativity , problem solving and leadership . reinforce your self-esteem by listing the challenges you 've surmounted , the goals you 've achieved and the lives you 've touched . keep adding to this yourselfit 's often easier to forgive others than to forgive ourselves . past regrets can hobble our pursuit of self-love . forgive yourself and move on . learn from your mistake , use it as an opportunity for growth and remember that you ca n't change the past . ",
        "remind yourself that you 're not that person anymore . if guilt bubbles up , tell yourself , `` when i made this decision i did n't know what i know now . '' silence your inner criticour brain is wired with negativity bias , a type of radar that seeks out negativity in order to protect us . this early warning system served our prehistoric ancestors well when a predator was looming . now , however , our brain vilifies minor things such as a misplaced set of keys , a bad haircut -- triggering our inner critic to pounce on and magnify small infractions one hundredfold . ",
        "when the inner critic throws a tantrum , manipulating you to believe , `` if i lose , i 'm a failure , '' it can help to repeat a calming , supportive mantra such as , `` i 'm only human and i 'm doing the best i can with what i know right now . '' the critic thrives on black and white statements . take comfort in the fact that our errors and shortcomings can be positively regarded as chances for growth and acceptance of about impressing otherswe often fixate on finding acceptance by `` looking good '' to others , and beat ourselves up if their reaction is lukewarm or nonexistent . ",
        "we seek their validation that we 're smart , accomplished , lovable , and base our own assessments of ourselves on theirs . this also puts us in a miserable place of your path to acceptance of yourself , know that if you cater to others and try to do so without failing or having missteps , your fear of mistakes will make you live so hesitantly that you 're not really living at all . what you can achieve has nothing to do with what others think is possible for kind to yourselfmany people refuse to allow themselves even a morsel of kindness because they believe that it is selfish , undeserved or a sign of weakness . ",
        "weakness , however , is part of being human . when you love yourself you discover acceptance of yourself . accepting yourself germinates when you love yourself because of your flaws , not despite do n't have to swim the english channel , marry a rock star , or write a bestseller for your achievements to have meaning and value . what about the rose bushes you nurtured that finally burst into blossoms ? or your diligent couponing that slashed $ 30 off your last grocery bill ? how about the first time your child tied his shoes ? when you acknowledge the small stuff , these achievements build upon each other to strengthen your sense of competence and confidence . ",
        "in his book , `` the power of habit , '' pulitzer prize-winning journalist , charles duhigg says , `` research has shown that small wins have enormous power and influence disproportionate to the accomplishments of the victories themselves . '' we -- not the outside world -- can be our own worst enemies , sabotaging acceptance of ourselves with grueling self-judgment , criticism and loathing . as a result , we do n't grow , and our world becomes smaller and smaller , constricting like a noose around our neck . happily , this does n't seal your acceptance is your birthright , and these tips can help you achieve it .
