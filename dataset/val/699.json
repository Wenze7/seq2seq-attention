        "here are five observations from bears practice friday , their second straight session in pads . remember , these are snapshots of players working to improve , and they deserve our analytical leeway in the accuracy on pitches and shovel passes was a point of emphasis for quarterback mitch 's no secret that matt nagy 's offense involves a variety of pitches and tosses by the quarterback . they require impeccable timing and accuracy to maximize the speed of bears players , the precision and design of their blocking and the impact of any misdirection on the might recall how the 2017 chiefs , for which nagy was the offensive coordinator , found great success in the shovel pass to three-time pro bowl tight end travis kelce . ",
        "well , trubisky will have to master that pass the same way quarterback alex smith process is ongoing . on friday during the install period , nagy had trubisky and the offense get back in the huddle and redo a rep of a tight end shovel pass . there are certain elements of the play that trubisky must sell in addition to executing his pass with the proper footwork , timing and accuracy . success of the play , nagy says , is in the in practice , trubisky tossed an option pitch behind jordan howard , placing the ball on his back hip or butt instead of out in front of him . ",
        "howard turned his body but did n't catch it , and it resulted in a fumble . `` you have to be accurate , '' nagy said . `` and you get bigger guys , bigger running backs , tight ends , guys that have these bigger shoulder pads -- if you throw anything behind them on the hip , it slows them up , and now it 's a catch tackle . `` in terms of putting on him , right in front of him , do they have a guy trailing him ? are they running free ? ",
        "we teach that pinpoint accuracy . he 'll get a feel for who these guys are , what their speed is . there were some inaccuracies today , but that 's kind of natural , and he 'll keep getting better at that . `` for me , trubisky 's best throw of the morning was a deep shot to rookie receiver anthony miller , who ran a double move and was open behind cornerback kyle fuller . whether fuller was supposed to have help was n't evident , but trubisky 's timing with miller was perfect , and the ball was out in front of him for a sure was intercepted by safety deiondre ' hall on a pass that was tipped by a defensive lineman . ",
        "he has been intercepted in all four padded trubisky is doing some things well that are n't evident to those of us unfamiliar with details of the trubisky has had obvious successes and growing pains in every practice , it 's imperative we remember that the quality of his performance in games will depend on elements to which we , the public , are not privy . this offense has so many checks for the quarterback at the line of scrimmage , and so many options during a play for quarterbacks and receivers , that we 'll never know trubisky 's full list of responsibilities on any given course , he ultimately will be judged on wins and how efficient the offense is . ",
        "the subtle details add up to affect those quantifiable measures , so , yes , we 'll have a fair indication of whether he 's developing command of the offense . but it 's important to keep in mind that more goes into a play than just throw and that point , nagy was energized friday . `` he had three plays today that he made some checks at the line of scrimmage , '' nagy explained . `` i told him out there : we 're building this puzzle right now , and each day we 're trying to take one piece of the puzzle and put it up there . ",
        "and then then before you know it , at the end of this thing , you have that puzzle put together . `` today was a day where there were two or three pieces that he put together on that puzzle . specifically , with a protection check , with routes that go with the protection check , he 's seeing the field well . but he had some bad plays , too , and that 's what i 'm trying to do as a coach is let him know , hey , we 're in this together . `` that was an insightful detail for nagy to share about his quarterback 's developmental process . ",
        "a helpful reminder for us allen robinson showed his value as a red-zone threat with two touchdown catches from , so one of the plays would have been a sack if contacting the quarterback were allowed . but that aside . robinson 's quality in running routes , selling fakes and his long catch radius add up to a friendly target in tight confines closet to the goal first made a diving catch in the back of the end zone , yet another grab while going to the ground . that 's something we 're getting used to seeing . ",
        "in fact , even at 6-foot-3 , he has about a half-dozen catches going to the ground already in camp . `` those are some of the tough ones , being a bigger receiver , '' robinson said . `` for me , it 's a little bit easier balls are up in the air . but that 's why they brought me here . my job is to make the quarterback 's job as easy as possible . i do a lot of practicing as far as trying to catch some of the low balls -- getting different hip and knee bend to be able to go down and get those passes . ",
        "my goal is to have the biggest target radius that i can have . `` in making these catches , robinson has shown exceptional body control . `` playing other sports has helped me out a lot -- playing basketball , baseball and doing some different things -- to create the body control and have the same focus getting those high passes and low ones , '' he tangential point about the trubisky-to-robinson touchdown that would 've been a sack : trubisky threw it off-balance with a three-quarters arm slot . that 's one of those funny-body throws that attracted the bears to robinson 's second touchdown catch from trubisky , no adjustment was necessary . ",
        "he was wide open to the eddie goldman 's bull rush is in good veteran nose tackle won back-to-back one-on-one pass-rush reps against center cody whitehair . on the first rush , goldman got his hands inside whitehair 's and into whitehair 's body , and from there goldman 's brute strength is the second rush , goldman 's quick feet enabled him to get on the edge of whitehair . that shows the mix of strength and finesse that defensive line coach jay rodgers mentioned in an interview back in the spring . `` he 's very explosive , '' whitehair said after practice . ",
        "`` very good off the ball . he does a really nice job with his hands as well . he 's making me better , that 's for sure . `` whitehair has faced goldman for going on three seasons now , and he believes goldman 's hand placement and hand-fighting are his greatest improvements over that fairness to whitehair , the one-on-one pass-rush drills are disproportionately difficult on offensive linemen because they do n't have blocking help or the design of the scheme to aid the quarterback in getting the ball out . but it 's helpful technique work . ",
        "and whitehair later stopped goldman on a rep by shuffling his feet quickly to combat goldman 's spin tarik cohen provides the sizzle to go along with the running back/receiver caught a dart from chase daniel down the right sideline for a 60-yard touchdown . great read by daniel with cohen behind the defense , and a perfect low-arcing , strong throw that did n't allow any disruption from a safety ran to the end zone , stood there for just a second and then did a standing backflip . stuck the two-footed landing . mind you , this was 2 hours and 25 minutes after practice began . ",
        "no one 's legs were fresh at that that 's report : rookie linebacker kylie fitts and veteran center hroniss grasu sat out . nagy indicated they 'll be out a while . `` we 're going through the timeline now of how long , '' he said , `` but they 'll be some time now . `` also out : linebackers danny trevathan and aaron lynch , tight end ben braunecker , cornerbacks sherrick mcmanis and kevin tolliver and guard kyle long .
