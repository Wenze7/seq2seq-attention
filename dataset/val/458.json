        "the stock market was in panic mode , jim cramer told his mad money viewers monday . but no one ever made a dime panicking , cramer reminded them , which is why the smart move today was n't to sell , it was to buy . today 's weakness can be traced back to thursday 's stunning decline in facebook , cramer said , where the company saw a dramatic slowdown in growth and an increase in spending . while cramer posited that perhaps management was trying to under-promise so they can over-deliver later , it seems , on the surface , that facebook lost touch with reality . ",
        "the reality is that facebook 's ads and services will be less effective and ultimately worth less if the company can no longer do anything it wants with its users ' data . that will be bad for all of social media , cramer said , including twitter , but it should n't extend to the cloud stocks , nor the rest of tech . cramer said there 's still plenty of money to be made in the financials , industrials and especially the domestic retailers , which is why he 'd be buying into the tech-induced weakness , as sell-offs like monday 's are just the type of cleanse the stock market needs from time to time . ",
        "let 's go shopping with the markets in turmoil , where should investors look for bargains ? cramer said to look no further than the biggest winners this earnings season . one of those winners is advanced micro devices , the semiconductor maker that 's beginning to leap over rival intel thanks to a remarkable turnaround that 's seen four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth . other winners in tech included microsoft , amazon and alphabet . among the industrials , cramer said he likes honeywell , which is splitting itself up to unlock even more value , along with united technologies and ingersoll-rand . ",
        "finally , cramer gave a tip of the hat to expedia , which was also among this quarter 's biggest winners . coming up on this episode of mad money : cramer interviews evan greenberg from chubb ltd. . and martin anstice of lam research . plus , do n't miss the lightning round . which stocks is cramer bullish on ? search jim cramer 's `` mad money '' trading recommendations using our exclusive `` mad money '' stock screener . to watch replays of cramer 's video segments , visit the mad money page on cnbc .
