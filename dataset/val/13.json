        "the boxes full of police interview reports and court transcripts paint a vivid narrative of marshall `` butch '' morgan jr. 's illinois institute of technology basketball player was shot three times during a street robbery . then he was dragged into his own car and left to account of morgan 's 1993 death , according to thousands of pages of notes , investigative reports and evidence logs , prevailed for years . it led to the conviction of one man for murder and the guilty plea of a second man . both spent years in prison for the 25 years after morgan 's half-naked body was found wedged between the front and back seats of his mother 's abandoned blue chevrolet cavalier on south michigan avenue , questions surrounding the suspects , witnesses and police tactics turn a clear-cut version of events into a swirling two men accused of killing the 20-year-old honor student are now free . ",
        "according to attorneys , a leading alternative suspect -- morgan 's father -- sits in prison , the admitted killer of a woman under circumstances similar to his son 's death . and the statements of the accused and several key witnesses used as the basis for the case are in doubt , the result , some say , of police coercion and so much lingering uncertainty , the question remains the same as it did in may 1993 : who killed marshall morgan jr. ? case seemed open and shutmorgan , a 5-foot-7 sophomore guard who averaged 18 points a game and wanted to become a lawyer , was last seen on may 8 , 1993 . ",
        "he was supposed to meet his girlfriend at the days inn on lake shore drive , but he never showed up and never 's whereabouts were unknown for nine days . the case drew citywide attention . his family and the police made up `` have you seen this missing person ? '' posters and flyers , with a description of morgan and what he was last seen wearing : blue jean shorts , a black t-shirt underneath a black-and-white striped jersey , black converse gym 's decomposing body was found may 17 after police responded to 5708 s. michigan ave. for a report of a foul odor coming from an abandoned car . ",
        "an autopsy determined he had been shot three times , once in the abdomen and twice in the the end of may , two men from the pullman neighborhood , tyrone hood and wayne washington , were arrested and charged with morgan 's murder . police said the two men killed morgan between 9 and 11 may 8 , the saturday before mother 's day , at 104th street and maryland told police hood shot morgan as the pair robbed him , a statement he later said was false , the result of police punching and slapping him while he was handcuffed . ",
        "that version of events prevailed at hood and washington 's criminal trials three years later . hood was convicted of murder and sentenced to 75 years in prison . washington 's trial ended in a hung jury . he later pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 25 years in circumstanceslawyers have said for years , and argued in a series of legal filings and appeals , that hood and washington did not kill morgan , and that instead the likely suspect is actually morgan 's father , marshall morgan sr. , a man with a troubled past and , they say , a months before morgan jr. 's death , his father took out a life insurance policy on his son and listed himself as the beneficiary of the policy . ",
        "an allstate insurance review of the case ultimately awarded morgan sr. . a $ 50,000 payout following the charges against hood and washington . `` a suspect has been placed in jail for the murder with the robbery being the apparent motive , '' one of the insurance company 's reviewers wrote . `` no beneficiary involvement . please approve . `` adding to the suspicion in the years following morgan jr. 's killing was the revelation that the father pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter for killing a man in 1977 . two years after his son 's death , morgan sr. . ",
        "received $ 107,000 in life insurance after the shooting death of his fiancee michelle soto . no one has been charged in soto 's , morgan sr. . pleaded guilty to killing his girlfriend deborah jackson during an argument on a chicago street in 2001 . jackson 's body was found inside an abandoned car , a scenario and circumstance with eerie similarities to morgan jr. 's sr. . is in stateville correctional center , serving a 75-year sentence for shooting and killing jackson . morgan sr. . admits to killing jackson but has repeatedly said that he was not involved in his son 's killing . ",
        "he did not respond to a written request for an interview for this part of a review of the morgan case by the cook cook state 's attorney 's conviction integrity unit , assistant state 's attorney james papa and cook county state 's attorney investigator thomas mcgreal interviewed morgan sr. . on oct. . 16 , 2012 , in father told investigators he was not having financial trouble at the time of his son 's death and said taking out the insurance policy was a normal practice for a father . he claimed his son wanted him listed as the policy 's parents do n't usually purchase life insurance on the lives of their children , according to jack dolan , spokesman for the american council of life there are valid reasons for a child to have life insurance protection , the basic purpose of life insurance is to compensate for a loss , dolan said in an email . ",
        "benefits from a life insurance policy help a family cope financially following the death of a wage earner , and children rarely are the main wage earners in a family , dolan , during the prison interview , asked morgan sr. . if he killed his son . `` no i did not , '' morgan said , according to papa and mcgreal 's report continued : `` marshall morgan sr. . said he admits to his current crime and is paying for what he did . he is not going to let anyone tell him he did what he did not do . ",
        "his conscience is clear and he can sleep at night . marshall morgan sr. . said if he killed his son he would feel guilty . he does n't feel guilty , because he did n't kill his son . `` state 's attorney 's reviewhood also has consistently denied he killed morgan jr. , but a state 's attorney 's review of the case ended as it began : with hood and washington still on the hook for the a brief memo note dated nov. . 27 , 2012 , papa wrote to fabio valentini , the chief of the cook county state 's attorney 's criminal prosecutions bureau . ",
        "`` after conducting and completing the review , it is the recommendation that no further action be taken on the matter as it pertains to the unit . `` the state 's attorney 's office said that one-page document is the only summary of investigators ' review of the case . a spokeswoman did not make papa available for an of police reports , interview notes and trial transcripts detail how the case against hood and washington came said washington , during questioning , detailed how hood spotted morgan pull up and park his car . `` there 's a vic , '' hood told washington , according to the june 11 , 1993 , report from the area one violent crimes detective division . ",
        "`` do you want to do him ? `` hood approached morgan , the report says , and told him , `` low it like you owe it . '' morgan reached into his pocket and pulled out some money . hood asked for more , and as morgan reached into his other pocket , the report says hood shot him in the he was found , morgan was missing a gold rope chain and a quigley south class ring and although he was believed to have about $ 400 on him at the time , only $ 17 was recovered , according to a may 21 evidence days after morgan was killed , on may 20 , hood was interviewed by police investigators . ",
        "the next day hood was taken to the police crime lab , where he was given a polygraph . the polygraph operator , according to police reports , told detectives , `` hood had indicated deception concerning knowledge and participation in this crime . `` the key piece of physical evidence connecting hood to the shooting was his fingerprint on a miller beer bottle in a trash bag found in the back of morgan 's car . hood was interviewed again by police at area one , continued to deny his involvement and said he did not believe his prints were found on any , according to the police report prepared by area one detectives , `` he also spontaneously stated that ` if i do n't say anything to explain , i will go to jail for a long time . ",
        "if i do tell what happened , i will go to jail . ' `` witness accountsa review of the case files , transcripts , filings and documents in the state 's attorney 's possession , which the office made available to the tribune in response to a freedom of information request , offers a few glimpses into the reviewers ' mindset . notes and underlining of court filings from hood and washington 's attorneys show where prosecutors disagree or question defense arguments , summaries of evidence or constructed a passage of one appeal , hood 's lawyers note that one witness in the case , kenneth crossley , received approximately $ 1,000 in exchange for his testimony , including a check for $ 750 and several cash payments . ",
        "`` how is this exculpatory ? '' one of the reviewers scribbled next to the the re-examination of the case , papa and mcgreal interviewed crossley . crossley and his brother , jody , testified at trial may 8 that they heard hood talk about wanting to commit a robbery and saw him retrieve a . 38-caliber handgun with black tape around the gun used to kill morgan jr. . was never said he was never given any money by the police or prosecutors in exchange for his testimony in the morgan affair . crossley said he signed an affidavit that had been written out for him , but that he does n't read very well and only signed the document because he thought he was going to get out of prison on an unrelated case soon , according to mcgreal 's april 11 , 2012 , , during the interview at crossley 's chicago apartment , pointed him to the paragraph that states he was given close to $ 1,000 by police or the state 's attorney to come to court during the morgan-related trials . ",
        "`` get the f -- out of here , '' crossley told papa and mcgreal . `` that is a damn lie . no one gave me no $ 1,000 . `` papa and mcgreal , according to their report , pressed crossley for details regarding anything he could remember about the marshall morgan jr. . slaying . ",
        "but crossley continually demurred , stating that he did n't remember much about something that happened so long ago and that medication he was taking was hurting his several witnesses in the case have changed their stories about what they saw or knew about morgan 's killing , one man , emanuel bob , has steadfastly maintained that he saw hood inside morgan 's car the night of mother 's day , pulling up outside his apartment near the crime scene to talk with 's story came to light nearly three years after the killing when investigators were interviewing a woman who said she might have seen hood in the victim 's car the day after morgan disappeared .",
        "bob happened to be visiting the woman when investigators asked her to review a photo array . bob told police he recognized hood and remembered seeing him the night after morgan was commutedafter serving nearly 22 years behind bars , hood was released from prison in the winter of 2015 . then-gov . pat quinn , on his final day in office , commuted hood 's sentence , and a judge vacated his conviction on feb. . 9 , 2015 . washington , who was released from prison a few years earlier , also had his conviction , in a recent telephone interview , said he tried to look at each individual petition for clemency or sentence commutation during his time in office . ",
        "hood 's case stood out . `` with tyrone hood , i just thought that it screamed to heaven for justice , '' quinn said . `` when you do it wrong , then the person who actually committed the murder goes free . `` hood , who now lives in north aurora , maintains his innocence . he and washington have cases pending in federal court , accusing the police officers involved in the investigation of violating their civil rights . `` i did n't kill him , '' hood said . `` so the killer has to be out there . ",
        "`` after hood 's sentence was commuted , the state 's attorney 's office said it was not going to try him again . but no one else has been charged with the crime . `` i ca n't go wrong with telling the truth , '' hood said during a recent interview in the break room of the loevy & loevy law firm 's offices in the west loop . `` i 'm comfortable with what i say because it 's the truth . `` but cook county circuit judge dominica a. stephenson remains unconvinced , twice denying hood the final piece of his redemption puzzle : a certificate of innocence that will completely clear his record . ",
        "the state has taken no position on the certificate of innocence . `` without commenting on all of the evidence , there is , however , physical evidence and un-recanted testimony linking the petitioner to the murder of morgan jr. . by way of his fingerprints and the testimony of mr. bob , '' stephenson wrote in her 's lawyers argue that morgan sr. 's 2008 conviction for killing jackson `` firmly established '' a `` modus operandi '' that connects him to the murder of his stephenson said there is a lack of evidence for those theories , and the alternative narrative is not enough to rule out hood 's involvement in morgan jr. 's death . ",
        "stephenson says morgan 's involvement in other crimes and his life insurance actions do not automatically link him to his son 's killing . `` there is absolutely no physical evidence linking morgan sr. . to this crime or crime scene , '' stephenson said he is perplexed by the judge 's rulings and by the state 's neutral position . `` i 'm puzzled by it , '' quinn said . `` i 'm disappointed . i really feel the state should act . `` quinn said he believes the state 's attorney 's office should stand in favor of hood 's innocence , instead of taking no position . ",
        "`` all of us , we have a duty to justice and if something went wrong , we 've tried to do that with clemency and we 've tried to act , '' quinn 's arrest for murder and armed robbery remains on his record . it also means he has not been able to collect $ 200,000 compensation from the state for a wrongful said that because he was linked to morgan through the fingerprint , he is now ultra-careful with his garbage . he has a lock on his garbage can lid that he clasps every night . ",
        "`` i 'm stuck . i feel like an ex-felon . i feel like an innocent man who is an ex-felon , '' hood said . `` i just feel like i want the same thing as before all this happened : i want my name back . it feels like someone has a hold of my name and is keeping it . `` when asked about bob 's story , and the relative consistency of his eyewitness account , hood questions how bob possibly could have physically seen what he claims to have seen . hood said he believes the police fed bob information in an effort to connect hood to the crime . ",
        "`` there 's too many loopholes in him , '' hood said of bob . `` ray charles could see that . `` a haunting casein the lobby of the leighton criminal courthouse three years ago , jim mullenix , hood 's public defender at his murder trial , gave hood a giant hug after the judge vacated hood 's convictions . `` this was the kind of case that haunted me for a long time , '' mullenix said recently . `` i had to suppress the memory . it was a bad loss . i tried to forget this case for a long time . ",
        "`` mullenix called into question the statements , and truthfulness , of an array of prosecutor witnesses . `` they do n't find any fingerprints on the car or on the steering wheel or seat or on the mirror or anything , '' mullenix also said the prosecution 's key witness , bob , was unreliable . `` a few years had gone by and he never went to the police ? why ? i thought , ` why would he make up this story ? ' why ? maybe he thought it was his 15 minutes of fame . ",
        "maybe he told police what they wanted to hear , '' mullenix the other wild card in the case is the behavior of the police . several of the police officers involved in the investigation have been under scrutiny in recent years for their tactics . washington has claimed he was forced into his confession . hood and washington have separately filed federal civil lawsuits against the city of chicago and police officers involved in the initial investigation , alleging their constitutional rights were violated . hood and washington allege the officers , including kenneth boudreau , a retired detective with dozens of allegations of misconduct in his past , fabricated evidence and coerced testimony . ",
        "boudreau , at a may court hearing in an unrelated case , denied ever beating any suspect he of the initial case centered on the statements of several people who told police hood had planned a robbery , and bob , who claimed to have seen him the next night in morgan jr. 's car . but many of the statements obtained by the police were written out for those interviewed . it can be difficult to discern the truth , especially since several of those involved changed their stories , sometimes recanting their initial statements and then later backtracking on their recantations . ",
        "`` there 's a lot of shenanigans that go on , and figuring it all out is a work of art and a painstaking ordeal , '' said candace gorman , a chicago defense attorney who has represented clients before the torture inquiry and relief commission . `` and it takes a lot of luck to try to find people who are willing to talk and those who are telling the truth now . `` gorman said it was not uncommon in years past for prosecutors to write out statements for witnesses or suspects , purposely adding lines that could be crossed out later in order to make the documents look more authentic . ",
        "this practice also is mentioned in the footnotes of a 2016 dissenting opinion from the torture commission . this is less common now that interviews with suspects and witnesses are videotaped . `` i 'd look at all of these statements with a jaundiced eye , '' gorman said . `` obviously , they 're written in a way that is favorable to the case , in their point of view . `` karl leonard , an attorney who is representing hood in his continued bid for a certificate of innocence , said that while many people have said many things over the years , his client has remained steady in his denial of any involvement . ",
        "`` tyrone has said every day since 1993 that he had nothing to do with this , '' leonard said . `` the truth is stubborn and the facts are stubborn and they do n't change . lots of people say lots of different things . if you can focus on those kernels of truth in that noise , those are the pieces that are the most reliable .
