        "the non-waiver trade deadline is 3 tuesday and cubs president theo epstein said he believes the cubs will make a deal . here are some questions and answers regarding the team 's needs and the trading did the cubs get to this point with their pitching needs ? the starting pitchers have n't pitched deep into games with any regularity , thus causing stress on a bullpen that has been effective and resilient despite injuries to valuable late-inning specialists such as brandon morrow and carl edwards darvish 's injury has stretched the depth further . left-hander reliever mike montgomery had to be plugged into the starting rotation and thus left the bullpen without an experienced long reliever . ",
        "a season-ending injury to top pitching prospect adbert alzolay looms even larger , especially because he could have performed the long relief duties and made a spot start or cubs are in the middle of a stretch playing 12 games in 11 days and will brace themselves for an odyssey in which they are scheduled to play 23 consecutive games without a scheduled day off starting aug. . teams present potential trade partners ? the most likely possible matches include the orioles , blue jays , royals , marlins and added the cubs could make a trade for a player whose name has n't been mentioned frequently as other obvious targets , such as left-handed closer zach britton of the orioles , who was traded to the yankees on nathan eovaldi of the rays , another pitcher who seemed to fit the cubs ' profile , was traded to the red sox on wednesday .

        "eovaldi , 28 , started the season on the disabled list but has rebounded nicely , going 3-4 in 10 starts with an era of and a whip of he 's also on an affordable contract -- $ 2 million this year with incentives that could make it worth another $ million -- but will be an unrestricted free agent after the relievers mychal givens and brad brach are n't having overwhelming seasons but could help the cubs bullpen . left-hander adam conley of the marlins is enjoying a career-best season and possesses better control than teammate kyle barraclough , who has struck out 50 but walked 24 in 44 innings .

        "both players are arbitration eligible this winter , so the price tag could be ross of the padres , whom the cubs courted before the 2017 season while he was recovering from a shoulder injury , has made 20 starts . dodgers radio announcer kevin kennedy observed during a july 12 start that ross 's mechanics were n't smooth , but ross managed to no-hit the dodgers for 5 1/3 few years ago , general manager jed hoyer quipped that the cubs someday would make a deal with the mets . but any potential trade is unlikely to involve jacob degrom because of the projected asking price and the lack of prospects needed to satisfy the said sunday that an impact trade would be difficult , but the pool of potential trade partners could expand as more teams fade from playoff might be dealt from the cubs farm system ?

        "for starters , the cubs are reluctant to move anyone from the current major-league roster . also trading gleyber torres , eloy jimenez and dylan cease has sapped the organization of some of its top few scouts have inquired about david bote , whose stock has ascended and would be on the major-league roster full time if there were a spot for him . one scout asked , `` i like him , but where do you play him ? '' my answer : `` in the batter 's box . '' bote has displayed adequate versatility around the infield , but he might be too valuable to the cubs as an insurance policy as manager joe maddon wisely monitors ben zobrist 's playing time and kris bryant 's lingering shoulder do n't see many untouchables , although 19-year-old catcher miguel amaya has ascended impressively this season .
