        "the minnesota wild and forward jason zucker have come to terms on a new contract , getting the deal done just days before the scheduled arbitration free agent , jason zucker , and the minnesota wild have agreed to a contract the will see the veteran forward staying with the team for 5 years . a deal identical in length to what defensemen mathew dumba signed last $ million dollar contract averages out to $ / year , with a fluctuating yearly salary to allow the wild some breathing room under the salary cap . the 2018-19 cap hit will be approximately $ 5 million . ",
        "zucker , a 2010 second round draft pick , had a breakout season setting career highs in goals , assists , points , power-play points , game-winning goals , and shots , while never missing a game . he firmly established himself as a reliable top player on a team in desperate need of one . jason zucker took the long way around to making the minnesota wild nhl roster . he struggled mightily under head coach mike yeo , finding himself in the press box much more than a young player would have bruce boudreau , however , he has taken his game to the next level , improving every season and earning a larger role in both even strength and power play time . ",
        "clearly , he is doing the most with what his coach is giving money on this deal makes sense as well , at $ / year this places zucker on a level playing field with mikael granlund , mikko koivu , and nino niederreiter . zucker , granlund , and niederreiter have each went over 55 points at least once in the last 2 seasons so it would only make sense they be on equal ground with their deal is huge for him , it 's big for the minnesota wild , but it 's also big for the state of minnesota . ",
        "this deal secures the core of the team for 2 more seasons , allowing new general manager paul fenton time to evaluate all of his options before making any drastic moves . in 2 years time , there are some tough decisions to be made in regards to who will stay and who should go . 2 years is a long time in the hockey world , though , and we will see what kind of manager fenton can be based on how he handles the future of this your voice heard ? join the gone puck wild team ! ",
        "for now , surprise trades notwithstanding , this is the last piece of offseason action that we were waiting for . we 've officially reached the dog days of summer , and now we wait for training camp and preseason to get underway . "
