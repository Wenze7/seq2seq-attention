        "two key dates in the annals of winnie-the-pooh : dec. . 24 , 1925 : milne publishes a front-page children 's story in the london evening news , changing the name of his nascent bear character to winnie-the-pooh . the bear is inspired by his son , christopher robin milne , his stuffed teddy , and the ashdown forest near milne 's residence in east sussex , england . the name winnie came from a famous bear housed in the london 3 , 2018 : disney , the commercial proprietor of milne 's characters since 1961 , releases its latest brand extension , `` christopher robin , '' combining live-action and discreet digital animation . ",
        "the story concerns a middle-age and beleaguered christopher robin , played by ewan mcgregor , a world war ii combat veteran employed postwar as an efficiency expert at a struggling london luggage company . he has a wife and a daughter he loves but neglects ; he is , in other words , suffering from mr. banks syndrome , named after the character in `` mary poppins . '' faced with the grim prospect of downsizing his staff , christopher robin has all but forgotten his childhood playmates pooh , eeyore , piglet , tigger , kanga , roo , et , popping through a magic portal in his tree-trunk home , pooh magically appears in london to reacquaint himself with his sad old friend . ",
        "after christopher robin 's initial shock , increasing exasperation and , back at the hundred acre wood , another separation , all of which proved quite upsetting to this critic 's 8-year-old stepson , the film lands on a mossy bed of warm feeling and humane work/life movie 's also unabashedly pro-labor and between 1925 and 2018 , so much else has happened with pooh , the hundred acre wood , the heffalump and other milne delights , in so many different came to `` christopher robin '' an ardent fan of both the milne stories , graced with shepard 's illustrations , and the disney shorts begun in 1966 .",
        "the new film is directed by marc forster , of `` finding neverland , '' and it comes from a curious and talented collection of screenwriters and rewriters , beginning with alex ross perry , best known for the fantastically jaundiced comedies `` the color wheel '' and `` listen up philip '' ; tom mccarthy , who scored with `` the visitor '' and as one of the writers of `` spotlight '' ; and finally allison schroeder , co-adapter of `` hidden figures . `` and the results ? quite good , it turns out . forster has his strident , pushy side and he has absolutely no sense of directorial or visual humor . ",
        "none . not a speck . but he made some shrewd key decisions on this project , starting with how to blend the two worlds , london and the hundred acre wood , and the live action with the digitally realized lives of the wee stuffed creatures who are , in fact , real : walking , talking , bouncing , caring we 're very much in `` hook '' territory , in addition to `` finding neverland '' territory . the grown-up christopher robin has become a drudge and a slave to the dollar , the way the grown-up peter pan in `` hook '' forgets his old life and comrades en route to conventional notions of success . ",
        "`` christopher robin '' does a better job of justifying that story decision . the mcgregor character is n't simply self-absorbed and emotionally distant ; he 's trying to save his colleagues ' jobs while cutting expenses on order from above . once forster and his design team get mcgregor back to the hundred acre wood , and in the bosom of his dear childhood friends , `` christopher robin '' finds its way . the interplay between humans and stuffed-but-very-lively animals is lovely . the voice work from jim cummings , brad garrett , peter capaldi , toby jones and the rest holds to a high about saying goodbye to childhood friends , and finding them again , work on our emotional defenses like nothing else . ",
        "unusually for director forster , `` christopher robin '' does n't go for the throat , or the jugular ; though the editing is antsy and a little off . mcgregor and atwell play their scenes for real . the core human/bear connection is treated with respect . pooh 's wisdom and kindness can not be denied . the same impulses worked for the two `` paddington '' movies , god knows . `` christopher robin '' is n't quite in their league , but it 's affecting nonetheless .
