        "with jermaine johnson now committed , georgia football is loaded up on pass rushers like we 've never seen before . could it become pass rush u ? georgia football has developed a reputation over the years . quite rightly , the dawgs have become known as rbu thanks to all of the running backs they have put into the league . needless to say that sony michel and nick chubb did n't hurt that image one bit . nor will the fact that they currently have three 5-star running backs on campus right there is another position where uga might be even more loaded . ",
        "over the past few years , georgia has recruited pass rushers at a rate that i for one have never seen . the 2017 class had walter grant and robert beal , both of whom are really talented . that was then surpassed by 2018 with three more top talents coming in . now the 2019 class could be even better than that as uga once again added two top and beal are in the rotation already and could really make an impact this year . with some very talented young players behind them , i fully expect both of them to find a way to raise their level this year and make some plays . ",
        "they are going to force the freshmen to try and take playing time away from them . that 's not a given by any means and any pass rusher is going to have to earn every of which should excite uga fans . lorenzo carter and davin bellamy were both dgd 's who made huge impacts in athens . however , neither possessed the raw pass rushing skills that mel tucker will have at his disposal going forward . all of this talent is making me just one thing . is georgia going to start to become known as the school that puts pass rushers into the league like they do running backs ? ",
        "if they do , then uga could well become pass rusher u. "
