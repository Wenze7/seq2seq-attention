        "two lawsuits filed thursday urge a federal appeals court to force southeast wisconsin and northwest indiana to comply with the latest limits on lung-damaging smog , targeting a trump administration rollback intended to benefit foxconn technology group and a handful of other big industrial legal challenges -- one filed by illinois attorney general lisa madigan and chicago mayor rahm emanuel and another by two chicago-based environmental groups -- cite the environmental protection agency 's own records and data in seeking to overturn the other things , last-minute changes by trump political appointees saved taiwan-based foxconn from having to make expensive improvements as it builds a massive electronics plant in racine county , just north of the illinois border in an area with some of the region 's dirtiest lawsuits also highlight the trump epa 's last-minute decision to remove all of mchenry county , ill. , and porter county , ind. , and part of lake county , ind. , from a list of areas that contribute to chronic smog problems in the chicago area .",
        "`` the epa is ignoring its own scientific data in order to put industry profits ahead of the public 's health , '' madigan said in a december , all of the counties were on the agency 's draft list of areas that either violate the new smog limit or add smog-forming pollution to neighboring counties with dirty air problems . by may , they were officially designated clean enough to avoid more aggressive steps to improve air changes were made by then-epa administrator scott pruitt , who had challenged the smog rules while serving as oklahoma attorney general and tried unsuccessfully to delay the more stringent standard from taking effect after joining the trump , also known as ground-level ozone , is formed by a reaction between sunlight and pollution from car tailpipes , power plants and factories , fumes from volatile solvents and gasoline vapors . ",
        "after a scientific review required every five years by the federal clean air act , the obama epa tightened the national smog standard in 2015 to 70 parts per billion , down from the 75 ppb limit set during the bush smog concentrations in all of the wisconsin areas initially targeted by the epa exceeded the new federal limit during the past three years , according to state monitoring data . ",
        "smog levels peaked at 83 ppb last year in racine county and averaged 75 ppb between 2015 and monitors in northwest indiana recorded average levels just below the new smog standard during the same three-year period , an epa staff report concluded that pollution from lake and porter counties contributes to air quality problems in the larger chicago metropolitan agency 's career staff reached the same conclusion about mchenry county , where smog levels averaged 69 ppb between 2015 and 2017 but so far this summer have peaked as high as 91 gov. scott walker , a republican who has made the foxconn plant the centerpiece of his re-election campaign , blames chicago for making the air unhealthy to breathe in parts of his epa staff analysis of industrial pollution , traffic patterns and weather patterns concluded wisconsin is at least partially responsible for its own smog problems .",
        "documents filed with the wisconsin department of natural resources show foxconn will be a major new source of smog-forming the trump epa exemptions , foxconn and other industries in the affected counties would have been required to install more effective pollution-control equipment , scale back production or broker costly emissions-trading agreements with cleaner facilities . ",
        "`` cleaner air is essential to public health and a strong economy in our region , '' said howard learner , president of the nonprofit environmental law and policy center , which along with the respiratory health association filed a separate lawsuit challenging the groups note most of the country met earlier smog standards far more quickly and at significantly lower costs than obama epa estimated most of the nation would meet the new smog standard by 2025 , with the biggest improvements in air quality coming from cleaner cars , trucks and power plants required by other federal regulations the trump administration is attempting to unravel ."
