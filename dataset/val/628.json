        "we 've only been to the moon a handful of times . but we 've already set our sights on a far more ambitious mission : colonize you believe the hype , it may happen in just a few decades . elon musk anticipates that spacex 's bfr will take its first handful of passengers to the red planet by 2024 -- if everything goes according to plan , that is . mars one 's crew , which will take up permanent residence on mars , is slated to launch by 2031 . nasa is aiming for a similar mission by humans there is hard enough . ",
        "but surviving there , especially over a prolonged period ? that 's a whole other question . a structure on mars would have to withstand intense solar radiation and massive daily temperature changes , and provide a pressurized environment inside for humans to inhabit over a prolonged period of time . weight and space limits aboard the rockets that will get us there will make the design task even printing the habitat seems like humanity 's best bet . the martian surface comes with its own challenges , but back on earth , 3d printing technology in home construction is proving to be very promising . ",
        "a 3d printer with local resources from the surface as the `` ink '' would mean that astronauts would n't have to fill up precious cargo space with building materials . plus , the reduced weight would make mars colonization substantially less nasa held a contest for the best 3d-printed habitat that might actually work on mars . that was in 2014 . the first two phases of the project required teams to submit renderings , and come up with material technologies . now , four years after launching the contest , nasa has narrowed the finalists to just five brilliant designs . ",
        "the fives teams , which hail from a handful of american universities and companies that specialize in architecture or construction , have now come up with an entire structure that takes advantage of autonomous 3d printing on the surface of another planet ; they will also share a $ 100,000 prize . for the next phase , each team will have to create a third-scale model of their are what the five finalists propose : first place : team zopherusteam zopherus from rogers , arkansas came up with the idea of mixing `` martian concrete '' using locally available materials -- ice , calcium oxide , and martian huge metal dome houses the concrete mixer and 3d printer . ",
        "the dome protects the structure the printer is constructing from the harsh environment . once the printer is done with a section , it lifts itself up , and repeats the process elsewhere . the resulting habitats are hexagonal , made of finished concrete that the team claims would be able to withstand the harsh local climate and absorb enough radiation to protect humans living within . the metal dome that houses the printer , plus any air locks and windows for the final construction will have to be shipped separately from place : team ai spacefactorythe team from new york tried to inject an `` element of humanity '' into its habitat design to create a `` credible and evocative habitat with an alien yet familiar beauty '' according to the team 's website . ",
        "the habitat , dubbed marsha , is cylindrical to maximize usable floor area and pressurization efficiency . multiple floors also means inhabitants wo n't end up murdering each other , offering each activity or group of people their own closed off bearings on the floor allow the walls of the habitat to `` breathe '' as it expands and contracts as the outside temperature are two layers : an outer shell to keep the harsh environment out , and an inner shell that houses people . the outer shell is made out of a reusable thermoplastic that is mixed with local rock fibers to reinforce it . ",
        "this type of plastic , called pla , is great for this application because it does n't expand or contract as much as other plastics when temperatures drop or kahn-yatesthe team from jackson , mississippi designed a habitat that has a prefabricated core , which the lander plops down on the martian surface . once it lands , the core extends a giant print arm that 3d prints the oval habitat 's foundation , then its habitat 's exterior shell has carefully-designed openings that allow sunlight to reach the inside . a gap between the outer shell and the interior core provide space for lush garden that can help filter the air search + apis corthe team from new york balanced on the habitat 's ability to shield inhabitants from radiation while still allowing sunlight to filter into the design 's interior . ",
        "the team partnered up with apis cor , an construction company that has already 3d-printed entire buildings using a special type of this model , the inhabitants live inside a pair of `` inflatable volumes '' that can be deployed to the martian surface before the crew arrives . a 3d printed shell , made of rough loose rocks , would shield the inflatable habitats from northwestern universitylike previous team , northwestern 's team designed an inflatable pressurized vessel that houses the 3d printer . the outer shell would be printed out of resources available on the crust layout focuses all `` wet rooms '' along one side of the habitat to concentrate plumbing and other mechanical features to one area .

        "nasa 's hi-seas experiment , which simulated space exploration , informed the proportions of the different rooms . "
