        "on a team visit through the pro football hall of fame on wednesday , bears rookie javon wims took a moment to appreciate his surroundings . `` you see so many of these guys you 've been watching since you were a kid , '' he said . `` and to see so much history in one building was amazing . `` most impressive to wims , a seventh-round pick out of georgia : a glimpse of his `` favorite receiver of all-time . '' that would be class of 2018 inductee randy moss . `` he 's one of the reasons i play receiver , '' wims said . ",
        "`` because of the things he was able to do . anytime you have your own about you ? man ! everybody knows you get ` mossed . ' anytime you have something named after you , that 's amazing . `` in a 17-16 bears loss to the ravens on thursday night , wims led all receivers with seven catches for 89 yards . wims recorded his longest reception on a 24-yard grab from tyler bray on a contested catch with cornerback anthony averett in tight coverage . `` just like georgia all over again , '' wims be clear , wims ' flashes came late in the nfl 's exhibition opener . ",
        "he still faces a long climb to make an impact and will have to battle just to earn his spot on the 53-man has openly acknowledged since training camp opened that he needs to continue to work on polishing his route-running and becoming more consistent in that regard . `` in college , i just showcased jump-ball ability , '' wims said . `` now though , coach nagy and everybody are giving me an opportunity to do multiple things . i 'm able to showcase the different things i can do . `` wims ' physical tools are obvious . ",
        "so , too , is his room for nagy : `` javon is a kid who has excellent hands . he has phenomenal ball skills . and he showed that in college . now , he 's a receiver who 's a good route runner . he can become better . and he knows that . `` and then when you get out on stage and you start getting some guys who are going to press you , how are you going to play against the press ? i thought he did a good job . he made some big-time catches over the middle in crucial situations . ",
        "and he 's a big target . it 's nice throwing to big guys `` wims maintained that he was eager , not anxious , to get his nfl debut under his belt . `` i did n't have any jitters , '' he said . `` i talked to my mom , my dad and they told me you 've been doing this since you were five . nothing different now . it 's just a bigger stage . `` first time ? nagy left thursday 's loss with a real appreciation for all the little details that came with his first game experience as an nfl head coach . ",
        "`` the game was valuable for me and our staff , '' he said . `` trust me , we spent a lot of time here in the last couple days trying to dot the i 's and cross the t 's in so many areas . there are so many things you do n't really think about . how are you going to do this ? how are you going to handle time management ? what 's your process ? now , you talk about it and you know it . but then when it actually happens and the bullets are flying , how are you going to react to it ? ",
        "`` i was really proud of the staff with the communication on the headsets . for me , knowing now that i have full responsibility of all three phases , it 's a little different . i 'm not with the quarterback as much as i used to me . so i rely more on and mark on how that thing 's going .
