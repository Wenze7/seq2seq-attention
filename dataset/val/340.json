        "napa -- but do n't tell anybody with the raiders that . if you do , they 'll refute it . heavily . `` the thing that you hear about that he ca n't run anymore , '' quarterback derek carr said , `` that 's false . '' `` i can tell you , he 's one of the fastest skill guys that we have still . he can run . you see that by his route running . if he can win on underneath routes , that means dbs are scared about what he can do over the top . ",
        "he 's still jordy nelson , that 's for sure . `` nelson may not be a no . 1 receiver anymore , but he can still sprinkle in plays like one every now and then . a couple impressive downfield routes and grabs proved just that during day 1 of training camp on caught his fewest passes since 2012 last season and tallied his fewest receiving yards since 2009 . he only found the end zone six times . you have to go all the way back to 2010 to find the last time he caught fewer than that many touchdown passes . ",
        "granted , aaron rodgers only logging seven games last season due to a collarbone injury played a significant role in nelson 's slide , but he 's tasked with rebounding from a down year nonetheless . `` he 's wired in , '' raiders ' head coach jon gruden said . `` you can see why he was a security blanket for rodgers all those years . he can still run . he 's proven to us he can still run . we can line him up anywhere we want and he can run any route we draw up . ",
        "we 're really encouraged by him . `` you 'll mainly see nelson on the outside , lined up across the field from amari cooper . nelson seems to sit firmly in the raiders ' no . 2 receiver spot . cooper is the clear no . 1 , and gruden hardly showered martavis bryant with praise friday , saying the first-year raider is still a work in only do the raiders hope they reap the benefits of nelson 's skillset , they believe he adds a much-needed veteran presence in a youthful receivers room . cooper is 24 , bryant 26 , ryan switzer 23 and seth roberts 27 . ",
        "`` he 's a tremendous leader , '' raiders ' offensive coordinator greg olson said . `` he 's a mentor to the younger players . i think they really appreciate that , including amari . i think that 's a good relationship there with those two . you see them together a lot and talking and that 's been real positive ... just his professionalism that he brings to that room . `` as we 've seen the first three days you 've been out here , he 's made some impressive catches and he 's shown exceptional speed after the catch . ",
        "`` carr faced the task of meshing with nelson after he formed one of the league 's most dependable quarterback-wide receiver combos in green bay . carr began that mission even before nelson signed , picking him up from the airport when he landed in the bay area for his visit back in mid-march . since then , the two have continued to hit it off . they may never reach the rodgers-nelson pinnacle , but the raiders would gladly take anything close to that . `` he 's just a guy that it 's easy to throw to him because he 's open , '' carr said . ",
        "`` there are some guys that are good at running some routes , a guy will be there that 's strong at catching the ball or whatever . he just gets open . he 's very route savvy . he 's very smart . `` i ca n't say enough good things . i ca n't believe green bay let him go , but i 'm glad he 's here .
