        "earlier this year i spoke to a jailed russian hacker about how he helped russian security agencies hack facebook , among other websites and media organizations , according to his account of events . it 's not just accounts of rogue russian missionaries . the chorus of voices calling out threats to digital security , especially on platforms like facebook , is growing louder every month . so far , facebook has been able to brush them off , telling investors it 's handling it . until today 's second-quarter earnings call , when we 're now seeing the impact of revenue growth deceleration . ",
        "`` we 're investing so much in security , that it will significantly impact our profitability , '' the company said on a call with investors on wednesday . `` we 're starting to see it this quarter . '' the company 's reported $ billion in revenues in the second quarter fell below $ estimate . still , reported earnings per share were $ compared to $ a year ago . what rattled analysts the most on the earnings call , however was the `` magnitude of deceleration '' and the executive team 's guidance that the operating margin will drop to mid-thirties within a time period of `` more than two years . '' ",
        "facebook 's operating margin was 44 % in second quarter compared to 47 % a year ago . so what 's going on ? cfo dave wehner cited currency impact on deceleration , noting a shift from it being `` a tailwind to a modest headwind . '' all executives also cited fake news , electoral integrity , security concerns as well as investments in new products like video , vr , stories . security headache is here to stay while the company shares some insights on how they 're tackling election machinations , crackdown on political campaigns and identity verification , it 's clear it 's an acknowledgement of an ongoing cyberwarfare .

'' facebook does n't think it 's a monopoly . last year has been tumultuous for facebook . in april , zuckerberg testified before congress , revealing there are no easy solutions to regulating facebook and protecting its users . during the hearing , iowa 's senator charles e. grassley said the tech industry has a responsibility to protect its users and said `` the status quo no longer works . '' ",
        "the company 's second-quarter results show that facebook has taken on that task , even it means rattling investors . still , the tone of the management 's discussion was upbeat and as idealistic as ever . the company committed to a five-year goal to help 1 billion people feel less lonely via its groups and communities . it did not share details how privacy of these groups and discussions will be balanced with filtering of politically divisive or racist content . if the european drop off from gdpr is any indication , facebook 's problems are far from over .
