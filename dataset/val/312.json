        "`` i 've been working in the body shop , '' he said -- and at two other points apologizing to analysts for what he called his `` bad manners '' on tesla 's may earnings call , also citing a lack of sleep . `` i hope you 'll accept my apology , '' he said to joseph spak of rbc capital , the analyst musk cut off for being too dry before turning to a tesla cheerleader on youtube . the apology was accepted , and the awkward moments brought some color to a call that otherwise meandered from topics including production rates , and plans for funding a gigafactory in china to its insistence that it wo n't need to raise any capital as it continues to spend heavily on model 3 production . ",
        "tesla 's earnings release was a mixed bag : the carmaker reported slightly more revenue than expected , at $ 4 billion versus an analyst consensus of $ billion , but higher losses than expected at an adjusted loss of $ per share versus a consensus of $ tesla also said that it had hit its goal of producing 5,000 model 3 cars per week `` multiple times '' throughout the month of july , and projected that they would produce between 50,000 and 55,000 model 3 units over the whole of q3 . the earnings call seemed to serve a dual purpose of elaborating on tesla 's progress and showing a humbled musk who also made a point of lavishing colleagues with praise for their `` mind-blowing '' achievements in the past quarter . ",
        "musk reiterated the company 's position that it will turn a profit in q3 , and took the forecast further in declaring that tesla will be profitable for every quarter from there on out . with a few caveats at least : it will be profitable barring events like a recession , or `` needing to pay back a loan , '' musk said . asked how tesla will fund massive projects like a china gigafactory , he said that it would turn to chinese banks . `` i think our default plan would be to essentially use a loan from the local banks in china and fund the gigafactory in shanghai with local debt ... we certainly could raise money but i think we do not need to . '' ",
        "musk also denied that a notice from the sec is preventing tesla from raising money , per the rumor that a wells notice is what 's keeping the company from fundraising . `` are we running low on money ? the answer is no , '' musk added on the call . tesla reported lower cash burn than expected , forecasting capital expenditures for 2018 of less than $ billion versus prior estimates of less than $ 3 billion . in the earnings release , tesla reported a cash pile of $ billion . its model 3 production numbers and sales are `` the most salient issues '' for tesla , said automotive analyst jeremy acevedo of edmunds : `` what they 're forecasting for q3 seems fairly aggressive and on pace . ",
        "it 'll be interesting to see if that 's sustainable through next quarter , '' said acevedo . investors took wednesday 's events as good news on the whole , with tesla 's stock up about 9 % in after-hours trading . "
