        "beyond human . prosthetic limbs have come a long way in recent years . from primitive designs that were little more than useless placeholders for the real thing , we now have high-tech devices that wearers can control with their thoughts . these prostheses can help people with missing limbs feel `` whole '' again . but in a new study , researchers set out to see if such devices could make humans more than , a pair of researchers from the advanced telecommunications research institute in japan wanted to know if giving someone a supernumerary robotic limb , a mind-controlled robotic limb that worked alongside the person 's two biological ones , could give that person multitasking abilities beyond those of the average published their research in the journal science robotics on july tasks , three hands . ",
        "for their study , the researchers asked 15 volunteers to sit in a chair with an srl positioned as if it were a third arm coming from their own body . on the head of each volunteer , the researchers placed special cap that tracked the brain 's electrical activity . the cap transmitted that data to a computer that then translated it into movement in the result : all a volunteer had to do to control the srl was think about an , they asked the volunteers to complete two tasks . to accomplish one -- balancing a ball on a board -- they used their natural limbs . ",
        "for the other , they used the srl system . the researchers asked the volunteers to complete the tasks sometimes separately , sometimes 20 trials , the volunteers successfully completed both tasks using the three limbs about 75 percent of the time . in other words , they were able to complete two tasks simultaneously that would have been essentially impossible with just two the brain . when you think you 're `` multitasking , '' you are n't actually paying attention to two things at once -- your brain just switches rapidly between the two tasks . past srl systems required the user to concentrate on just the task at fake hand -- this system is the first that could `` read '' a multitasking mind , sifting out the user 's intentions for the srl . ",
        "it can do this simply because it 's more advanced than previous researchers even believe their system could essentially help humans become better at multitasking even when they do n't have a third limb helping out . `` by operating this brain-machine interface , we have an idea that we may be able to train the brain itself , '' researcher shuichi nishio told the research will endeavor to figure out whether that 's true or not . if it is , we might be able to enhance our minds by temporarily enhancing our bodies .
