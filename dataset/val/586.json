        "in the promo for the final episodes of nashville season 6 , deacon sees rayna . was she really there in the nashville series finale or was it a teased us with that epic moment in the nashville series finale . we got a glimpse of rayna jaymes appearing to deacon . he even asked the question we were wondering : was it really true ? could rayna really be there considering she 'd been killed off in the middle of the fifth season ? well , the nashville finale has been and gone . we finally got our spoiler warning before i get into this . ",
        "really , that should be obvious but , well , ya know what some are like ! nashville -- photo credit : mark levine/cmt -- acquired via cmt pryes , rayna was there but not in the sense that we 'd like . as much as we wanted to wind the clock back to before the accident -- maybe even before that horrendous accident that nearly saw us lose rayna the first time when the series was on abc -- and find out that rayna was still alive , that was n't going to happen . realistically , we knew would have been a disservice to the fans if that was the route the show took , so i am glad they did n't . ",
        "we did get a deacon/rayna moment though in the nashville series -- photo credit : mark levine/cmt -- acquired via cmt prwe got a memory ; a beautiful memory of their wedding night . this was just perfect , as deacon thought back on his time with her before going out on stage . of all the people to break the memory , scarlett really was a perfect choice . she has been by deacon 's side through thick and thin . they 've both been there for each other more than anyone else has been there for them . ",
        "having scarlett there when the memory was broken was just what deacon then have deacon and rayna together on stage as charles esten and connie britton singing together with the rest of the cast was just the icing on the did you think of the way the nashville series finale brought rayna back into the story ? what did you think of that final moment ? share your thoughts in the comments you , nashville , for six wonderful years of storytelling . thank you , abc , for picking up the pilot to series six years ago . thank you , cmt , for snapping up the show when abc dropped it .
