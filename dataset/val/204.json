        "the miami dolphins are not practicing today as they get their first break since camp started a week ago . it 's been longer for the miami dolphins rookies reported on july 18th and the veterans followed on the 25th . now with five full practices in the can the players can take a breath and get out of the hot florida the past five days there has been some pretty good highlights and some lowlights . here is a look at the players that are showing up ready to play and the ones who are not making a case for a roster spot or at the very least not : the dolphins are generating positives on both sides of the ball and almost all of the media members have said that this team this year looks a lot different from years past . ",
        "in a positive way . that 's good because typically they are a sounding board for everything that is going wrong . not so much this year . granted it 's still on the riseisaiah ford -- the 2nd year receiver showed up to camp ready go and he has impressed everyone from the media to his coaches to his quarterback . ford is making a strong case for the final 53 but what he does in pre-season games will decide his tannehill -- tannehill is impressing everyone with his attitude , his passing motion , footwork , throws , and reads . ",
        "his knee is also , thus far , been a non-issue . oh , and he is showing a lot of amendola -- there is a definite rapport building between amendola and tannehill and this could be a big year for the receiver . his work ethic is starting to bleed over on other gesicki -- after a quite start , gesicki is making big plays and catches and his blocking is improving . he is generating a lot of positive wilson -- his speed has been impressive and the fact that he is now considered an `` outside '' guy means we will see more of him in the weeks to on the falldevante parker -- parker is not having a bad camp he just is n't having a great camp and for the dolphins and their fans , they want more . ",
        "parker needs to turn it carroo -- there is nothing special here because he has not practiced much . he had a clean-out procedure done in the off-season but he is clearly on the proverbial bubble this year and is losing on the risetorry mctyer -- he has earned time with the number one unit at corner and is impressing everyone with his speed and athleticism . he has turned a two-man competition between cordrea tankersley and tony lippett into a three-man lippett -- lippett is returning from his achilles injury of year ago and he looks better than he did before he got hurt . ",
        "lippett is bringing a lot to the three-man howard -- howard has basically taken devante parker out of the offense . he looks like a shut down corner which is what safety mcdonald called mcmillan -- there has n't been much about mcmillan outside of his leadership role but there has been nothing negative about him fitzpatrick -- the kid is a football player and so far he is impressing his fellow defensive players and the guys on offense . there is a learning curve and he seems to be finding his way through it . chase allen -- allen has intercepted two or three passes already and seems to be around the ball all of the time and in position to make plays . ",
        "the coaches are watching him closely and solid pre = season performances could land him a starting job on the outside linebacker on the fallno one -- there has not been a lot of negatives through the first week of practice . not enough to say someone is practicing their way out of a roster spot . there are good competitions going on and the players are getting better each teamsjason sanders -- sanders has a `` leg '' up on his competition . he has been very good through camp so far and while i am sure he has missed a field goal or two there has n't been any mention of it . ",
        "he did make all of his kicks the first day of practice including from over 50 joseph -- joseph has not had a comparable camp to sanders and it appears that it is sanders ' job to lose unless the dolphins bring in a veteran to compete . "
