",
        "the company says that creating a healthier social network has short-term consequences but predicts the changes will contribute to long-term growth . following a major rule overhaul last year , twitter is continuing to respond to user criticism on how the platform handles abuse and its report , twitter says the network is now removing twice as many accounts for violating spam policies as it did last year , identifying 9 million potential spam accounts every week and preventing 50,000 fewer spam sign-ups each day . that results in 8,000 fewer average spam reports on the network every of the spam numbers are caught at sign-up and never included in the company 's user count , however , so the drive to curb spam is n't responsible for that one million user drop .
