        "chicago public schools officials are digging out from another barbara byrd-bennett scandal , three years after the former cps ceo departed the district in short : gary solomon and thomas vranas , two now-imprisoned byrd-bennett cronies , allegedly pocketed $ 294,000 to help camelot education open several cps campuses , according to the district 's inspector general , nicholas schuler . he says the company also hired a former high-ranking cps administrator -- an official who had resigned from the district during an internal misconduct investigation -- `` as part of a ` wink-wink ' agreement that solomon brokered on byrd-bennett 's behalf . '' ",
        "camelot has received more than $ 67 million in cps business , schuler note this case is separate from the kickback scandal that landed byrd-bennett , solomon and vranas in camelot report at first may seem like ancient history ; most of the alleged misconduct happened between 2012 and 2014 . but if the ig 's findings are accurate , then camelot opened several alternative schools to serve dropouts not by bidding fairly , but by corruptly paying for ig report is another terrible stain on chicago board of education oversight and the district 's problem-plagued procurement process . if most of the district 's board members from this era had n't already stepped down , we 'd be calling for all of them to resign should happen now that schuler has alerted chicagoans ? ",
        "the district has started a punitive process that likely will end either in a negotiated settlement or in shuttering camelot 's schools and barring the company from doing business in chicago again . camelot disputes schuler 's findings . `` we competed for and won the board of education 's contract fairly and on our merits , '' camelot ceo andrew morrison 's top recommendation : zero tolerance for corruption . that sounds right to us , especially since two top executives allegedly involved in the cps case remain at camelot , schuler camelot from chicago will have to be done carefully . ",
        "camelot operates several high-performing alternative schools in the district . these schools serve many students who have dropped out of , or been expelled from , traditional schools . we 've met some of these students and heard about their struggles with personal and family demons . reaching these teens with the right instruction and counseling , and helping them graduate , is a says state law would prohibit camelot school closures at least until august 2019 . fair enough -- that gives cps time to plan for a seamless transition to one or more honest schools and transferring students elsewhere risks disrupting these students ' education yet again . ",
        "but other high-quality contractors would eagerly bid for the chance to run schools in chicago . cps should open the bidding and give everyone a chance to educate these 's our top recommendation , and schuler 's as well . if closing those schools would prove too disruptive , schuler recommends a lesser punishment : fine camelot at least $ million -- one-tenth of its chicago revenue -- and appoint an independent monitor to track the company over the next three schuler 's allegations are true , then fining and monitoring this company are n't enough . camelot allegedly cheated to get cps ' business . ",
        "children learn that cheating brings punishment . the chicago board of education should end camelot 's reign in chicago . "
