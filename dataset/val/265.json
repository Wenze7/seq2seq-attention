        "the cdc has linked the current salmonella outbreak to backyard chickens in multiple states . since the year 2000 , 70 salmonella outbreaks have been associated with live poultry . according to the centers for disease control and prevention , 212 people have already fallen ill with salmonella in over 40 states . what are some important steps to take to reduce the chances of getting infections from backyard chickens ? salmonella outbreakas of the latest update , 88 more people were reported to be infected with salmonella , bringing the total number of salmonella infections up to 212 . ",
        "the illnesses began in february of this year , with 34 of the ill requiring hospitalization . fortunately , no deaths are linked to the multistate so far link the illnesses to contact with chicks and ducklings that came from multiple sources and hatcheries . in fact , 72 percent of the ill who were available for interviews reported having contact with chicks or ducklings in the week before they fell ill , the animals having come from either hatcheries , websites , feed supply stores , and even investigations are still ongoing , but 22 of the isolates from the ill people contained genes that are expected to have some form of resistance to common antibiotics such as ampicillin , ciprofloxacin , tetracycline , gentamicin , and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid . ",
        "because of this antibiotic resistance , some of the infections may require other kinds of chickensmore and more people have been keeping chickens in their own backyards , but while it is a great experience for many , it also increases the risks of getting illnesses and infections from being in close contact with the chickens . in fact , cdc data reveals that there have been 70 salmonella outbreaks linked to backyard chickens since the year 2000 , resulting in over 4,700 illnesses , almost 900 hospitalizations , and seven infections may be gotten from chickens ' bodies and droppings , even when they look clean and healthy . ",

",
        "it 's also important to remember not to eat or drink in the chickens ' area and to not kiss or snuggle chickens should not be allowed to roam or live inside the house , particularly in parts of the house where food and drinks are stored , prepared , or served . children , the elderly , and other people with weakened immune systems should not be allowed to handle live poultry , and it is also wise to have separate footwear for taking care of the chickens to be kept outside of the house at all times .
