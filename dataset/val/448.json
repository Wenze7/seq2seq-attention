        "if a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step , how does a comfort food tour begin ? with a single recipe ? with a kind word ? with a generous , loving offer of safe harbor ? emily nunn 's journey of a thousand miles began with all of those things , leading her down a road reconnecting with friends and family she had thought lost to her , and into a kind of healing she needed more than anything in life , and which she thought would never come . eventually , it led to `` the comfort food diaries : my quest for the perfect dish to mend a broken heart , '' her singular , poignant and beautifully written memoir chronicling that search in vignettes so personal and at times so dark yet moving , that the words will rip your heart right out of you . ",
        "`` when i started , i was so broken , '' nunn said in an interview from her north carolina home . `` it 's hard to explain how completely lost i was . `` she wanted to cook with and be around people -- people who maybe had difficult lives -- `` i wanted to see how they did it . '' how they is a journalist and food writer . a southerner , born and raised in virginia but living in north carolina now , she writes freelance for such publications as food52 . her comfort food tour was born in chicago after a particularly cruel fall from what seemed the top of the nearly 10 years at the new yorker , she moved to chicago about 15 years ago to take up arts and food writing for the tribune , a job she loved . ",
        "in 2008 , she moved to good eating , where she wrote deftly about such topics as her love of the toum at fattoush restaurant , or her fangirl crush on ina garten . i was a fan of nunn 's writing , but i did n't know her well . certainly not well enough to know what was going on in her life away from trib 2009 , she had been laid off by the paper , like so many in those dark days of tribune 's bankruptcy . i did n't know what she was up to , where she was living or how she 'd find work in a recession , when like hundreds of other facebook friends , i read her raw cry for help in the nunn recounts in the book : `` one night i drank several glasses of sauvignon blanc and , in a fit of uncensored self-pity , broadcast the details of my wrecked life on facebook for the unsolicited elucidation of around 350 so-called friends . ",
        "`` nunn was struggling with much more than a lost job . her brother had killed himself , her fiance had broken off the engagement -- and basically taken away his daughter , whom nunn had come to love as if she were her own . in the book , nunn reconstructed that post , writing , in part : `` i have almost no money , no job , no home , no car , no child to pick up after school , no dog to feed , no one to care for . i am cold and alone '' -- and she was drinking again after being sober for next morning , she expected a `` virtual scolding '' in an avalanche of facebook comments , but instead woke up to an outpouring of love , offers of help and empathetic admissions of painful struggles . ",
        "this , from distant friends and relatives and people she did n't even know well from across the country . come visit , they said . we 'll cook for you . which meant , we 'll take care of you . we 'll ease the hurt . make it a culinary tour , said a former sorority sister from savannah , eileen . and this seemingly crazy idea , from an old new yorker friend , kevin : `` it should be your comfort food tour . `` in short , that 's what nunn did . she launched a comfort food tour , and it was brilliant . ",
        "though real life is not as pat as a mickey rooney-judy garland plot , as nunn references , the idea appealed because it gave nunn something to do . `` i had to have this project : ` come and we 'll make comfort food for you , ' '' nunn said . there was n't much of a plan , at first . `` it was n't fleshed out . but it ended up being much deeper and richer . it ended up really changing my life . it 's about this path i had to take . '' ",
        "`` comfort food diaries '' is not an addiction and recovery book , per se ; nunn handles that subject quickly . ",
        "she does n't dismiss it ; she gives it weight -- including a breakdown that led to a psychiatric ward stay and a separate stint at the betty ford center -- but she spends her time with the reader talking about other things : focusing on how she got to where she was in life and how to be tour started in earnest with a visit to her cousin toni in atlanta and continued with visits to other family members and friends : her aunt mariah in virginia , her sorority sister portia on her georgia farm , wyler in athens , ga. .",
        "dot in north carolina . all along the journey , she allowed these people who loved her to cook for her , to comfort her -- generosity she had n't felt worthy of accepting before , and which continually surprised and humbled her . `` comfort food diaries '' chronicles those visits in frank detail , the restorative conversations , the affirmations of long-ago cemented bonds , and because it 's a culinary memoir , nunn shares recipes , 56 in all . they finish off a story or underscore an emotional homecoming . each illustrates a memory or acts as a coda to a chapter -- martha 's virginia sweet chunk pickles , angel biscuits and great-grandmother 's mean lemon cake . ",
        "and there 's nunn 's spoon recipe illustrates nunn 's message . she writes about first tasting spoon bread at the roanoake hotel when she was 10 : `` what was this stuff that made me want to push everyone out of the way in order to eat their serving ? '' it took a good deal of work to get the results she wanted , which makes it all the more , however , suggested i include a dish she made with north pond chef and owner bruce sherman , cheesy eggs on toast . at one point during her journey , nunn was living in charleston , , but came to understand it was n't right . ",
        "`` it had all the signs of home , but it did n't feel like a home to me . so i split . that 's when i needed to face chicago down , '' she went to see sherman , whom she had covered while working for the tribune . at the restaurant , they cooked the eggs on a portable burner in the dining room , because the staff was prepping for lunch , while she asked sherman about how he came to start the restaurant . from the story about the path he took , nunn took inspiration for her own -- `` trust who you are , what you do , eventually you ca n't be anything other than yourself , '' he told is why nunn suggested that we share the recipe , but also , she enthused : `` that dish is freaking awesome . ",
        "`` but about that subtitle , `` my quest for the perfect dish to mend a broken heart . '' book publishing and the need for a hook being what they are , it was n't quite accurate . nunn was n't really looking for a dish to mend a broken heart , nor was the broken heart caused by the man . it was everything : her family , her brother 's death , losing her job , the breakup . `` the man was a small part of it . was what led me to the man , '' she said , explaining that the quest became : `` what happened in my family to make me this way ? ",
        "`` and that 's what she set out to discover . `` it 's kind of like a hero 's story . you face these dragons . i would take a step forward , and i would realize something , and i would take a step back . i was leaving my comfort zone and taking a step toward a dark past . `` i also learned something : it was like the crumbs back to me . it was my crumb trail , but i was spreading the crumbs . i was deciding where the crumbs were . that part of the book was really amazing . ",
        "`` and she came to look at cooking she lived in chicago , she cooked a lot . `` i really enjoyed that part of being part of the family . but one thing that i really started to be aware of on this path , i became comfortable in other people 's kitchens . i just did it . that 's who i am now . i 'll cook for you . does n't have to be the perfect ingredients . the idea of having a dinner party was really stressful in chicago , but i do n't worry now . ",
        "`` did she ever really find the answer to her quest ? this is where she said she might cry . `` it 's like the really corny line : it 's the journey . you have to keep going with your life . the journey became the end . `` did i find the perfect dish ? no , of course not . did i find what was missing from my life ? yes , i did . really true connections with human beings . saying yes to things , not being afraid . '' `` it was not the idea of wrapping it up into a neat little bow at the end . ",
        "that is never what i was after . i was after finding out how to live , how other people live . '' an open heart with kindness , forgiveness . not a wary way . `` i 'm a completely different person now . not completely different , but i 'm changed . my relationship to things , the way things look , achievements , the exterior signs of a great life , i 'm a lot less attached to those things now . `` i live in a barn , and i 'm happy . the things i valued in people changed a lot .
