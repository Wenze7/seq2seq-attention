        "ridgefield -- beer drinkers might soon be able to grab a snack on their way out of route 7 's nod hill brewery , thanks to a new ordinance that will let the business apply to have one or more food trucks in its parking lot . the new rule -- approved almost unanimously by more than 50 voters in a town meeting this week -- creates an exception for breweries and wineries to a 2016 rule that does not allow mobile food vendors in one spot for more than 15 minutes , except for two food trucks that were grandfathered in . ",
        "it was sent to a town meeting after nearly 400 residents , or more than 2 percent of voters , signed nod hill brewery 's petition , which requires the town to hold a vote on the proposal . supporters argued the food truck option would help the popular brewery continue to attract business to ridgefield . `` we are an integral part of the town and we want to continue to be that way for a long time , '' co-owner robert kaye told the crowd wednesday . `` this will help . '' the ordinance allows breweries and wineries to apply for permits for food trucks as long as they only operate on that property and during the `` general hours '' of the business . ",
        "some selectmen and residents worried the `` general hours '' language was too vague or that the food trucks could create parking problems . but kaye agreed to say on the record at the meeting that the truck would not stay on the property after the business closes , except maybe for a short time to break down . first selectman rudy marconi said , as with any business , the police department would handle any parking problems . one nearby restaurant owner said he worried the food truck would unfairly draw customers away from other businesses . `` right now the way i see it , it benefits one party and it will hurt every brick-and-mortar business on that street , '' he said . ",
        "others , though , argued that the brewery and food truck will attract different customers than a sit-down dining experience . some said , too , that helping nod hill be successful means more business for the town as a whole , since it will draw customers from other towns into ridgefield . `` we should do whatever we can to encourage a new business and let the market dictate , '' one resident said . `` if the food trucks do n't make money , they go away . if they do , bully for the owners .
