        "a year ago , norma sanchez and ambrocio carrera were on the verge of losing their east oakland home -- staring down a massive rent hike and with no hope of affording a new place close to their jobs or their three sons ' , thanks to an innovative strategy gaining traction in the bay area , not only did the family stay put , they 're on their way to owning that home . `` it 's very emotional , '' carrera said in spanish . `` it 's something that , in the beginning , you do n't believe . ",
        "but here we are . `` sanchez and carrera held onto their home with the help of a community land trust -- an organization that buys up residential properties , keeps ownership of the ground beneath the buildings and then rents or sells the units back to low-income residents at a discount . it 's an unusual strategy that does two things traditional government-subsidized affordable housing does not -- it guarantees the property will remain affordable forever , and it gives residents the chance to build equity in their soaring prices continue to squeeze bay area renters , leaving both cities and affordable-housing advocates desperate for solutions , community land trusts are becoming an increasingly attractive option . ",
        "there are at least seven operating in the bay area , including in oakland , san francisco , east palo alto and sonoma county . and though the average resident likely has n't heard of the wonky concept , the trusts have secured affordable housing for dozens of families . `` there is really a resurgent interest in this model , because we see that so many other approaches are not really measurably moving the needle in terms of the crisis , '' said steve king , executive director of the oakland community land trust , which bought carrera 's and sanchez 's the house from the land under it is a key piece of the land trust strategy because it acts as a safeguard to ensure the property can never again be sold at market rate . ",
        "instead , if the owners decide to sell , they go through the land trust , which sets a price that keeps the unit affordable for the next low-income family . `` it 's sort of this rearrangement or this reconfiguration of what property ownership really means , '' king oakland community land trust received $ 974,150 from the city earlier this year and also pulls in funding from foundations , banks and other sources . since 2010 , the trust has purchased 20 single-family homes , two mixed-use buildings and one seven-unit live-work building . `` the city thinks very highly of community land trusts , '' said darin ranelletti , oakland 's policy director for housing security -- a role mayor libby schaaf created this year to address the housing shortage . ",
        "`` we think that they 're a great model . `` on the other side of the bay , the san francisco community land trust controls 13 properties , including one across the street from the transamerica pyramid . residents of that 21-unit apartment building each pay a $ 10,000 deposit , plus monthly mortgage payments , to own a stake in their building . `` it 's one of the very few tools we have to provide a way to home ownership for the very low-income folks of san francisco , '' said tyler macmillan , the land trust 's organizational housing land trust of sonoma county , which houses nearly 80 families , is an official part of the local government 's affordable-housing strategy . ",
        "when new low-income units are built , cities hand them over to the land trust , which then sells them to low-income residents at an affordable trust fever has spread to east palo alto as well , where former mayor duane bay is launching the pahali community land trust . he 's working on buying three properties -- two single-family homes and a vacant lot where he hopes to build 41-year-old sanchez , who works cleaning homes in san jose , and 45-year-old carrera , who works at a togo 's in pleasanton , the oakland land trust saved their two-bedroom home . ",
        "last august their landlord , steve kalmbach , notified them he intended to double their rent -- raising it from $ 1,200 to $ 2,400 . under california 's costa hawkins law -- which voters will decide whether to repeal in november -- single-family homes are exempt from rent and carrera fought back with protests and petitions , and the rent hike was put on hold . but then the landlord began making plans to sell the property , leading them to fear they would be kicked out by the new owner . they began trying to convince kalmbach to sell to the oakland community land trust . ",
        "after a year of contentious negotiations -- which included the family picketing kalmbach 's piedmont home on halloween , and sanchez and carrera 's 15-year-old son , jonatan , putting his fist through the `` for sale '' sign in the front yard in a moment of despair -- kalmbach agreed to sell for $ 335,000 . he could not be reached for the family pays $ 1,800 a month in rent to the land trust , and in a few years they 'll have the option to funnel some of that money toward a down payment . they pay $ 50 a month to lease the land under the home from the land 28-year-old javier prescott first heard about land trusts , he was reluctantly considering moving to oregon with his fiance to start a family because they could n't afford to buy a home in the bay area . ",
        "a sonoma county native , prescott works as lead custodian for the county 's office of education , and his fiance is a bartender studying to be a year , they did something they never thought they 'd be able to do -- they bought a house in petaluma for $ 323,000 with the help of the housing land trust of sonoma county . they pay $ 2,197 for the mortgage -- about 25 percent of their combined incomes -- plus $ 90 a month to lease the ground under the house . `` oh my god , you do n't even understand how amazing it feels to be a homeowner in sonoma county , '' prescott said . ",
        "`` the housing market is just so overwhelming , that someone my age -- it 's not even a thought . `` if they sell the house , the price will be tied to the area 's median income gains , not the housing market 's fluctuations . so if the median income in sonoma county rose 10 percent , for example , they could sell the house for 10 percent more than what they does n't mind not making a windfall . `` since i was kind of gifted with this awesome situation , i do n't really have any kind of issue paying it forward , '' he community land trust model also can prevent small businesses from being the owner of a mixed-use building on 23rd avenue in east oakland decided to sell , the tenants raised $ 90,000 during an eight-week crowd-funding campaign -- enough for a down payment .

        "the oakland land trust put that money toward buying the building in april and now is training the residents to manage the property themselves , as a collective , with the idea that their rent payments will become mortgage payments in about 10 the residents -- which include families and individuals , as well as nonprofits renting office space -- are figuring out how to do everything from fix sinks to conduct safety audits of fire extinguishers . the former was a skill they needed almost as soon as they signed the contract , said devi peacock , founder of peacock rebellion -- a queer and trans arts and culture group that rents space in the building . ",
        "`` it was so emotional , because we 're like , ` oh my god we signed , ' and then almost right away a sink broke , '' peacock said . `` we cheered . because you know what ? it was like our problem now . and what a thrilling feeling . '' "
