        "kris bryant 's talents are virtually impossible to replace , but it appears that ian happ will handle a large majority of the third base duties while the cubs slugger heals from a left shoulder injury . `` happ has more experience there , '' manager joe maddon said before starting happ for the fourth time in five games since bryant was sidelined . `` he 's more comfortable there , and i kind of like it . `` the other options are tommy la stella , who is used more frequently as a pinch-hitter , and rookie david is a second baseman by trade , but bote has impressed maddon around the infield as well as at the plate , where he 's batting .
