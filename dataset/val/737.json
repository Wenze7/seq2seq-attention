        "with rafael devers on the disabled list , rumors are swirling about the red sox checking in on a former sox third baseman . could we see a surprise infield addition ? with less than a day to go before the trade deadline , the rumors were guaranteed to fly . they always do . and there are always some interesting ones floating about . but late monday night a truly interesting rumor hit twitter . with starting third baseman rafael devers on the disabled list , the boston red sox have apparently had conversations with the texas rangers about bringing adrian beltre back to fenway park . ",
        "beltre spent the 2010 season in boston , and was beloved while there , but signed a long term deal with the rangers that played in 154 games that season , blasting 28 hr with a . 321 / . 365 / . 553 triple slash while providing exceptional defense . these days the glove may be closer to average , but at 39 years old , that 's still mighty impressive . and the bat has n't dried up , either . the 30 home run power is gone , but he still boasts a . 292 / . ",
        "342 / . 404 slash . he offers a significantly higher floor than devers , though the 21-year-old 's power keeps his ceiling higher than the rangers third would this trade mean for devers ? the first thing that comes to mind is that devers ' hamstring injury is worse than the team is letting on . the latest on his condition is that he feels pretty good and does n't expect to be out more than the minimum 10 days . but this is the same team that had their manager claiming mitch moreland was only out for a routine day off the day before admitting it was because of a sore knee . ",
        "while the belichickian antics are not unappreciated , it 's tough to feel completely sure that devers really feels as good as he even if devers is back on august 8 , an adrian beltre trade makes some sense . one of the areas in which devers needs the most help is with the glove . who better to teach him than one of the best defensive third basemen of the last two decades ? the mentoring alone might be worth the price in trade chips . add to that the fact that devers is managing just a 57 wrc + against left handed pitching this year , whereas beltre sits at 116 . ",
        "a straight platoon could be used the rest of the way . with christian vazquez not due back before september , the team would n't even need to clear a roster spot to make this work . tzu-wei lin could be optioned back to pawtucket leaving a starting infield of rafael devers , xander bogaerts , brock holt , mitch moreland and sandy leon with blake swihart , steve pearce , eduardo nunez and adrian beltre on the bench until rosters expand . that 's some impressive dustin pedroia makes it back before september , the red sox would have a difficult decision to make , but at this point it 's getting a little tough to imagine that happening .
