        "but zillow says it 's simply responding to the majority of renters it recently surveyed for the upcoming 2018 zillow group consumer housing trends report . the new survey found that most apartment dwellers have less than three months to find housing , so streamlining the process could be a huge improvement . `` renters tell us they want the entire rental process to happen online , from search to application to payment , '' zillow president jeremy wacksman said in a statement . `` however , most landlords do n't have the resources to offer these services . we 're excited to provide the technology to help renters and landlords have a better experience .
