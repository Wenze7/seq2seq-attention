        "so far it has been a `` meh '' year for investors . we did see a bit of volatility in the first half with the market peaking in january , a good , old-fashioned correction of at least 10 % , and some scratching and clawing to get back to par . my thought is it will take the market most of the summer to figure it out , but figure it out it will . personally , i think all this hand-wringing about tariffs and trade wars is missing the forest because of the trees . what the real underlying issue is , will rising interest rates and the fed removing liquidity from the system hurt the economy long-term ? ",
        "the trade and tariff thing are short-term and will soon be resolved and forgotten . liquidity and the access to capital are the straws that stir the drink , however , and have a real impact on earnings and subsequently dividends , which we all know are what drives stock prices . it remains to be seen what the second half of the year will bring , but my thought remains the market will end the year in the black . i do n't think it will be a barnburner by any stretch of the imagination , but something okay , perhaps in the 6 % to 8 % range . ",
        "so far , weyco group is the clear first-half winner . that tjx companies is having an excellent year is not really news , they are after all the best at what they do . then we have those that confound me , like franklin resources , which is practically printing money as their economic internals are off the charts . lastly is the head-scratcher of all time , philip morris international . this is pretty simple : a lot of people like the effects of nicotine . tobacco is the cheapest and most widely available nicotine delivery system . ",
        "there is no worldwide health craze emerging where tobacco will go the way of the dodo bird . any analyst that tells you otherwise has been smoking something besides tobacco . accordingly , phillip morris and franklin resources are clearly double down stocks , and ibm is a gift waiting to be discovered . if i were constructing the lucky 13 today i would definitely add 3m company , abbvie inc. . , and cummins inc. . . if i could get air products & chemicals at $ 147 or lower , johnson & johnson at $ 113 or lower , and american express at $ 86 or lower i would be all over it .
