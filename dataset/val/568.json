        "when the traded for tavon austin this offseason , did they envision pairing him with cole beasley to give opposing defenses nightmares ? when the drafted north carolina receiver ryan switzer in the fourth round of the 2017 nfl draft , some analysts were confused by the selection . as one of the most prolific special teams returners in college history , his role as a specialist was switzer did not seem to fit a role on the cowboys offense as the 5-foot-8 , 185 pound was clearly a slot receiver . and dallas already possessed one of the top slot receivers in the nfl in cole beasley . ",
        "switzer simply appeared to be a result was the young slot receiver saw very limited snaps on offense his rookie year and he was traded to the oakland raiders this offseason for defensive tackle jihad dallas did something a bit strange . they traded for another slot receiver in former first-rounder tavon austin , from the los angeles rams . after parting ways with switzer , bringing in austin seemed like a similarly inept austin brings another dimension to dallas than switzer could provide . that being one of a dynamic playmaker who can line up in multiple positions including running back . ",
        "in fact , early rumors were that the cowboys intended to use austin as a wed/change of pace back to spell starter ezekiel , the cowboys have used austin exclusively at wide receiver this offseason . and despite his slight 5-foot-8 , 179-pound frame , that includes using him on the outside . in fact , dallas has also been experimenting with putting the similarly-sized beasley on the outside as well . there have actually been plays where both diminutive receivers have lined up on the outside at the same 's what cowboys offensive coordinator scott linehan told 's gregg rosenthal about this unique duo just last week . ",
        "`` there could be three plays in a row where tavon lines up in three different positions . i think add very effective matchup potential together with us . it 's proven . not just like he 's done it in college . we 've seen him do it in the pros . '' despite their lack of size , it 's their quickness and speed that could make tavon austin and cole beasley a lethal combination in dallas next season . the cowboys are clearly experimenting with new ways to open up their passing game . perhaps they 've just discovered the next dynamic duo in big d. regardless , the combo of austin and beasley should be fun to watch .
