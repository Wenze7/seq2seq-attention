        "i 'm frankly appalled by what i 'm seeing in the ipo marketplace right now . a whopping 120 companies have raised just over $ 35 billion through the first half of the year on stock exchanges . that puts 2018 on track to be the second-busiest ipo year since ... drumroll please ... the 2000 peak of the dot-com bubble . if the companies coming out of the chute were solid ones with long histories of profitable operations and time-tested business models , i would n't worry . but the sludge that 's running down wall street is entirely different . ",
        "take a company called iqiyi . it 's a chinese video streaming service majority-owned by baidu that 's been operating since 2010 . unfortunately , in every single one of those eight years , it lost money . that includes $ 554 million in 2017 , $ 463 million in 2016 and $ 410 million in 2015 . what about the future ? it must look better or the `` netflix of china '' would n't have been able to go public in a march ipo that raised $ billion , right ? nope ! as of june , analysts were forecasting losses to surge to $ 789 million in 2018 and $ 723 million in 2019 . ",
        "again , let me repeat that for emphasis : eight years of operation ... eight years of losses ... and another $ in losses likely over the next 2 years . yet for a time , investors piled into iq shares like the company was spinning straw into gold . the stock soared from its $ 18 ipo price to more than $ 46 in mid-june , a gain of 155 % in just a few weeks . but iq is far from alone . take dropbox . it lost $ million in 2015 , $ million in 2016 and another $ million in 2017 . ",
        "yet it went public in march , raising $ 756 million . spotify racked up red ink of $ 268 million in 2015 , $ 629 million in 2016 and a stunning $ billion in 2017 . yet it went public through a direct listing in april that valued the company at around $ 27 billion . those are just the ones you 've probably heard of because they get so much digital ink . there are plenty of also-rans and `` me too '' companies slinging their shares , just like two decades ago . take hyrecar , whose business model revolves around connecting wannabe uber and lyft drivers with people who have idle cars they do n't mind renting out to them . ",
        "it managed to raise $ million last month despite the fact it sported operating losses of $ 800,000 in 2016 and $ million in 2017 . or how about domo inc. . , the cloud computing company ? it raised $ 193 million in june ... despite losing $ 176 million in fiscal 2018 and $ 183 million in 2017 . then there 's bilibili , a chinese provider of online entertainment including videos , mobile games and anime content . it lost $ 57 million in 2015 , $ 129 million in 2016 , and $ 34 million in 2017 ... yet still managed to raise $ 483 million in its march ipo . ",
        "another chinese tech play , the `` used car e-commerce platform '' uxin , followed bilibili with its own $ 225 million ipo . that 's money it could really use , considering it racked up operating losses of $ million in 2016 and $ 270 million in 2017 . of course , money-losing , traditional tech companies are n't the only wing-and-a-prayer firms with their hands out . money-losing biotechs have been raising gobs of money , too . in a single 24-hour period -- june 20-21 -- five biotechs priced their ipos . they raised a total of around $ 460 million , making it the most active day for biotech deals in history . ",
        "yet not a single one of them was profitable . that included avrobio , with full-year 2017 losses of $ million , aptiny , with 2017 losses of $ million , magenta therapeutics , with losses of $ million , kezar life sciences , with losses of $ million and xeris pharmaceuticals , with losses of $ million . for good measure , eidos therapeutics went public a day earlier . it lost $ million in 2017 . so , what do i think about the tech ipo mania ? what do i believe the future holds for many of these companies , the ones gobbling up billions of dollars in capital like pac-man on a blue ghost bender ? ",
        "well , more than halfthe dot-com darlings of the late 1990s eventually went up in smoke . not every one of the companies i just mentioned is destined for the dustbin of history . but given the gobs and gobs of red ink they 're racking up , and the half-baked business models many of them are pursuing , there will be financial carnage . lots of it . heck , it may not even take all that long to get started . that 's because many of the stocks are already tanking ! bottom line : when you combine the ipo frenzy with all the other manic market behavior out there , you do n't exactly get a happy-go-lucky picture of market stability . ",
        "instead , it looks exactly like what you 'd expect to see in the final death throes of a deflating `` everything bubble . '' wall street analysts and the mainstream financial press want to talk fang , fang , fang -lrb- facebook , apple , netflix , alphabet all day long . that 's because these `` hot '' stocks boost their ratings , commissions and fund inflows . but with the yield curve collapsing ... the federal reserve raising rates steadily ... and signs of credit stress increasing by the day , mark my words : those ultra-high-risk companies are likely headed straight into a brick wall . ",
        "so , the only sensible course of action in my book is to : continue to maintain a much higher cash position than in years past . the model portfolio currently has about 40 % in cash , up sharply from our previous fully invested stance . move up the quality scale for any remaining stocks you hold . by that , i mean get rid of higher-risk garbage names like those i just mentioned . focus instead on higher-rated , higher-yielding , more stable names . hedge against weakness -- or target downside profits -- using specialized tools like inverse etfs . ",
        "the proshares ultrashort financials and proshares ultrashort euro are two i 've zeroed in on so far , and they 're both working out nicely for you . by : mike larson , editor of safe money report . via moneyshow . apple , alphabet and facebook are holdings in jim cramer 's action alerts plus member club . want to be alerted before jim cramer buys or sells aapl , googl or fb ? learn more now .
