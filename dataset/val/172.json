        "the trade deadline is getting close , and the same would seem to be true for the white sox 's two best prospects . but general manager rick hahn continues to insist that eloy jimenez and michael kopech still have work to do in triple a. `` one thing i can promise is that our focus is unwavering in terms of putting this organization in the best spot for the long term , '' hahn said . `` we 're not going to take any shortcuts or make any short-term , satisfying moves that potentially could cause any impact on these guys not meeting their potential . ",
        "`` while the arrival of jimenez and kopech could lessen the pain of nights such as friday , when reynaldo lopez served up five home runs and walked four in 4 1/3 innings in a 10-5 loss to the blue jays , the sox front office unsurprisingly remains focused on 2019 and beyond , not salvaging this it is fun to think what the sox will have when they do unwrap jimenez , who is hitting . 328 with 16 homers and a . 958 ops between double a and triple a , and kopech , who in his last three starts has struck out 24 and allowed four earned runs in 17 innings . ",
        "`` both of them are going to be really amazing players , '' said reliever tyler danish , who was promoted from charlotte on friday . `` they 're going to have special futures here . `` kopech has gotten better in each start i 've seen him in the last month-and-a-half . eloy 's obviously a special human being in what he does . you see it on a daily basis . `` yoan moncada was promoted from triple a shortly after hahn made a series of midseason trades last season . but there 's little feeling that he 's currently working on an avisail garcia trade , which would open the door for jimenez . ",
        "`` those guys are going to tell us when they 're ready , and when they 're ready there 's going to be opportunity for them in chicago '' ' hahn said . `` it 's up to us to figure out how to create that opportunity , but we 'll figure it out . we 're not going to wait for the market to allow us to free a spot for a guy if it 's time for his development to take that next step . `` finding a spot for kopech would not appear that appears to be tiring in his first full season as a major-league starter as he has allowed 21 earned runs in 212/3 innings over his last four starts . ",
        "his era has climbed from to over that move to a six-man rotation would ease the strain on all the sox starters down the stretch , but there 's no guarantee the sox will promote kopech in granderson and lourdes gurriel jr. . homered on the second and third pitches of the game , and randal grichuk homered in the second inning as the blue jays built a 5-0 lead that grew to 10-1 before the sox started pecking away at hit his second homer of the game in the fourth and kendrys morales hit one off lopez in the manager rick renteria and pitching coach don cooper were ejected in the top of the first after third-base umpire fieldin culbreth ruled that morales had checked his swing on a 3-2 pitch .
