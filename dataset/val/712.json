",
        "it 's one more than 599 . `` the guys in melvin 's clubhouse saw the achievement in a different light . `` we 're all happy for him , '' mark canha said after going 2 for 4 with a pair of doubles and an rbi . `` we all love that guy . he 's our fearless leader . it 's a pleasure to play for him . `` the a 's allowed melvin to reach the milestone by continuing the offensive assault they started with their 10-1 win over the blue jays davis led the charge at the plate , capping off a remarkable month of baseball by singling in the first , blasting his ninth home run of july in the third and ripping an rbi single in the sixth . ",
        "davis ' 29 rbi are the second-most in july during the franchise 's oakland era behind the 35 runs brought in by jose canseco in davis ' 29th homer landed a ways above the `` holy toledo '' sign in center , melvin was more dazzled by his run-scoring single . `` what i 'm most impressed by is the base hit single that drives in the sixth run , '' he said . `` you watch him take bp now and it 's more of a hitter 's bp . it 's not necessarily just a power hitter 's bp . ",
        "he hits the other way in one continuous round and his bat control 's gotten better and better since we 've seen him here . `` he 's drawing more walks . he 's more dangerous . `` in addition to davis ' offense , matt olson went 2 for 4 with two rbi , bringing in nick martini and matt chapman with a single in the their three-run third , the a 's achieved a pair of uncommon feats on the same play . semien and canha pulled off a double steal , which included a swipe of home plate with rickey henderson present in the facility . ",
        "canha managed to sneak home after luke maile attempted to throw out semien at second , sliding foot first under the catcher 's tag . he said he 's expecting compliments on his slide from baseball 's all-time stolen base king . `` i went before got rid of it , '' said canha , who also stole home last season on a similar play . `` if he 'd pulled that down and took a look at me , i would have been hosed . `` chapman also participated in the 11-hit parade , doubling in the sixth after walking in the first , reaching base in a career-best 17th consecutive game . ",
        "chapman , who leads all defensive players in runs saved , also made a remarkable play in the field , chasing down a grounder with the shift on , pivoting , jumping and throwing out aledmys diaz as his momentum carried him toward foul territory in the called the chapman 's defense `` video game-ish , '' before suggesting that a video game probably `` has n't seen that before . `` starting pitcher trevor cahill appeared to agree . `` he just plays like his hair 's on fire out there . he 's all over the infield , '' the right-hander said . ",
        "`` that play he made with the jump throw -- how he 's able to make those throws like that off balance and it seems like they 're always on the money , too . `` on a day when the a 's failed to solidify their starting rotation by acquiring a starter before the nonwaiver trade deadline , cahill continued his dominance at the oakland coliseum in his 200th major league start . he recovered from a rocky first in which he gave up a run off a double and a single , surrendering two earned runs off five hits and two walks over six only blemish after the opening frame was justin smoak 's leadoff homer in the fourth . ",
        "`` he battled , '' melvin said . `` early on , i 'm not sure his command was as good as it normally is . he got better and better as he went along . the next thing you know he gets his six innings , and six innings makes it a lot easier on us . `` despite the quality start , cahill 's home era jumped from to as he gave up just his fourth and fifth earned runs at the coliseum this win moved the a 's to within a game of the seattle mariners for the second wild-card spot in the american league . ",
        "they remain five games behind the houston astros for first place in the al west standings . `` there 's a lot of games left to be played , '' melvin said . `` i do n't think anything surprises the team with where we are right now . we 're looking to do better things as we go along . '' "
