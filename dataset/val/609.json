        "from his windows up high in a hyde park retirement home , eugene parker can see , fittingly , the great mass of the museum of science and industry and the distinctive rooftops of the university of also can watch the sun as it rises over the lake and sets in the west , which is even more fitting because as much as any human alive , parker is responsible for our understanding of the star that keeps us a young u. of c. scientist in the mid-1950s , he performed some calculations and realized there must be a `` solar wind '' -- his term -- propelling material outward from the sun and affecting the entire solar system .",
        "the astronomical community scoffed at this upstart insight , and then , within a few years , early space missions proved it a 91-year-old emeritus professor in 2018 , he will be at cape canaveral next month to watch nasa launch its parker solar probe , the agency 's first mission named for a living broke protocol , said thomas zurbuchen , head of the agency 's science mission directorate , because of `` the unique impact parker has had in the entire portfolio . we have 107 missions ongoing right now , '' either in operation or in planning . ",
        "`` thirty-five of them are directly related to parker 's work . '' `` it 's wonderful , '' said nicola fox , project scientist for the solar probe , which will bring science far closer to the sun than it 's ever been . `` he 's going to stand and he 's going to watch his legacy mission leave the planet and start its journey . `` he is the father of the mission . it was his paper . it was his science . it was his discovery that led to science 's knowing the corona was such an interesting place to go visit , and it 's taken 60 years to be able to do this daring plunge into the sun 's atmosphere . ",
        "`` parker , though , is n't much for the the home he and his wife share , an end table carried about the only visible sign of his fame , a stack of coaster-sized parker solar probe stickers . `` a mission to touch the sun , '' they say , the words atop an image of a spacecraft against a fiery orange inferno . `` take one , '' parker encouraged visitors late last week . `` i 'm greatly honored that they would put my name on it , '' he said . `` but i contributed nothing to the spacecraft . ",
        "that 's the hard work of a lot of other guys who never get much credit . they do n't get interviews from the newspapers . `` but to be the first living honoree , following missions named for the likes of kepler , galileo , hubble ? `` i tend to shrug my shoulders at that , '' he said . `` the fact that i 'm living seems neither here nor there because i have not contributed in any way to the building of that spacecraft . `` he is more focused on what the probe will learn on its seven-year mission as it loops repeatedly around venus to propel it through the sun 's atmosphere . ",
        "among the key questions being explored : how is the sun , contrary to any phenomenon on earth , so many magnitudes hotter in its corona , the surrounding area visible in an eclipse , than at its surface , and how does it expel matter at supersonic speeds ? the sun , parker said a couple of times , is a `` very ordinary star . '' what we learn about it will tell us , in all likelihood , about much of the universe , although the craft 's closest approach , at about 4 million miles and 2,500 degrees , wo n't come until 2024 . ",
        "`` investigating the mechanisms of the heating are what i get most excited about , '' he sounds a lot like the gene parker she has come to know , said fox , who will take part with the professor in a press event at the university 's gleacher center downtown on tuesday to draw attention to the scientist and the upcoming mission , now targeted to launch in the early morning hours of aug. . 11 . `` it 's like meeting brad pitt or somebody , '' she said . `` he discovered the solar wind . he 's kind of the father of heliophysics . ",
        "... he 's this mythical person that did all this unbelievable science , and then you meet him , and he 's just a lovely man . `` in october parker visited the applied physics laboratory at johns hopkins university , where fox is chief scientist for heliophysics and where the parker solar probe was being loaded with an array of instruments that may solve some of the sun 's enduring , she said , he was humble in the face of the engineering . `` i took him to meet the spacecraft that bears his name , '' she of that event show parker standing in the white suit required in a `` clean room , '' peering into the innards of the craft , and standing beside the exterior clad in the almost 5 inches of carbon that will keep it from incinerating as it flies past the , she recalled , kept saying , '' ` you guys are the really clever ones . ",
        "i just solved some equations . ... i just wrote a paper . ' '' `` i was like , ` yeah , it 's a pretty good paper , gene . ' '' `` dynamics of the interplanetary gas and magnetic fields '' started on page 664 of volume 128 of the astrophysical journal , published in november , 1958 . `` we consider the dynamical consequences of biermann 's suggestion that gas is often streaming outward in all directions from the sun with velocities on the order of 500-1500 km/sec , '' begins the paper 's do n't sound like the first words in a revolution , but those , and the words and calculations that followed , proved profound . ",
        "`` people expected the space between earth and the sun to be basically a void , '' said angela olinto , a u. of c. astronomer and the university 's dean of physical sciences . `` solar wind sort of connects up to the sun and all the other planets of the sun . our local neighborhood is really quite different than the one we thought of in the 1950s . '' `` one of the reasons why parker is so revered is because he was comfortable with a topic that most found arcane , difficult , '' said geza gyuk , director of astronomy at the adler son of an engineer and grandson of a physicist , parker , who grew up in the buffalo and detroit areas , was able to see the sun differently than those who had studied it before , he said , because he did n't approach it with a traditional astronomy background . ",
        "trained at michigan state and caltech , he was a physics guy so he tended to think in terms of systems , he said , where astronomers thought more about discrete key to his work was the german scientist ludwig biermann 's theory about why comet tails always point away from the sun , no matter the comet 's direction of travel . biermann suggested the sun must be emitting a stream of material , dubbed `` solar corpuscular radiation , '' but did not explain the reason for the existence of such the british scientist sydney chapman had shown that the sun 's corona extended beyond earth , parker said , but chapman thought of the corona as a static you add in biermann 's idea of motion , `` you get an equation with one more term in it , '' parker said . ",
        "`` and when you solve that , that makes all the difference in the world . `` he looked at it as a problem similar to hydrodynamics -- the flow of water -- and found `` there 's only one solution that fits , '' he said . `` that 's the supersonic solar winds starting slow and dense and accelerating as you go out '' away from the sun . `` you put that into the mathematics , and the mathematics says , ` well , there you are , ' '' he is nasa 's layperson 's explanation of solar wind , from the detailed website for the parker solar probe : `` in the 1950s , parker proposed a number of concepts about how stars -- including our sun -- give off energy . ",
        "he called this cascade of energy the solar wind , and he described an entire complex system of plasmas , magnetic fields , and energetic particles that make up this phenomenon . `` but eminent astronomers in 1958 disagreed . two of them were given the paper for peer review , and both rejected it . their message was essentially that parker could n't be right because his work disagreed with conventional thinking . `` we recommend that the author go to the library and read up on the subject before he attempts to write papers about it , '' parker recalled one of the scientist 's critiques there was no `` real criticism , '' just a declaration and so parker persisted : `` i 've had people say , ` well , were n't you worried that if everybody disagreed , you might be wrong ? ' ",
        "my reply is , ` i 'm working with newton . newton got it right . ' ",
        "`` the journal 's editor subrahmanyan chandrasekhar , a chicago astronomer and future nobel laureate in physics , examined the paper and told parker he could find nothing wrong with it and he would publish was very little reaction , parker said , but the 1962 mariner 2 robotic voyage to venus confirmed the solar wind 's continued on the faculty full time through 1995 , had a major hand in guiding the university 's astronomical research , colleagues said , and published important papers regularly on topics including the solar magnetic field and a theory on how the sun 's corona is won honors including the national medal of science , in 1989 , and the kyoto prize for lifetime achievements in basic science , in 2003 , but not the theory on the lack of recognition from sweden ?",
        "`` it was n't exotic , '' he said of his solar wind work . `` in a way i sort of feel , that just shows how much smarter you have to be to see it -- because none of you guys thought of it . but anyway , i ca n't complain . i 've gotten by all right . `` gyuk , of the adler , thinks there may be a nobel nomination in the offing `` if his suggestions on heating mechanisms in the solar wind come to boot '' as data comes in from the parker solar nasa naming the mission after him last year , no matter how much parker might demur , represents a kind of crowning honor . ",
        "it becomes doubly true when you consider how the mission will end : with the craft losing propellant and thus its ability to protect itself from the sun , vaporizing in the heat and joining the solar wind . "
