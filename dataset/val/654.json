        "reliever jesse chavez returns tuesday to pnc park , where his 11-year major-league career began with a perfect inning of relief against the cubs . chavez 's nine-team odyssey included one curious trade-deadline detour eight years ago . `` i was walking from the visitors clubhouse to the bullpen in cincinnati , '' recalled chavez , believing at the time he would stay with the braves with the deadline minutes away . `` i was literally behind home plate as the umpires were convening . `` then i was called back and told i was traded to the royals . ",
        "`` but chavez wo n't need to worry about a similar occurrence this season after making a favorable impression in the short time he has been with the cubs since arriving from the rangers in a trade july 19 . `` he knows what he 's doing , '' manager joe maddon said saturday after chavez had his fifth consecutive scoreless outing . `` he 's very resilient . he 's an interesting add . `` chavez immediately established his value : he pitched two scoreless innings to preserve a 7-2 victory july 21 in his cubs debut , and he pitched a scoreless sixth that allowed the cubs to rally from a 6-1 deficit to a 7-6 walk-off triumph thursday over the diamondbacks .

",
        "`` the earlier you get to a new team , the better the acclimation you can make to the club -- from the catchers , scouting staff , pitching coaches , the manager . it goes down the line from the players to the clubhouse guys , getting them comfortable with you . they want you to be comfortable . `` with all the moving chavez has experienced , providing support for his family is just as essential . his family accompanied him from texas after the trade and will stay with him through next weekend 's home series before they return to riverside , 's daughter christe will start freshman orientation next week at riverside poly high chavez , who turns 35 on aug. .
