        "san diego -- with a 54-54 record and a game deficit to overcome in the division , the giants said they were open to buying or selling if the right opportunity presented itself . at the 1 deadline , that opportunity was nowhere to be found . `` we had a strategy of being strategic buyers and if so inclined and compelling enough , strategic sellers , '' vice president of baseball operations brian sabean said . `` but in that context , we wanted to stay clear of free agents-to-be and preferred people that were controllable . `` though sabean and general manager bobby evans will continue to search for younger players with team-friendly , controllable contracts through the month of august and into the offseason , the giants ' front office was cautious to protect a farm system that lacks veteran starters johnny cueto and jeff samardzija deal with injuries , the giants indicated they 'll continue to scour the market for pitching talent after pursuing opportunities ahead of the non-waiver deadline . ",
        "`` one , we were n't going to gut the farm system or overpay and two , in a perfect world , which we were trying to pursue , was a controllable situation that would help us in the present and the future , '' sabean said . `` if it did n't advantage us in that fashion , we backed off . `` the giants likely gauged interest from other clubs on right fielder andrew mccutchen , a free agent-to-be , as well as several relief pitchers , but sabean and evans did n't want to move assets unless the giants received meaningful pieces in return . ",
        "if san francisco falls completely out of the race in august , that could change , especially because sabean says the club is motivated to evaluate younger prospects approaching the major league the giants did n't complete any deals tuesday , evans said the flurry of activity in the hours leading up to the non-waiver deadline may indicate teams will remain motivated to pursue trades in august . `` we 're always looking at opportunities after the deadline and we try to stay available and transparent with clubs in terms of opportunities , '' evans said . `` i think there 's been a whole lot more activity around the trade deadline this year than we 've seen in years past . ",
        "`` several giants players are expected to be placed on waivers in august , at which point other teams can submit a waiver claim . the giants can then negotiate a trade with the team that placed the claim , or pull a player back from the waiver wire . if a player goes unclaimed for two days , the giants would be free to work out trades with any the giants stay in the hunt in the national league west and or the wildcard race , evans and sabean may also look to add to the existing roster . ",
        "san francisco was linked to reds starter matt harvey before the deadline , but cincinnati elected not to trade him . harvey will likely end up on waivers in august , so if the giants feel compelled to add a pitcher , there should be more chances to do than 90 minutes before the deadline , giants manager bruce bochy said he 's hopeful giants players take a quiet deadline as a vote of confidence in the current roster and the team 's abilities to make a late push . ",
        "`` that 's what you 're hoping , we still feel that we 're in this and we have a chance to get to where we want to go , '' bochy the franchise is determined to remain under the competitive balance tax threshold of $ 197 million this season , the giants are unlikely to pursue deals for any two-month rentals or players earning significant salaries in rotation undeterminedbochy said the giants could have a decision regarding how they 'll treat cueto 's right elbow sprain within the next giants manager said monday tommy john surgery is a ` strong possibility ' after cueto revealed he 's experiencing pain in his elbow after every cueto on the 10-day disabled list and expected to miss an extended period of time , the giants have listed madison bumgarner as their starter for thursday 's game in arizona and have left the rest of their weekend rotation as `` to be announced .",
        "`` if the giants avoid using right-hander chris stratton out of the bullpen tuesday , bochy said stratton will likely start friday 's game against the d'backs . "
