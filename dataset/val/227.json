        "with two games before facing boise state , oklahoma state football has some time to figure out whether or not spencer sanders is the answer at state football has a lot of potential for the 2018 campaign , but the program also has a lot of question marks . a young and talented roster with a new key part of the coaching staff can create a lot of uncertainty . the pokes lose out on one of the best quarterbacks in the big 12 and one of the best statistical pass throwers in the nation in mason rudolph . the quarterback competition for oklahoma state under head football coach mike gundy will revolve around four options . ",
        "those four options are senior taylor cornelius , junior john kolar , sophomore keondre wudtee , and true freshman spencer a former four-star dual-threat quarterback prospect out of the dallas , tx , area , sanders might be the most talented of the four options . however , he 's also the most inexperienced and raw option . cornelius got some valuable experience last season and even wudtee took some game snaps . kolar has been around the program for three years now so he 's become acquitted to the do n't have to look too far back to when gundy went with a true freshman under center and it worked out well . ",
        "gundy had to burn rudolph 's redshirt in 2014 after injuries ended the seasons of both walsh and daxx garman . rudolph won two of his final three games of the season in 2014 , including a key victory in bedlam over the oklahoma the next three seasons , rudolph led the pokes to double-digit win totals on each occasion . although , that 2014 season that gundy had trouble finding the answer under center saw the team win just seven games . gundy needs to find the right answer from the get go . a very tough non-conference contest lies ahead against the boise state broncos in big 12 media days , gundy gave a glimpse into the current state of the quarterback competition saying that cornelius is oklahoma state 's `` guy '' entering fall camp . ",
        "that leaves sanders ' outlook for immediate playing time in the dark as of , if cornelius ca n't convert as the starting quarterback this fall , sanders will be waiting for his opportunity . this quarterback situation has quite a few similarities to that of the 2014 season . garman and walsh were the experienced options , but maybe not the most is the highly touted four-star quarterback prospect that might not get the opportunity to start right away . rudolph was in the same shoes back in 2014 and led oklahoma state to one of its most consistent periods of success in program history . ",
        "sanders could be looking at a very similar to that of rudolph with oklahoma state football back in 2014 . "
