",
        "the thunder need to either waive , stretch or trade for players to alter its current goes without saying that okc have concentrated on acquiring as many wings as possible , electing to occupy eight of the 15 spots with shooting guards and small forwards . however , this has caused an imbalance in the roster . with patrick patterson the only legitimate power forward , the thunder are lacking front court depth . it would be wise for oklahoma city to acquire another power forward should injuries thunder have three trade chips in terrance ferguson , alex abrines and kyle singler . ",
        "tferg is only 20 years-old and has tremendous upside as a three and d player . presti never trades young assets on controllable contracts therefore its difficult to imagine trading him unless its a player that definitively raises okc 's and singler on the other hand are expiring contracts and can be moved easily due to their small cap hit . the spaniard is oklahoma city 's purest shooter while singler is nothing more than a locker room voice making close to $ 5 million . okc also have their second round picks from 2020 thunder need to find a player that can : shoot the ball from rangecan play power forward and capable of playing on the breakperforming a trade that does n't increase the luxury taxlets take a look three trade possibilities .
