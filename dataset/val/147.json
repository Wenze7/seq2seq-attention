        "outfit : tobi bodysuitalice & olivia vestall saint skirtsam edelman bootssaint laurent bagventrone chronicles chokerargento vivo necklacethis is an all black outfit that is far from boring . i will definitely be going back to this outfit in the future . i felt so chic and well put together . i 've had this alice & olivia faux fur vest in my closet for years ! it was quite the investment for me at the time . i believe i was 14 when i purchased this ensemble . it definitely is a great way to add some contrast with texture and color to an all black outfit . ",
        "honestly , that 's all an all black outfit really needs to take it to the next this look : but the real star of this show is this black lace up bodysuit from tobi . i have always loved these kind of bodysuits , but felt i did n't have the bust to pull it off . yet , now when i see it styled , i ca n't get enough . with most of the attention going towards the cut out details , i made sure to keep the rest of the outfit clean and minimal and of course ... all black . ",
        "be sure to check out for more bodysuits ! i pulled out my all saints leather skirt i 've also had for years . if you do n't had a leather skirt in your collection ... girl ? !? you need to asap . and i 'm going to tell you right now , invest ... invest ... invest . there are some things worth spending the extra money on because you 'll have it forever . i love the fit of this leather skirt and how it flares outwards ever so wore my sam edelman petty boots . i love these boots so much you do n't even know . ",
        "by far one of the most comfortable boots out , i want to talk about my new gothic choker necklace by argento vivo ! this is my latest obsession . i have always loved the gothic font , but could never find an affordable jewelry brand that offered exactly what i wanted until argento vivo . i chose the all gold combination , but they also offer all silver and mix metal for this necklace . my `` k '' gothic choker necklace is a perfect everyday necklace to wear . check out argento vivo for affordable jewelry . they have a minimal style to their jewelry which i love .
