        "orange is the new black fans all wondered where alex is , as she 's missing in the trailer , but we did n't think about another character noticeably left : not yet finished with your orange is the new black season 6 binge-watch ? spoilers ahead ! `` where 's alex ? have you seen alex ? '' is the most-asked question in season six of oitnb , but what about the iconic duo , flaritza ? bffs flaca and maritza are too much fun together . we love watching the two share the screen , they never fail to make us laugh . ",
        "their friendship is the best and often serves to cheer us up when the series gets a bit too dark and real . so , naturally , we missed them dearly in season six . where the hell is maritza ? is diane guerero gone for good ? is there no chance of a reunion in season seven ? the season 5 finale separated flaca and maritza . at the end of the prison riot , flaca was put on a bus with several others we know , martiza , however , was escorted to a different one . and while most of them were reunited , maritza is never seen bustle , sadly , reports , maritza was transferred to another prison . ",
        "but really , guerrero 's absence should n't be too shocking if you have kept up with her work . the christian post was one of the first to report diane guerrero joined superior donuts on cbs , questioning if she would be leaving oitnb . scheduling conflicts on top of maritza being on an entirely different prison , are the reasons her character simply did n't fit in season , just as we once saw natasha lyonne 's nicky and laverne cox 's sophia leave the series temporarily before , we may see maritza again . and with season seven reportedly being the last one in the series , flaritza could happen next is the new black season six is now streaming on netflix .
