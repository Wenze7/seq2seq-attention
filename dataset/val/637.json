        "in the last three months , facebook 's usually steep user growth did n't change at all in the and fell in europe following new data privacy laws . but during a second-quarter earnings report on wednesday , july 25 , the social media giant shared a new number -- there are billion people using a facebook-owned app , which also includes instagram , whatsapp , and messenger , each month . the metric does n't double count users on multiple apps , such as people that are on both facebook and network shared the statistic for the first time this week during a report that posted slower revenue growth than anticipated while the company 's costs continue to jump . ",
        "this year , the company has faced its largest privacy scandal yet while simultaneously working to make sure time on facebook is `` time well spent '' and buckling down to combat abuse . facebook expected that those changes would impact user counts and revenue , and true to the company 's predictions , both slowed during the second quarter of 's newest statistic feels even more impressive considering 3 billion of the 4 billion world internet users are on social media . that means the company has the attention of more than 80 percent of social media users users now total billion -- that is still a growth over 2017 , but the 11 percent growth is the slowest user growth that the network has seen since 2011 . ",
        "that 's also lower than last quarter 's growth after the cambridge analytica prompted a #deletefacebook hashtag . facebook says the growth was driven by users in india , indonesia , and the philippines . growth in the and canada remained flat at about 185 million users . after the new general data protection regulation privacy laws went into effect earlier this year , the user count in europe fell by a million monthly active users . despite those changes , facebook says that a majority of users opted to allow the network to continue ad targeting to see more relevant ads at the cost of sharing facebook predicted a slowdown when ceo mark zuckerberg called for the platform to make time spent on facebook time well spent , wall street was more surprised by the results , with the company falling short of expectations and stock dropping by 20 percent as a result . ",
        "revenue decelerated by seven percent and the company predicts a similar `` high single digit '' rate throughout the remainder of 2018 . ad revenue , however , grew by 42 percent over 2017 , with mobile ads now taking up 91 percent of the overall ad the same time , the company 's costs have increased by about 50 percent , with staff growing by 47 percent . that investment is largely for security as facebook expands review staff . the network says that despite the investment in security , the network does n't plan on slowing the investment into developing new latest numbers may be bad news for investors , but zuckerberg shared several changes implemented over the last few months designed both to curb abuse and to create less passive content consumption .

        "the platform 's artificial intelligence for detecting graphic violence , for example , now catches 90 percent of the violence removed from the network . the network now has two new tools for ad transparency and has stepped up the fight against fake news by pushing known misinformation further down in the feed .
