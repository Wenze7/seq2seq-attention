        "10 thoughts after the chicago bears opened preseason with the baltimore ravens a week ahead of the rest of the nfl . the ravens won 17-16 at tom benson hall of fame the bears would have far preferred if their first-rounder was their most newsworthy draft pick on thursday -- not their seventh-rounder -- but the negotiating impasse for inside linebacker roquan smith continues and wide receiver javon wims put together a nice second half with seven receptions for 89 careful not to get ahead of yourself when it comes to wims , but understand that the solid showing comes after the former georgia bulldog put together some nice practices in bourbonnais . ",
        "that is the key for late-round picks and undrafted free agents . they have to continually pop and catch the attention of coaches and decision makers . it 's early in the process and wims is going to have to do a lot more to state his case for a roster spot at a position where things will get bears sat out 27 players , not including smith , and four of them were wide receivers -- allen robinson , anthony miller , taylor gabriel and kevin white . you figure that the bears will wind up keeping six wide receivers on the 53-man roster and those four have a spot . ",
        "i would give a nod right now to veteran josh bellamy , who has experience on special teams and has been worked in some with the first unit on occasion . next , you 're looking at wims and perhaps bennie fowler , the veteran who came over from the broncos . fowler signed a $ 1 million , one-year contract with $ 200,000 guaranteed . that is who wims is competing against . fowler is a proven player on special teams and has been a little more productive than bellamy on offense in his career . `` it was a good showing for my first nfl game , '' wims said . ",
        "`` my coaches told me to stay ready and so did my teammates , stay ready . every opportunity you get , just try to make the most of it . i think camp has gone good . every day i am learning something new . every day i am getting better . `` wims ' good hands were on display in the back-shoulder throw he caught at the start of the fourth quarter , outmaneuvering ravens rookie cornerback anthony averett for a 24-yard gain . wims does n't possess top end speed and he might lack the sudden quickness to shake better cornerbacks but he 's had a nice camp so far and this performance backs that up . ",
        "he just needs to keep stacking productive practices adrian amos was one of the many bears who got the night off , but the fourth-year safety was paying close attention to the action and is eager to review film of several 15-yard penalties that were handed out by referee walt coleman 's crew . the ravens were specifically penalized twice for use of the helmet penalties and baltimore picked up two more unnecessary roughness calls , both 15-yarders . bears safety nick orr also got a 15-yard unnecessary roughness call . on the couple replays i saw on a tv that was mounted high in the press box , it did n't look like a bad hit . ",
        "amos was in agreement and it 's a real question for defensive players around the league : is the game going to be officiated differently ? `` we just have to go back and look at them and see what they are , '' amos said . `` they looked like pretty good hits . i do n't know . we 'll see . `` i asked him if it 's the beginning of a trend we 'll see unfold in preseason , is it going to force him to evaluate how he goes about bringing down ball carriers or receivers ? ",
        "`` i 've got to play football , '' he said . `` i have to protect myself and play football . i 'm not going to not tackle someone . i 'll let them make a determination afterward . i can only control what i can control . `` in doing that , he will have to hope that he maintains control of his wallet as well . amos certainly does n't want any fine notifications arriving at halas hall . `` yeah , '' he said . `` we 'll see . `` 3 . jonathan bullard figures to be in line for a starting job as a defensive end and he might be the only eventual starter that wound up playing in this game . ",
        "he ran ravens quarterback robert griffin iii out of bounds for a sack , which was good to see . bullard totaled two tackles and as he prepares for his third season , he 's hoping to build his effort near the end of last season when he began getting more playing time with mitch unrein sidelined . `` last year , the last four or five games i started and that really helped me at the position , '' bullard said . `` just having reps. repeated reps are always huge . `` roy robertson-harris is pushing bullard and he also picked up a sack as the defense totaled eight in the loss to the ravens . ",
        "a little more consistency from both of them would help out up front where they 've got a good thing going right now . `` we 've got two solid guys in akiem and eddie right there , '' bullard said . `` just need some production out of that right side end . that 's my job and hopefully i can step in . if we start getting production from all three spots , we can be even better . `` 4 . one player that is going to be interesting to track in preseason is punter pat o'donnell . ",
        "he averaged 57 yards on four punts , so it was a good effort . the ravens got 24 yards on three punt returns ; the bears would like to get better there , but a net average for o'donnell is nice . the bears created competition for him in the spring when they signed ryan winslow , an undrafted free agent from pitt . the team kept a close eye on winslow and brought him to halas hall for a pre-draft ` donnell returned on a one-year contract worth $ million with $ 500,000 guaranteed . that 's not exactly a ton of job security for a fifth-year player and that 's why the addition of winslow made things interesting . ",
        "still , o'donnell is the incumbent and special teams coordinator chris tabor had some particularly interesting stuff to say about the veteran from bourbonnais earlier this week . o'donnell primarily used what is known as the `` flip flop '' punt last season -- the rugby-style kick that goes end over end . that was under the direction of former special teams coordinator jeff rodgers and there are a variety of factors that surely went into the decision process . it 's a conservative kick that is more difficult to return because of the height and hang time . it also does n't travel as far as a traditional spiral punt . ",
        "`` there are a lot of things with the flip-flop , '' tabor said . `` you can work faster and control it . i have used it before as an open-field punt . i used it in cleveland a couple times . we were playing antonio brown and we did n't want to outkick our coverage and give him a head start as it 's higher and shorter . we 've worked from the spring changing some things up with pat and he has been , to his credit , a true pro 's pro . he 's accepted it and attacked it and that 's why i am anxious for him and excited for him . ",
        "`` the bears have tweaked o'donnell 's steps and his stance and the hope is it produces bigger and more consistent results . `` he 's been awesome , '' tabor said . `` we 've changed some things with him on the regular punt . we 're going to see where he 's at . he 's really worked . i am anxious to see where he 's at . `` i asked tabor if , based on the fact that he has n't asked his punters to use the flip-flop punt much in the past , if he 's more of a proponent of a regular punt . ",
        "`` i am , '' he said . `` but i am a proponent of what the player does best . like colquitt in cleveland , he had a bunch of clubs . he could hit the flip-flop . we worked where he would face that way and hit it and it looked like a shanked punt but it would roll on the ground forever . we worked on all those things . like sam koch , are hard to field because you do n't know where he is going . that 's the beauty of the whole thing . ",
        "we 're not there with our guys yet but i like where we are trending . `` here is a breakdown of the four punts : -- 1 . 53 yards , seconds hang time , 12-yard return -- 2 . 57 yards , seconds hang time , touchback -- 3 . 59 yards , seconds hang time , 13-yard return -- 4 . 59 yards , seconds hang time , no returnthe last punt had a tremendous result , but was n't real pretty as o'donnell said he got it a little on the side of his foot . ",
        "still , a 59-yard net looks pretty in the stats . winslow attempted one punt when the bears were backed up on their own 4-yard line . he had a 50-yard punt and the ravens lost one yard on the the nfl 's new kickoff rule was put into play for the first time and it 's going to be important to monitor all preseason . tabor was one of the position coaches that traveled to new york to meet with the league when the rules were adjusted that , among other things , outlawed a running start for players on the kicking team and made wedges illegal for the return team . ",
        "the idea was to eliminate as many high-speed collisions , the type of plays that lead to concussions . in essence , the kickoff has become a little bit more like the did we see ? each team had two kickoff returns and both sides had a long of 24 yards . in other words , there is still a lot of unknown . `` i will be honest with you , there are unknowns on the deal , '' tabor said before the trip to canton . `` thursday night something could happen where you 're , ` i thought i thought of that . ",
        "i guess i did n't . ' or , ` well , i thought this would stress it out in the blocking scheme and sure enough it did . ' what can you do to tweak it to fix it ? sherrick mcmanis , who has been the team 's top special teams performer for the last several seasons , is n't sure what to make of the rule changes either . `` it 's like anytime they make a rule change every year , you just have to adjust , '' mcmanis said . `` you either adjust or you do n't play , you know what i mean ? ",
        "it 's going to be fun to see how it goes and how it 's officiated . a player like me is going to adjust . i think it is going to be fine . `` does mcmanis believe the adjustment will make the kickoff safer because ultimately that is what will be monitored closely . `` we shall see , man , '' he said . `` hitting is hitting . you can probably slow a person down but if you get hit the right way , it 's football . it 's going to be hard to stop everything from happening . ",
        "we 'll see how this goes . `` 6 . eric kush was probably the only potential offensive starter to play in the game . he spent the majority of training camp working at left guard and he played center , something he 's done in the past . it 's good work for the bears to get kush in the event something happens during the season . rookie second-round pick james daniels has n't had a lot of action with the first team and of late he 's been sidelined with a shoulder injury . so , it 's fair to say kush is asserting himself early when it comes to this job . ",
        "`` camp is good , '' he said . `` just working hard . trying to get better at something every day . `` the interesting dynamic for kush is that general manager ryan pace knew him and liked him and coach matt nagy worked with him in kansas city before so he knew him and liked him . offensive line coach harry hiestand had not worked with kush previously so that creates a little unknown for a player , especially a guy like kush who has been around for a while but only has five career starts . `` when you have a new guy coming in , you hope he likes you and everything , '' kush said . ",
        "`` i just focus at doing what he says and try to focus on what he likes to do , certain things and that 's how it goes . `` i asked kush if the goal right now is to nail down the left guard job for week 1 . `` i am just working at getting better at what i can every day , '' he said . `` if it leads to that , i am pretty damn happy with myself . if it does n't , i ai n't gon na quit . i am going to keep on going . ",
        "`` 7 . the bears are here because of brian urlacher , who will be enshrined in the pro football hall of fame on saturday night , and nagy has been certain to mention that several times . urlacher 's brilliant career , entirely with the bears , made this possible and he was a first ballot selection in january when my former colleague dan pompei , whose work can now be found at bleacher report and the athletic , presented urlacher to the hall 's selection committee . i chatted with dan about the was the biggest challenge for you in preparing the case to present urlacher to fellow selectors back in january ? ",
        "dp : the challenge was that it was his first time and there was a backlog of really good candidates that people felt were in line first . i know there is still some feeling about that . the other factor was he was at the same time as ray lewis . so , i thought it was important to show that brian urlacher was a strong first-ballot hall of fame candidate in his own right regardless of lewis ' candidacy . i made the point , ` why ca n't you have two players from the same position ? ' ",
        "i pointed out that a number of times it 's happened before where you have had guys like this . there are so few times in history where you have had two of the greatest at a position come up in their first ballot so it was something that i think people were wrestling with and had to kind of get over and they did presented richard dent multiple times until he was voted in . i would think as a presenter you have to develop a strategy and you get better at it the more you do it . ",
        "anyone can present jerry rice but when presenting other players there is real work that goes into it . what was the process like ? dp : you start building a case for a hall of fame candidate years and years before he ever becomes eligible . you have to start gathering acorns along the way and figuring out what makes him worthy . i did that with urlacher . i could n't even tell you how much time i put into it because it was spread over so many years . it might have been five minutes here , a half-hour there , 45 minutes there . ",
        "you know , it was not something where i just sat down one day and built a case . it was a long time those lines , do you find yourself picking up acorns for devin hester here and there these days ? dp : absolutely . i have started that process as well . it 's something that will continue and i 've got several more years to build it . assuming that i am still on the job for the hall of fame , by then i will have had a lot of time to really think about why he should be a hall of 's a different argument and one that is going to take some real work . ",
        "that prototype player is n't in canton right now , is he ? dp : no . there is no one like him really and we have very few players that were primarily special teams players . so it is going to be a different one for him . but there has never been a player like devin might strengthen your case right there ? dp : that 's an important realization that i would like to share with the other members of the board of selectors when the time comes . he 's kind of unique in nfl history and i will tell you what , there will never be another like him because of what is happening with the rules . ",
        "he was a one of a kind and hopefully that will help his it 's going to be interesting to see if the bears carry a fullback on the roster . they felt like they added a solid one in michael burton when they claimed him off waivers last season . he appeared in all 16 games logging 179 snaps . nagy comes from an offense that has incorporated a fullback . anthony sherman is entering his sixth season with the chiefs and was used on 180 snaps on offense in kansas city last year , almost identical to burton 's workload . ",
        "the difference is sherman led the chiefs in special teams snaps . he was on the field for percent of kansas city 's special teams plays . burton was involved in percent of special teams snaps for the bears last season , ranking 18th on the roster . `` it 's a good question , '' nagy said earlier in camp . `` the fullback position is one that you see in our offense we do n't use a whole lot of . but at the same time you can take that position and you can move him around in different areas . ",
        "we talk about man , zone tells and getting an advantage with the defense . you can do that when burton 's in there . burton right now is just , he 's done everything we 've asked him to do in regards to lining up at fullback and thumping a mike linebacker on a mike play . we 'll space him out and run a stick route , we 'll do different things with him and zero complaints . so he 's the epitome of control what you can control and then make it tough on us when we get to creating the roster . ",
        "`` burton is doing his best not to wonder about the number crunching that comes at the end of preseason when roster decisions are made . `` i am just worried about coming out here and being the best i can be for the team and whatever coach asks me to do , '' burton said . `` anthony sherman , great player , been in the league for a long time and has done some great things in kansas city . i have watched all his film and he fits there really well . so obviously that would be something i would try to mimic . ",
        "`` burton understands the significance of special teams and is doing his best to catch the attention of tabor . `` my goal is to be a four core special teams player , '' he said . `` it 's so important . `` 9 . the bears head home and will be back on the practice fields at olivet nazarene university on saturday . it 's going to be much warmer this weekend , with forecasted highs reaching the low 90s . i would imagine nagy uses that to put a little more pressure on the players . the bears are getting their work done in the morning , so they wo n't be in the heat of the day . ",
        "nagy talked about there being live sessions in camp before it opened and that has been quite limited to this scouts from five nfl teams were in attendance . represented were the bengals , browns , chargers , eagles and steelers . two cfl teams were also present with the calgary stampeders and saskatchewan roughriders on there have been a handful of scouts from the cfl circulating through training camp recently . the cfl regular season is in full swing but those teams like to survey the landscape in nfl training camps and at preseason games to get a handle for players that fall through the cracks . ",
        "things are going to get interesting for the cfl , however , which will soon have competition for players that ca n't stick on an nfl roster . the alliance of american football is an eight-team league slated to get started in february after super bowl liii . the xfl , which was around for one season in 2001 , is scheduled to return in 2020 . you 're always skeptical that a second-tier football league is going to be able to put down roots and actually work but both outfits appear to be well funded , at least right now . ",
        "the minimum salary in the cfl is $ 54,000 canadian . that 's less than half of what a player can earn in the nfl if he is able to stick it out for the entire season on a practice squad . the minimum for practice squad players bumps up to $ 7,600 per week this season or $ 129,200 for the full season . the collective bargaining agreement for players in the cfl expires next spring and if the league is struggling to attract players it would have signed in the past , the owners will have to give consideration to raising the it will be fun to see many of urlacher 's former teammates in town as they gather for the induction ceremony on saturday . ",
        "it 's important for them to see urlacher honored and that 's really one of the neat parts to the the ravens were running more blitzes and pressures than you usually see from teams early in the preseason . maybe that benefits the bears in the long run . they will certainly have some stuff to review on tape .
