        "minneapolis , mn -- november 25 : alex hornibrook no team is ever truly complete and wisconsin football is no exception . with a bit of a critical eye , here are five weaknesses for this year 's badgers team . this post is going to be admittedly very nitpicky . wisconsin football is very talented this year , but no team in college football is ever perfect . even last season 's national champions had to make a quarterback change at is a team full of great strengths , and those will be highlighted in the future by badger of honor , but we need to get the weaknesses out of the way first . ",
        "wisconsin is n't a team associated with much weakness besides the general feeling that it recruits poorly . while that may be true , relative to its record and rankings anyway , the badgers develop talent as well as any program in the country . the only downside that poor recruiting could mean is a lack of 2018 , the badgers will not be without athletes . thanks to recent recruits beginning to pan out , wisconsin can now hit the occasional home run on offense and make huge , momentum-swinging plays on defense . freshman aron cruickshank is going to have a lot of eyes on him due to his lightning speed and explosiveness . ",
        "receivers quintez cephus , danny davis , and taylor are just as capable of making plays down the field for the badgers . and kendric pryor added diversity to the offense with two touchdowns on rushing plays last taylor is n't your typical wisconsin back either . he can bang in the trenches , but he has breakaway speed and can outrun defenders for long gains . the badgers may have had issues in the past with picking up chunk yardage , but that wo n't be the case this that we 've debunked what is probably the most commonly thought of weakness for wisconsin , let 's get through what really might hinder the team this year .
