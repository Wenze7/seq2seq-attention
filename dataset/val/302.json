        "the white sox won the home run derby thursday but still lost to the angels sox hit six home runs on a warm afternoon , five of them solo shots off angels starter nick tropeano and a two-run blast from jose abreu in the ninth off reliever blake parker . abreu hit two as did daniel palka , with avisail garcia and nicky delmonico also joining the trot fun . garcia , palka and delmonico hit home runs in a four-batter span of the seventh that cut an angels lead to one at angels countered with three home runs , the first two shots from kole calhoun in the first and ian kinsler in the fourth . ",
        "the third one was a crusher . after closing to 6-5 , reliever juan minaya allowed a single and walk to put two on for catcher francisco arcia , who was making his major-league debut . the rookie clubbed his first hit and homer in the majors to push the lead to 9-5 . the angels would go on to batter the bullpen and push their lead to 12-6 before abreu 's consolation homer in the ninth . `` the ball was traveling well , '' manager rick renteria said in an understatement . `` it was a hot day and balls got out of here fast . ",
        "i do n't think i 've ever been in a game where our first five hits were solo home runs . `` starting pitcher dylan covey had an experience thursday similar to teammate james shields on wednesday . it was a 3-2 game when he ran into trouble in the fifth . with two outs , he gave up singles to justin upton and albert pujols and then a triple to andrelton simmons into the left-field gap . simmons scored on the play when there was no one backing up home on tim anderson 's relay throw home . `` it was pretty hot but you just have to deal with that , '' said covey , who gave up just two hits in 8 1/3 innings in beating the mariners 5-0 saturday . ",
        "`` i did n't have my best stuff , but there were a couple of situations where i needed just one pitch to get out of the inning and get the team in the dugout . `` upton 's single came on a 2-2 fastball and pujols ' single was a first-pitch blooper to left . he had simmons 0-2 before he tripled . `` he has been throwing well but just was n't as sharp today , '' renteria said . `` he tried to grind it out but they had a lead and kept attacking . `` the three home runs in the seventh got the sox back in the game , but minaya gave up the three-run homer and chris volstad gave up three runs in the eighth . ",
        "the angels had nine extra-base hits on the sox split the four-game series with the angels . the best sign of the series was the two fine starts from lucas giolito and carlos rodon and abreu snapping out of his slump , going 6-for-16 in the series with three home runs . he 's 12-for-37 on the just completed trip . `` i feel like i 'm back in the groove , '' abreu said . `` this series i was able to find my swing . i feel i can do even better and more for the game .
