        "the new york giants went into the off season with a glut of issues . ",
        "so , in honor of mission impossible , which has been on all weekend , i want to take a minute and rewind on the impossible task that jerry reese refused to year in , dave gettleman and pat shurmur have changed the way the new york giants have been operating , the defense is fired up and aggressive under the new coordinator but the best tidbit to come out to start is that the giants offensive line is playing with an edge like they never had is not the same line that jerry reese neglected for the most part and when pushed against a wall and told to fix it , he looked everyone in the face and said these guys will all be better next 's like busting all day on a black jack table then betting all your remaining money on the hope things might get better .",
        "instead gettleman went out and got bigger up front on offense and do n't yet know if the line is great yet , but in fairness it definitely could n't have gotten worse . with the additions of a new left tackle in nate solder and left guard in will hernandez , the whole left side of the giants line became technically sound and a little people may have also forgotten that ereck flowers was originally supposed to learn on the right side and let will beatty handle blindside may be a bold prediction but i feel that flowers will have a great year on the right side being a mauler style player as well as having saquon barkley , jonathan stewart and wayne gallman jr. . ",
        "aiding in chipping on the front side should lead to some great pancake moments for him this coming saquon barkley being drafted brought down the house , once again there is no saying this was a homerun . ",
        "however gettleman seen enough of the giants running game or lack thereof to not make a ignored the chatter of drafting a quarterback and brought in a difference maker , then added a familiar face to mentor in past star stewart and has another bruising back in second year man gallman who ran halfway decent last three stable backs eli manning should feel some of the pressure disappear from him and also save his arm down the stretch if the giants can pull an amazing turnaround from last final mission has yet to be completed , but this falls on coach shurmur , he has to be ready coming out of camp .",
        "if this means jumping out of a window onto the roof of another skyscraping building then so be it . what it really means is if coach shurmur has to rely on some rookies to lead the way then he should . if he can stay away from the previous coaches ' mistakes of not playing the best player available and live with some of the rookie mistakes they make their way through the growing pains he will have won the locker room and will set himself and the team up for great future giants fan base may have been on ghost protocol last year , but with a new season upon us there is great hope good things are on the horizon .
