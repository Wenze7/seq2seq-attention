        "nvidia corp. . is gearing up for the future . the chip manufacturer announced that it was teaming up with defense advanced research projects agency , which is an arm of the department of defense , for a four-year contract worth around $ 23 million . `` the electronics resurgence initiative jump-starts innovations to address the challenges stemming from the end of moore 's law , '' said steve keckler , vice president of architecture research at nvidia . `` the technologies that are developed through the eri program will have a substantial impact on the future of electronic computing devices and nvidia 's future products . '' ",
        "moore 's law has come up a couple of times throughout phone calls with colette kress , nvidia 's cfo . `` one , an understanding that the slowdown of moore 's law is in front of us or is actually here today . the slowdown of moore 's law puts in a question in terms of how am i going to get additional throughput and compute capacity out of the overall configurations i have today versus what i had seen in the past . the use of acceleration , therefore , is front and center , '' said kress at nasdaq 's investor conference on june 12 . ",
        "action alerts plus analyst zev fima sees this contract as a good move on nvidia 's part . `` at first look , $ 23 million over 4 years , nothing to get excited about . but the real kicker is that if this is successful , nvidia 's gpus could be able to compete with asics , which many have cited as a source of competition and is a point the bears like to harp on , while still maintaining their programmability and be backwards compatible thanks to cuda . that is a game changer .
