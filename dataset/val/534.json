        "the nfl trade landscape has changed in recent years . teams used to rarely unload players but the arrival of a new generation of gms has changed 2018 offseason was unprecedented in its number of deals , both big and small . it 's clearer than ever that teams are losing their fear of sending big names away or acquiring them in the name of trying to get better . this has made it exciting for the fans if nothing else . the question is whether the big movements are done or are they just beginning ? there are still plenty of names that could be in play for the trade deadline this fall .

        "names either still holding out from their respective teams or names that will be free agents in 2019 barring a last-second move . here are some to watch and the likely teams they 'd fit best on if they were to get bridgewater sam darnold finally signed his rookie contract , so the original plan seems back in place . the new york jets may not hand him the torch immediately but it 's almost inevitable at this point . many feel they might try to play teddy bridgewater for a few games as sort of an audition to elevate his stock and then deal him before the trade deadline before moving to darnold .
