        "san francisco -- hader stole headlines during the all-star game last week when racist and homophobic tweets that he sent out as a 17-year old surfaced during the midsummer classic . now , he 's heading out onto the road for the first time since the controversy ignited , preparing to pitch in a city that 's known for being the birthplace of the gay rights movement and a bastion of liberal thought . `` this is n't something i 'm really worried about , '' hader said prior to thursday 's clash between the giants and brewers . `` obviously , i 've made mistakes , but hopefully , these fans will get a chance to know who i really am and not be judgmental about my past mistakes . ",
        "`` after the all-star game , hader apologized to his teammates and expressed regret during a news conference , insisting the seven-year old tweets are n't reflective of the person he is today . when he took the mound at miller park saturday , he received a standing ovation from brewers fans , the type of reaction typically reserved for no hitters , milestones and farewell hader will be pitching in an entirely different environment this weekend , facing hostile fans in a city that 's known for its protests against racism , homophobia and hate speech . the response will be harsh when he takes the rubber in the visiting team 's bullpen along the third baseline at at&t , who 's entering the game with a era and a whip in 33 appearances , says he 's ready for whatever giants fans throw his way . ",
        "`` i 'm not really expecting anything , '' hader said . `` whatever they want to say to me , if it 's good or bad , i 'm ready for anything . `` i really do n't know how they will react . i 'm here to do my job and not let any distractions get to me , whether it 's my past mistakes or the crowd . `` the giants wo n't be focusing on hader 's past either . they 're more concerned with chasing down the los angeles dodgers , arizona diamondbacks and colorado rockies in the national league west standings than their fans reactions to hader 's tweets . ",
        "`` i 'll be honest , that 's the last thing i 've been thinking about the last couple days , '' giants manager bruce bochy said . `` my thoughts : we need to get rolling here . '' "
