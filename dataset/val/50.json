        "and just like that , more than $ 100 billion worth of facebook is 's what happened shortly after the stock market opened thursday , as facebook 's shares fell almost 20 percent at the opening bell , to $ , in the wake of an earnings report and outlook that left some on wall street wondering if the social media giant 's best days may already be behind it . with the losses , facebook 's market capitalization fell to as low as $ 419 billion after finishing wednesday with a valuation of about $ 522 billion . `` for now , facebook stock is in the penalty box , '' said dan ives , chief strategy officer and head of technology research at gbh insights . ",
        "`` this is a fork in the road situation for facebook to drive back content , engagement , and get the company onto its next phase of growth or face much more challenges ahead . `` adding to concerns about facebook was its user-growth rates and outlook . the company said it ended its second quarter with billion monthly active users , but that figure was up by just percent from the first quarter of the year . '' outlook suggests a growth ` wall ' is in sight , '' said pivotal research analyst brian wieser , in a research note thursday morning . ",
        "`` the big story for the market was the commentary around deceleration at high single-digit levels during each of the next two quarters . `` those factors wehner mentioned are proving to be daunting even for a company as big and well-known as facebook . in addition to the investments in new services , facebook said its business is being impacted by the effects of foreign-currency exchange rates and the recently implemented general data protection regulation standards put in place by the european union which are meant to give individuals more privacy , and control of their personal data online .
