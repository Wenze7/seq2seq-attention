        "even in a crowded field of distinctive voices emerging out of chicago hip-hop , valee stands out . he 's not the loudest or flashiest mc . on the contrary , he just may be the quietest , the most subtle . his songs appear , dust the environment around your ears with whispers and implications , and then vanish only a minute or two later . `` people say it 's a quiet flow , that it sounds like i 'm in a library , '' valee says . `` that could have come from when i was living in my old place , a nice loft . ",
        "i was the youngest person in the building and i would be working alone on my music . i would get emails two or three times a month about ` loud ' music , so i became quieter and quieter about making beats . it was a necessity not to irritate my neighbors . `` he also reminisces about listening to his mother 's favorite singers -- sade and whitney houston -- when he was a kid growing up on the south side in the '90s . `` i love whitney , but her music could get on my nerves -- so much loudness , yelling , '' he says . ",
        "`` sade never got on my nerves . i do n't want to get on people 's nerves . i try to put myself in other people 's shoes . why do n't you like this song ? if i play somebody 's mixtape , if it gets on my nerves halfway through because it 's too loud or everything sounds the same , it makes me want to approach every song i do differently . i do n't want somebody saying , ` that 's enough of this , ' when they listen to my music . `` now listeners ca n't seem to get enough of it . ",
        "valee emerged with a 2016 song , `` shell , '' that caused a major ripple for its stylistic daring , its idiosyncratic yet fully formed execution . it takes the ominous elements of trap and strips them down to its rawest essentials . the words are seemingly about nothing special , and yet they resonate almost in spite of themselves : `` walked out gucci , then crossed the street / upset stomach , i had to eat . '' the line is punctuated by a groan -- `` ooh '' -- that becomes a subtle hook , delivered with all the urgency of someone waking up from a nap . ",
        "it 's over in 109 seconds . the accompanying video has become just as iconic , a slow-motion slice of life that stands in stark contrast to most boisterous , quick-edit hip-hop visuals . `` living in chicago you have got to not be afraid about failing at something , '' valee says . `` at the time we had chief keef and lil durk coming out . keef is doing videos with all these people in the street , and i could n't do something like that . i did n't know how to shoot videos when it came time . ",
        "i worked really hard on making good music , and the right videographers came to me . they helped me put out relaxed videos , where i 'm not jumping up and down , doing more slo-mo . i do n't want to make videos that come out looking like commercials or movie trailers . `` two years later , valee has a record deal with kanye west 's music label and released his first ep for the label in march , `` good job , you found me . '' since then , he 's continued to drop singles and is also working on a full-length album . ",
        "it was n't necessarily the life valee envisioned for himself when he was a teenager growing up on the south side , even though he dabbled in music for about two in high school , valee taylor learned how to make beats from a neighbor and formed a rap group with three friends . he recorded a few of the group 's songs on his computer , but when it crashed , he lost interest and began devoting his time to fixing cars . at various times he 's also worked as an electrician and was making a comfortable living and had no aspirations to get back into music as he rolled into his 20s . ",
        "one weekend when he got bored , he hopped into his car and on a whim veered into a guitar center and bought himself a bunch of recording gear . it was a lark that turned into an obsession . `` it was frustrating at first after i hooked up the gear , rewired a bunch of stuff and downloaded beatmaking software , '' he says . `` i was teaching myself how to make these things sound like i imagined them to sound , and that took a while . but when i get into something , i get obsessed with it to the point where nothing else matters . ",
        "when you 're in the middle of it , you forget about how long it 's taking . you dive in and you have no choice but to get better . there was nothing else to do , and you 're never satisfied . `` valee knew his approach , his subject matter would have to be different to matter to anyone . `` in rap a lot of people are saying the same thing , so i have to say it differently , '' he says . `` to get beyond that , i knew each sentence i rap had to make sense , had to paint its own story . ",
        "you had to be able to picture yourself doing it and not just say stuff to get you through a verse . `` in addition to making every word count , the producer-mc put a premium on brevity . `` i would be with friends of mine who definitely would tune out on a pretty big artist once the song got to the second verse , '' he says . `` i 'd think this person paid a lot of money for this video , but my friends , who are fans of hip-hop , could n't care less about the next minute and half of this expensive video . ",
        "i want to keep people involved , i want them to care . `` it 's why he 's being careful about his next move , even as he continues to drop distinctive singles such as `` womp womp '' and `` loading . '' patience , he has found , has its rewards . `` i 'm glad that i 'm not putting out a full-length yet , '' he says . `` with a little bit of waiting , something extra will come up . `` greg kot co-hosts `` sound opinions '' at 8 friday , 7 saturday and 2 .
