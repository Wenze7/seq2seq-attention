        "the detroit pistons ' fifth highest-paid player was an afterthought for much of last season . langston galloway is owed $ million in 2018-19 . but where does the shooting guard fit on this roster ? do you remember playing `` where in the world is carmen sandiego ? '' as a kid ? personally , i do n't . but i imagine the concept is similar to langston galloway ` s current situation with the detroit the end of last season , he was largely an 26-year-old signed a two-year deal worth just over $ 14 million back in july 2017 . ",
        "after playing in 27 of the first 29 games , galloway began to receive plenty of `` did-not-plays '' . in those 27 games , his numbers were n't terrible . he averaged points , rebounds , assists and steals in minutes of action . galloway also shot percent from the floor and percent from beyond the , nothing that will jump out at you . but his play was n't awful . was galloway trigger-happy ? absolutely . should he have gone to his dribble more often ? there 's no doubt . but his sudden drop off in playing time was odd the remaining 53 games , he was benched in 22 of them . ",
        "this included two five-game stretches where galloway did n't see the of this could be attributed to avery bradley , reggie bullock , and luke kennard all competing for minutes at shooting guard , in addition to , who struggled during his short tenure in detroit , started all 40 games when available . that was n't going to change as long as he was on the blossomed into one of the league 's best 3-point shooters . he finished second in 3-point percentage , with a final tally of kennard was n't as effective , but he did shoot percent from the floor and percent from deep as a the midway point of the season , both players had leapfrogged galloway in the rotation , and deservedly so . ",
        "but to bench him so often and abruptly , what purpose could that have served ? only stan van gundy knows the answer to that van gundy is gone , and it 's up to dwane casey to figure out how one of the club 's highest-paid players fits into the 's hard to see anyone start at the two over bullock . his size and 3-point shooting ca n't be replicated . that most likely solidifies kennard as the backup shooting that leaves galloway is anybody 's guess . but it would be a mistake to automatically pencil him in as the third option . ",
        "rookies bruce brown and khyri thomas are knocking on the door , and they 're not as reliant on spot-up 'll have to wait until the preseason to see where galloway fits with the is , if he even fits at all . "
