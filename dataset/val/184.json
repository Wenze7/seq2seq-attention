        "utah is the first team in the conference to open the regular season and the first in the south to start training constitutes a successful camp ? that depends on the depth chart , of course , but the hotline figured a dash of context might be in order . *** arizonabest case : if khalil tate stays away from twitter and stays in the pocket ; right tackle thiyo lukusa plays like an elite big ten recruit ; the linebackers are as good as the hotline advertised ; former safety dane cruikshank 's name is rarely mentioned ; and the stadium renovation remains on case : if tailback jj taylor is less than 100 percent when game week arrives ; the backup quarterback situation remains muddled ; justin belknap and co. . ",
        "look wobbly on the defensive front ; safety scottie young 's situation becomes a distraction ; and a whiff of controversy surfaces ... from the basketball 's mouth to our ears : `` when you 're the back-up quarterback , it 's really kind of a cool position because you 've really got nothing to lose when you go in . you do n't get yanked . you just go back to where you were , right ? so there is a little different pressure when you 're a starter , and it comes with the things that are expected of you . ",
        "not just on the field , but off the field and on the sideline . so that growth is taking place because as great as his numbers are , he 's really a young player . `` my brain to this keyboard : aside from a handful of positions on the offensive line , the wildcats are in solid shape across the depth chart . combine the quarterback , defense and schedule , and sumlin stepped into a good situation . the wildcats should be in week three form in week : sept. . ",
        "1 vs brigham young *** arizona statebest case : if the new offensive linemen , especially lt casey tucker , are ready to contribute pronto ; a backup tailback surfaces ; nobody gets cut from the roster ; the defense grasps the basics of coordinator danny gonzales ' 3-3-5 scheme ; and michigan state suffers a chicken pox outbreak that lasts through the second saturday in case : if quarterback manny wilkins stagnates ; linebacker koron crump and cornerback chase lucas feel like they 're playing 2-on-11 ; anything happens to tailback eno benjamin or receiver n'keal harry ; and herm edwards loses his voice after 200-something interviews this ' mouth to our ears : `` 70 % of your day a lot of times is spent on recruiting .",
        "it 's a year-round process . i never would have imagined , and i 've been in college football before -- i 've been recruited as a college athlete -- that the degree of recruiting now . you 're talking about 2020 kids . we already are looking at 2020 kids . i 'm going , really , 2020 ? how do you make a decision on a 2020 kid ? `` my brain to this keyboard : new offensive line , new defensive line , new defensive playbook , new culture ... and precious little time to learn with san diego state , michigan state and washington in the first month . ",
        "no team has more to accomplish in camp than the sun : sept. . 1 vs. utsa *** coloradobest case : if tailback travon mcmillian loosely resembles phillip lindsay ; the offensive line produces an upside surprise after the disappointing '17 season ; defensive linemen javier edwards and chris mulumba are impact players consistently ; and freshman cornerback chris miller plays like a case : if quarterbacksteven montez is n't sharp ; the young wideouts are n't consistent ; and coach mike macintyre does n't see a few of the same traits that were visible in aug. . ' 16 , when cu was quietly positioning itself for a breakout 's mouth to our ears : '' has gone from algebra to calculus in understanding how to prepare for a game , his film study and all the things he 's doing . ",
        "he 's been around the office all summer , watching tape , working on it , studying it . and kurt roper , our new quarterback coach , has done a great job with him . `` my brain to this keyboard : we wo n't begin to speculate on cu 's effectiveness on the lines of scrimmage -- too many new players , too little game experience -- but the hotline would be surprised if montez does n't thrive under roper 's tutelage . sometimes , a different voice can change : aug. . ",
        "31 vs. colorado state *** uclabest case : if the defensive line solidifies around chigozie nnoruka ; someone emerges at quarterback not named dorian thompson-robinson ; tight end caleb wilson 's forefoot remains sturdy ; and edge rusher jaelen phillips shows off the form that made him the most coveted prospect in the class of ' case : if devon modster plays like a backup quarterback , wilton speight plays like a starter ... at michigan tech ; the defense allows rushing yards per practice ; the offensive line is as mediocre as expected ; and chip kelly banishes the bruins to san 's mouth to our ears : `` if we 're going to be successful at ucla , it really starts on the defensive side of the ball .",
        "one thing that people do n't realize ' or maybe just kind of glossed over , is when we were really good at oregon is because we were really good on defense . `` my brain to this keyboard : player development was lacking in westwood under the previous coaching staff . expect that to change under the current staff : kelly and his assistants will get the most out of the talent , however much : sept. . ",
        "1 vs. cincinnati *** uscbest case : if jt daniels plays like matt barkley as a rookie , matt fink plays like sam darnold as a rookie , or none of the quarterbacks play like a rookie ; the offensive line avoids serious injury ; a cornerback emerges opposite iman marshall and a safety emerges opposite marvell tell ; and playcaller tee martin thrives on a staff that has only one coach named case : if daniels plays like a teenager ; tailback stephen carr runs like an octogenarian ; the defense is anything less than stellar ; and if essential personnel , as often happens with all the distraction of los angeles , engages in off-the-field 's mouth to our ears : `` we 've got 25 practices .",
        "i 'll name somebody before the opening game . i do n't have a crystal ball because i 'm going to have to have time enough to allow the kids to compete and make the best decision for the football team . so i think it will be later than sooner . `` my brain to this keyboard : more than a few usc fans are undoubtedly wondering if helton will pick the right quarterback . but if execution matches the talent at the other 21 spots , the trojans would merely need decent qb play to control the : sept. . ",
        "1 vs. unlv *** utahbest case : if quarterback tyler huntley improves his pocket efficiency ; the young defensive backs play like veteran defensive backs ; anything bad happens to byu ; receiver britain covey plays like he spent a two-year mission on the patriots practice squad ; and coach kyle whittingham only has to answer one question per day about never having won the case : if the offense looks like it has a new playcaller ; defensive tackles pita tonga and leki fotu do n't look like utah defensive tackles ; the receivers prove their skeptics correct ; and chase hansen is forced to return to safety because of concerns on the back 's mouth to our ears : `` we 've had a chance to get to the championship game a couple times , have not capitalized on that opportunity .",
        "that 's the next step of our evolution as a program ... i 've heard it over and over : we 're the only team in the south , since we joined the league , that has n't gotten there . but we own up to that . we 're not trying to hide from that . `` my brain to this keyboard : considering the utes have a veteran quarterback , four returning starters on the line , an established scheme and familiar playcaller , there should be no talk of the defense being ahead of the offense .
