",
        "his decision will lead to some ripple effects that will shape this class . to start with , he is the first 5-star defensive tackle that kirby smart has received a commitment from since he arrived back in august just a few days away , fans across the sec are starting to get quite excited . teams like south carolina and missouri are already starting to get a little bit too excited about their 2018 seasons . florida and tennessee also seem to assume that they will instantly be better under their new head here at uga , things just keep chugging along . ",
        "our record-breaking 2018 signing class is in town and seems to be fitting in nicely . the young players that need to step up and fight for positions are working hard . while everyone outside athens seems to have something to say about this current georgia team , kirby smart and his players are relatively , they 're just doing the work they need to on the recruiting trail and the practice field . so why exactly is the walker commitment such a big deal ? why should the rest of the sec continue to be worried about what smart and his coaching staff are building right now ?
