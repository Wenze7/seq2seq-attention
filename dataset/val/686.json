        "with the pac-12 championship , san francisco bowl and national championship all slated to be played in the bay area this season , many are hoping to prove that the region will embrace college football . of course , the threeames also will be a boon to the area 's pro teams . 49ers general manager john lynch said he was n't sold on first-round pick mike mcglinchey until he saw the notre dame offensive tackle in person at stanford . `` i 'll be at the national championship for many reasons . one of them is the story of mike mcglinchey , '' lynch said at monday 's touchdown tailgate luncheon in santa clara . ",
        "`` you saw him on tape over and over and over , but one of the things that sold me was seeing him in person against stanford . `` i was down on field in the notre dame end zone during pregame warm-ups and watched his attention to detail . it was like he played a game before the game . for college football players , sometimes it 's the little things that differentiate them , and those are the things you can see in person . `` i ca n't wait for this game to be here . '' ",
        "tight end u : after receiving a text from 49ers head coach kyle shanahan about an injured tight end , lynch joked that he 'd just borrow one from stanford . the cardinal , who probably run as many two-tight-end sets as anyone team in the country , are adding 6-foot-4 , 230-pound freshman taeveonle to a group that included kaden smith , colby parkinson and scooter harrington . the returners combined for 36 catches , 521 yards and nine touchdowns last season . `` i was going to call my buddy david shaw , because i know he just stockpiles tight ends up at stanford , '' lynch joked . ",
        "`` if we could take one on loan , so we do n't have to fly someone out for a couple of days , that would be great . '' just for kicks : brent brennan said he learned a ton during his first season as san jose state 's head coach , namely letting bryce crawford attempt field goals from yardage that other coaches would n't even consider . crawford had five field goals of at least 50 yards last season . including crawford 's five , the school has had 17 such kicks in its history . `` last year as first-time head coach , i made a couple of stupid decision to go for it on 4th-and-short from just past the 50 , '' brennan said . ",
        "`` i should have just let him bang another 55-yarder . i 'm learning as i go . '' for no . 9 : about a year ago , brennan told boogie roberts that he could wear a single-digit jersey number if he maintained a or better grade-point average . the senior defensive lineman has gotten at least a since then and is listed as no . 9 on the roster . lockdown corner ? brennan played receiver at ucla from 1993 through ' 94 , and shaw played receiver at stanford from 1991 through ' 94 , so naturally , cal head coach justin wilcox , a defensive back at oregon from 1996 through ' 99 , was asked how he would have covered the bay area 's other head coaches . ",
        "`` probably a lot of double coverage , '' joked wilcox , who did n't allow a touchdown reception his senior season . `` we 'd try to make them run the ball . we 'd force their hand and make them run it . '' rusty simmons is a san francisco chronicle staff writer . "
