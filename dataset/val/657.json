        "there was a certain irony for the bears on thursday night as they prepared to face the ravens in the hall of fame game . there was brian urlacher , once the heartbeat of the defense , an eight-time pro bowl selection and now a hall of famer , going from player to player with high-fives and words of , an elite member of the franchise 's long linebacker lineage , was receiving his latest acknowledgement for his big weekend at the pro football hall of the young linebacker expected to begin the next chapter of defensive dominance for the bears was nowhere to be found , not around to grasp the significance of urlacher 's smith , who was drafted no . ",
        "8 in april -- one slot ahead of where urlacher was picked in 2000 -- has yet to sign his rookie contract . he has n't reported to training camp and has n't been able to begin practicing with his shrugged friday afternoon when asked about smith 's ongoing absence and a contract melodrama that has killed some of the summer buzz around the team . `` it 's a business deal , '' urlacher said . `` that 's the way it goes . sometimes these things happen . i do n't think it 's his issue . i do n't think it 's the bears ' decision for this to happen . ",
        "but let 's see where it goes . `` eighteen years ago , as a top-10 pick and a player expected to help revive the bears defense , urlacher made certain to report to camp on time . he told his agent he wanted no part of a holdout , in big part because he needed to learn to play linebacker after spending the latter part of his college career at new mexico as a safety . `` i ca n't speak for other people , but i told my agent : ` i will not miss camp . i 'll be in there . ",
        "even if we sign the day before , i will not miss camp at all . i think it 's detrimental to me learning the defense and my teammates . ' we made sure we got it done in time . `` urlacher stayed true to his word , won defensive rookie of the year honors in 2000 and went on to enjoy a storied career that has led him this weekend to the hall of smith can enjoy a similar journey when he finally signs and joins the bears on the field . still , urlacher said , the rookie should not be concerned with any lofty expectations or comparisons as his arrival inevitably sparks references to urlacher , mike singletary , dick butkus and bill george . ",
        "`` there should n't be any pressure , should n't be any comparisons , '' urlacher said . `` there are no comparisons . it 's like what i said when people asked me that question . it 's not fair to butkus , to singletary , to bill george to compare me to them . i 'm not them . i was me . i did n't think it was fair to them . they were in the hall of fame at that time . `` urlacher now is 's career arc is yet to be seen . but he 'll have to find a way to erase the frustrations that have come from his holdout .
