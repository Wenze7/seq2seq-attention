        "first-round draft pick . defensive rookie of the year . eight-time pro bowl selection . nfc champion . soon , an official member of the pro football hall of a stellar 13-year career with the bears , brian urlacher 's legacy is defined not only by his personal accomplishments but also by the impact he had on teammates , coaches and others associated with the 's official hall of fame enshrinement will come next weekend in canton , ohio , a landmark moment that will put him in the most elite football company there will be presented at the induction ceremony by former bears defensive coordinator bob babich . ",
        "and he will be celebrated by a legion of bears supporters , including those who spent considerable time with him at halas hall , at soldier field and in stadiums around the tribune recently caught up with those who knew urlacher best . these are their jones : in the locker room , he was hilarious . we were a very , very close team in chicago . like brothers , like a family . we were together all the time . and ` lach was one of the ringleaders . we had this game where we had this ball made out of the tape that you wrap your ankles with and we 'd shoot this huge ball into the laundry basket . ",
        "guys would get crazy . double or nothing . you name it . it turned into this whole event at lunchtime . and ` lach was the main ringleader . it would piss tony medlin off because he 's trying to get clothes out of the laundry basket and as he 's standing there he 's ducking as this big ball comes flying at the basket . and brian was the ringleader of all of this . that was ` lach . on the field , he was always goofing around . stuffing grass in people 's helmets . it was like you took kids from pop warner and you fast-forwarded 20 years later and they were doing the exact same things . ",
        "that 's why people loved him so much . because as big of a star as brian was , he was one of the most humble guys you 'll ever meet . and he was very , very approachable . ... brian just had this mystique , man . a presence . it was a quiet confidence . he never bragged . he never talked about himself . he was a big kid . all he did was laugh and joke around . and even in practice , he was still always happy-go-lucky . so i never really saw that other side of him until game time . ",
        "and then it was like he became another person . i do n't know , man . it was like he got this crazy mean streak about him . i was like that in practice . everything i did was intense . i did n't know how to do anything different . out on the field , in the weight room , watching film , everything i did was very intense and serious . no games . but then you see someone like brian who is playing at such a high level . he 's literally chasing down quarterbacks , chasing down running backs , knocking the crap out of fullbacks and linemen . ",
        "always around the ball . always making plays . and it was crazy to see him go from being this happy-go-lucky guy who is always laughing and joking and then he turns into this kind of savage of a player . it was like a magic kreutz : have you ever heard the story of his first play live at middle linebacker in practice ? so barry minter is hurt and brian was n't exactly setting the world on fire at sam . they had him on the line and they were trying him there and no one was overly impressed . ",
        "you could see in practice his athleticism , but at sam it was n't amazing and barry minter was here and everybody loved barry . he was a good leader and steady and right at the end of his they put urlacher at middle linebacker and in those days , i am not saying i was great , but when there was outside zone , linebackers were easy for me and i cut them off in a second . so i jump out and try to cut off ` lach on that first play and he just flies . i came back to the huddle and i was like , '' that guy is fast ! ",
        "leave him there . '' that was my third year and i was n't great , but i was pretty damn good by then and i jumped out there like , `` this is my block . i 'm going to kill this guy . '' he just flew by me big and strong and fast and i do n't know if i 've ever seen anything quite like , he ends up being a first-ballot hall of fame guy and now , yeah , looking back that is how good he was , but at the time i was like , '' i 've never seen anything like that . '' ",
        "i do n't think ` lach even knew how fast he was at that time . if you could imagine the first time playing mike and you designed something and said , `` what would brian urlacher be really good at ? '' well , it would be chasing down the outside zone . he did that and there was n't a linebacker i played against -- pro bowl , all-pro at that time -- that i was n't cutting off with ease and ` lach 's speed was on a whole other smith : brian urlacher comes over right at that intermission . ",
        "and i grabbed brian and i looked at him with a smile and i said , `` hey , brian . you know it 's time now , right ? what are you waiting for ? we 're running out of time . if we 're going to do something , we need to do it pretty quick . '' brian and i are just casually talking . it 's not like i 'm chewing him out . i was just trying to loosen him up and get him going . so i said , `` you 're freaking brian urlacher . ",
        "you need to make something happen right now . '' and brian did . ... for brian to yank the ball out , he 's tearing the ball from a great player 's hands . and then , where have we heard this before ? charles tillman involved with a takeaway ? and scoring a touchdown ? we 've seen and heard that many times . ... brian was everything you want a linebacker to be . first off , that leader . the voice . the guy who 's out front . he 's an imposing figure . every play , they see a 6-4 , 260-pound , 6 percent body-fat guy in front of you . ",
        "... and brian was a guy who knew what everybody was supposed to do . you expect that guy , in big games , to come through . if we needed him to make a big hit , he did that time after time . stripped the ball . you expected that out of a first-ballot hall of famer . the chicago bears should have a player like that . and they mccaskey : wow . where do you start ? twenty-five tackles in the `` crown their ass '' game . there he is ripping the ball away . ",
        "peanut picks it up and scores . i also think about his 90-yard fumble return in atlanta . he looks like he 's having a conversation with the entire falcons bench as he 's running down their sideline . but i can tell you this : my favorite brian memory is not on the field at all . we had this ticket donation program with the players , which is now called `` home team hand-off . '' it was more informal back then . my assistant in the ticket office was kendra maher . ... brian would go to her and tell her , `` you tell me how many you need me to buy . ",
        "and you decide who 's getting the benefit and i 'll take care of it . '' he did n't want anybody to know about it . he 'd probably be mad at me for telling you this . but that was his tickets would go to so many various charities -- midtown educational association , special olympics illinois and a whole host of other organizations . the program continues to this day . but brian was the one who really propped it up . that told me that he was incredibly generous , that he did n't want anyone to know about it , that he does the right thing when people are n't looking . ",
        "he gets it . that 's what being a leader and being a bear parrish : right away , you could tell brian was a phenomenal athlete when he first arrived . but he was kind of like a ` slash . ' he played a few different positions early on -- sam and the will spot . and then greg blache put him in the middle . we had those two mountains up front in ted washington and keith traylor with brian right behind them . and that story ends with the yellow jacket on brian 's back . ",
        "... i also remember coming back to the huddle and during timeouts , brian would be singing just about every song they were playing in the stadium . all the time . on the field . and it seemed like he knew all the lyrics to all the songs . did n't matter what genre . he was just having fun the whole i also remember after games sitting next to mike brown and saying , `` how many tackles did you get today ? '' because it was just like a race . we were racing just to get a piece of something because the rest of that defense was just so strong . ",
        "and brian was at the forefront of that . mike and i were basically running around and jumping on piles pretty much . that was our running blache : what always impressed me was how smart he was . brian had football savvy right away that a lot of young guys could n't ever dream about . the only guy i ever put in that ballpark with him was mike brown . as far as football sense was concerned , those were two of the best i have ever been around . that was such an added plus . we just had to make certain we took him along and did n't get him hurt as we were going through the process of making him a middle linebacker . ",
        "... our plan was to eventually move him to middle linebacker regardless . he actually started his first game for us as a nickel ` backer . we put him at middle linebacker in the nickel because he did n't have to run in traffic . you get a guy who 's 6-5 and he has played safety and you throw him in the middle with all those bodies , you 're asking for disaster . so we started him off at sam , where all the traffic came from one direction . even though you 're on the line of scrimmage , it was from one direction . ",
        "he had always played 15 yards off the ball and ran to the ball . he did n't have to take people on . and so that was a concern . getting him through the adjustment physically of being up front , in the mix , with all the big guys . he took to it well . ... we started him off that first year at sam behind rosie . brian worked hard and he was embarrassed when he was not named the starter . he did n't even go home and tell his family . because he was that much of a competitor . ",
        "i talked to him and said , `` brian , you 're going to be our guy . there is no doubt in our mind . but it would be stupid for us to put you in situations that are dangerous for you . '' a lot of people say he should have started day one . but if he had torn his knee up , he would have been another one of those statistics of great first-rounders who got hurt and never , ever materialized . in reality , we 're sitting here talking about a guy going into the hall of fame . ",
        "getting a briggs : when i first got to the bears , i hardly said i word . i kept my head down and just focused on my play . brian brought me into the group and made me part of it . that 's just the way he was with the defense and in the locker room . we had a lot of fun , and coach lovie allowed us to because we were sharp on the field . we loved playing together and being together , and that started with brian . i eventually earned a spot in the starting 11 and we were able to develop a partnership that was just remember the first game in 2005 against the redskins . ",
        "brian was flying around . he made one , and i remember saying to myself , `` man , he 's going to win defensive player of the year this year . '' and , sure enough , he did ! tony medlin : when we were playing the green bay packers on dec. . 23 , 2007 , brian ran an 85-yard pick-six versus brett favre . we won that game 35-7 . that was one of the greatest moments when you say brian urlacher . i remember when he ran across that goal line , he was just huffing and puffing . ",
        "he came back and everybody started laughing . he really was shaking his head at how tired he was . that 's a big one for me because when you 've got a chance to beat green bay or you get a chance to intercept one of the greatest players in nfl history in brett favre , that 's a big statement . you had hall of famer versus hall of famer . you did n't know it at the time , but you knew at some point they 'd get that joniak : few players i have come across in my career loved the game more -- and i mean the day-to-day grind . ",
        "he loved everything . loved being on the field with his teammates . loved practice . loved the locker room and the fun they had in there . he knew the defense cold , knew everyone 's responsibilities and ran the show . not one guy i have ever spoken to did n't say the same thing about brian . he ferociously supported every teammate and would do anything for anybody at any time . from the time he walked into the building , he was a positive . he competed every day and loved his will never forget early in his career . ",
        "brett favre rolled out to his right and was chased down from behind . and i remember favre got up and turned his head , stunned that he was tackled -- and it was brian . that mental speed and instinctiveness served him well . it was an honor to call his games , an honor to call the career of a hall of fame middle linebacker who made so many big plays . i have too many favorites to list . the comeback in arizona was a trademark game . he was a sideline-to-sideline nightmare for the cardinals in that game : 19 tackles , three hits on the qb , three stuffs , one forced fumble and two pass breakups . ",
        "incredible day . incredible forte : me being a rookie coming in , i look across the defense before my first carry at camp , and there was brian urlacher , lance briggs , tommie harris , peanut tillman , mike brown -- the whole super bowl defense . the first play , brian called out the play . like , `` it 's coming right here ! '' i 'm thinking to myself , `` if he knows where the play is going , how are we going to run the play ? '' needless to say , he was right there to make the play too . ",
        "playing against a defense like that a young rookie groomed me to know that i just arrived here and that i had n't made johnson : in 2013 , shortly after i became the head coach of riverview high school , i reached out to brian and he was more than willing to help . he did n't hesitate . he said , `` what can i do to help you ? '' i told him we were in need of new uniforms at our school and he said , `` consider it done . '' we got it done . ",
        "we were struggling . we had n't gotten new uniforms in a long time and we were having to mix and match a little bit and piece some stuff together . we had over 60 kids on our varsity team at the time and this was a necessity . this was n't just wanting to look cool . the kids were fired up when they learned they came from brian urlacher . it made me a pretty cool coach , but they were super excited and shocked he was the one that facilitated it and got it `` big cat '' williams : the first time we saw him at practice , being out on the field , they put him in at outside linebacker . ",
        "i think we ran a sweep play . it was myself and chris villarrial . we teamed up to urlacher , and we missed him . we got back to the huddle and talked amongst ourselves , and we could n't figure it out . we were like , `` damn , that dude is fast as hell . `` so we go back in and look at film . come to find out , dude had taken three steps in the wrong direction and was fast enough to still beat us over the top . we were like , `` dude , we are in some trrrooouuuubbbbbble . ",
        "we might have to make some adjustments . '' you could tell when he first hit the field that he was going to be something mannelly : i have two stories . one is on the field , one is off the field . my no . 1 story is that , you know , he was sponsored by nike . he would go through shoes all the time at practice and then have them in his locker . him being who he was , when you went to ask him for an autograph for a auction item or something like that , he would say , `` is this a big event ? '' ",
        "i 'd be like , `` yeah , yeah . '' he 'd be like , `` oh , let me get you a pair of shoes , and i 'll sign the shoes because it 's something different '' instead of a piece of paper or photo or football . he went out of his way to think about his teammates and help charity and think , `` how can i make it different ? '' i would show up to these events or sent stuff off -- brian 's signed shoes -- and they 're like , `` oh my god , this is awesome ! '' ",
        "they would raise so much money because it was something different . but that 's brian and who he was as a teammate , thinking about what he could do to help out . that kind of sums him up that he was such a great guy , a great teammate . i probably got 10 pairs of his shoes over my the field , i just remember -- it had to be his first year -- it was up in green bay . favre is rolling out to his right , coming toward our bench . favre ... looks over his left shoulder and thinks he has an extra second . ",
        "he takes that little half-second pump to try to throw something in there , and the next thing you know his face is right in the turf . it was urlacher chasing him , and i think that was a moment when he was like , `` oh , crap , this dude is for real . he 's got a different gear , and i really have got to worry about this guy . '' i think us as a team and teammates were like , `` all right , we 've got something special . `` greg gabriel : it goes back to late december 2001 , our first season here . ",
        "the final game was in detroit . being that i lived in buffalo , i flew home to get my kids and drove to detroit so they could see the bears play . my kids were like 12 , 13 years old , and so obviously in awe of pro football players . brian saw me in the lobby with the girls , came over and said hello , said , `` are these your kids ? '' he went out of his way to be nice and be friendly and say hello to the kids and me . it 's little stuff like that that jumped out at me about brian urlacher the person . ",
        "i could think of all of the times you 'd be in the weight room working out , and he 'd come up and , `` hey , how 're you doing ? how 's your family doing ? '' i just think he 's a quality person on top of being a great athlete . brian ... was a pretty humble guy and raised right , so i think a lot of it has to do with that . he knew where he came from . , part of the reason he became the great player he did become was really bringing in lovie and putting him in that defense . ",
        "he was the perfect player for that scheme . before lovie came here , his ideal linebacker was really the will linebacker , and we had a great one too in lance briggs , but because of brian , he put a lot more onus then on what the middle linebacker could do . that marriage of lovie and brian actually made brian 's career turn to be out the way it made things look easy . he was n't the greatest pass rusher , but what he could do -- and part of it was he played safety in college -- is he could drop into zone and take away the whole center of the field because of his ability to play zone coverage . ",
        "a lot of that underneath stuff across the middle , you could n't do it with brian urlacher on the pompei : michael vick came into the league in 2001 , and he could not be stopped . it looked like he was playing a different game from everyone else in terms of his speed . no one could chase him and catch him . and then the bears played him , and urlacher just chased him all over the field , ran him down , kept hitting him the whole game , ended up with eight tackles , an interception , a forced fumble , a recovered fumble and he scored a touchdown . ",
        "it was really an eye-opener about the kind of athleticism this guy had at playing at over 250 pounds , that he could chase this incredible , one-of-a-kind quarterback all over the field and not only match his speed or exceed his speed but beat him up physically to the point where he basically defeated him . the bears won that game , and urlacher ended up 5-0 in his career against vick . i 've talked to vick , and vick considers him one of the two greatest nemeses of his entire career , along with julius peppers , who he played all the time because they were in the same division in the nfc south when vick was on the falcons . ",
        "to me , as a player , that was something that really stood a game like that , in terms of how he handled it , he never was a great interview after a game like that . he never had a whole lot to say . but if he played poorly , which was rare , or let 's say he had a play where he looked bad , like the time tom brady deked him in the open field , he was really good talking about that . he was always better talking about things he did n't do well than his own greatness . ",
        "he was also good talking about his teammates . he was always really passionate about praising his teammates and especially about defending his teammates . that was the thing that used to really get him riled up , and i think it ended up probably leading a lot of members of the media to think he was not the greatest guy because he was such a vociferous defender of his teammates , that that 's really all that mattered to way he handled a lot of those interviews was really a window into who he was and the type of person he was and what mattered most to him . ",
        "he 's probably the most humble superstar i 've ever been around . he has very little to no ego whatsoever , and i think that 's part of the secret of his success too . he never saw himself as great a player as he was . he saw himself as a guy who had to work hard for everything he had , do everything the right way . the way he was raised , it was what was in his dna . , i think there was n't much you could say against him other than this was his first time up , and he also was in competition , i guess , with ray lewis , who many people think might have been the greatest middle linebacker ever or one of the top couple anyway . ",
        "other than that , there 's no argument against brian urlacher because he checked all of the boxes as a hall of famer . "
