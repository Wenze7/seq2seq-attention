        "i left chicago in 2001 , but i understand the place . i get it . i still read the tribune every day because it 's the news that makes sense to ' t get me wrong , i 'm not a chicago whisperer . ",
        "i 'm not mike royko or studs terkel , but it 's home , and i get it in a way i 'll never get anything a white supremacist terrorist walked into a bible study at charleston 's emanuel ame church on june 17 , 2015 , and murdered nine people , i realized that despite having lived in charleston for several years by that point , i did n't know the was n't surprised by the racism motivating the murderer , but i thought the initial reckoning that led to the removal of the confederate battle flag from the south carolina state capitol would ultimately also confront the fact that a statue of john c. calhoun loomed over the city 's largest public square , just a few hundred yards away from emanuel ame calhoun was prominent in my northern social studies curriculum , i 'd forgotten his importance by the time i first moved to charleston .",
        "in addition to being vice president of the united states and a senator from south carolina , calhoun argued that slavery was not a necessary evil , but a `` positive good '' benefiting is an ideology central to the terrorist who killed the nine parishioners engaged in bible study at emanuel ame church . we can not excuse calhoun 's beliefs through being a `` man of his time . '' the importation of slaves had been banned in 1808 , almost 30 years before calhoun 's `` positive good '' theory . the prevailing belief , even among the white population , was that slavery was sinful and that it would one day die a `` natural '' a statue of calhoun continues to stand in a place of honor confuses and angers me . ",
        "why ca n't others see what seems so obvious -- that his is a past undeserving of honor ? thankfully , i found answers in a book published earlier this year : `` denmark vesey 's garden : slavery and memory in the cradle of the confederacy '' by historians ethan j. kytle and blain roberts , who are both professors at california state university , but started the book when on the faculty at the citadel in on in the introduction , they offer an anecdote of when they looked at an apartment in one of charleston 's old buildings , built in the 1840s by the toomer family . ",
        "the prospective landlady said that it was once the space of `` the servants . '' `` of the slaves , '' one replied . `` there 's no evidence in the historical records that the toomers did n't pay them , '' the woman double negatives have been in the news lately , but the import of this one was as apparent to me as a reader as it was to the researchers in the moment it occurred . `` denmark vesey 's garden '' explores the willful blindness toward `` america 's original sin '' among some white charlestonians . ",
        "each chapter fills in the gaps between these two histories -- what happened in the historical record versus what those with a vested interest in another narrative prefer to `` remember . `` reading the book helped me realize why calhoun continues to reign over the city , why there is a pitched battle over a new historical marker acknowledging his role in perpetuating slavery and why a city resolution to apologize for slavery passed only 'm still angry and believe the calhoun statue should be removed and his views on slavery roundly condemned . only now , i can make this statement with a more nuanced view of the issues , because this book achieved what books do best : it bridged a gap in my understanding in ways no other medium warner is the author of `` tough day for the army . ",
        "`` book recommendations from the biblioraclejohn warner tells you what to read next based on the last five books you 've `` dangerous liaisons '' by pierre choderlos de laclos2 . `` heat '' by bill buford3 . `` the handmaid 's tale '' by margaret atwood4 . `` a gentleman in moscow '' by amor towles5 . `` amsterdam : a history of the world 's most liberal city '' by russell shorto -- joe i. , lakewood , ohiothere 's a good bit of variety here , so i 'm going to hope i just ca n't go wrong and try `` corelli 's mandolin '' by louis de `` alternate side '' by anna quindlen2 .
