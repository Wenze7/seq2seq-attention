        "in a rare act of rebellion , cook county primary election voters in march fired one of the democratic party 's most powerful politicians . they nominated a newcomer , frederick `` fritz '' kaegi , a financial adviser from oak park , to appear on the november ballot in place of incumbent assessor joseph ran a grass-roots campaign that tapped into local taxpayer resentment over rising property taxes and berrios ' insider politics . the saga of berrios ' office accepting campaign money from attorneys whose clients wanted assessment reductions attracted international interest . the economist magazine profiled the race last fall in an article with a headline that summed up berrios ' reign : `` how cook county 's democratic machine works . ",
        "`` the system of assigning property values in cook county , a key exercise in determining property tax bills , along with the property tax appeal process have long been viewed as rigged . an award-winning 2017 tribune and propublica illinois series , `` the tax divide , '' exposed the system as clout-driven and regressive , hurting minority and low-income communities while protecting wealthier ones . yet berrios relentlessly defended it . his refusal to admit the obvious inequities cost him his for newcomer kaegi is high as he prepares to take over what has been an engine of democratic fundraising . ",
        "every assessor -- but especially berrios , who also ran the cook county democratic party -- has leveraged the position to rake in huge campaign donations from tax appeals lawyers and property owners . not anymore . kaegi says he wo n't take donations from those interests , which he dubs `` the tax appeals industrial complex , '' and he would support an ordinance banning such kaegi gets past the general election as expected -- he faces a republican opponent who is n't campaigning -- he will begin dismantling a system that benefits the state 's most powerful interests .

        "house speaker michael madigan , chicago ald . edward burke and many other elected officials , lawyers , lobbyists and influence peddlers have earned fortunes off the broken property tax system . madigan 's and burke 's law firms represent some of chicago 's most expensive commercial properties , seeking lower if taxpayers expect swift change under kaegi , they might be disappointed . reversing decades of established bad practice in property valuation will take time . motivating and training a patronage-laden and union-protected workforce in the assessor 's office will take persistence . confronting the state 's elites who profit from a fixed property tax system will take 's win represented more than taxpayer backlash . ",
        "it set him up for a clash with the titans . during a meeting with the tribune editorial board , kaegi said he 'll have the tools to fix flaws in the system that punish low-income homeowners , without leaning on springfield to enact changes . through models he expects to test , and with a data-rich real estate landscape , there 's no reason the assessment process ca n't be fair and 's good . but remember , many factors determine what property owners owe in taxes : their school district 's spending , their zip codes , the existence , or not , of commercial development . ",
        "all of that is part of the puzzle that determines a tax bill . city dwellers got their new reassessment notices this summer , with some north side property owners reporting increases . north suburban communities are next . then the south is no guarantee that a new assessor , running a fairer assessment system , will mean lower property tax bills . but we hope it will mean renewed trust in that system . kaegi believes property owners , especially those familiar with the appeals process , are willing to pay their fair share , as long as they feel confident the system is n't driven by taxes and how they 're determined should be a math problem , a formula on paper , not a money grab for politicians .
