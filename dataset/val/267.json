        "including large investments in china mobile and taiwan semiconductor businesses -- the fund also has money in malaysia , romania , russia , brazil , india , thailand , and turkey , among others . aberdeen has other funds that focus exclusively on india , japan and australia . herzfeld 's caribbean basin fund , which goes by the catchy trading name , focuses not just on the late fidel castro 's erstwhile socialist paradise , but also jamaica , trinidad , tobago , puerto rico , haiti , the dominican republic , and aruba , among other islands . ",
        "eighty percent of the fund is invested in various securities , including those of companies with substantial business dealings and trade in the caribbean . have a yen for japanese small-cap plays ? there 's there 's nomura asset management 's $ 376 million japan smaller capitalization fund , which has stakes in okinawa cellular , among other firms . active management closed-end funds that focus on international markets bring to the game something etfs typically do n't -- active management . when dealing with niche foreign markets , having a locally-based fund manager and expert leading the effort can offer a significant advantage . ",
        "`` it creates the ability for some managers to not be as index orientated in some of these more specific markets , '' rvp 's neer says . local knowledge of the market , the company , the country and the culture can all be crucial factors in determining whether an investment is successful . if the fund is focused on chinese companies in particular provinces , then you need a fund manager based in those areas with an in-depth knowledge of the local market and the businesses that are being eyed , says ken nuttall , director of financial planning blackdiamond wealth management in new york . ",
        "`` you have to judge it on how good the manager is , '' nuttall says . `` you have to find a guy who is very talented in finding those niches . '' there 's also another advantage closed-end funds bring to the international investment game , and that 's a stable capital structure . closed-end funds issue shares during an ipo . the number of shares remains fixed and does not expand or contract based on market activity like it does with an etf or an open-end mutual fund . the fixed number of shares means closed-end fund managers do n't have to fear a big outflow if they start buying shares in a high-reward but high-risk sector . ",
        "shares can change hands in daily trading but the overall number stays the same . this structure provides managers with the capital stability they need to take on riskier investments , such as smaller companies in developing markets . `` active management in emerging market securities is more impactful than in the large cap market , '' neer says . `` there would be more opportunities for a good manager to outperform . '' a buying opportunity closed-end funds with an international focus are also selling at an attractive discount to net asset value . the japan smaller capitalization fund , for example , is trading at a nearly % discount . ",
        "herzfeld 's carribean basin fund , or cuba , is trading at an percent discount . essentially , that means their share prices are lower than the value of the portfolio of assets in the fund . there are a couple factors that help create discounts in the closed-end fund world . after a closed-end fund issues shares through an ipo , the number of shares remains fixed and does not expand or contract based on market activity like it does with an etf . this fixed-share structure means the price a closed-end fund trades at each day and the net asset value of its underlying portfolio float independently of each other . ",
        "and while this can sometimes result in closed-end share prices that trade at a premium , or higher than their net asset value , or nav , more frequently it results in a discount situation . this can create opportunities to buy more with less , with investors able to effectively buy a portfolio of japanese small cap stocks for a little over 87 cents on the dollar , or stakes in businesses in cuba and other caribbean nations for an even cheaper 81 cents on the dollar . on top of that , international equities are selling on the cheap right now as well , especially compared to the stock market , which is bouncing around at all-time highs . ",
        "`` foreign investment in general is cheaper now , but you do you have your headwinds , your trade wars out there , '' nuttall says . however , given how high stocks in the are right now , there is probably more upside right now in emerging markets , nuttall says . `` emerging markets have better growth prospects , '' he says . brian fischer , a financial advisor at evensky & katz / foldes financial wealth management in miami , agrees . `` whenever i talk to a client interested in closed-end funds their interest almost always comes from the substantial discounts to nav that they hear about , '' fischer write in an email . ",
        "`` lately , with international stock valuations seemingly cheaper than stocks , there would appear to be an additional margin of safety to supplement discounted international closed-end funds . '' but fischer adds a cautionary note -- discounts from net asset value on closed-end funds do n't typically vanish overnight , offering investors a speedy windfall . rather , it can take time for a discount to narrow and investors to reap the reward . `` it 's important to keep in mind that discounts from nav can and do persist , '' fischer notes . `` from a behavioral perspective , this can be a huge challenge for those that are n't willing to hold on and stay the course .
