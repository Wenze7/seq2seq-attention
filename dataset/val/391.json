        "napa -- yes , the raiders ' offense will need to bounce back to 2016 levels for the raiders to contend for the playoffs in 2018 , but the defense will have to make an even larger 's where guenther comes before gruden took the raiders ' job for a second time this past offseason , he knew that guenther , the longtime cincinnati assistant , was going to be his defensive coordinator . and even though guenther did n't accept gruden 's offer to come to oakland immediately , gruden stuck with his ? to start , trust . ",
        "gruden is an offensive-minded head coach -- that 's no secret -- so his defensive coordinator is granted a tremendous amount of autonomy . gruden needed someone for the dc job that not only did n't need babysitting , but someone who could challenge him and his offensive players in practice as well . `` i think those guys are really close , '' safety marcus gilchrist said about gruden and guenther . `` being that they 're really close , i think they compete a lot . it trickles down to the players and it makes us even more competitive . ",
        "`` the second reason ? it 's simple : `` i love the way the bengals play defense , '' gruden said at his introductory press conference . `` up the field , single gap , get after ya . `` there was little to love about the way the raiders ' played defense last year . despite having one of the best defensive players in the nfl -- khalil mack -- last year , the raiders were one of the worst defenses in the league in 2017 . football outsiders ' dvoa rankings had the raiders ' no . ",
        "29 in overall defense and third-to-last in the nfl in pass defense . and those numbers came after an uptick in play late in the season , after ken norton jr. . was fired as defensive coordinator and john pagano replaced him and attempted to morph the raiders ' two-gap 3-4 defense into a single-gap , 4-3 is tasked with taking that late-season progress and turbo boosting cincinnati , guenther ran what , on the surface , appeared to the layperson be a basic 4-3 , cover-2 defense predicated on physical play on the outside and a strong rush on the reality , guenther 's defense is much , much , more complicated than that . ",
        "guenther has a reputation for being a brilliant blitz designer , and to dial up those blitzes , he reportedly has 14 different defensive-line fronts , 14 stunts and twists , 15 coverages , 20 blitzes out of a four-down front , 26 blitzes out of double-a-gap fronts , and 19 blitzes out of `` odd '' stuff , no doubt . new linebacker derrick johnson called guenther a mastermind of disguising defenses . at the same time , guenther 's defense is already being hailed as simpler than his predecessors ' . yes , the defense is hardly basic , but the responsibilities for each player are more straightforward , particularly for players in the box , in guenther 's ' one-gap defense than in the two-gap system the raiders ' ran last year . ",
        "`` the defense is like night and day to me , from past two years to this year , '' bruce irvin , who is moving to a more traditional defensive end role this season , said sunday . `` guys are flying around . guys are doing less thinking . first day we had five turnovers . all last year we had 14 combined ... less thinking and more reacting . guys just playing football , not out there trying to figure out coverages and what each guy has . it 's just guys lining up , in assignment , making plays . ",
        "`` guenther is facing the challenge of installing his defense without the defense 's most important player , mack , available . mack is currently holding out of camp in an effort to land a new contract and there 's no resolution in said , neither guenther nor gruden is putting much stock in the absence . `` when he gets here -- if he gets here -- he 'll be an exciting piece to add , '' guenther said . `` we were n't very good last year on defense with khalil mack , '' gruden told nfl network monday . ",
        "`` we 've got to get a better pass rush , we 've got to play better defense , period . and we hope khalil gets here , but in the time being , we 've got plenty of guys who need work . `` the raiders are also without second-year rookie corner gareon conley , who strained a hip last week and is expected to miss a couple of weeks . conley was poised to be the raiders ' no . 1 corner this season , but another training camp injury puts that status in , the raiders are down their two best defensive players so far in camp . ",
        "for another defensive coordinator that could be a big problem , but one of the reasons gruden hired guenther is that he 's always been able to do more with cincinnati , he turned vontaze burfict into an impact player and helped author a late-career renaissance for adam `` pacman '' jones . yes , year-in , year-out in cincinnati , the bengals were one of the best defensive teams in the nfl and guenther -- even while an assistant for former dc mike zimmer -- was a massive part of that success . `` he 's a great teacher , he 's been able to get a lot out of players , ' gruden said of guenther in guenther can turn the raiders ' defense into a similarly consistent unit -- hell , if he can get take this current raiders ' defensive roster and get the raiders to play even league-average defense -- he 'll put the raiders ' one good offense away from serious contention in the 's early , but early indications are that gruden and carr better have their a-game ready to go week one .
