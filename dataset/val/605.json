        "at the age of 80 , the michigan-born martha henry has played many of the roles in the shakespeare canon during her 44 years at the flagship theater of her adopted canada . as 10 artistic directors came and went , henry wended her way through lady macbeth and lady macduff , goneril and cordelia , titania and paulina . heck , she played most every significant woman of shakespeare 's imagination , beginning in 1962 with miranda , opposite william hutt 's here is what henry had not done until this summer in director antoni cimolino 's production of `` the tempest '' : played opposite no year , henry is prospero herself . ",
        "and there never was one more -- widely viewed as the shakespearen alter ego , if not his vehicle for saying `` so long , suckers '' at the end of his playwriting career -- delivers the bard 's greatest climactic monologue , a plea to the audience to be freed . and in all my years watching shows at this theater , a miragelike fountain of excellence among the flat farmed lands of ontario , i have never seen anything quite like the experience of watching henry get to say , her cheeks wet with tears , `` gentle breath of yours my sails must fill , or else my project fails , which was to please . ",
        "`` as far as i know henry is not retiring , and cimolino surely has no intention of sending one of his most valuable actors prematurely up to the there is no mistaking how this pair , in tandem with the mystical design of bretta gerecke , have together approached the end of `` the tempest , '' which is to fuse the biography of a great and now aged shakespearean actress finally freed , through the magic of prospero and our halting progress as a species , to play a powerful man with agency . henry gets to say lines that no woman has ever said at this theater -- and that every creature of the theater covets . ",
        "when she gets to the last three words of `` now i want spirits to enforce , art to enchant , '' she hammers them home partly like someone delivering their own eulogy but also like a high school valedictorian who cares about arts education . and then she disappears up into the sky , an artist transformed into can be a crummy life , but as i watched , i kept thinking about how this theater was at least allowing one of its true greats one heck of an exit . most workers -- should they be lucky enough not to already be put out to pasture at age 80 -- end their careers with a cake or a hurried after-work beer , if not a brutal pink slip . ",
        "henry gets shakespeare 's finest gust of wind in her sails . how lucky for is more to `` the tempest , '' of course , than henry 's prospero , including a fascinating performance from mamie zwettler , making her stratford debut as miranda . young zwettler , who looks at henry as one so compelled as to have no other choice , is reminiscent of the british actress carey mulligan , or so you think , at least , until you see the pictures from 1962 of henry playing miranda . i have no idea if such casting was conscious , but it certainly feels like henry is acting right alongside her ingenue 's all a reminder of the pleasures afforded to an audience by long-term commitments of employment to great actors such as henry , who age in their work . ",
        "we see this all too rarely in the theater now , which is pretty much the embodiment of the gig economy . only administrators grow old in their jobs . but stratford has understood better than most the truth that the theater is in the business of relationships , and that beloved performers always fuse with their characters , which is precisely how and why shakespeare wrote his plays . ` coriolanus ` maybe `` the tempest '' is not the aesthetic equal of director robert lepage 's dazzlingly precise `` coriolanus , '' surely the greatest contemporary staging of this play that i ever have seen . ",
        "but i know which of the festival 's two marquee shakespeare productions made me feel more , and that had everything to do with henry , and cimolino 's embrace of her most personal could argue , of course , that such is mere sentiment . and that can cloud clarity of observation of the human condition . lepage would surely make that case . lepage , working at stratford for the first time and never known as the touchy-feely type , has been obsessed with controlling what the audience sees as long as i have been watching his achieves that narrative control -- and dazzlingly so -- partly through focus and rigorous detail : in this production , he has an idea for every scene , and an idea that works . ",
        "but his other method is the literal shading of the stage though his trademark black boxes ; he constantly is closing down one vista and opening up another . at times , all you can see is a single well-positioned face of an actor , soon to be sucked into the void . no one can do the theatrical equivalent of the movie close-up , or a cinematic blackout , quite like its core , `` coriolanus '' is the tragedy of a great leader , a war hero , who is thoroughly irritated by the pesky democratic notion that a politician should be accountable to the people . ",
        "you might see shades of the current president or his russian counterpart but , frankly , most politicians , especially those with a military past , come to have complex relationships with the `` being liked '' part of the job . the longer they serve , the more they think they know better than the great unwashed . maybe they do . maybe they do n't . that 's what this lesser-known play is all -- whose sympathies , like george bernard shaw , often seemed to be more with the intellectual elites than the deplorables -- does not hesitate to show us the downside of the populace , as he does in `` julius caesar , '' through the presence in `` coriolanus '' of his fine pair of brutus and sicinius . ",
        "like many populists , these two leaders know how to exploit those who only intermittently pay attention to the facts . but there is , of course , no alternative to suffering the errors of the ballot box . not beyond either fascism or the show in modern-day rome , lepage , who both directs and set designs with a level of auteur control unusual at this collaborative theater , shows us many vistas on this conundrum . coriolanus is discussed in restaurants and at fat-cat eateries until he is forced to flee in his car . he ultimately is brought to his senses by volumnia , his own mother , an assertive pragmatist if ever there was one in shakespeare 's world . ",
        "but it 's too late for him to turn , his company ex machina , and his stratford collaborators somehow wrangle a difficult play into a heart-stopping narrative that puts you in mind of a martin scorsese film , a noir melange of whispered conversations , insecure familial bonhomie and an overall air of imminent unfettered doom for democracy . there is even a knockout scene of exposition by texting , replete with an emoji that , in this mercurial staging of an unstintingly wide-eyed drama of the omnipresent consequences of human fear , makes all the sense in the raging but buttoned-down star of `` coriolanus , '' andre sills , seems not to know himself at all , which is precisely what the play demands . ",
        "he could not be further from martha henry , of course , just as lepage and cimolino are polar on one remarkable weekend of shakespeare , one offers insight into the painful reality on our television screens , and the other just a hint of only , ms. henry ! ` the rocky horror show ` once richard o'brien 's `` the rocky horror show '' went to the pictures , it could never be the same , thanks to a thousand flea-pit midnight showings of the 1980s , and beyond , the tawdry 1973 london satire of b-movie pulp became an interactive bacchanal fueled by bud light and dominated by gen xers looking to earn their letter . ",
        "and , in the years that followed , this appropriation mostly confused the live theater and its cosplay something to encourage ? ought n't the door be shown to those who loudly added the line `` for the football team '' when janet said she was saving herself ? most live renditions of `` the rocky horror show '' fell somewhere in between and , as a consequence , were about as awkward as virginal brad and janet before they meet frank n. furter , the hands-on counselor and advocate of the life pleasurably lived . for what else we got going ? ",
        "at stratford , though , the director donna feore has gone all in . not only has she embraced the show 's r-rated but singular place in the cultural gestalt , her production has made its verbal interactivity a scripted part of the attraction , even if people are asked to remember , should they feel the urge to throw something , that these are live actors . audience plants lurk in the house , helping patrons remember what to do and , at the rather staid matinee i saw , doing it for them . it 's less organic , for sure , but it also allows the actors to know what 's coming and work it into what they 're doing . ",
        "when you add a scenic environment from michael gianfrancesco that feels thoroughly digital until it thrusts into the necessary third dimension of sexual congress , you get a winning hybrid of the cinematic and the very much imagine o'brien , who was never ambivalent about what happened to his baby , took some persuading to go along with this . and i further imagine the board of trustees at a theater with an audience dominated by teachers and erudite souls of a certain age had some pause . but `` rocky horror '' really is kind of a triumph , in its ridiculous way , in that it feels like a re-creation of a lost property with a score which is , to my mind , and i know some differ , very much the equal of , say , `` little shop of horrors . '' ",
        "and , palpably , it 's a hit , with the younger audiences all theaters covet arriving in droves from toronto and beyond , entirely ready to of this would work without bravura vocals and charm from dan chameroy as the sweet transvestite from transsexual wherever and , notably , from jennifer rider-shaw , who gives janet a power in delicious contrast to her usual demure persona . add in a very muscular and funny rocky and a frenetic columbia and the eye hardly knows where to is far better than many broadway directors at finding a legit rock sensibility , as distinct from a fussier theatrical one , which she achieves through attitude , pacing , volume , pyrotechnics of song , and , most significantly , a raucous sensibility . ",
        "many elements of `` rocky horror '' affront current sensibilities -- for one thing , frank n. furter exchanges in plenty of consent-free manipulation of identity . this show can only work now if everyone feels safe and the time-warped world nonthreatening , which feore somehow achieves while also maintaining enough edginess that you feel at least a whiff of fear for human sexuality when frank 's idealized sex doll flexes his not so sweet after all . and , now , not so far from reality . ` the music man ` closer , certainly , than `` the music man , '' which , improbably , feore takes on in the same repertory system always is fun for the audience , but there is something especially entertaining in watching the weirdos of `` rocky horror '' transform themselves into demure iowans , all failing to avoid trouble in river city despite their pretty attire . ",
        "it 's hard to get the force of the contrast in style and assumption out of your mind . i saw `` the music man '' the very same day . there was theatrical it 's also true that frank n. furter and harold hill have a lot more in common than first meets the eye . feore 's star , african-american actor daren a. herbert , is very much the disrupter of iowan complacency , just as frank goes after those heteronormative rules . ",
        "in fact , feore is both delivering the kind of `` music man '' that can attract 1,800 people or more to the festival theatre -- her own choreography is richly engaging and plenty showy and , on the surface , the show checks every box that any ontarian might wish -- while also emphasizing the radical ideas that lie at the core of meredith willson 's this production , hill mentors the young townsperson tommy djilas , who is also played by an african-american actor , devon michael brown of course , he turns the world of marian the librarian , played with longing and sadness by danielle wade , completely topsy-turvy .",
        "the other counterintuitive element to herbert 's very clever performance is that he turns a crucial theme of this musical -- that self-confidence is all it takes to succeed in america -- on its all know that it was never true and , when it matters the most , herbert and feore allow you to see inside harold and marian 's fears . what kind of life are they going to have in this town , you think , especially once folk stop obsessing over the band . it 's as if you 're watching `` the music man '' fused with `` get out . ",
        "`` you have to want to see this , of course . but if you do , it 's there . feore operates on many levels ; she 's overdue for broadway . "
