        "the bears ' exhibition opener thursday was a tease for anyone hoping to see anything resembling what matt nagy 's team will look like in the sept. . 9 season opener against the players understandably were held out of the 17-16 loss to the ravens in the hall of fame game in canton , ohio . the night , then , amounted to an early august exercise in filling cracks at the bottom of the are five observations from rewatching the nbc isaiah irving and kylie fitts were disruptive enough to generate optimism about the edge-rush 's be clear : neither was rushing against the caliber of blocker he would face in a regular-season game . ",
        "the ravens rested their top guys just as the bears did . but all irving and fitts could do was win the matchup in front of them , and there were some encouraging had one of the bears ' eight sacks , but the most impressive flash was irving 's strip-sack that was negated by his offside penalty . because he jumped into the neutral zone on robert griffin iii 's hard count and then tried to get back onside , irving was actually going away from the quarterback when the ball was undrafted rookie left tackle randin crecelius set with his hands low , which irving exploited by swatting downward . ",
        "that got him on the edge of the block , and irving did a terrific job to bend the corner and burst to , the penalty was a lapse of focus . but the one-on-one blocking win , albeit against relatively weak competition , is something to take forward as the bears try to figure out their outside linebacker was unblocked on his sack on third-and-goal from the 5 because the running back ran into the left tackle , setting a pick that irving used to get home without being touched . there 's not a lot to take away from that one from a technique positive play for irving : his stop of griffin on a zone-read option keeper at the start of the second quarter . ",
        "griffin had irving in a bit of space and tried a spin move , but irving was patient and closed down the space to stop griffin for a gain of 2 fitts ' sack , he beat tight end nick keizer , who 's listed sixth and last on the ravens depth chart . ok , that 's not regular-season-caliber competition , but the sixth-round draft pick won the block in front of him with superior hand placement . keizer did n't have his hands up , which allowed fitts to get his hands into the tight end 's chest and bull rush him back . ",
        "fitts quickly shed the block and finished the too was flagged for being offside on a play . but in terms of the pass rush , the first half offered something on which to receiver javon wims has an attractive combination of length , hands and seventh-round pick showed -- on the national stage against inferior competition -- what has been evident in spurts during training camp . he 's a friendly target because of his length , ball skills and competitiveness on contested catches , and he 's sneaky fast after the catch . wims ran a 40-yard dash at the scouting combine in february -- which is ok for a 6-foot-3 , 215-pounder -- and appears to play with effective football lined up at times thursday in the slot and on the outside . ",
        "his first catch was a 7-yard reception from the slot on which he freed himself from the linebacker with a hard step to the outside before breaking in . that was a sign of being route savvy , a focus of his practice work . he then caught the ball in traffic , one of several contested catches . being able to catch the ball over the middle is a valuable trait , one that kevin white , for example , is still working to wims ' 17-yard catch-and-run at the end of the third quarter , he was on the ground when quarterback tyler bray released the pass . ",
        "catching it while in the process of getting to his feet required great concentration , and wims showed off his burst by running for 13 24-yard reception on the next play on a back-shoulder jump ball was one of the highlights of the night . shades of alshon jeffery there . ok , let 's not get carried ' shortcoming in camp has been drops , and he had one on third-and-6 late in the fourth quarter with the bears driving to try to tie the game . the ball got on him quickly during an in-cutting route on which the defensive back was very handsy . ",
        "tough catch ? yes . one that would help wims make the team ? absolutely . to wims ' credit , he converted on fourth-and-6 on the next bears are expected to keep at least six receivers . allen robinson , taylor gabriel , anthony miller and white account for four of those spots . with special teams contributions needed from the group , pencil in josh bellamy for a course , the bears are n't stocked well enough to leave out any receiver who contributes to the passing game , so wims can carve out his place by being consistent . ",
        "let 's see if his performance thursday earned him an opportunity to play against better competition in upcoming officials must establish some consistency enforcing the helmet-contact be clear , some of the 15-yard penalties walt coleman 's crew called were for hitting defenseless receivers , although he did n't explain that clearly on every call . still , the new rule prohibiting contact initiated by the helmet was a factor , particularly in the first of the calls were obvious , but there were other times when a penalty was warranted and not called . for example , a ravens defender led with his helmet while running into bray on an incompletion on the bears ' last possession . ",
        "that was an obvious penalty , and not just under the new rule . it should 've been a flag for a head shot against the and game officials must use the preseason to closely evaluate how the rule is being enforced and strive for consistency . that 's going to be the most frustrating part of how this affects 's like a baseball umpire calling balls and strikes : hitters just want consistency so they know what 's what . the same applies to this rule . there needs to be a clear standard . the stakes are too high for there not to be . ",
        "those 15-yard penalties alter drives , which can directly affect the outcome . hopefully thursday night is just a starting coach matt nagy passed a minor game-management 's first time overseeing the entire operation did n't produce many telling moments . there were n't key replay or clock-management decisions , even though it was a one-possession game . one game-management decision did stand out : nagy 's choice to accept a 5-yard penalty against the ravens for ineligible man downfield with 19 seconds left in the first ravens had completed a pass to the bears 47 to set up fourth-and-1 . ",
        "if nagy had declined the penalty , the ravens would 've gone for it . the yardage was more important than the down , and nagy recognized 's worth noting the bears used their final timeout after both teams lined up to run the ensuing third-and-16 from the ravens 38 . after the game , nagy told reporters he called timeout so the bears could try to get the ball back , but the clock was n't running because of the penalty . that explanation needs its own the interception chase daniel intended for dion sims exemplifies the offense 's growing and sims obviously expected each other to do something different . ",
        "sims ran a short route underneath , turned to face daniel but then drifted toward the sideline -- away from nearby linebacker kamalei correa . daniel threw to where sims had stopped , and the linebacker caught noteworthy about the misunderstanding is that it occurred between a quarterback who is well-versed in nagy 's offense and the first-string y tight end . if a starter and knowledgeable backup quarterback are breaking down on a simple pass , it 's a good indication a lot of work remains for the offense .
