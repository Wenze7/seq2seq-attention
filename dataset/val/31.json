        "the chicago bears will play in the 2018 hall of fame game on thursday against the baltimore ravens , but what should fans be watching for ? the chicago bears will be a part of one of the most merciful days of the entire year . on thursday night , it 'll be the bears as one of the two teams taking the field for the 2018 hall of fame game . ahead of saturday 's enshrinement ceremony for the pro football hall of fame , the bears will head to canton , oh and take on the baltimore 'll be a special weekend for the chicago bears as a franchise , without a doubt . ",
        "not only will they be in the spotlight of playing in the first preseason contest of 2018 , but they 'll also have one of their favorite sons being inducted into the hall . legendary linebacker brian urlacher will receiver a bust in canton and deservedly it comes to the hall of fame game itself , however , it wo n't be about looking back at the history of the bears . rather , it 'll be about the first look about what this team has to offer in the 2018 season . with the arrival of head coach matt nagy and the second-year with quarterback mitchell trubisky at the helm , there are high hopes for this young team in chicago taking a big step , we might not see much of that on thursday night in the hall of fame game .
