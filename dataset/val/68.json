        "and very fast . instinctively , you will reach out for anything as you fall . sooner or later you will latch onto what is known as the `` black palm . '' it 's inevitable . this thin tree grows thorns the likes of which are not common around here . even with the gloves , you will occasionally impale fingers and hands on these thorns . no , you will not be able to stop what you 're doing just because there is a long thin pointy thing sticking out of both sides of your hand . the guys will point and laugh .

        "you will laugh too . it will be them in an hour . better than being eaten by the ants , or seeing the stagnant , murky water suddenly move around you while traversing through the chest-deep grossness of a swamp . jungles are dangerous places . traders might have felt like the markets were dangerous places as the closing bell rang last night . amazon closed at $ 1808 , down nearly 3 % on the day , or in dollar terms $ thank facebook for forcing the entire nasdaq composite into a tailspin in what was -- at least in certain spots -- a strong day for equity markets .

        "while old-school retailers might still look at amazon as a `` death star '' willing to spend just so it might take market share , that this is now a well-rounded corporation that has , over years , made the jump from cash burn to highly profitable , and on expanding margins across nearly all business lines . by the way , the pajama crowd has this name up more overnight than it was down during thursday 's regular session . it seem like just yesterday that i raised my price target for amzn to $ 1950 from $ 1850 , and i raised my panic point for this name from $ 1350 to $ 1540 .
