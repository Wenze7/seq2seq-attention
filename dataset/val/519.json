        "is a man on a mission . to have him tell it , he does n't just make music to construct unique beats or decontextualize unique samples . no , the nigerian-american producer makes music with the express desire to connect the black diaspora and bring them back to their motherland . `` i just want all of my friends to feel more comfortable with their african background , '' afolayan says . `` i want that dialogue between african-americans and africans about going back home to africa . `` music making is a new pursuit for afolayan . although he grew up attending church and playing the drums , he never considered making music to be a viable career choice .

",
        "`` this is it right here . we need to start having dialogue about going back home and building our communities , '' says afolayan . `` i 'm letting my music build a link . `` a self-taught musician , afolayan began building beats on his ipad , first starting with rudimentary software like garageband and transitioning to more advanced programs such as logic and protools . the learning curve took about a year , a small drop in the bucket of any given musician 's those earliest music experiments , afolayan has amassed a large body of work , largely kept to himself .

        "however , last month , the producer released his debut ep , `` every last african warrior . '' the six-track ep is an eclectic , sample-heavy blending of the afrobeat and hip-hop genres , creating a sound uniquely afolayan 's own . `` i let the sample take me where to go with my beat . i do n't think too much when i 'm making it . i just like to be in the groove , '' he listeners can catch the producer at one of his first big shows as part of `` summer jams , '' a series of programming curated by mpaact , an organization that aims to develop , nurture , and produce african-centered theater grounded in the traditions of african culture and its diaspora .

        "`` if you 're going to go to my show , you 're going to hear a lot of music you might not be familiar with , but it 's going to be translated it in a way you 'll understand , '' he says . afolayan would n't want it any other way . `` i want nigerians in chicago to know there is in chicago and he 's making hip-hop and nigerian music , '' afolayan says . `` music has always been a way to connect to people , and if i am able to do that , i can also use my music to paint a perfect picture .
