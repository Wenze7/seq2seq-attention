        "when she heard about the big latch on , jenny leflore knew she needed to get involved . the global event takes place at registered locations where women come together to breastfeed in unison and offer one another peer support to celebrate the beginning of breastfeeding awareness founder of local motherhood community mama fresh , leflore is planning one such gathering 9:30 sunday at build coffee in woodlawn . she calls the event a `` breastfeeding sit-in . '' `` it was so important to me this year because of all of the fire that really has gone on with women and breastfeeding , '' the 37-year-old bronzeville resident said . ",
        "`` in the news , with utah and idaho just making it legal in the last two weeks , and then locally , with the woman in chicago who was there to serve jury duty and being denied access to a lactation room . this was something where i felt like , ` you know what ? i have to be a part of it . ' `` in addition to seeking to normalize breastfeeding , the event fits within mama fresh 's mission to create a diverse community of motherhood , particularly for women on the south side . ",
        "leflore cited a 2013 centers for disease control and prevention report , explaining that `` black infants consistently had the lowest rates of breastfeeding initiation and duration . '' leflore sees lack of peer support as a major contributor to those problematic rates , but she 's working to change that . `` the statistics find that it is all because of the lack of community to support each other in breastfeeding . that 's why it 's important to me for you to see other black women there , breastfeeding their little ones , '' she year , leflore organized a similar event with the lactation team at university of chicago medicine . ",
        "however , she sees strategic value in holding this year 's event in a community business like build coffee . `` i felt that it was important to have it in a comfortable and relaxing and everyday environment , '' leflore said . `` because that truly normalizes it and takes away the stigma that it 's something clinical that should be done in privacy or in a hospital . `` bea malsky , build coffee 's bookshop and events manager , described the business as a kid-friendly shop that wants new parents to feel welcome , making a partnership with leflore 's event an excellent fit . ",
        "`` we 're very glad for the chance to support jenny in her work to make it safer , easier and more fun to be a mother in public , and to create spaces for young families to thrive , '' malsky loved build coffee 's mission as `` a place for radical collaboration and experimentation , '' and she felt strongly about hosting the sit-in within her own community . `` woodlawn and the neighborhoods around it -- kenwood , hyde park , bronzeville -- people can speak about it in a very monolithic way because it 's majority african-american , but when you look at the other demographics in terms of education , economics , marital status , there 's so much variety and culture right in this group of neighborhoods , '' leflore said . ",
        "`` and it 's so great that you can see longtime residents that have been here for generations and then residents who are choosing to move here . they might have lived in other parts of the city , and then they 're choosing to come to this area to raise their families . and that 's because of the cultural richness that we have in this area .
