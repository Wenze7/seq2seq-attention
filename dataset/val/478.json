        "the festivities are now well underway at the pro football hall of fame , a celebratory summer weekend as brian urlacher and six other members of the class of 2018 are honored for their contributions to the on the itinerary : the first of 65 nfl exhibition games to be played over the next four weeks . that formality came thursday night when the bears fell to the ravens 17-16 at tom benson hall of fame kickoff , there was urlacher again on the football field , being introduced and making his way down a high-five line of current bears players . ",
        "the eight-time pro bowl linebacker planned to stick around . but only for part of the first half as he then made his way to a nearby party in his enough . urlacher , after all , was always praised for his instincts , quickness and those dying for even a small taste of football , thursday night 's game probably was n't exactly what they craved , an exhibition game at a neutral site with very few notable players on either side game 's first play ? a perfectly appropriate dump-off from chase daniel to fullback michael quarterback to fullback . ",
        "checkdown . gain of , yes . the , sure , thursday marked the first game matt nagy has coached since joining the bears in january . but it was hardly a sneak preview of what 's to come in the months starters , nagy kept just about every potential starter on offense and defense confined to the bench . so there were no mitch trubisky darts to analyze or jordan howard runs to allen robinson or tarik cohen or trey burton or even kevin even a glimpse of promising rookie receiver anthony nagy : `` in my opinion , it does n't make sense . ",
        "it just does n't . we still have a quarter of a season left to play before we play week 1 . so it 's just a risk-reward deal . and it 's just too much of a risk for such little reward . `` furthermore , nagy is n't about to show off too much of his offensive ingenuity in the preseason anyway , keeping things simple with his play-calling . the real creativity , the true glimpses into the new coach 's aggressive attack wo n't be seen until patient . the wait 's big-picture takeaway for nagy ? ",
        "`` you get to see where your depth is , '' he said . `` you get to see where guys are at and what you need to work on from here . `` the bears trailed 10-7 at halftime on thursday . offensively , there was a well-executed 4-yard touchdown pass from daniel to burton and a 30-yard run by benny cunningham , the longest play of the first , deandre houston-carson delivered for the bears with an early interception of robert griffin iii . and if there was anything significant to be gleaned from the night , it 's that vic fangio 's group played fast and aggressive and may have enough quality depth to further stabilize a defense that finished in the top 10 in yards allowed last ravens used griffin and josh woodrum at quarterback before halftime , not exactly the aaron rodgers-matthew stafford-kirk cousins triple threat the bears will face in the nfc north this fall . ",
        "but it was still encouraging to see the second-unit defense applying consistent pressure with five sacks in the first half . the bears finished with eight sacks for the 10-yard tanner gentry touchdown catch with 2:44 left gave the bears an opportunity to steal a victory late . but tyler bray 's two-point conversion pass to daniel brown , there are bigger tests ahead as august unfolds . and while thursday 's game may have given general manager ryan pace a better idea of how his 53-man roster might shape up , every part of the night has to be viewed with proper perspective . ",
        "until the bears have multiple games with their starters in action , even a surface-level assessment of their progress is hall of fame celebration will continue through sunday . the biggest event , of course , is saturday night 's enshrinement ceremony , giving urlacher a chance to step on stage and formally thank those who helped him reach hall of fame and the current bears , however , will be back in bourbonnais , resuming practice saturday morning and gearing up for their second exhibition game next week in cincinnati . that contest should offer at least a glimpse of the starters .
