        "q : who is the idiot that invented metering lights ? m. r. pamidisan josea : idiot ? he 's dolf may , a legend in the traffic world and one of my favorite interviews . why are you so upset ? q : i think they make traffic flow worse . i remember last year when the metering lights on northbound highway 101 past the san jose airport were off and traffic moved smoothly . when they are on , traffic backs up almost half a mile : dolf was a traffic engineer in illinois when he set up the first ramp meter in 1963 on the eisenhower expressway in chicago . ",
        "a traffic cop stood at an on-ramp with a hand-held light he would switch to red as cars approached . dolf later became a professor at uc-berkeley and moved to the bay prove ramp meters work . a minnesota review in 2000 involved shutting off all 433 ramp meters in the minneapolis-st . paul area for eight weeks to test their effectiveness . when the meters were turned off freeway capacity decreased by 9 percent , travel times increased by 22 percent , freeway speeds dropped by 7 percent and crashes increased by a staggering 26 to home , upset drivers pressed local officials to pressure caltrans to speed up the meters on highway 85 and the 25-mile drive from south san jose to mountain view . ",
        "but travel time increased by 48 percent and drivers pleaded for the meters to be slowed lights have reduced travel time by 19 minutes on a 10-mile stretch of highway 101 in san mateo county . travel speeds on 101 between bernal road and capitol expressway moved at an average of 36 mph before metering , and 44 mph after . there are now nearly 560 active ramp meters in the bay area and the goal is 1,320 by to : jeff-the-bridge-man lacks imagination about the need of wind socks on the san mateo bridge . a wind sock indicates wind strength , obviously , and some drivers will be extra cautious in high wind , the same way that some drivers become more cautious in ruckstuhlcupertinoa : oh-oh , another one of my-go-to-guys is getting : i think jeff-the bridge-man missed the value of a windsock for wind speed on the san mateo bridge . ",
        "if you see the windsock indicates high wind , a cautious driver might be inclined to slow down , not fiddle with the radio or not grab his cell phone . maybe even keep both hands on the kenyonsan josea : i 'll pursue this with caltrans . just do n't call me an idiot . "
