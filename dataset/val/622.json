'' do n't worry : you have n't accidentally clicked on pre-digital trends , by mistake . this is part of a shakespearean sonnet created by deep learning artificial intelligence -- and , shockingly , it 's actually pretty good . the bot was created by researchers at ibm research australia . trained on around 26,000 real sonnets , it mimics the iambic pentameter and rhyming pattern of the poems most famously written by ol' bill shakespeare himself . ",
        "`` while the application itself may not seem directly relevant to real-world applications , the underlying machinery of our model shares the same core algorithm that drives other problems that require generation , '' jey han , one of the researchers on the project , told digital trends . `` translation , summarization , and chatbots . when we started the project , a research question that we wanted to address was , ` how do we build machines that can produce a coherent narrative that spans multiple sentences ? ' and we thought poetry is a good place to start . '' ",
        "we previously covered some pretty interesting attempts to mimic creativity using these have included everything from google 's deepdream image generation project to a bot-written script for tv comedy scrubs , which was then read by actor zach braff . while is currently in the process of munching up jobs in the real world , however , the researchers on this particular project think there 's still a way to go before top-tier poets are put out of business by machines . if , indeed , it ever happens . `` the conclusion in the paper is that we should focus more effort on ` content ' in future work : spend less time on rhyme and meter , and more time on emotion and readability , '' adam hammond , a university of toronto english professor , who lent his expertise to the project , told us . ",
        "`` i 'm excited to see what 's possible , but i 'm very skeptical . i think it 's quite easy to have a deep learning model spit out lines of verse in rhyming iambic pentameter . it 's much , much , much , much harder to train it to have an opinion , or a feeling , or a desire , or a story to tell .
