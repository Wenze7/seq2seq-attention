        "triple-digit temperatures and super-concentrated heat -- not heavy winds -- are spinning funnels of fire that have twice erupted in the dangerous carr fire , tormenting the city of redding in northern california as firefighters contend with a rare meteorological likened one thursday night to a tornado . another ominous fire cloud friday reached nearly five miles high , so tall it cast a shadow and caused wind gusts of 50 unusual weather phenomenon , called a `` fire vortex , '' is creating dangerously erratic conditions , complicating efforts to contain the steadily growing carr fire in shasta county , said daniel swain , a climate scientist at the university of california at los angeles . ",
        "`` this giant rotating cylinder on top of the fire , composed of smoke , pulls burning embers and smoldering debris thousands of feet into the atmosphere , '' he allows fire to jump over barriers , such as roads , rivers and bulldozed firebreaks , he said . `` it causes it to do crazy , very unpredictable things . `` what 's behind the phenomenon ? the redding fire is not driven by stiff winds , as witnessed in santa rosa , the oakland hills and other fatal california wildfires , he said . instead , the fire created its own heat source , aided by an afternoon sun that baked the ground with air temperatures to 113 super-hot smoke ascends , it creates a wicked updraft -- so strong it begins to rotate . ",
        "`` it rises , stretches and spins , like a ballerina , '' swain video captured by bystanders show an enormous tendril-like plume whirling near redding , spewing smoke and poisonous carbon monoxide gas into the `` fire whirls '' are small and brief spin-ups that occur almost continuously on the margins of major the carr fire fire-induced vortex was unusually deep and tall , according to scientists . `` full-on rotating convective column . scary as hell , '' tweeted neil lareau , assistant professor of atmospheric science at the university of nevada at was so powerful that three high-voltage transmission towers were melted and blown over , according to journalist damon arthur of the redding-based record searchlight newspaper . ",
        "he witnessed mature trees that escaped the flames -- but were uprooted and stripped of all leaves . `` the carr fire is unprecedented in that strong winds were not driving the fire , but rather the plume rotated and intensified creating its own weather . for a fire to burn into redding like that is very unique , '' said professor craig clements , director of the fire weather research lab at san jose state university . `` hot temperatures , dry air , and critical fuel conditions . the fire danger today is extreme for northern california . ",
        "`` last october 's catastrophic fire in santa rosa was ignited by downed power lines and fierce wind gusts . the 1991 oakland hills fire was driven by hot , dry diablo winds up to 65 mph , which ignited stands of eucalyptus and dead monterey pines . the december 2017 thomas fire in ventura and santa barbara counties was propelled by unusually strong and persistent santa ana winds , causing it to jump from ridge to redding , the winds were essentially dead calm , said swain . but temperatures reached the triple digits , peaking at 113 . ",
        "`` it really did create its own weather system over the city of redding , '' he columns of fast , rising hot air are often seen over the sierra in the summer , resulting in bubbly cumulus clouds . that 's because those mountain peaks act as a heat source , warming the local atmosphere . the heat causes little pieces of the atmosphere to rise , condensing and forming clouds -- even triggering rare , it is not unknown to firefighters . one of california 's most famed `` fire tornadoes '' occurred in 1926 , when lightning struck large oil tanks near san luis obispo . ",
        "thousands of whirls were formed , lofting one house into the air for 150 feet , killing two they are difficult to predict , said swain . `` california 's fire-fighting agencies are second to none , '' with strong connections to the meterologic community , he said . `` they were well aware of the potential for this to happen . '' `` in this instance , it all came together , '' he said , `` at the worst time and worst possible place . '' "
