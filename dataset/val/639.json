        "apple will experiment with more iphone colors again , a new report suggested . the rumored lcd iphone will apparently come in never-before-seen colorways such as flash yellow and bright orange . when the iphone 5c was released in 2013 , it was criticized for being too pricey and too lacking in cutting-edge features . even still , it introduced never-before-released colorways for the iphone line , albeit in a cheaper-looking plastic then , there have been no follow-ups and instead of going for a more experimental approach with colors , apple only released safe color variants such as rose gold , jet black , space grey , and other similarly muted colors . ",
        "needless to say , it is time to change things up a iphone colors , according to macotakaraa new report says the company will release new color variants for the lcd iphone that 's supposedly coming this year . ming chi-kuo , a trusted apple analyst , first gave this tidbit earlier this month and now , macotakara is corroborating that apple will indeed release the lcd iphone in new , macotakara 's report disputes what colors will be available . originally , kuo said that the lcd iphone will come in gold , grey , white , blue , red , and orange . ",
        "meanwhile , macotakara says it will come in black , white , gold , and most surprisingly , flash yellow , bright orange , electric blue , and taupe , which is supposed to be gray with a tinge of does not mention a red iphone variant like kuo did . however , it is possible apple will save that variant for a mid-year release as it did with the iphone 8 product of which prediction ends up being accurate , it is nice to see that apple is making more experimental color variants of the iphone again . it makes sense because the iphone 5c was apple 's lower-tier iphone and the variant supposedly will be the same iphonesapple is rumored to launch three new iphones this september , two of which are premium options with oled displays , and the other one being a low-cost alternative , which is the lcd variant in question . ",
        "it is not clear whether the other two options will also come in a variety of colorways , but that is not likely . apple might retain the iphone 's more muted colors for those options , seeing as they are the more expensive do you think is right -- macotakara or kuo ? which color of iphone would you prefer ? do you think apple should experiment with more diverse colorways going forward ? as always , if you have anything to share , feel free to sound them in the comments section below .
