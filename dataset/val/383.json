        "while the excitement of the trade deadline bypassed the white sox , they created a little of their own on the field , unfortunately the wrong anderson , the shortstop of the present and the future , was pulled from a 4-2 loss to the royals in the sixth inning tuesday night after prompting a visible display of anger from manager rick renteria . he failed to run out of the batter 's box on a low liner to third baseman rosell herrera and made an inning-ending out at first when umpire lance barksdale ruled herrera trapped the ball rather than caught called it an atypical `` lapse '' from anderson . ",
        "but he thought he had to react when anderson turned into a spectator at home plate . `` he got stuck at the plate , '' renteria said . `` he hit the line drive the call was not made as a catch . it was still alive . ... we tell these guys , do n't assume anything . just go until they ultimately make the call . we 'll let the opposing team make the review call . it did n't look very good to have him standing at the plate and having the ball going around the diamond . ",
        "`` this play was the most memorable moment on a night when james shields ' effort was spoiled by two-run home runs from the royals ' ryan o'hearn , who was making his big-league debut , and brett phillips , recently acquired from the brewers in the mike moustakas 2-0 , the white sox had runners on first and second with two outs in the sixth inning . they already had left eight runners on base when anderson came up to face danny drilled a shoetop-high liner at herrera , who reacted slowly to barksdale 's safe call . herrera threw to second base too late to force omar narvaez , who busted it to the bag , but anderson never even started down the line . ",
        "second baseman whit merrifield took a few steps toward first and lobbed the ball there for the final out . `` i never thought i should have because if i did i would have run , '' anderson said . `` i saw him throw to second and i saw it go to first . i thought caught it . i did n't see the umpire signal safe but i learn from it , keep on going . `` renteria could n't believe his eyes . he waved his arms , then slammed his hand down on a railing before heading up the dugout tunnel . ",
        "anderson was lifted from the clearly showed herrera had caught the ball , so the royals could have appealed if anderson had been safe at first . but it was a moot point because anderson posed like a statue throughout the entire said he was surprised renteria pulled him from the game . but renteria insisted it is the kind of play that a manager must police . `` i pulled welington castillo , i pulled avisail garcia , i pulled eveybody from spring training through the regular season , '' renteria said . `` there are certain plays in which you can talk to the guys and keep them in the game and go over it . ",
        "certainly this was n't done to embarrass timmy but we do expect we 're going to give it an effort on every play to the best of our ability . `` james shields pitched well but lost to duffy because he gave up a pair of two-run home runs . those accounted for the only runs off him over seven innings . matt davidson hit a two-run homer in the seventh but the sox could n't overcome leaving 13 runners on shields was n't traded before tuesday 's deadline for non-waiver trades , he 's a candidate to clear waivers and become trade eligible once again . ",
        "`` i only can control what i can control , '' shields said . `` but i 'm always focused . i thought my mechanics were really good . i had a few walks that cost me there today . but i 'm just focused on pitching for this squad right now and doing my part . `` phil rogers is a freelance reporter for the chicago tribune .
