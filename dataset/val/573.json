        "phoenix -- when giants executives brian sabean and bobby evans have analyzed their pieces and evaluated options , the front office duo has almost always devised aggressive strategies and often used maneuvers that led to endgame year , with a . 500 club and long playoff odds in front of them , sabean and evans sat down at the table before standing up to spectate . for the first time since 2013 , the giants did not execute a deadline trade and instead opted to see if their current roster has enough left in the tank to challenge for national league west will the next two months look like in san francisco ? ",
        "our giants beat writer , kerry crowley , answered readers ' are the giants going after in waivers ? crowley : it 's unclear whether the giants will look to buy or sell on the waiver wire in the month of august as the team 's performance over the next two-to-three weeks will likely dictate the direction the franchise the giants do look to add pieces , expect the front office to pursue starting pitchers , relievers or corner outfielders under team control for the next few seasons . sabean said the giants are n't looking at free agents-to-be to help the club and are instead monitoring the market for young starting name that makes sense is cincinnati 's matt harvey , who will assuredly be placed on waivers and could help a starting staff that 's been decimated by johnny cueto all but gone in 2019 , who do you see the giants bringing in to fill that role ? ",
        "crowley : if johnny cueto 's elbow injury does require tommy john surgery , the giants will be forced to consider adding at least one established starting pitcher this offseason . ",
        "with dereck rodr\u00edguez and andrew su\u00e1rez under team control for five more years , the giants will have the financial flexibility to look at veteran free agents like gio gonzalez and patrick , after watching older pitchers including matt cain , jake peavy , johnny cueto and jeff samardzija break down in recent years , the giants will be motivated to trade for young starters and may be forced to part with top position player prospects to fill the potential void left if cueto is out for all of next francisco should also look to re-sign derek holland , who is enjoying his best season in years under the guidance of pitching coach curt giants stood pat at the deadline .",
        "do you think that 's a sign brian sabean is testing the team ? crowley : the giants ' quiet deadline is due to a combination of factors , but sabean did tell reporters it 's imperative to continue evaluating the current roster entering another pivotal offseason for the front for sabean , evans and manager bruce bochy expire after the 2019 season and the front office needs to see what this current core is capable of over the final two months of the year before determining an offseason strategy . the giants have dealt with several devastating injuries , but that 's a peril of fielding a club loaded with brandon belt set to return shortly and joe panik ready to resume playing every day , sabean and evans are eager to see if a mostly healthy roster can play up to the expectations set in the offseason . ",
        "if the giants fall out of the race , the front office will be more compelled to shake up the team before there a chance joe panik will lose his job to alen hanson or chase d'arnaud ? has he peaked ? panik is hitting under . 240 for the second time in three seasons and is once again battling injuries that have kept him out of the lineup for a significant portion of the year . because he 's the only member of the team 's core who is still arbitration-eligible , he 'll also be viewed as an attractive asset to other clubs if the giants consider trading him this the giants do believe acquiring pitching help can be accomplished through an offseason trade , it would n't be a surprise to see panik 's name floated in discussions . ",
        "hanson is younger and more athletic than panik and d'arnaud , and he wo n't be a free agent until you see the front office shutting down some of these young arms in the next couple weeks ? the nationals did it with strasburg while in a playoff race . though the giants have n't given any indication they plan on limiting the workload of andrew su\u00e1rez and dereck rodr\u00edguez in the coming weeks , this will be a topic of conversation if the team falls out of \u00e1rez threw 155 innings in 2017 and has already logged 124 innings across two levels this year , while rodr\u00edguez is 30 innings shy of his career-high for a minor league season . ",
        "both pitchers look capable of handling increased workloads , but expect the giants to use off days to their advantage in august and september and allow for additional rest for both pitchers between more does pitching prospect tyler rogers have to do ? rogers was the giants ' 10th round pick in 2013 and is on his third season pitching for the triple-a sacramento river cats . he was named an all-star in each of the past two years and owns a era in 41 games this giants might be skeptical of how rogers ' arsenal will translate to the major leagues because he 's a submarine-style pitcher , but at this point , there 's absolutely no reason to hold rogers back in september . ",
        "if the giants do n't add rogers to the 40-man roster this offseason , he 'll be claimed in the rule 5 draft and they 'll have wasted a chance to see if he can you think the giants will re-sign madison bumgarner after his contract is up ? unless the giants reach an agreement to extend bumgarner this offseason , this question will loom over the franchise throughout the 2019 's difficult to envision bumgarner pitching in any other uniform , and the fan base 's love for bumgarner is something ceo larry baer understands it financially prudent for the giants to spend another $ 100-plus million on a pitcher with nearly 1,600 innings on his arm ? ",
        "probably not . but if there 's any player the giants will do it for , bumgarner is the obvious choice . my gut tells me bumgarner and buster posey will never wear another there a starting pitcher in double-a or triple-a that could be the next andrew su\u00e1rez ? right-hander shaun anderson was acquired in the eduardo n\u00fa\u00f1ez trade last july and was recently promoted to triple-a . like su\u00e1rez , the folks who rank prospects are n't obsessed with anderson , but he clearly has the potential to break into the giants rotation and help the club as soon as next the club needs another arm in september , the giants may even look at anderson this year . ",
        "however , the middle of 2019 appears like a realistic time for anderson to break into the big leagues . "
