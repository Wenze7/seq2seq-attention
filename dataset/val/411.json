        "there are no guarantees kris bryant will return to the cubs lineup on thursday , and manager joe maddon did n't rule out bryant making another trip to the 10-day disabled list because of recurring pain in his left shoulder . `` i ca n't tell you it 's impossible , '' maddon said wednesday after bryant , the 2016 national league mvp , missed his second straight start . `` i do n't know that . everything is in play right now . i just got to hear from him and the doctors . `` maddon stressed patience in assessing bryant 's injury , especially since he missed 16 games from june 22 to july 10 because of discomfort that he tried to play through for at least one month . ",
        "maddon said that bryant has n't received a cortisone shot yet . `` part of it is the pain tolerance , '' maddon said of bryant 's measuring stick for playing . `` you know what it 's like when something hurts . you 're working athletically and you get to that point where it grabs you , and you anticipate the grab and that can restrict you and lead to something else possibly . `` i just know he 's not comfortable with it . and i know he said one swing in the game bothered him , a ball hit to the right side . ",
        "that 's what i do know . i ca n't anticipate good or bad . `` since returning from his first dl stint , bryant was batting . 250 with two home runs and eight rbis . `` of course we want him back as soon as possible , '' maddon said . `` but i do n't know that this is something you can necessarily rush right now . let it rest . listen to the doctors and figure it out . try to avoid testing it until they tell you it 's ok to test it . `` tommy la stella started wednesday 's game at third base in place of bryant , and backup catcher victor caratini -- a former corner infielder -- worked at third with coach brian butterfield before the game . ",
        "david bote , who is currently at aaa iowa , made 11 starts at third for the cubs during his time with the major-league team . ian happ and javier baez have made seven starts each at other injury news , maddon said pitcher yu darvish will throw his second bullpen session friday in st. louis . darvish , recovering from right triceps tendinitis , threw 16 pitches off a mound tuesday for the first time since suffering recurring discomfort on june 28 . darvish has n't pitched in a game since may 20 .
