        "but analysts pressed apple tim cook for more detail on apple 's plans for life beyond the iphone , which makes up more than 60 % of apple 's total revenue . shares rose almost 6 % on wednesday to a new all-time closing high of $ , leaving the the tech giant just shy of the historic trillion-dollar market cap . on the company 's earnings call with analysts on tuesday afternoon , needham analyst laura martin asked tim cook about him how the company thinks about its latest offerings such as the apple watch , airpods and apple music subscriptions . ",
        "`` i love the expansion of new products . do they attract people to the ecosystem or does the person have to have an iphone first ? '' martin asked . driven in recent years by the iphone , apple 's ` walled garden ' ecosystem -- its closed world of devices , software , apps and content curated entirely by apple -- has been very successful in enticing users and keeping them in the fold . but in a world populated by home assistants , wearables and other connected devices , in addition to phones , investors are debating how the users of the future will wind up there . ",
        "cook responded on the call that non-iphone devices and products are a `` core part of the ecosystem , '' as seen in increasing revenue in apple 's wearables business . meanwhile , apple is touting growth in its services category -- which includes the app store , itunes , icloud and apple care -- which bullish analysts cite as evidence that apple is on the right track . apple reported that its service revenue increased 31 % to $ billion this quarter . in an interview with thestreet on thursday , martin explained how she interpreted cook 's response to her question . ",
        "`` the answer led me to believe that even if you 're drawn to the ecosystem through the watch , you 'll quickly integrate back into the phone , because the phone makes everything work , '' martin said . needham raised its price target to $ 220 from $ 210 on wednesday largely on the idea that a more diversified slate of apple products means more entry points into apple 's lucrative ecosystem . the firm estimates that apple 's ecosystem now includes 823 million unique users , with 90 % of those users owning an iphone and ios users staying in the ecosystem for 10 years on average . ",
        "still , some are looking to apple 's lagging performance in the red-hot home speaker category , currently dominated by amazon echo and google home , as a potential red flag . `` the gaping hole in their strategy right now is connected home ; they need to get homepod right or buy something else , '' said tom forte of da davidson . `` but what gives me encouragement there is that they poached someone from google to improve siri , and with a new ios and the privacy features , they did make siri incrementally better . '' ",
        "forte was referring to apple hiring former google ai chief john giannandrea to lead its voice-assistant technology , following criticism of siri 's progress relative to amazon 's alexa . added martin , `` there 's a war going on between microsoft , amazon and google in the home , while apple is sort of dabbling . their product roadmap has had tv on it ; now it 's had the homepod for six months . we 'll know how important it is to them by looking at their roadmap over the next two years .
