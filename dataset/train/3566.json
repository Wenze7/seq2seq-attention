        "the sheriff of st. thomas although this story contains things from the world in which we live , it should be read as a work of fiction . all characters are fictional and not based on any actual living person . the events that take place in this story are entirely the product of my imagination . it was new year 's eve . a strange `` holiday . '' dalton had never been able to get into new year 's eve or new year 's day ; he thought it an artificial , manufactured `` holiday '' where someone had decided to make the final and first days of consecutive years special for some reason . ",
        "the dates were just another couple of days on the calendar to him , and they always had been . he did n't get all the partying , the watching the ball drop in times square , or all the nostalgia spent about the previous twelve months , most of which people were trying everything they could do to forget . look forward . no , this thing was just some weird excuse to get in one last day of partying and doing nothing before the calendar flipped over . he was n't complaining mind you ; he was a federal employee after all , and federal employees love their federal holidays . ",
        "so who was dalton to complain ? he had been doing this stuff long enough to know that you never looked the proverbial gift horse in the mouth ; when the powers that be gave you another day off to do what you really wanted to do , you took it . and leveraged it to the hilt . and that was precisely what he and his wife were doing at this very moment on the afternoon of 31 december 2017 . while almost everyone else they knew were back in conus freezing on the last day of the year , they were sitting in their rented condo up on the hill overlooking the northern shore of the island of st. thomas . ",
        "they had today and tomorrow off . the final week of the nfl season was playing out on the television , and as dalton watched pittsburgh go through the motions against cleveland , his wife watched an episode of the crown on her ipad . the sliding glass door out to their balcony was open , and a salty caribbean breeze languidly floated into their living room . it was getting close to that time when dalton would have to fire up the grill on the balcony and prepare a light dinner for the two of them . he delighted at the prospect . ",
        "when he actually sat back and gave it some deep thought , they were worlds different than most of the people they knew . sure , they had tried to be like others . a few years back , they had finally succumbed to all the pressure and gotten onto social media . they had gone all those years in its infancy without ever really thinking about it . and they had been pretty happy without it . dalton had years ago tuned out of news of any kind , seeing it change from being an objective , fact-based medium into a twisted , politically-driven narrative all clothed up as `` news . '' ",
        "this had infected every major news outlet , nbc , abc , cbs , fox , pbs , and all the venerable , old print media : the new york times , washington post , chicago tribune , and la times . dalton had initially found the notion of an online , personal website where a person posted his or her daily experiences to be , to say the least , a bit , weird . facebook , twitter , instagram . as the years rolled by , here each one of them came , with different capabilities and diverse audiences . ",
        "he watched it all develop with bemusement . he was n't so sure in his line of work that it would be a good idea for him to engage . but eventually , he gave in , to a point . but he never bought in . not totally anyway . no , what all these new social media platforms did could be distilled down into two basic things : they gave you a very clear picture into the lives and priorities of your `` friends , '' and they established how absolutely different your life and your priorities were in comparison . ",
        "dalton did n't know whether this was a good thing or not , and he did n't care . but he did gain valuable insight into the difference and how it had developed . it did n't mean anyone was right or wrong ; it just meant that dalton and his wife were different . they valued things others did not , and the others valued things the daltons did not . for instance , the mere fact that the daltons were here in st. thomas as opposed to some city in conus , that was an indicator . dalton had pursued the so-called american dream for a while , and he found it to be a myth . ",
        "everyone defined it as owning a home in a perfect neighborhood with perfect schools and a perfect church and perfect neighbors . dalton knew from experience it did n't exist . no city , no neighborhood , no school , no church , no neighbors , were perfect . every place had its own issues , and when you finally learned this fundamental precept , it freed you . it freed you to find the place where you could marginalize the negatives and maximize the positive aspects to a hilt ; dalton called it `` leveraging the good . '' ",
        "why were the daltons here ? at this place and at this time ? it was simple . change was a constant part of life ; dalton had learned that through experience . you might think you had arrived and found the perfect place , the perfect job , the perfect life . and invariably , after feeding you a steady series of fastballs right done the middle of the plate , life would suddenly throw you a wicked curve ball , or even worse , an exploding slider , and you would swing and miss it , badly . ",
        "life was about constant change , and you could do one of two things in response : you could stick your head in the sand in denial , acting like everything was and would always be perfect , or you could learn to adjust and react . you could learn to adjust to the changes that were inevitably going to come your way . and once you learned this fundamental truth and figured out that you had to adjust , you could actually learn to thrive in this environment of change , to capitalize on it . sometimes , change was obviated by necessity , and sometimes change was the result of opportunity . ",
        "and even still , sometimes change was hastened by a combination of both . on this occasion , dalton was in st. thomas due to an unforeseen opportunity that had come out of the blue . and he intended to make the absolute most of it . so as dalton sat in the condo with his wife on the bright and breezy 77-degree december 31st of 2017 , he wished he had something more `` philosophical '' to offer , but he did n't . life was a series of events ; in some of them , one had some measure of free will and control , and in in others , one had little -- if any -- ability to control anything . ",
        "it was a pretty stoic outlook , but a practical one . the key was to exercise one 's free will consistently on all occasions ; act appropriately , decisively , and ethically in those events within your control , and react similarly when you had no control . this was the essence of sanity and happiness in a world where change was as constant as the sun rising each morning in the eastern sky . it was surely easier said than done . but this was the goal one must strive to attain . dalton was right where he wanted to be . ",
        "adapting to something new . looking forward , not behind . outside his comfort zone . he would n't have it any other way . glen hines is the author of two books , document and cloudbreak , available at amazon . com and barnes and noble . his writing has appeared in sports illustrated , task & purpose , and the human development project .
