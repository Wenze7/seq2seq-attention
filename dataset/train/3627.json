        "cbs local -- a customer at an indiana hotel is claiming that she was charged $ 350 and threatened with a lawsuit in retaliation for the negative review that she posted online . katrina arthur and her husband stayed at the abbey inn & suites in march of 2016 and allege the room they stayed in was less than stellar . `` it was a nightmare , '' arthur said , via wtvr . `` the room was unkempt , and it looked like it had n't been cleaned since the last people stayed there . we checked the sheets and i found hairs and dirt . '' ",
        "the unsatisfied customer added that the abbey did not have any staff available to fix the issues and their calls to management went unanswered . `` i decided to call the number that goes to the front desk and it automatically went to a lawyer 's or something weird like that , '' she added . `` i actually had to clean the room myself . '' after their stay , arthur posted her review , which she says gave an honest account of the couple 's experience . the hotel quickly responded to the review by slapping the $ 350 fee on arthur 's debit card and sending her a letter promising to sue for the comments they claim , `` disparages us in any public manner . '' ",
        "`` that scared me to death . i feel like they were punishing me for being truthful and i do n't think that 's fair , '' arthur told reporters . the former guest added that she deleted her review out of fear the hotel would continue to threaten her . a detailed explanation of the inn 's hard-line stance against bad reviews had been posted on abbey-inn . com , but the website was reportedly taken down in november of 2016 . arthur took her complaint to the indiana attorney general 's office in hopes of getting back her $ 350 . ",
        "the state 's top law enforcement office not only filed a lawsuit against the abbey inn on dec. . 15 , but accuses the business of violating indiana 's deceptive consumer sales act . `` it is illegal , unethical for businesses to charge consumers or threaten legal action , '' national consumer watchdog jason brown said . `` currently only yelp warns consumers of this practice . consumers should continue to write truthful reviews . ''   "
