        "if you think all of philadelphia eagles faithful out there gave up hope for a super bowl title this season after pro bowl quarterback carson wentz went down early december with a torn acl , well , you better think again . the minute the second-year man out of north dakota state suffered the season-ending injury at the conclusion of week 14 's wild win over the l. a. rams , philly fans all over were obviously devastated by the horrific luck . but rather than get down , they all started simultaneously believing in nick foles and scheming to get wentz back asap . ",
        "is it possible to beat medical science and get their mvp-caliber quarterback on the field to finish what he started , they asked ? this 43-year-old die-hard eagles fan is willing to test the limits . eagles fan willing to sell his knee to carson wentz for super bowl tickets -- philly . com december 20 , 2017 . brian `` butch '' coll , father of two and owner of coll 's custom framing in conshohocken , pa , was willing to take one for the team and sacrifice his own limb in order to help wentz get back on the field and lead the team to its first-ever super bowl championship . ",
        "here is the full ad , which still is active as of this writing : if that 's not dedication and ultimate fandom , then we seriously do n't know what is . of course , butch has a stipulation involved -- an even exchange for super bowl lii tickets . seems fair right ? now if only we can convince wentz to actually go through with the procedure . so far , no responses to the proposition that we know of , but regardless , if no one from the eagles organization bites , have no fear , mr. coll : backup nick foles tossed four touchdown passes last week for the win . ",
        "he 's a capable signal-caller who has had playoff experience before . we 're pretty sure that no matter who is behind center , the team has plenty of weapons elsewhere to make a healthy run . do n't give up your knee if you do n't have to .   "
