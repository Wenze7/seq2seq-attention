        "thomas mcmullan 10 min 1 sec ago the apple watch series 3 came out in september 2017 , bringing cellular connectivity and a big red dot to apple 's wrist-bound timekeeper . the tech industry being what it is , we 're already looking ahead to the inevitable apple watch 4 -- likely to launch later this year . what can we expect from apple 's device when it gets here ? it 's early days , but rumours about the next apple watch have already begun to circulate , from a fresh design to the addition of new health sensors . ",
        "here 's what we 've gathered so far . apple watch 4 release datebar the first apple watch , recent iterations have tended to be revealed in september , at the same time the new iphone : apple watch : 24 april 2015 apple watch series 1/series 2 : 16 september 2016 apple watch series 3 : 22 september 2017 this pattern suggests we 'll see the next apple watch during the company 's autumn event . there are rumours that apple may launch an `` s '' model before a fully fledged apple watch series 4 . could a series 3s model launch during the summer at wwdc ? ",
        "perhaps , although there 's currently nothing in the way of strong evidence to support this . we 'd say an autumn launch is more likely . apple watch 4 designapple has kept its square-faced watch design consistent for the past three generations . the time is ripe for a design change , and we 'd put money on the apple watch 4 bringing a substantial aesthetic overhaul of the smartwatch . this may include a rounded watch face . one patent that surfaced last year , but was originally filed back in 2015 , shows a strap with an in-built battery , hooked to a circular timepiece . ",
        "it 's worth noting that apple is known to use generic images in its patents , so it does n't necessarily mean a round watch face is definitely on the cards . given the bounty of round android smartwatches , a circular option for the series 4 does seem a good idea . then again , perhaps the series 4 will push something altogether more experimental . another apple patent , unearthed by patently apple , shows a watch with an integrated , flexible display strap . bendable screens have been conceptualised by samsung , but the technology is still at an early stage . ",
        "it 's unlikely we 'll see a full , wraparound display in 2018 , but the patent could give a clue where apple is heading with its watch in the future . apple watch 4 features and specsthe series 2 brought gps to the apple watch package , while the series 3 brought cellular connectivity . the gradual shift of iphone capabilities onto your wrist could continue with an in-built camera in the series 4 . another patent spotted by patently apple appears to show an in-built selfie camera that could be used for future watch devices . while current apple watch models can remotely activate the camera on your iphone , they ca n't take pictures . ",
        "wrist-based selfies might be a bit of fun , but more useful would be the support of facetime for star trek-style video conversations on the move . the series 3 came with a comprehensive array of health-related sensors , but rumours suggest apple 's next wearable could raise the game for heart-rate monitoring . citing people `` familiar with the plan '' , a bloomberg report from december 2017 claims apple is developing an ekg heart monitor . according to the site , a prototype involves wearers squeezing the device between two fingers , with an imperceptible current passing across the person 's chest and tracking electrical signals in the heart . ",
        "whether or not this technology is ready and approved in time for the apple watch 4 remains to be seen . there are stringent testing requirements around medically approved devices , and apple with have to negotiate these before an in-built electrocardiogram can be brought to market . aside from a camera and new health sensors , the series 4 may include a bunch of iterative upgrades to things such as battery life and strength of cellular connectivity . a report by kgi securities predicts that the next apple watch will use the liquid crystal polymer circuit board tech currently used in the iphone x and iphone 8 . ",
        "this should make the wearable 's cellular antenna more stable for signal transmissions . the latest news and rumours about the apple watch series 4 .   "
