        "muzo - for decades , women like rosalba canon were banned from colombia 's emerald mines : men said they brought bad luck . canon and others like her have spent their lives as `` guaqueras , '' or fortune hunters , sifting stray gems from the shale gouged from rock and spewed out as waste from the mines in the lush mountains of northern colombia . `` the idea of getting an emerald brought me here and i 've stayed in the hope that the baby jesus will put one on my shovel , '' said the 63-year-old canon , her face chiseled by the sun . ",
        "canon arrived at the end of the 1970s in the andean town of muzo , known as the emerald capital of the world . the women who came here , some running from violent relationships , could not work in the tunnels alongside the men because of the macho prejudice that they brought bad luck . the country 's laws additionally prevented women from going down the mines . `` it has always been said in this region that the emeralds hid when they would enter , '' says maria luisa durance , a 39-year-old social worker at mining texas colombia , a leading company in the sector with 800 employees . ",
        "every day for more than three decades , canon has put on her rubber boots and joined dozens of other fortune hunters sifting through the mine waste in the fast-flowing las animas river . global fascination for emeralds dates back to pre-columbian civilizations . ships from the spanish conquest exported the precious stones as far away as persia , and in the 20th century the mountain was practically disfigured by explosives used to shift walls of rock . colombia now produces around two thirds of the world 's emeralds , most of them from the muzo area , around 150 kilometers north of the capital bogota . ",
        "- green fever - the modernized mines now produce less waste shale . but even so , men and women of all ages still cling to their shovels and sieves , seeking their fortune in the tons of mine tailings thrown into the river . `` this is a fever , '' admits canon , who has raised her three children with the proceeds from the job . from time to time , someone will strike it lucky , finding sparkling green stones in a wash of shale , but for the most part , the guaqueros -- men and women alike -- live in debt to local merchants . ",
        "`` they lend us money and when we find a stone , they take it , '' said blanca buitrago . `` for a long time now , i have n't found anything . '' but sometimes , buitrago says , she can find gems that will bring in between 65 and 165 dollars , `` no more . `` buitrago , a 52-year-old mother of five , arrived in muzo to seek her fortune after being forced out of her home by one of colombia 's dozens of armed groups in 2006 . in 2015 , women were finally allowed to enter the mines when the sexist law that prevented them was aned . ",
        "but like canon and many other guaqueras , buitrago is now too old to benefit from the law and get a formal job at the mines . however , saida canizales , 40 , was able to take advantage of the change and she is currently the only woman among 18 mtc security supervisors . `` obviously women joining the mines has been a challenge ... but i think i 've already taken it forward , '' says canizales , an expert in electronic surveillance , who tripled the 600-dollar salary she was getting in bogota . wearing a black helmet that barely covered her blonde braids , canizales headed deep into the mine to monitor gems being extracted from the rock . ",
        "later -- and 140 meters deeper -- a miner using a jackhammer broke through the rock face as canizales watched . a powdery white vein of calcite appeared , and a smudge of green dust -- a tell-tale sign of a gem . in the shifting beams of head torches , a geologist delicately chipped at the rock with his pick until a few emerald stones tumbled into his palm . he slipped the stones into a bag that canizales sealed , before making her way back up to the surface . - ` hardworking , honest , proud ' - luis miguel ayala said he is unfazed by having a woman supervisor in what until recently has exclusively been a man 's world . ",
        "`` anyone with the ability to use the tools can do this job , '' said the 23-year-old , wiping the sweat from his eyes as temperatures in the shaft reached 35 degrees celsius with 90 percent humidity . hiring women has been `` a very successful policy , '' mtc chairman charles burgess told afp . the women `` are very hardworking , honest and proud of their work . '' `` although obviously there are jobs that are not suitable for them because the work is sometimes very hard physically , '' said the 62-year old former us diplomat , who is married to a colombian . ",
        "but introducing women in the shafts was not easy . when the huge elevator that takes them down from the surface was operated for the first time by a woman , no miner would take the risk of going with her . an engineer finally stepped forward to set an example . two years later , some 15 women known as `` malacateras '' handle these machines , most of them single mothers or widows who left violent homes . adriana perez escaped a poverty ridden childhood to get here . the day she could go down the mine , she said `` my life changed . '' ",
