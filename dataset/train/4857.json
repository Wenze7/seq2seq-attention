        "as we enter the twilight zone of festive programming , it 's time to look back at the television year that was . yes , i know many of you will bemoan the lack of game of thrones , the walking dead or even a handmaid 's tale from this selection , but these are the 10 shows i that i enjoyed the most this year and found myself binge-watching . feel free to add your own picks in the comments section . read more : alias grace it might not have boasted chilling parallels to contemporary america or the compelling elisabeth moss , but there was plenty to love about this `` other '' margaret atwood adaptation to hit tv screens in 2017 . ",
        "adapted by sarah polley and directed by mary harron , it united sumptuous production values , a terrific , eclectic cast and a tantalising narrative to create binge-worthy viewing . the crown as series creator peter morgan has constantly displayed throughout his decade-and-a-half reign as the king of british royal and political dramas , he has an eye for detail , an ear for cadence and courtly language , a deep knowledge of protocol and a deft touch when it comes to pacing and creating characters and situations you want to spend time with . even if you did n't watch the critically acclaimed first series , you 'll easily find yourself immersed in the crown 's dramatically rich world . ",
        "curb your enthusiasm it seems like the show 's six-year hiatus was the smartest thing larry david ever did , for the popular noughties cringe comedy has returned pithy and more brilliant than ever . inspired casting , taut scripts and david 's complete lack of empathy and overabundance of social awkwardness combine to create car-crash television that it 's impossible to drag yourself away from . episodes i 'd given up on this trans-atlantic meta-comedy from the makers of frasier around about the end of season two , but it came back with a roar for its fifth and final outing . ",
        "the last set of seven scripts tied up all the loose ends nicely while delivering some terrific serves towards the relentless descent of reality shows and scripted comedies into grim and grimy territory . matt le blanc 's finest three-and-a-half hours . the good fight a spin-off to rival frasier and boston legal in its maintenance of quality , this the good wife follow-up deserves a far better fate here than being left up in the air . the fact that you can only watch it on air nz flights is a situation that seems utterly ridiculous given the calibre of the cast , the sharpness of the writing , the more-than-acceptable audience figures and the rave reviews it 's earned elsewhere . ",
        "modern life is goodish we 're latecomers to dave gorman 's brilliantly conceived musing on the perils of 21st century living , which has been running in the uk since 2013 . filmed in front of a live studio audience , it 's essentially a power-point presentation , but the deceptively simple premise hides some meticulously planned set-ups . highlights include the weekly `` found poem '' and a brilliant gag that involves pretending a dishwashing power ball is actually a smartie . stranger things as with the critically acclaimed and wildly popular first season , things 2 's combination of multiple storylines , whip-smart dialogue and warm nostalgia makes for compelling viewing . ",
        "there are certainly enough visual horrors to disturb your sleep and more than enough mystery to keep you glued to the action and convince anyone you 're sharing the viewing with to watch just `` one more '' before bedtime . taskmaster the funniest show on tv right now , this greg davies-hosted `` panel '' show is so good tvnz has screened all five series back-to-back . the show consists of expertly edited sequences of the five `` challengers '' performing their various tasks while a live studio audience watches on and davies pithily dismisses their `` pathetic efforts '' . ",
        "this is us bizarrely , it 's rumoured that we 're going to have to wait until the second quarter of 2018 before we can rejoin the heartwarming and wrenching lives of the pearson `` triplets '' . that 's a massive disappointment because the best american network drama in years had done a terrific job of drawing viewers into its tautly written web . at the centre of its success is a terrific ensemble cast which includes sterling k. brown , mandy moore , milo ventimiglia , chrissy metz and justin hartley . travel man tvnz has clearly only recently re-discovered what choice tv has known for some time -- richard ayoade is television gold . ",
        "building on the success of his gadget man series , the acerbic british comedian spends 48 hours in various locations with a different companion each time . the result is laugh-a-minute television and the best travel show on the box .   "
