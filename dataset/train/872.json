        "miami - no longer can the tale of one single human migration out of africa 60,000 years ago be considered an accurate history of humankind , said a review of scientific literature thursday . rather , multiple migrations out of africa , beginning 120,00 years ago , gave rise to the modern population of people , said the findings in the us journal science . advances in dna analysis and other fossil identification techniques , particularly regarding discoveries in asia , are helping to rewrite what we thought we knew about our origins . a `` plethora of new discoveries '' over the past decade has shown that modern humans , or homo sapiens , reached parts of the asian continent much earlier than previously thought , said the report . ",
        "homo sapien remains have been found at multiple sites in southern and central china , going back to between 70,000 and 120,000 years ago . other fossil discoveries show that modern humans reached southeast asia and australia prior to 60,000 years ago . `` the initial dispersals out of africa prior to 60,000 years ago were likely by small groups of foragers , and at least some of these early dispersals left low-level genetic traces in modern human populations , '' said michael petraglia , a researcher at the max planck institute for the science of human history in germany . ",
        "`` a later , major ` out of africa ' event most likely occurred around 60,000 years ago or thereafter , '' he said . recent research has confirmed that this mass migration 60,000 years ago `` contributed the bulk of the genetic make-up of present-day non-africans , '' said the report . these early voyagers interbred with other species , including neanderthals and denisovans and one currently unidentified population of pre-modern hominins , in many locations across eurasia . scientists estimate that among modern non-africans today , one to four percent of the dna comes from neanderthals and as much as five percent may be from denisovans . ",
        "`` it is now clear that modern humans , neanderthals , denisovans and perhaps other hominin groups likely overlapped in time and space in asia , and they certainly had many instances of interaction , '' said the study .   "
