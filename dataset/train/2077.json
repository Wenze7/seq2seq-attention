        "by ian ransommelbourne - nightmares loom for players dreaming of grand slam success if they have the misfortune of running into bespectacled bogeyman chung hyeon in coming years , according to his coach neville godwin . south korea 's new sensation became his country 's first grand slam semi-finalist on wednesday with a 6-4 7-6 6-3 defeat of tennys sandgren , proving a waking bad dream for the 97th-ranked american at the rod laver arena . like victims alexander zverev and novak djokovic before him , sandgren hammered away desperately at chung , only for the unseeded korean to keep returning with a zombie-like resolve . ",
        "unspoken of before the tournament among the lists of contenders , let alone the top young guns , chung will battle defending champion and 19-times grand slam winner roger federer in one of the more unlikely semi-final match-ups . `` obviously , he moves around the court incredibly well , and he 's incredibly flexible , '' godwin , who began working with the 58th-ranked chung last year , told reporters at melbourne park . `` everyone has their strengths , but for hyeon , i think it would be a nightmare to play against him because he basically out-djokovic-ed djokovic which is something that not that many people have been able to do . ",
        "`` chung 's blazing run through the melbourne park draw has appeared like a bolt from the blue on the surface , but the 21-year-old has shown flickerings of promise for a number of years . the parts have all clicked in a devastating way in melbourne over the past fortnight but the best is very much yet to come as he matures and enjoys more structure to his scheduling . `` we have changed some technical things on his serve , which he 's a lot more comfortable with now , '' said south african godwin , who ended his partnership with big-serving compatriot kevin anderson last year . ",
        "`` he has the option now of serving a high percentage or getting a free point or going for an ace ... and he 's feeling a lot better about that . `` it 's not quite the finished product yet , it 's still quite a work in progress but that 's definitely improved . `` i 'd also like to see him use his phenomenal speed to get up the court a little bit more and use it more in offense rather than only on defense . `` thinking of historyalthough nicknamed `` professor '' for his scholarly look , chung has shown humor on the court , working the crowd with a hand-flapping celebration like many a show-boating nba player . ",
        "he also showed himself endearingly human as he blew a 40-0 lead while serving for the match against sandgren , joining the long list of athletes blinded by visions of the trophy when closing in on victory . five match points came and went before he sealed the win with a thumping forehand to the corner that proved too hot for sandgren to handle . `` if i win one more point , i make history in korea , '' chung said of his wobble . `` i thinking about the ceremony . `` chung 's qualification for the semi-finals is certain to trigger a new round of front page headlines in south korea 's newspapers on thursday , a country which has hitherto had a very limited tennis history . ",
        "similar to asia 's first grand slam singles champion li na , who was overwhelmed by the attention the chinese woman 's 2011 french open triumph garnered back home , chung would need to brace for big change on the domestic front , said godwin . `` i do n't think that anyone is ever ready for that kind of thing , '' he said . `` it hits you much bigger than you can imagine . `` he maybe does n't feel the outside effects of it . he will feel it when he gets . it will be interesting to see but i think he 'll handle it fine . '' "
