        "as we enter the new year , the national labor relations board is under new leadership and has begun returning the nation to a more balanced labor policy . the nlrb is responsible for enforcing the national labor relations act , which governs labor management relations at unionized and non-unionized employers . the nlrb 's composition and leadership fluctuate based on presidential elections . under the new administration , the nlrb has returned to a more moderate approach to labor relations issues and begun reversing some pro-union rulings generated during the prior administration . recently , in december 2017 , the nlrb changed course on several issues important to employers , including : `` micro units '' under the prior administration , the nlrb made it easier to unionize small sub-sets of employees within a larger workforce . ",
        "created by the specialty healthcare and rehabilitation center of mobile decision , these small groups of employees , known as `` micro units , '' were allowed to unionize without concern regarding the other employees . on december 15 , 2017 , however , the new nlrb reverted to a more long standing precedent , known as the `` community of interest '' test , to decide whether a larger group of employees , based on their shared working conditions , should vote about unionization , rather than only a smaller sub-set . joint employmentmany workforces are comprised of people who work for different employers , such as a temporary employment agency . ",
        "a few years ago , the nlrb issued a controversial decision making it easier to combine these employees , who work for different employers , pursuant to the joint employment doctrine . under the browning-ferris industries ruling in 2015 , joint employment status could be established basically by showing that one employer had indirect or potential control over employees of another employer . late last month , however , the nlrb returned to a more traditional test for joint employment : whether one employer exercised actual and direct immediate control over the working conditions of the employees of another employer . ",
        "employers welcomed the return to the traditional test , which offers more certainty and less subjectivity . also , the ruling will likely help clarify whether franchisors are responsible for a franchisee 's employees under the joint employment doctrine . employee handbooksemployee handbooks convey important information about the workplace . over the past several years , the nlrb had scrutinized many standard handbook provisions using a very subjective standard and invalidated many policies as potentially `` chilling '' the exercise of nlra rights . last month , however , the nlrb reversed course and established a more predictable , less subjective test that focuses on two factors : `` the nature and extent of the potential impact on nlra rights , and legitimate justifications associated with the rule . '' ",
        "under the new analysis , it will be easier for employers to draft and enforce important personnel policies such as `` no camera '' and `` civility '' rules . the new nlrb 's recent rulings have begun returning to more moderate and less subjective rulings , benefiting employees and employers . similar changes are expected to continue this year .
