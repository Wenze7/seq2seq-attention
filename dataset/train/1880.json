        "having earned critical acclaim for her roles in pride and prejudice , pirates of the caribbean and atonement , keira knightley has a penchant for period movies . now , the british actress has revealed just why she prefers to go back in time on the big screen . the 32-year-old star told variety that she was not a fan of modern-day movie roles because they tended to include scenes of women being sexually assaulted as part of the storyline . `` i do n't really do films set in the modern-day because the female characters nearly always get raped , '' she said . ",
        "`` i always find something distasteful in the way women are portrayed , whereas i 've always found very inspiring characters offered to me in historical pieces . `` although disgusted with the way women are portrayed in contemporary films , knightley is hopeful that the narrative can change . she credits streaming giants such as netflix for turning the tide by continuing to introduce strong female characters in its dramas . `` there 's been some improvement , '' she said . `` i 'm suddenly being sent scripts with present-day women who are n't raped in the first five pages and are n't simply there to be the loving girlfriend or wife . ",
        "`` she also opened up about working with harvey weinstein whose hollywood empire came crashing down in october when he was hit with a slew of allegations of sexual harassment and assault by more than 30 women including rose mcgowan , cara delevingne , kate beckinsale and gwyneth paltrow . the claims cast a spotlight on hollywood 's seedy underbelly and opened the floodgates with more victims of sexual assault speaking out against the perpetrators . `` my experience with harvey weinstein was always very professional , '' knightley said . `` he was very good on the films we made . ",
        "i was aware of his reputation of being a bully . `` he was famous for phoning people in the middle of the night and screaming at them . he did n't do that to me , and he certainly never asked me for massages or anything like that . ''   "
