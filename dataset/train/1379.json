        "kitzbuehel , austria -- henrik kristoffersen of norway led a men 's world cup slalom after the opening run sunday , threatening marcel hirscher 's five-race winning streak . kristoffersen timed 55.87 seconds on the ganslern course to lead michael matt of austria by 0.10 , while hirscher was 1.05 behind in third . fourth-place daniel yule of switzerland had 1.29 to make up in the final run . `` it 's only one tenth ahead of michi , '' kristoffersen said . `` it was ok , a nice run . it 's turning a bit , pretty difficult , but it 's not a fast course . ",
        "you have to push . `` kristoffersen set a world cup record this season by getting podiums in all six slaloms without winning a race . he has been after his 15th career slalom victory since triumphing in schladming , austria , a year ago . continuing their slalom rivalry from past seasons into next month 's pyeongchang olympics , kristoffersen was runner-up to hirscher in five races this season , including three giant slaloms . on sunday , many racers struggled in the tough conditions after overnight snowfall . on a difficult course set by his coach jani hladnik , russia 's alexander khoroshilov straddled a gate and failed in his bid to improve his slalom ranking ahead of the olympics . ",
        "britain 's dave ryding , who finished runner-up to hirscher last year , trailed kristoffersen by 2.89 seconds in 25th . with a win on sunday , hirscher would match hermann maier 's austrian record of 54 world cup victories . only swedish standout ingemar stenmark won more races . a six straight win would leave the austrian still three victories short of the best mark of nine consecutive slalom wins , set by italian great alberto tomba in 1995 . leading the standings by 174 points over kristoffersen , hirscher was on course for an unprecedented seventh overall title .
