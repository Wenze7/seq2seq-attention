        "roberto osuna and marcus stroman are the only two blue jays that are set to go to arbitration , and the former 's case is an very interesting one . the blue jays were able to get most of their in house contract work done last week , settling with josh donaldson , kevin pillar , aaron sanchez , devon travis , and dominic leone prior to the arbitration deadline . two situations were left unresolved at this stage , with both marcus stroman and roberto osuna set to go to arbitration , assuming neither works out an extension with the blue jays before then . ",
        "for stroman , it 'll be his second straight year of heading to arbitration and once again the sides are n't that far apart . the pitcher won the case last year when he asked for 3.4 million compared to the club 's offer of 3.1 , and they 're roughly $ 400,000 apart this time , filing at 6.9 and 6.5 million respectively . the situation did n't appear to cause any friction last year , and the hope is that things will work out in a similar fashion this year as well . for osuna , it 'll be his first go around in arbitration , and he 's set to receive a big raise no matter what happens . ",
        "he earned just $ 552,400 last year in his third season in the league , and has filed for 5.8 million against the blue jays ' offer of 5.5 million . as i said , a five million dollar raise or more will be nothing to sneeze at either way , especially for a young man who wo n't turn 23 until february . more from jays journal blue jays : donaldson 's contract about more than 201813h ago blue jays : beware of the message inside arbitration1 d ago blue jays appear headed to arbitration with stroman and osuna1 d ago blue jays : jays journal podcast - `` winter 's wrath & spring 's inspiration `` 1 d ago blue jays avoid arbitration with pillar and leone2d ago some fans and writers would argue that the blue jays should n't be squabbling over $ 300,000 with their star players , and in some cases i would agree with that standpoint . ",
        "however , i look at osuna 's situation a little differently , and i think that 's the case for a few different reasons . first and foremost is the whole debate about how much money a team should invest in their bullpen , and more specifically their closer . baseball has enjoyed a shift in philosophy in recent years , with many organizations opting to load up in their bullpen , and investing heavily in shutting down the back half of a ball game . we 've watched super-bullpens get built in places like kansas city , new york , and more , and correspondingly the salaries have increased for valuable contributors . ",
        "whether the blue jays like it or not , osuna will only get more expensive as he continues through his arbitration years . however , if the blue jays want to hang on to osuna for several more years , the easiest way to justify that is to try and keep his salary as reasonable as possible . not every team is willing to pay a premium for a one inning pitcher , and the blue jays have n't been jumping at the chance to pay for bullpen help in recent years , opting instead to take flyers on guys like joe smith and j. p. howell . ",
        "there 's no doubt the blue jays are willing to pay 5.8 million for a pitcher as valuable as osuna now , but how are they going to feel about it when his salary climbs to 10 million ? how about 15 , or 20 million ? if that sounds ridiculous , check out this link from sportrac which lists the highest paid closer 's in baseball . topping the list is aroldis chapman of the yankees at 20 million in 2018 , followed closely by wade davis , who signed a new deal with the colorado rockies this offseason , and will early 16 million this season . ",
        "if osuna continues to grow and develop as he has over the first three years of his young career , he 'll be in line to become one of the highest earning reliever 's in the game at some point . however , that also brings me to a second point . despite the fact that he finished the 2017 with a very respectable 3.38 era , 39 saves , and an all-star appearance , it was a trying year for the mexican hurler . he was lights out for nearly the entire first half of the season with a 2.06 era , and then found himself struggling badly after the all-star break and posting a 4.97 era in 29 appearances . ",
        "temporary struggles happen with pitchers at times , especially ones that are barely old enough to buy beer in the united states , but when it comes to relievers it 's a little more concerning . do n't get me wrong , i have a ton of faith in osuna and i believe his future is bright , but if he flamed out in the next year or two , he would hardly be the first reliever to have that happen to him . it 's a volatile position , which is why some teams are reluctant to spend big on the area whether it 's viewed as having increased importance or not . ",
        "fortunately the gap between the player and organization 's salary figures is n't that far for now , but the 2018 season will go a long way in determining osuna 's contractual value going forward . unless something unforeseen happens , he 's set to be a tremendous bargain for the blue jays once again this year , even if figuring out the proper compensation is a little complicated . next : beware of the message in the arbitration process roberto osuna and marcus stroman are the only two blue jays that are set to go to arbitration , and the former 's case is an very interesting one .
