        "rival builders were picking over the carcass of builder carillion on monday after the struggling firm 's dramatic collapse into liquidation . the death of the company puts more than 40,000 jobs under threat , including 19,000 in the uk , as well as creating a major headache for the public sector because of all its contracts to build and maintain schools , hospitals , prisons and infrastructure . thousands of smaller firms owed money by the firm have also been put at risk by the failure . carillion has been on a knife-edge since a disastrous profit warning six months ago shocked the city with huge write-offs on major contracts as well as the soaring scale of its debts and a £ 600 million pension deficit . ",
        "but today the firm succumbed to the inevitable after banks pulled the plug , and the government refused to underwrite fresh loans to keep it afloat . shares were frozen at friday 's price of 14.2 p , valuing the firm at £ 61 million -- a contrast with £ 1 billion a year ago . industry sources said a clutch of rivals would be examining specific contracts rather than bidding for separate divisions of the failed empire . one major rival said : `` the rail business is well worth looking at so if network rail picked up the phone you 'd obviously have the conversation . ",
        "whether you would take the work on at the same price is a different kettle of fish . '' carillion carries out up to £ 200 million of work for the rail operator , including bridge replacements and track renewals . another major builder said carillion 's work with national grid -- designing and maintaining high-voltage power lines -- could also be attractive . chairman philip green said the liquidation , to be handled by pwc , was a `` very sad day for carillion , for our colleagues , suppliers and customers '' but a welter of small firms have more immediate fears over the knock-on effect . ",
        "the federation of small businesses ' national chairman mike cherry , said : `` it is vital that carillion 's small business suppliers are paid what they are owed , or some of those firms could themselves be put in jeopardy , putting even more jobs at risk . '' rudi klein , chief executive of the specialist engineering contractors ' group , warned that the collapse should be taken as a `` catalyst for change '' in how the government buys its construction projects .
