        "the asus lyra voice -- winner of the ces 2018 innovation award -- is a two-in-one mesh wi-fi system and voice assistant , according to a press release . it includes stereo speakers , a microphone , and integrated alexa voice control . users can work with alexa directly through the lyra voice , as they would with an echo device -- putting another nail in the coffin for microsoft 's cortana digital assistant , which has failed to gain much enterprise traction , as zdnet reported . lyra voice communicates with other connected lyra hubs to ensure there are no wi-fi dead zones in a house , and to more easily connect other smart home devices , the release noted .
