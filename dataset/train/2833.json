        "bass , berry & sims attorney chris lazarini discussed an adversary proceeding brought against a broker by a plaintiff seeking recovery of investment losses . after the plaintiff filed a finra arbitration , the broker filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy action . the arbitration stayed , the plaintiff responded by challenging the dischargeability of the broker 's alleged debt . denying the broker 's motion for judgment on the pleadings , the bankruptcy court ruled the broker/debtor could not automatically escape the potential debt because the court could decide the merits of plaintiff 's state securities law claims under 11 u. s.c. § 523 . ",
        "chris provided the analysis for securities litigation commentator . the full text of the analysis is below and used with permission from the publication . butler , in re : dorsch vs. butler , no . 17-22141 , adv. proc . no . 17-02169 a debtor may not escape a debt in bankruptcy if the debt arises from false pretenses , false representations or actual fraud ; or from fraud or defalcation in a fiduciary capacity , embezzlement or larceny ; or from violating a securities law resulting in a judgment , settlement or administrative order . in 2014 , plaintiff opened an account with butler as her broker and made a cash deposit . ",
        "butler told plaintiff he was developing a long-term investment strategy for selected clients and invested her funds in what plaintiff alleged to be aggressive , high-risk stocks . after the purchases had been made , butler asked plaintiff to sign a wealth management agreement . concerned about her investments , plaintiff refused and filed a complaint with the wisconsin department of financial institutions . after reviewing the matter , the department sent a letter to butler 's counsel `` requesting '' that butler and his firm refund all advisory fees charged and `` consider '' settling with plaintiff on her investment losses . ",
        "butler refunded the advisory fees , but an agreement could not be reached on the investment losses . plaintiff filed a finra arbitration , which was stayed when butler filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy action . plaintiff then filed this adversary proceeding to challenge the dischargeability of butler 's `` debt '' to her , attaching her finra statement of claim to her complaint . butler answered , with a counterclaim for declaratory judgment , and moved for judgment on the pleadings . the court examines whether the `` debt '' is non-dischargeable under 11 u. s.c. § 523 , § 523 or § 523 . ",
        "first , plaintiff failed to state a claim for false pretenses , false representation or fraud under § 523 . the only representation butler was alleged to have made is that he was developing a long-term investment strategy . on the face of the pleadings , the court finds this statement was not false or made with reckless disregard for the truth or with the intent to deceive plaintiff . next , although the court finds butler was a fiduciary under § 523 , the defalcation standard is not met because butler 's investment in publicly traded securities was neither an intentional wrong nor criminally reckless . ",
        "finally , turning to § 523 , the court finds plaintiff stated a claim for violation of the state securities laws , but finds the department 's letter requesting that butler consider a settlement with plaintiff insufficient to meet the judgment , settlement agreement or order requirement . however , because § 523 allows for the judgment or order to be entered in a federal or state judicial proceeding , including a bankruptcy proceeding , after the chapter 7 petition has been filed , the court denies butler 's motion for judgment on the pleadings , allowing plaintiff to move forward with her adversary claim . ",
        "before getting to the merits of butler 's motion , which requires it to accept as true all well-pleaded allegations in plaintiff 's `` pleadings , '' the court questions whether it should consider the allegations in plaintiff 's finra statement of claim , which she attached to her complaint . the court says it is a `` debatable '' issue , but because butler addressed the finra claims in his pleadings , the court `` assumes '' the allegations were appropriately incorporated into the complaint .
