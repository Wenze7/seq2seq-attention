        "my son needed new shoes . he did n't want new shoes . he liked his old ones , but they were too small . miracle league had a bowling day , and i decided we would bowl for an hour and then shoe shop . children with autism need to know what is happening and what comes next . for 2 days , i told him the plans ... over and over ... he was well advised . bowling was awesome ! we made new friends , and my son even made a strike ! the game ended , and i , again , told my son the plans . ",
        "no problem . he was fine . we headed to the mall . we always go to the same shoe store . he is accustomed to the environment . it is quiet and well suited to children who overstimulate easily . i knew i was in for trouble when he resisted taking off his old shoes to be measured . the measurements spoke what i knew to be true . i showed him all of his options , and he said , `` no ! '' and ran to pick up his old shoes . `` dis ! dis ! '' ",
        "which means `` this this ! '' he held up the old shoes . he pointed to the dirt on the bottoms . he liked that dirt . it told the story of the places he had been . while taking off my son 's shoes , i had to get on my knees . it was a perfect time to pray . god was busy elsewhere . my boy wanted nothing to do with new shoes . the clerk and i tried every trick in the book . even a couple of customers chimed in . nope . `` dis ! ",
        "dis ! '' `` this child will not out stubborn me ! ! '' my thoughts were pure stupidity . we were going to another store . `` ooo ! mama ! it so high ! '' he said , peering over the rail to the floor below . between our current position and the other shoe store was a video game of thrilling explosive fire geysers , loud trombones , and circus rides . at least , this is what i imagine it must have been for him . by the time we weaved our drunken over-stimulated selves into the shoe store , it was all out spazorama . ",
        "he ran the isles . i chased him . brought him back to me . i tried to ask the shoe clerk where the little boy section was , and she ignored me . maybe it was my own crazed look that shook her from her desire to neglect , but , she did n't the second time . the shoes were in rows up over my head . `` no ! no ! no ! dis ! dis ! '' god ... seriously ? i could use some help here . he tore through that store like a tornado on cocaine . ",
        "as we were walking out , the workers gave me a look . oh , no you do n't . i saw what those grown women did to the sale isle . this kid knocked over a couple of boxes . get over yourself . some folks looked at me in judgement , and others in sympathy . i 'll have none of either . walk a mile in my shoes , and then we will talk . and for you others , i 'll have you know this is the best kid in the world . i do n't need your sympathy . ",
        "he is having a moment . i made a mistake . life happens . he is still fantastic . i thought better of visiting another store . he won the stubborn contest . i lost at parenting . autism , as i try to explain to others , is the world turned up to 11 . the `` go to '' reaction for my kid is all out happy/crazed . i know this . he felt remorseful . well , he felt sad he would n't get a `` surprise . '' even though i screwed up , i will not reward bad behavior . ",
        "no need in adding more poor parenting to the stew . it is difficult raising a child . in this day and age , parent shaming is all the rage . listen carefully , to these words : mind your own business . people screw up . parents are people . we do our best . it 's all we can do . my son still has his old shoes . i have post-tramatic stress . his teacher will be told of the dilemma . between all of the adults in his life , maybe we can talk this kid into new shoes . ",
        "if not , i 'll be cutting a hole for his toes until we can . visit for more about my new children 's book , `` bad sheep '' ! thanks for reading ! they are too small .   "
