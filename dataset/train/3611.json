        "sending and viewing snaps is n't just for snapchat anymore . no , we 're not talking about jumping ship to instagram stories . on tuesday , snap introduced an un-snapchat-like move that allows users to send links of snapchat stories for viewing outside of the snapchat app . this change means anyone -- not just snapchat users -- can see snaps from celebrities , media partners , and some everyday users via desktop and mobile thanks to a new web player . so , yeah , forget about snapchat being just for the kids on snapchat . anyone can see what 's happening on snapchat , at least from publicly shared snaps . ",
        "the move opens up snapchat in a way that 's similar to twitter introducing embedded tweets in 2011 and facebook with embedded posts in 2013 . media companies , for example , could use embeddable stories to share snapchat 's exclusive footage from breaking news events , which is one of snap 's big bets . the links do disappear after 30 days , however . the change breaks from the exclusivity/fomo nature of snapchat , but as snapchat undergoes slowing growth and faces the wrath of the public market , these product shifts seem necessary to grow the audience . ",
        "snap ceo evan spiegel listed content , along with user growth and augmented reality , as his new priorities for 2018 . here 's how the new feature works : . snapchat users can create links to stories by holding down on the `` tile '' on the discover page . then , they can copy that link and share it over text , email , or to another social network like facebook or twitter , for example . if users share the link to facebook , it shows up similarly to a youtube link , meaning it does n't auto-play . ",
        "for twitter , links to snapchat stories can play within a tweet . the new link tool applies to official stories , our stories , and search stories . it does not include publisher stories or shows , for now . while most content on snapchat lasts for 24 hours , these links will be available for longer and will maintain all of the individual snaps unless a snapchat user or curator chooses to delete them . official stories are only available for 24 hours . our stories and search stories are available for 30 days . for users , one benefit of viewing stories through the snapchat player : no ads . ",
        "for publishers , they now have the ability to direct viewers to their own websites instead of just snapchat for the once-platform-exclusive content . snapchat experimented with a web player during the 2016 oscars with an our story that featured snaps from the red carpet and audience shots . snapchat 's web playerimage : snap inc. . the update is only available to users who also have snapchat 's redesign . the redesign , announced in october , is live in canada , australia , the u. k. , and has been beta tested worldwide . all snapchat users are expected to have it over the next few weeks , according to a snap spokesperson . ",
        "as facebook continues to copy snapchat 's features , snap is doubling down on the uniqueness of its content and hiring more people to promote it . last month , snap hired rahul chopra , former ceo of storyful , an agency that sources and verifies content on the web . last week , snapchat 's recently promoted head of platform content mike su emailed snapchat 's media partners about its first-ever publisher summit , digiday reported . that `` charm offensive , '' as digiday described , is coming with some hurdles . snap recently laid off about two dozen employees , mostly in the content division , but the team is re-staffing . ",
        "the layoffs are in part because of snap 's decision to grow its news team out of the company 's headquarters in venice , california . meanwhile , facebook is pushing further away from news in an effort to inspire more people to post and communicate .   "
