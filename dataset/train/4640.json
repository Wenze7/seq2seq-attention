        "i 'm half dazed , all these medications running through my veins makes that perfect sleep cocktail . it 's boring in here , it feels like an isolation from life . i 'm hoping writing can keep me company for the moments everybody leaves me in the hands of the very nurses i 've been criticizing for the past few months _ now i feel i should have given them hell instead of trying to talk sense into their heads ; here i lie , a victim to their ignorance . i end up giving myself all my medications , else they 'll never be served on time or never served . ",
        "they say i have a pneumonia ; but that might not be the worse . i 've been taking care of tuberculosis patients for weeks without good enough protection . ok i lied about the last line , guess i 'm trying to be modest , actually without any protection , because the hospital does n't provide any . tried to get the recommended mask myself in town but did n't find any . tried to the best of my knowledge to reduce my risk of catching the disease and i 'm hoping i did n't . not like we do n't know better , but somebody still has to take care of these poor patients right ? ",
        "i do n't and wo n't regret it whatever that gene xpert report shows tomorrow , i guess this is the life i chose . but i 'll hate going on those medications , a choice i would n't have anyway . a minute , let me set up my next infusion . where was i. nagging about my nurses i guess . just to close that chapter can i just say these are the worst nurses i 've ever encountered my entire life . ok , now chapter closed . my mouth taste bitter , depriving me from enjoying the many gifts coming my way , even apples taste like paracetamol now . ",
        "a nurse just walked in 2 hours after my medication was due , now asking me questions . sometimes i wish i can raise my voice at some people . maybe i should n't have opposed when my family wanted to fly me back home for care yesterday . but what kind of world will i be living my patients in when i have to run away because i have a pneumonia . i believe i 'm in good hands , these guys i 'm proud to call my colleagues work the hardest ; they go through hell and back to save lives on the daily . ",
        "they might not have it all , but i know they 'll give away their last breath to give me a chance to live and for that i 'm good . ok i 'm getting drowsy again . i guess that 's goodbye till my alarm sounds for my next dose . i know this piece might make no sense , but just felt if kanye could rap through the wire , i can write through the pain .
