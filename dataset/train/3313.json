        "this time last year millions of angry and impassioned women across the country were preparing to march -- in washington , d. c. and beyond -- for women 's rights and in protest of the newly inaugurated president donald trump . others were declining to participate after the march refocused itself to include an array of issues experienced specifically by women of color . a selection of white women , it turned out , were feeling indicted by this and were considering staying home . as jennifer willis , a 50-year-old from south carolina , opined to the new york times last january , `` this is a women 's march . ",
        "we 're supposed to be allies in equal pay , marriage , adoption . why is it now about , ` white women do n't understand black women ' ? '' the obvious answer to her question is that white women do n't understand black women 's issues , and frequently do n't seem to care about the inherent differences between their issues and ours . throughout the history of feminism , we have continually focused the movement on our equal pay , our marriages , and our reproductive rights -- only demanding alliances when it suits us and failing to show up and fight when it does not . ",
        "the obvious answer to her question is that white women do n't understand black women 's issues . of course , the march , even with its carefully crafted diverse leadership , was still flawed -- not because it was intersectional , but because it was n't intersectional enough , leaving many , particularly women of color , feeling rightfully suspicious of what this showing of solidarity could mean for them . as my former colleague kara brown wrote on jezebel after attending the march in los angeles : i do n't trust most of the women 's march participants to show up again . ",
        "i do n't trust the resolve of their concern . i do n't trust that all voted for hillary clinton or recognized the unprecedented threat of donald trump . i do n't trust that they understood this was an election to do everything in our power to keep him out of the white house -- too important to throw a vote away on jill stein or write in your mother 's name on the ballot . what i do trust , however , are bigots . i trust bigots to remain bigots . i trust them to continue sending me gloating , racist emails and harass john legend and shoot black people for as long as they continue to get away with it . ",
        "i trust them because there 's evidence . history is riddled with proof . their hatred has always persevered . in the months following the election and the march itself , white women faced greater public scrutiny as oppressors than ever before . sure , we could still comfort ourselves with the reminder that we 're not as bad as white men , but still , it was becoming consistently harder to lie to ourselves about the myriad of ways that we have profited from and advanced white supremacy . it 's possible to fight for myself while recognizing my own privilege in our nightmarish white supremacist culture . ",
        "but it 's hard to be introspective and admit that you 've had a hand in another 's oppression , to face the terrifying notion of change and the relinquishing of social power , when instead you can hide behind your own victimhood . self-pity can serve as a means of absolution , a balm that convinces us that , because we too are victims of a white supremacist patriarchy , we could n't possibly be oppressors . it is true , of course , that women of all races and social classes have been subjugated in some ways , but no one more than white women have been weaponized as a tool for racists . ",
        "the promise to `` protect our women '' -- weak and fair -- has existed as an excuse to carry out violence against people of color long before and long after 14-year-old emmett till was murdered in money , mississippi , in 1955 . still there are white women who deny our hand in any of this , who believe that somehow -- if we were ever to blame to begin with -- these crimes were expunged by our own misfortune and then again by the sisterhood of feminism . as if eugenics never happened , and hate crimes were no longer committed on our behalf . ",
        "self-pity can serve as a means of absolution . but why stir the pot now , a year after the march ? well , because weinstein happened and once again white women have reclaimed our victimized narrative , while women of color have been shoved to the background . white feminist celebrities are eager to rally around each other , wear all black to the golden globes , and say , `` time 's up ! '' but they 're not so willing to examine the ways they 've enabled this system to continue to exist . few seem to recognize that while gwyneth paltrow was exceedingly brave to come forward against harvey weinstein , a black actress like lupita nyong ` o 's account will come with twice the risk and half as much credit . ",
        "in fact , when biracial actress aurora perrineau came forward to accuse former girls writer murray miller of sexual assault , lena dunham -- one of the most prominent voices of white feminism in the entertainment industry -- saw fit to speak out against perrineau , accusing her of making a false accusation . to be a white victim of misogyny is still a deeply painful experience that i personally explore and struggle against every single day . also worth taking into account is that `` whiteness '' covers a swath of cultures and to deny bigotry against white jewish women , queer women , or women with disabilities would be both harmful and neglectful . ",
        "but i also try to remind myself that it 's possible to fight for myself while recognizing my own privilege in our nightmarish white supremacist culture . suffering is n't a competition , but it is a hierarchy where some people 's pain is continuously prioritized over others , even in cases where women are trying to support each other . suffering is n't a competition , but it is a hierarchy where some people 's pain is continuously prioritized over others this weekend , many will again take to the streets to mark the one year anniversary of the women 's march on washington . ",
        "worth considering as we prepare our signs and put on our pussy hats is what exactly we 've accomplished in the past 365 days . quite a lot , actually , when you consider the #metoo movement and displays of courage that 's arisen from it . but still , as much as that merits pride , we 're leaving too many women behind in favor of self congratulations and the strange comfort of our own victimhood . perhaps we know how to rage and push back because the version of feminism on clearest display at this moment has given us the language and tools to do so . ",
        "of course , no one wants to be a victim in theory , but even among liberal white women , i often observe that they are much more confident when it comes to being stepped on than they are at realizing they 're stepping on someone else .   "
