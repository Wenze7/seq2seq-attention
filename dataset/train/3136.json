        "cuphead took the gaming world by storm this year , and for good reason . the challenging platformer is a love letter to old school animation , with a fun soundtrack to boot . an homage to steamboat willy-era cartoons , the game is nonetheless made for modern-day consoles , but curious players have found ways to bring it to life on not-so-modern screens . the most recent successful attempt was posted today on reddit , and while several other cuphead fans have tried on other `` vintage '' screens , this classic 50 's tv takes the cake .

        "check out the full gameplay below : played on a restored 1953 muntz black and white tv , the game seems almost like a classic cartoon that you might watch on a saturday morning , though some parts of the screen get buried in the resolution . still , hearing those classic tunes come out of the antique and watching it in action is pretty exciting . posted by youtuber filmsphere and later shared again on reddit , this fun little `` mod '' is a great way to see how the game plays on something from the era it pays tribute to .

        "`` i used an hdmi to rca converter box and had the rca cables go into a vcr , '' they wrote in a comment on a reddit thread . `` i had bought a stand alone rca to coaxial cable converter , but the signal it put out was way too weak . the coax from the vcr then goes to a transformer that connects to where the rabbit ear antennas would go . `` this is n't the first time a cuphead fan has tried playing the game on an old tv . back in october , another fan tried the game out on a black-and-white crt tv using their xbox one .
