        "warsaw banks on `` dialogue '' to solve its row with the eu over recent reforms denounced by brussels as violating the rule of law , poland 's new foreign minister jacek czaputowicz said on monday . the european commission last month launched unprecedented judiciary proceedings against the polish changes , which brussels says place courts under the control of the right-wing government and threaten democracy . but warsaw insists the reforms are needed to overhaul a system still haunted by the communist era . `` we will rely on dialogue for solving this issue , '' czaputowicz said in the bulgarian capital sofia during his first official visit abroad since being appointed last week . ",
        "`` i would like to underline that we expect the intervention of the european court , which is the institution that , according to eu law , is responsible for such issues , '' he added . czaputowicz 's trip to bulgaria -- the new holder of the bloc 's six-month rotating presidency -- comes following a major government reshuffle seen as a clear signal that warsaw wants to change the tone of its discussion with the eu . bulgaria , itself under eu monitoring for deficiencies in its judiciary and organised crime , is quite supportive of poland in the row with the commission . ",
        "bulgaria sees little action against poland any time soonmember states may not reach a stage where they could take a vote on sanctions against poland during bulgaria 's six month eu presidency , bulgarian prime minister boyko borissov said on thursday , explaining he would prefer to resolve the crisis through dialogue and avoid sanctions altogether . never before used against an eu member state , the so-called article 7 proceedings can eventually lead to the `` nuclear option '' of the suspension of a country 's voting rights within the bloc . this , however , is unlikely to happen as poland 's ally hungary has vowed to veto the measure . ",
        "the eu gave warsaw three months to remedy the situation , saying it could withdraw the measures if it did . on 27 february , member states will hold their first ministerial meeting with poland since the eu triggered the proceedings last month . `` bulgaria as eu council president will make every effort to continue the dialogue according to the plan that you mapped out -- to present your stance and try to bring together the positions in order to find a solution to this really not very pleasant situation , '' bulgarian foreign minister ekaterina zaharieva said after talks with czaputowicz . ",
        "czaputowicz will travel to germany later this week and has also asked for a meeting with eu vice-president frans timmermans . timmermans said on monday he expected to `` present the commission 's case to the council '' during next month 's meeting . `` poland will also present its case i suppose , '' he told journalists in brussels , with the council then set to discuss the next step .
