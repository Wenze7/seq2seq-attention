        "milwaukee - milwaukee-based startupscanalytics is helping businesses explore customer activity with floor sensors that track people 's movements . the company has developed paper-thin tiles , similar to a touch-screen , called a sole-sensor . the 2-foot by 2-foot sole = sensor panels are only 1/32 of an inch thick and can be snapped together and hid underneath a flexible floor covering to seamlessly measure insights on your location 's performance . for example , the sensors can read a customer 's unique foot compressions to track that person 's path to a digital display and how long the person stands in front of it before walking away . ",
        "not only can a store find out which displays draw the most customer attention , but they can use the data generated by the sensors to study what sells , know when to schedule staff for busy times , and what store layout is most effective . however , as u. s. news reports , the technology may be a bit expensive for small retailers . the cost of having the sensors ranges from $ 20 to $ 1,000 per month , depending on square footage and add-on applications to analyze data or interact with digital signs . but the software applications can give a business a lot of information , including real-time and historical reports covering entrances and exits , heat maps , customer engagement and more . ",
        "dashboard for sole-sensor technology . scanalytics inc. . scanalytics ceo joe scanlin says his sensors do n't collect personally identifying information so there are no concerns about privacy or surveillance involved . his sole-sensors are strictly for tracking customer engagement and numbers . milwaukee , wisconsin-based scanalytics was founded in 2012 by joe scanlin and matthew mccoy . the company focuses on the development of sensor-based analytics and engagement platforms for physical spaces . according to crunchbase , `` scanalytics records , stores , and analyzes where people walk , stop orient , how long they stay and how it all connects to conversions and floor layout/effectiveness . ",
        "they have developed a proprietary technology that gathers this data 100 percent passively and unobtrusively without cameras , rfid or the need for cell phones . bottom line ? this is a really neat idea simply because it is unobtrusive , and does not involve customer privacy . for retail stores , regardless of their size , who does n't want to know how heavy customer traffic is on certain days or even particular times of the day ?
