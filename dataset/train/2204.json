        "close to three-quarters of residents feel that a 170-hectare golf course in fanling is occupying too much land , while 56 per cent feel that the government should use the area for public housing , a survey has found . the poll was conducted by the democratic party between december and january this year by phone . a total of 1,076 responses were recorded . democratic party lawmaker andrew wan siu-kin said on sunday that the survey found an overwhelming 70 per cent of respondents felt that the hong kong golf club was using land resources excessively . wan pointed out that the size of the fanling golf course is equivalent to nine victoria parks . ",
        "on how respondents hoped the plot of land would be used , 56 per cent said it should be for public housing , 12 per cent for private residential use , 17 per cent for government or community facilities , and six per cent for other purposes . only nine per cent said the land should remain unchanged . the home affairs bureau is now reviewing some 67 private recreational leases involving 400 hectares of land across the city . the fanling golf course is leased to the hong kong golf club until august 2020 . the rent for 2016/17 was hk$ 2.4 million . ",
        "the survey also found that 79 per cent of respondents felt that the government should regulate the land use period for private recreational leases , such as those for golf courses . wan said that the home affairs bureau typically awards periods of 15 years or 21 years . `` the figures are clear , the government should take back the golf course for housing development , '' wan said . he also urged the government to quickly complete the review of the private recreational leases and explore the option of having a model of 10 years of fixed-term tenancy and 10 years of periodic tenancy . ",
        "the government-appointed task force on land supply would meet on saturday to discuss whether private recreational sites , including golf courses , should be considered for development to ease the city 's housing shortage . the meeting was postponed from last tuesday to give the government more time to prepare papers for the discussion .
