        "the commodity futures trading commission has released a backgrounder on the federal oversight of virtual currencies and its approach to regulating the virtual currency derivatives markets . because virtual currencies have been deemed a commodity , certain derivative and other transactions in virtual currencies may be subject to cftc oversight under the commodity exchange act . the cftc outlined its 5-pronged approach to the regulation of derivatives involving virtual currencies , which will focus on consumer education ; asserting legal authority ; market intelligence ; robust enforcement ; and government-wide coordination . additionally , the cftc provided further detail on the self-certification process for new derivatives products involving virtual currencies at a futures exchange , as well as an explanation of the `` heightened review '' it has undertaken for such filings , within the limits of the cftc 's ability to stay or block such a filing . ",
        "the cftc noted in particular certain standards it would expect to apply to virtual currency futures , including substantially higher margin requirements as compared to other products , reporting requirements and surveillance coordination . the cftc also noted it has limited authority to block or stop derivative trading on virtual currencies , and further argued that attempting to do so would have `` ensured that the virtual currency spot markets continue to operate without federal regulatory surveillance for fraud and manipulation . `` the cftc considered the impact of virtual currency derivatives on three particular constituencies : market participants and consumers ; the public interest generally ; and derivatives clearing organization clearing members . ",
        "the cftc notes that it has these constituencies in mind when reviewing proposals regarding the virtual currency derivatives markets . the cftc also announced that its market risk advisory committee will meet on january 31 , 2018 to discuss the statutory and regulatory process for listing new derivatives products , such as those based on virtual currencies , through the self-certification process on cftc-regulated designated contract markets and swap execution facilities . this follows an announcement that the cftc 's technology advisory committee will meet on january 23 , 2018 to discuss new and emerging technology such as virtual currencies , digital ledger technology , cybersecurity and more .
