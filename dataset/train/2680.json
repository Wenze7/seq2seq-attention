        "lately , i 've been trying to live my best life and walk in my purpose . determining your true purpose can be a daunting task and can consume insurmountable amounts time . it took me decades to finally submit and commit to it . truthfully , i 've known my purpose since i was in 4th grade and just did n't want that to be my purpose . instead , i decided to foolishly traverse the world in search of something that was always a part of me . it 's like cranes in the sky . lifes ' hard but worth the challenge . ",
        "because we 're friends and l love you i want to share some easy ways to determine and walk toward your purpose and passion . find what inspires you through volunteerism . volunteering is my jam . my intention is always to give back to those in need but i 'm the one that is impacted the most . i leave so full of gratitude , more aware and woke . volunteering can make the world a better place , expand your network and allow you to learn more about your purpose and passion on this earth . a few years ago , i spent 7 months working on a campaign for unicef to get clean water to children in third world countries . ",
        "aside from learning more about other people in various parts of the world , i had the opportunity to volunteer with amazing people . do n't sweat the small stuff . trust me . life will throw plenty of stressors your way in various forms : bad relationships , heartbreak , death , health diagnoses , job loss , you name it ! with that in mind , please let the little things go . i know that you hate seeing miniature speckles of toothpaste plastered on the bathroom mirror but do n't sweat it . they make windex . ",
        "those minor annoyances are just distractions to get you off your path to greatness . i know that this concept seems simple but it 's quite difficult . it requires grounded practice , self-awareness and constant conservation with god . next time somebody steps on your new jay 's just brush it off . take a chance . sometimes the answer is an unequivocal `` yes ! '' life has a weird way of putting us on the right path to our purpose if we pay close attention . when opportunities come your way its best to answer in the affirmative because you never know who you 'll meet or where those relationships will take you . ",
        "if you decline offers and opportunities because you feel that you are not ready , you 're doing yourself a disservice and can potentially block what 's in store for you . take a chance and live in the moment . everything in life is fleeting and temporary . if something results in embarrassment or failure it will not last for long . i hope that you find these tidbits helpful . please share steps you 've taken to find your passion . drop a comment below . originally posted at www . aryouserious . com-ar ' sheill monsanto .
