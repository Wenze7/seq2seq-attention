        "samsung has been working on an in-display fingerprint sensor for more than a year . the korean company had even joined hands with synaptics to develop a fingerprint scanner that could be placed under the display of its flagship phones . rumors about the galaxy s8 and note 8 having an optical fingerprint scanner did n't materialize because samsung was still facing production and security issues with the new technology . will the samsung galaxy s9 feature synaptics ' new optical fingerprint reader ? image credit : ice universe / twitter will the samsung galaxy s9 feature the clear id fs9500 sensor ? ",
        "on tuesday , synaptics announced that its new clear id fs9500 in-display fingerprint scanner had entered mass production . it would be much easier to authenticate by placing your finger on the screen rather than on a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner . what makes synaptics ' announcement even more interesting is that it has partnered with a `` top five '' original equipment manufacturer to produce clear id fs9500 . industry experts believe that synaptics has partnered with samsung . the top five smartphone oems are samsung , apple , huawei , oppo , and xiaomi . apple 's iphone x has completely ditched fingerprint scanning to incorporate the face id facial recognition system . ",
        "apple executives have said that the tech giant was never interested in adding a fingerprint sensor to its flagship model . kgi securities analyst ming-chi kuo has reported that all the 2018 iphones would come with face id . so , apple is not synaptics ' partner for the in-display fingerprint reader . samsung is most likely to be synaptics ' partner . the korean company has a long history of working with the fingerprint sensor maker . but that 's not all . synaptics mentioned in its press release that the new clear id sensor was designed for smartphones with `` bezel-free oled infinity displays . '' ",
        "they mentioned `` infinity displays '' three times in the press release . the only vendor that refers the edge-to-edge oled screens on its phones as infinity display is samsung . by mentioning the term multiple times , synaptics gave a clear indication that it was talking about samsung . kevin barber , svp of mobile division at synaptics , said the `` natural placement of the fingerprint sensor is in the display itself . '' synaptics claims its clear id optical fingerprint reader is faster and more secure than alternative biometrics including apple 's face id . the clear id is said to be twice as fast as face id on apple 's iphone x. clear id could show up in the samsung galaxy s9 and note 9 phones coming in 2018 . ",
        "an optical fingerprint scanner would allow samsung to ditch the rear-mounted fingerprint reader , which is so close to the camera lens that users sometimes accidentally put their finger on the camera . however , it 's too early to say whether the samsung galaxy s9 would sport the clear id sensor . the s9 unveiling is only a few months away , and samsung may not want to make last-minute changes to its flagship smartphone . synaptics has n't announced the name of its partner , so it could even be huawei , xiaomi , or oppo . also , ming-chi kuo says the galaxy note 9 , not the s9 , will be samsung 's first phone to sport an optical fingerprint reader . ",
        "there have been multiple leaks and rumors suggesting that the fingerprint reader would be placed on the back of the samsung galaxy s9 rather than under the display . screenshots from samsung 's s health app also showcase the rear-mounted fingerprint sensor . if synaptics was indeed referring to samsung as its partner , the feature could debut with the galaxy note 9 . galaxy s9 to sport an advanced iris scannerearlier this week , korean media reported that the samsung galaxy s9 would feature an advanced iris scanner . the company will bump up the iris scanner lens from 2mp on the s8 and note 8 to 3mp on the s9 . ",
        "it will be able to recognize users ' eyes more accurately in tricky situations such as bright light and dark environments . it would work even when you are moving your eyeballs or wearing sunglasses . samsung has reached out to multiple banks in south korea to ensure that the banking apps are compatible with the iris scanner as an authentication method . the galaxy s8 and note 8 have three authentication methods -- fingerprint sensor , iris scanner , and facial recognition . but the facial recognition is not secure enough for financial transactions . samsung is reportedly improving the iris scanner to take on apple 's face id . ",
        "how the galaxy s9 plus would differ from the s9the galaxy s9 and s9 plus are rumored to look like their predecessors , except that the new phones will have slimmer bezels and a relocated fingerprint sensor . samsung is looking to differentiate the s9 plus from the regular s9 by adding a dual camera and a larger 6 gb ram on the larger model . the standard galaxy s9 would feature 4 gb ram and a single camera on the back . the galaxy s9 would be powered by qualcomm 's snapdragon 845 soc , which is 30 % faster than the sd835 . ",
        "the new processor also brings improvements to virtual reality , ai processing , camera performance , security , and battery efficiency . other rumored features include a 3.5 mm audio jack , 64 gb of internal storage , and a microsd card slot for external memory expansion . there has been a lot of talk lately about the galaxy s9 unveiling . there were speculations that samsung could unveil the device at the consumer electronics show , which is only a few weeks away . but a samsung executive denied those rumors , saying the ces unveiling was `` unlikely .
