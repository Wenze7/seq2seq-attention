        "i 'll be honest -- i had a hard time getting into the whole makeup-subscription thing . as much as i love the thought of having a pretty box filled with beauty products land on my doorstep every month , i 'm more of a run-to-sephora-and-burn-my-entire-paycheck-every-week kind of person . but as these little kits continue to take over the beauty sphere -- and probably most of the usps 's inventory -- i 've decided to hop on the train , too . so after scouring the internet for the coolest products and best deals , i very scientifically selected the very best , top-of-the-top , subscription boxes that are truly worth your money . ",
        "check out the winners , below . 1 for the naturalist . each month , petit vour sends out four cruelty-free , non-toxic , and plant-based beauty products in a minimalist , instagram-worthy box . at $ 18 per month , petit vour is definitely on the pricey side , but with top-notch green brands like french girl organics and juice beauty , each sampling has an estimated value of $ 45 - $ 60 , which means you 're actually getting a really , really good deal . the monthly subscription can be canceled at any time , but if you sign up for a one-year plan , you 'll save $ 3 per box . ",
        "winner , winner . 2 for the diehard beauty fan . we know you 've already heard of birchbox -- the $ 10 a month service that serves up five incredibly good hair , skin , and makeup samples in each box , ranging from cult-favorite brands , to under-the-radar indie picks . but the best part is how easy birchbox makes it for you to buy full-size versions of your favorite samples : not only are all the products shoppable online , but you 'll also earn $ 1 for every $ 10 you spend through their loyalty points program . ",
        "plus , you 'll get to pick out one of your samples each month after receiving your first box . 3 for the community-oriented . with a boxycharmsubscription , you 'll not only get four or five full-size beauty products -- an estimated $ 100 value for just $ 21 per month -- but you 'll also join a massive community of `` charmers '' who share step-by-step tutorials and product recommendations like the makeup-obsessed family you never had . and , as you refer friends , review products , and remain an active subscriber , you 'll also receive loyalty charms , which add up to major savings and discounts on future boxes and products . ",
        "4 for the control freak . the best part about ipsy -- other than the fact that your products arrive in a different free makeup bag every month -- is that each box is curated specifically for you , giving you a level of control most other subscription services do n't offer . new subscribers are walked through an in-depth questionnaire to determine which makeup , hair , and skin-care samples will suit you best , meaning hair-haters can choose all makeup , while skin-care fans can stick with face products . the subscription includes five custom products for $ 10/month , but if you sign up for the year , you 'll get one free month . ",
        "5 for the recommendation kween . each glossybox features five beauty samples from crazy-good brands , like glamglow , tarte , and kat von d , all wrapped in a millennial pink box , because of course . the real draw , though , is that glossybox has a major reward system for product reviews -- you 'll earn glossycredit for each review you write on the website , which , for anyone who has some hella strong opinions , can be a game changer . and if you 're also a commitment phobe , do n't freak -- the subscription lets you either pay for a month to month subscription for $ 21 , a three-month subscription for $ 58.50 , a six-month for $ 111 , or 12-month for $ 210 .
