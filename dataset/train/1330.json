        "alabama freshman tua tagovailoa was n't just cool when he led the crimson tide back against no . 3 georgia to win the cfb playoff national championship game , he carried the same demeanor into the postgame , sounding more like 10-year nfl veteran than a 19-year-old who just orchestrated one of the most iconic moments in ncaa football history . `` i mean , it just felt like another game out there , '' tagovailoa said on sportscenter after alabama 's 26-23 overtime win . `` i just thank god i was put in a place and the position that i 'm in now .
