        "etfs powered by artificial intelligence in an attempt to beat the market are working . exchange-traded funds powered by artificial intelligence are getting smarter , according to a co-founder of equbot , a company that created one such fund . the ai powered equity etf -lrb- aieq , an actively managed security that seeks to use ai to beat the market , launched on oct. . 18 . `` the ai actually grows in value , '' equbot co-founder and coo art amador told cnbc 's `` power lunch '' on tuesday . `` we 're going to be even better tomorrow than we are today , '' amador said . ",
        "while the fund got off to a rocky start , underperforming the market , in the last three months the etf was up more than 10 percent . the returns were similar to the s&p 500 's during the same time period . the company built the etf on its proprietary algorithms . it is composed of more than 60 companies and uses algorithms to select the best stocks . top picks include amazon , alphabet and nvidia . while the ai was originally programmed by humans to monitor algorithms , amador said it is now completely autonomous , making decisions based on the information it scans . ",
        "`` our ip looks at the data and tries to find the truth and credibility behind the data , so we can see how important that information is and how important it is to the security price of over 6,000 companies , '' he said at this week 's etf conference in hollywood , florida . the automated etf is capable of processing each day approximately 1 million pieces of information , such as news articles and company financial statements . `` we believe there will be even more information tomorrow than there is today , '' amador said . ",
        "`` the ai technology mimics the process of an army of equity research analysts that are working around the clock . ''   "
