        "about six years ago , before `` deep learning '' was hot , i was approached by a startup that had invented a powerful new technology . the founder 's pedigree was impressive . he had built a very successful ai company in the past , which had led to a very public and valuable exit . since then , he had invested his time in developing a new and improved machine learning algorithm , which found human-readable rules to describe patterns in very noisy data and make fast and accurate predictions . you could see the potential application in many markets -- advertising , security , scheduling optimization , finance . ",
        "the potential use cases seemed infinite . but when you 've developed an interesting new technology that has many potential use cases , it 's especially difficult to find the right one . starting with a solution , rather than with a problem , will inevitably bias your customer discovery process . you 'll find yourself involuntarily pointing out the use cases to prospective customers , rather than listening to their problems . the prospect may even agree that there is room for improvement ! but you risk discovering problems that , while real , are not particularly valued . ",
        ". a real pain point is only validated when it is both verified and valued . going back to anonai , advertising was one potential use case -- anonai could offer machine learning as a saas tool to ad agencies to help them optimize for click through rates . anonai even found a paying ad agency as a customer for that use case . validation , right ? after spending time exploring this opportunity , it turned out that we could n't find a viable , repeatable business model , even though we had found a paying customer . the larger , more lucrative campaigns at the agency did n't focus on ctr optimization at all -- so optimizing for ctr , while it yielded results , was n't actually valued by the agency or their customers . ",
        "other digital agencies that focused on ctr optimization did n't have high enough margins for the saas offering to provide and capture significant value . while the technology worked exactly as it was supposed to , and while the problem it solved definitely existed , the pain point simply was n't valued by potential customers . anonai learned the hard way that , even when you have a paying customer for a technology solution that seems to solve the problem at hand , you are n't done validating your real pain points . unless you have especially deep experience in an industry , it takes disciplined , unbiased research to understand the valuable trends and business drivers in an industry . ",
        "it 's especially hard to keep such an unbiased view in markets where you already have a paying customer -- even more so if your team has already put in a lot of work under tight deadlines into customizing your tech for that customer 's use case . in this case , it can be deeply demoralizing to suddenly find out that the use case for your technology is not widely valued in the industry . this , unfortunately , was what happened with anonai . there was palpable slowing of momentum and lower morale after spending significant time exploring and abandoning the advertising use case . ",
        "it ultimately led to the decision that the startup should pivot from a product to a services company . of course , this use case problem is n't only faced by startups . i recently spoke to an ex-product manager at motorola , who shared his experiences of the r&d team handing over exciting new technology and tasking him with finding applications for it . he described similar struggles of trying to force-fit solutions for new technologies . instead of starting with use cases , we recommend a vision-driven approach to bringing a product to market -- that is , starting with a clear statement about the pain point you are solving and the change you want to see in the world . ",
        "the team is guided by that vision to work on figuring out a solution . when there are setbacks in achieving your vision , the team is more resilient because they know the ultimate goal and why they are working on it . you can read our posts on this vision-driven approach , including how to create a vision , how to build a product strategy , and how to measure what matters . share your stories and experiences of trying to find applications for new technology . for a vision-driven approach to product development , you can download the toolkit for free from radical product . ",
        "we look forward to hearing from you ! the difficulty of finding your way through a maze of use cases .   "
