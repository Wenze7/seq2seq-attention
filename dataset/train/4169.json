        "perris , calif. . -- a 17-year-old girl called police after escaping from her family 's home where she and her 12 brothers and sisters were locked up in filthy conditions , some so malnourished that officers at first believed they all were children , even though seven are adults . the girl was so small that officers initially thought she was only 10 . she called 911 and was met by police who interviewed her and then went to the family home in perris , about 70 miles southeast of los angeles . they found several children shackled to their beds with chains and padlocks in dark , foul-smelling surroundings , according to the riverside county sheriff 's department . ",
        "the children , ages 2 to 29 , `` appeared to be malnourished and very dirty , '' according to a news release announcing sunday 's arrest of the parents . `` the victims were provided with food and beverages after they claimed to be starving . `` david allen turpin , 57 , and louise anna turpin , 49 , were each held on $ 9 million bail and could face charges including torture and child endangerment . it was not immediately known if they had attorneys . they were scheduled to appear in court thursday . state department of education records show the family home has the same address as sandcastle day school , where david turpin is listed as principal . ",
        "in the 2016-17 school year , it had an enrollment of six with one student each in the fifth , sixth , eighth , ninth , 10th and 12th grades . neighbors in perris , where modest but well maintained homes are tightly packed on suburban streets , said they were stunned by the arrests . andrew santillan , who lives around the corner , heard about the case from a friend . `` i had no idea this was going on , '' he told the press-enterprise newspaper of riverside . `` i did n't know there were kids in the house . ",
        "`` other neighbors described the family as intensely private . a few years ago , robert perkins said he and his mother saw a few family members constructing a nativity scene in the turpins ' front yard . perkins said he complimented them on it . `` they did n't say a word , '' he said . social media photos show the family at disneyland and las vegas . the most recent shots , from 2016 , show the parents beaming after they apparently renewed their wedding vows and posed with an elvis impersonator . james turpin , of princeton , west virginia , said tuesday that he was surprised by the news reports about his son david . ",
        "all 13 children are david 's biological children . none are adopted , he said . turpin said he first heard about the matter monday night in a call from a reporter . he declined to talk further . `` we 're going to try to get to the bottom of it , '' he told the associated press . he and his wife , betty , told wheeling , west virginia , television station wtrf that david grew up in southern west virginia . the family moved to southern california in 2011 from johnson county , texas , near dallas , according to property records . ",
        "the turpins filed for bankruptcy that same year , stating in court documents they owed between $ 100,000 and $ 500,000 . at that time , turpin worked as an engineer at northrop grumman and earned $ 140,000 annually and his wife was a homemaker , records showed . their bankruptcy lawyer , ivan trahan , told the new york times he never met the children but the couple `` spoke about them highly . '' `` we remember them as a very nice couple , '' trahan said , adding that louise turpin told him the family loved disneyland and visited often . "
