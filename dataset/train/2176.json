        "china 's complete ban on ivory trade went into effect sunday , officials said , a major step forward in beijing 's efforts to rein in what was once the world 's largest market for illegal ivory . `` from today ... china 's complete ban on ivory trade went into effect sunday , officials said , a major step forward in beijing 's efforts to rein in what was once the world 's largest market for illegal ivory . `` from today ... the buying and selling of elephant ivory and goods by any market , shop or vendor is against the law ! '' ",
        "the forestry ministry said on its official account on chinese social media platform weibo . `` from now on , if a merchant tells you ` this is a state-approved ivory dealer ' ... he is duping you and knowingly violating the law . `` the ministry added that the ban also applied to online sales and souvenirs purchased abroad . according to the xinhua state news agency , a partial ban had already resulted in an 80 percent decline in seizures of ivory entering china . domestic prices for raw ivory are down 65 percent , it said . ",
        "the total domestic ban was announced at the end of last year . by this march , xinhua reported , 67 factories and shops involved in china 's ivory trade had closed . the remaining 105 were expected to close sunday . china had previously banned imports of all ivory and ivory products acquired before 1975 , after pressure to restrict a trade that sees thousands of elephants slaughtered every year . african ivory is highly sought after in china , where it is seen as a status symbol , and used to fetch as much as $ 1,100 a kilogramme . ",
        "poaching in africa has seen the elephant population fall by 110,000 over the last 10 years to just 415,000 , according to the international union for conservation of nature . despite an overall fall in poaching , africa 's elephant population has declined in part because of continued illegal killing , said a report this year by the convention on international trade in endangered species .
