        "let 's face it , no one enjoys preparing their taxes or complying with federal and state tax code each and every year . it 's not hard to see why , either . the federal tax code was nearing 10.1 million words in length as of 2015 , and it 's gained an average of 144,500 words per year since 1955 . if not for the assistance of tax software and tax professionals , preparing your taxes might otherwise take a really long time . nevertheless , we pay our taxes and are mindful of compliance because we know it keeps the lights on for the federal , state , and local governments . ",
        "it also allows for jobs to be created and infrastructure to be built and maintained . but in 2018 , a few of those state governments will be requesting more from their residents . if you live in one of the following six states , now might be the time to prepare for a higher tax liability in the upcoming year . hawaii . the aloha state is one of three states in 2018 that 'll be passing along income tax increases to its residents . while hawaii 's will be the largest nominal increase by far , it 'll also affect the smallest percentage of the population . ",
        "beginning next year , the state will reintroduce a peak marginal income tax rate of 11 % , up from 8.25 % , on all income over $ 200,000 for single filers . this peak rate was instituted in 2009 as a temporary tax increase , but it expired in december 2015 . the state decided to reinstitute this peak rate once again , with the expectation that it 'll bring in about $ 51 million in extra revenue in 2018 . what 'll be worth closely monitoring is if this tax hike negatively impacts hiring in hawaii . a number of pass-through business owners are taxed at the individual tax rate , and small businesses accounted for more than 96 % of hawaii 's employers as recently as 2013 . ",
        "even though not all small businesses are pass-through entities , there could be an adverse knee-jerk reaction from this tax hike . illinois . in terms of sweeping income tax reforms , illinois just might take the cake among the three states set to increase income taxes in 2018 . earlier this year , the land of lincoln passed a 32 % increase to its individual income tax rate , from 3.75 % to 4.95 % . however , the increase was designed to be blended in during 2017 and enacted fully in 2018 . in plainer terms , illinois residents will pay 3.75 % for the first half of the year on their earned income and 4.95 % for the second half of 2017 . ",
        "meanwhile , in 2018 , they 'll be paying a 4.95 % in state income tax on their earned income . for a single filer earning about $ 40,000 in adjusted gross income , you 're looking at an extra $ 480 out of pocket in 2018 compared to the previous rate . things will be a bit tougher for the well-to-do . single filers making more than $ 250,000 in agi , and couples filing jointly earning more than $ 500,000 in agi , are losing their personal exemptions , the illinois property tax credit , and credits related to paying private school tuition for elementary and high school , as noted by the chicago tribune . ",
        "kansas . the third state passing along income tax increases in 2018 is kansas . following an income tax cut to its residents earlier this decade , kansas ' legislature passed its largest tax increase in history this june . in july 2017 , state income tax rates rose by 0.2 % for those earning $ 30,000 or less , 0.3 % for those making between $ 30,001 and $ 60,000 , and 0.6 % for folks making more than $ 60,000 . beginning next year , these rates will rise once more . those making $ 30,000 or less will see yet another 0.2 % hike to 3.1 % , while middle-income earners making $ 30,001 to $ 60,000 will absorb a 0.35 % increase to 5.25 % . ",
        "lastly , those making more than $ 60,000 will see their income tax rate jump 0.5 % to 5.7 % . still , kansans are paying a lower income tax rate than they did between 1992 and 2012 , and they 'll see a handful of reinstated deductions , including the child care deduction , which returns in 2018 . get your motor running , because tennessee is planning to take a little bit more out of your wallet each time you fill your vehicle up with gas . for the first time since 1989 , the volunteer state has increased its gas tax to fund roadwork and slash other taxes within the state . ",
        "on april 24 , tennessee gov. bill haslam signed the improve act into law , which is expected to raise $ 350 million annually . this began with a $ 0.04-per-gallon gas tax increase on july 1 , 2017 , and it includes a $ 0.01-per-gallon increase in july 2018 and july 2019 , for a total hike of $ 0.06 . diesel vehicles will fare a bit worse , with the $ 0.04-per-gallon increase in july 2017 , followed by $ 0.03-per-gallon jumps in july 2018 and july 2019 , for a total rate increase of $ 0.10 per gallon . ",
        "and just in case you think you 're exempt because you drive an electric vehicle , the improve act establishes a new annual fee of $ 100 for evs . south carolina . in may , south carolina gov. henry mcmaster vetoed the infrastructure and economic development reform act , which was designed to raise $ 640 million in annual revenue primarily through a gas tax increase . however , the state 's legislature , by a vote of 32-to-12 , overrode that veto and moved this bill into law . however , residents of the palmetto state should n't be weeping too much , seeing as how their gas tax of $ 0.1675 per gallon is the second-lowest in the country , behind alaska . ",
        "nonetheless , the now-passed bill allows south carolina to increase its per-gallon gas tax by $ 0.02 annually , beginning in july 2017 and continuing through july 2022 . that means residents can expect a mid-year $ 0.02 hike on a per-gallon basis in 2018 , and will be paying $ 0.2875 per gallon by july 2022 . additionally , biennial vehicle registration fees for folks under the age of 65 jumped from $ 24 to $ 40 , and the maximum sales tax per motor vehicle sale increases from $ 300 to 5 % of the purchase price with the passage of the iedra . ",
        "but the smorgasbord of tax increases for 2018 goes to oregon . the passage of house bill 2017 is expected to generate $ 5.3 billion via taxes and fees to tackle highway and bridge improvements and to reduce congestion on major highways over the next 10 years . it 'll lift taxes and fees in a variety of ways . for starters , oregon is tacking on $ 0.04 per gallon to its motor fuel tax , pushing it to $ 0.34 a gallon from $ 0.30 . the state has the option of adding $ 0.02 per gallon in 2019 and beyond , but additional hikes will depend on the results of state-agency studies . ",
        "second , oregon is hitting residents , along with nonresidents performing services in oregon , with a 0.1 % payroll tax increase . if employers fail to deduct and withhold the tax , the employer will be on the hook for the tax . third , oregon is introducing the nation 's very first bicycle excise tax . despite being known as a `` green '' state , the only thing green here is the $ 15 tax imposed on buyers of bicycles retailing for $ 200 or more with wheels of at least 26 inches in diameter . finally , a privilege tax of 0.5 % is being implemented on the retail sales price of motor vehicles . ",
        "while the dealer is responsible for this tax , do n't be shocked if it gets passed along to consumers in the form of a higher sticker price .   "
