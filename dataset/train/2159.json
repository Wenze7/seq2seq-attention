        "once upon a time , having gated content meant you had hit the content marketing big leagues . it meant that you had enough traffic and authority that people would line up to read your content even when you put obstacles in their way . there were two main arguments for gated content : it could be a source of revenue it helped you build an email list for lead generationand , while those two things are still true , the downsides of gated content have become much more apparent over the last few years . so let me put my content marketing heretic hat on , and we 'll take a look at why that is : you fill your email list with junk subscribersmy content writing `` specialty '' is business . ",
        "that 's a pretty big umbrella , and i 've found myself researching things that i did n't even know existed before getting the assignment . that research has often included exchanging my email for gated content . to this day , my inbox overflows with marketing emails about products that i will never , ever buy : cold water survival gear , rooftop equipment and supports , hvac systems , construction supplies , etc. . sure , it 's annoying for me , but it 's also expensive and wasteful for the companies sending those emails . many email marketing services charge by the number of subscribers , and people like me are just a waste of money . ",
        "and that 's not the only wasteful aspect of gated content . many people have junk email accounts that exist solely to provide a destination for marketing emails . the accounts may be real , but nobody ever checks them , so your outreach emails just sit there and stagnate . some of these people may eventually convert , but they 're going to do it in their own time and on their own terms . until that point , your emails are just falling into a black hole -- and you 're paying for the trip . takeawaydo n't gate your content to build an email list unless you have a way to figure out which are qualified leads and which are people like me , just stopping by to do a bit of research . ",
        "it can be hard to tell the difference on the front end , but it 's easy to weed those junk leads out later on . use your sales data to identify a timeframe after which conversion is unlikely , and delete those records once that time has passed . you gate content too far up the sales funnelif you belonged to a gym in the 90s , you might remember that getting a price quote over the phone was like pulling teeth -- from a velociraptor . you had to go in person and endure the tour and the sales pitch before you could find out whether the price of membership was even in your budget . ",
        "it was irritating as heck -- and so is content that 's gated too far up the sales funnel . takeawaydo n't put obstacles in the way of people who are still trying to figure out whether or not they 're interested in what you have to offer . think of it as being on your best behavior on a first date : wait until you know they 're really interested before you start revealing the little quirks they 'll have to put up with if they want to be in your life . your gated content is available somewhere elseas unbelievable as this may seem , it happens -- especially on sites like medium . ",
        "a lot of their content is syndicated , meaning it 's published somewhere else first . see for yourself : next time you run into medium 's paywall , try googling the title of the article to see if it 's posted publicly on another site . it might not happen all that often , but the point is that there 's nothing in place to keep it from happening , which undermine 's medium 's value proposition for their gated content . and it will do the same to yours . takeawaycheck to make sure your gated content is n't available free somewhere else . ",
        "your gated content is crapi 'm not trying to pick on medium , but it 's the perfect example for this one . there 's no quality control for what goes behind medium 's paywall . it 's completely up to the writer -- and some of them are n't as good as they think they are . it 's another flaw in the platform 's business model : a lot of the members-only content is crap , and people will only pay for crap for so long . takeawayif you are going to gate something , it has to be extraordinary . ",
        "it has to be so great that readers are willing to buy it , whether the price is in dollars or personal information . in other words , if you 're going to put a price tag on your content , make sure it 's worth it . you make it too hard or ask for too muchthe value of your gated content has to equal or exceed the price of admission . and , since readers wo n't form an idea as to the value of your content until after they 've read it , err on the side of caution . ",
        "you do n't want them to end up with a bad case of buyer 's remorse . takeawaydo as much as you can to reduce friction . allow readers to use one of their social accounts to log in rather than making them start from scratchuse progressive profiling , where you ask for the minimum information the first time and gradually request more as a reader shows continued interestyour gated content damages your seoall those bots constantly crawling your site are n't going to hand over their credit card or give you their email . when it comes to seo bots , your gated content does n't exist . ",
        "and , since gated content is usually , your best work , that 's a big problem . takeawayif your content marketing strategy really depends on gated content , at least offer a keyword optimized summary in front of the paywall . while there are certainly situations where gated content makes sense , it 's losing favor as a one-size-fits all content marketing tactic . the downsides are big enough to warrant asking yourself some tough questions , not the least of which is , `` are we just gating content because all of the cool kids are doing it ? '' ",
        "as with anything else in content marketing , `` everybody else is doing it '' is a lousy -- and potentially costly -- reason . it 's critical to make sure that any content you gate serves your strategic goals and does n't undermine them . if any of the points above made you feel a little squirmy , that 's a good indication that your gated content might be doing more harm than good . i want to give a shout-out to rob howard for his medium article , `` why paywalls do n't work , '' for inspiring this post .
