        "leadership is many things , not the least of which is influence . influence means `` the capacity to have an effect on the character , development , or behavior of someone or something , or the effect itself . '' leaders can have an impact on their colleagues ' character and development with influence . influence is asserted both outwardly and behind the scenes . a real leader is vocal about supporting a colleague 's project and advocates for them . they share ideas and elevate coworkers with this collaboration . they share results from their own work , too , reflecting on ways they can improve and not being afraid to ask for feedback . ",
        "having influence involves modeling those behaviors that you want to help develop in others . open collaboration is one such behavior , but being an influential leader also includes gratitude . give thanks for shared ideas . be vocal about your appreciation for the work others do to help you . show gratitude for professional opportunities . influence also comes from private interactions and individual work . in one-on-one situations , a leader should provide feedback to colleagues on how their work can be improved . sharing ideas go in both directions and supports growing influence . a leader can also check in with themselves , to ensure the work they are doing aligns with company goals . ",
        "by openly sharing and supporting ideas , and letting company priorities inform your interactions and your work , you will naturally become a more influential leader . influence begins with nurturing connections and depends on your ability to mobilize those networks . start with everyday conversation and watch your influence grow . rachel krug is a proven product and marketing leader who enjoys tackling any problem , large or small . want to chat more about leadership ? message me on linkedin or twitter .
