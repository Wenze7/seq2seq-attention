        "it 's the season where sharing means caring . except when you 're sharing a cold or the flu . it seems inevitable during the winter months that colds spread through office spaces like wildfires . but it does n't have to be so . dr. kelly powers , national review regional fellow , tells newsmax health that although winter viruses are common , there are ways you can lesson your chances of catching a cold or the flu , and/or reduce the severity or duration of a viral infection . here are nine of the best strategies . wash your hands : experts say hand washing is the single most effective way to prevent the spread of germs and bacteria . ",
        "powers tells newsmax health that handwashing is a quick and simple act that plays an imperative role in minimizing exposure to bacteria and viruses . vigorously wash your hands under warm running water for at least 20 seconds before rinsing . avoid touching your face and , if you 're not feeling well , stay home from work to prevent the spread of colds and flu . if you 're already sick and ca n't miss work , make a point to sneeze or cough into your elbow -- not your hand . also disinfect any common surfaces , like water coolers and refrigerators that you touch regularly . ",
        "`` no surprise in our high-tech world most jobs are comprised of frequent use of computers , mobile phones , ipads , etc. . these devices are often covered with bacteria . it may not be a bad idea to wipe down keyboards , desks , doorknobs with alcohol and your cell phone screens with safe antimicrobials wipes . just make sure to use something that is approved for phone and computer screens , '' says powers . supplements can help : powers notes that vitamin c should be a staple this time of year to help keep your immune system in tip-top shape . ",
        "`` some research has shown that vitamin c can play a role in possible prevention and even shortening the duration of a cold , '' she explains . `` another familiar supplement is echinacea . although the mechanism of action is not well understood , research shows that it too can reduce symptoms and speed up the duration of a cold . zinc is another helpful adjunct as the body 's immune system needs zinc to function properly and studies have also shown that zinc when taken at the start of a cold can shorten the duration and reduce symptoms . '' ",
        "rest up : research shows that adequate rest is an integral component of staying healthy through the cold and flu season . aim for at least seven hours of shut-eye a night to reap the cold fighting benefits . one study found that those who slept at least seven hours a night were four times less likely to catch a cold than those who only slept between five and six hours . manage stress : few things tax your immune system as much as chronic stress . one study found that people who reported that they felt under a tremendous amount of stress were twice as likely as their non-stressed counterparts to get a cold . ",
        "when the body is under stress it produces the hormone cortisol , which can cause constant low grade inflammation and increase the chance of developing a virus . try reducing stress by exercising , yoga , or meditation . get moving : staying active may help prevent a viral infection and reduce its duration if you do catch one . studies have found that exercise can boost the immune system and reduce the chance of catching a cold by 50 percent . aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise daily . take a decongestant : although it wo n't cure the common cold , a nasal decongestant can help you fight off cold symptoms once they hit . ",
        "make sure to drink plenty of fluids because they can be dehydrating . staying hydrated , regardless of whether you take a decongestant , is an important aspect of fighting off colds . drinking extra fluids may reduce the severity of a cold . watch out for signs of dehydration like dark yellow urine , dry lips and thirst . try chicken soup : turns out mom was right about the chicken soup . researchers from nebraska medical center found that chicken soup may help combat a cold by inhibiting neutrophils -- white blood cells produced during an inflammatory response to a cold that tend to increase mucous production . ",
        "honey : adding honey to your tea can help calm colds and ease sore throats . a 2007 study compared honey with a pharmaceutical-grade cough suppressants and a placebo for the treatment of children 's upper respiratory tract infections . honey came out on top . eat your veggies : vegetables are packed with powerful cold-fighting antioxidants like vitamin c and zinc which can boost immune function . fill your plate with natural sources of vitamin c including citrus fruit , dark leafy greens , berries , tomatoes and bell peppers . powers notes that it 's important to remember that people are contagious even before they have cold symptoms . ",
        "`` often individuals are infectious a day or two before symptoms arise and usually remain contagious for about a week thereafter , with some variability , '' she explains . `` if someone is taking antibiotics for a bacterial infection , this does shorten the potential for transmission as the bacterial load is lessening with each day . '' powers adds that if you 're feeling sick , stay home . your coworkers will thank you .   "
