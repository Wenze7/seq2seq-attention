        "washington -- the state department has released emails from huma abedin , a top aide to hillary clinton , that were found by the fbi on her husband 's laptop . some of the emails found on former rep. anthony weiner 's laptop were marked classified . it was unclear whether they were deemed classified at the time they were sent or when the state department was preparing them for release . the emails were released in response to a freedom of information act lawsuit filed by the conservative watchdog group judicial watch . the state department said it `` carefully reviews the content of records requested through foia to determine whether any information is sensitive or classified , '' and some of the documents released friday have `` classified information that has been redacted . '' ",
        "the fbi found thousands of emails exchanged between clinton and abedin while searching weiner 's laptop as part of a criminal investigation into his sexting with a high school student . the discovery led then-fbi director james comey to announce in late october 2016 , as clinton 's run for the white house was in its final stage , that he was reopening the probe of her use of a private computer server . then two days before election day , the fbi declared there was nothing new in the emails . clinton has called comey 's intervention `` the determining factor '' in her defeat . ",
        "the fbi has since said that only a small number of the emails found on the laptop had been forwarded while most had simply been backed up from electronic devices , including most of the email chains containing classified information . comey said the fbi had concluded that neither weiner nor abedin had committed a crime in their handling of the email .
