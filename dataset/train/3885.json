        "how marcus mariota 's previous five games compare to his last five games in 2016 . mariota in 2016 kansas city , mo -- december 18 : quarterback marcus mariota # 8 of the tennessee titans in action during the game against the kansas city chiefs at arrowhead stadium on december 18 , 2016 in kansas city , missouri . without question , marcus mariota had a better statistical season in 2016 . however , mariota has a chance to take the titans into the post season with a home win against jacksonville on sunday afternoon . mariota really hit his stride last season from week five through week twelve , throwing at least two touchdown passes per game . ",
        "from week five through week ten mariota tossed 17 touchdowns to just 3 interceptions and was considered to be a `` red zone assassin '' . down the stretch , mariota 's production slowed down a bit . in the last five games mariota played in 2016 , he threw 5 touchdowns to 1 interception . he yielded a completion percentage of 54.4 % , connecting on 73/134 passes . mariota totaled 944 passing yards over the last five games , ending his season at the close of the third quarter in a week 16 loss to jacksonville . he finished the season with 26 touchdowns to 9 interceptions . ",
        "mariota in 2017sunday will mark the first week 17 game mariota will play since entering the league in 2015 . that being said , mariota has n't been able to recreate the same magic he did last season . he 's been playing banged up and his lack of lower body strength is having an effect on his accuracy and power throwing the football . glendale , az -- december 10 : marcus mariotahe also has been more hesitant from the pocket , as the mental cobwebs stemming from his season-ending fibula fracture in 2016 linger . a potential breakout season with new weaponry in his receiving group has transformed into more of an ebb and flow year . ",
        "miscommunication , qb vision and receivers understanding their routes have all had an effect on the stagnant pass offense . in the last five games , mariota has produced a completion percentage of 62 % , connecting on 93/151 passes . he 's thrown for 1,009 passing yards , with 4 touchdowns to 5 interceptions . it 's fair to say mariota will not come close to his touchdown/interception ratio he built in 2016 . however , a win on sunday would punch the titans ticket into the playoffs . getting tennessee into the `` second-season '' is paramount , and the only goal that matters at this point . ",
        "`` all i really care about is winning . when it comes down to it , yes i would have liked to play better throughout the year . but we have an opportunity , '' mariota said . `` we have a chance to go in the playoffs and then get in the tournament . that 's all you really want to do . when the offseason rolls around , obviously i 'll find ways to improve and get better from it . but , right now my main focus is just going there and winning this game with these guys . ",
        "`` as evidenced throughout history , anything can happen in the nfl playoffs . the titans did n't meet expectations that many had placed upon them heading into the season . the receiving weapons added to the fold have n't produced the fireworks many had hoped . the offensive line and running game were n't able to replicate last season 's success . however , the titans still control their destiny . more from titan sized tennessee titans 2018 opponents announced and analysis2d ago tennessee titans afc playoff scenarios : win and in ! 2d ago tennessee titans could find an answer to offensive woes in the division2d ago tennessee titans : important player matchups to watch in week 164d ago the tennessee titans can beat the rams by playing to their strengths6d ago ugly roadthe road to the playoffs was n't as `` pretty '' as many titans fans hoped . ",
        "most were looking forward to clinching a spot by week 14 . tennessee has been on both the good side and bad side of ugly football games . it 's only fitting for their entrance into the post season to be just as ugly . nashville , tn -- december 24 : quarterback marcus mariotathe jaguars will do everything in their power to keep the titans out of the playoffs . history favors the titans in this match up . during the 1999 super bowl season , the jaguars won the division . in fact , they only had two blemishes on their regular season -- both to the titans . ",
        "tennessee would meet jacksonville in the afc championship . despite the jaguars hosting the game , the titans would come out on top . the titans reaching the playoffs at 9-7 is n't a bad thing . in the `` second-season '' , every team 's record is 0-0 . it does n't matter what was accomplished during the regular season . tennessee aims to prove they are better than their record reflects . mariota will not be focused on his stat sheet or padding his numbers sunday afternoon . his focus is on winning . he will do everything in his power to get the titans into the dance .
