        "stephen curry has a hell of a pit crew getting him back onto the nba track . curry is rehabbing a sprained ankle that will keep him out of action at least through christmas . i 'm not sure why the nba does n't simply put its schedule on hold for a couple of weeks . all the players could use a blow , and the league is n't as much fun without curry . but adam silver is a stickler for schedules . however , the commissioner will ask the league 's other superstars to be more exciting for the next couple weeks , chipping in to make up for steph 's absence . ",
        "but about the pit crew : for his daily shooting routine , which he got back to wednesday , curry always works with assistant coaches bruce fraser and nick u'ren , but steve nash recently joined the crew . you know nash , the team consultant and former two-time league mvp . nash drops into practice from time to time and usually works with kevin durant , but this time he joined curry 's fun bunch . curry did his usual shooting . looked nimble , did the typical cutting and running , did n't seem to be favoring the ankle , got the usual lift off the floor on his jumper , which is n't much . ",
        "i wonder if the forced layoff will be beneficial for curry . who knows , maybe a bit of shot fatigue can set in when you shoot a million shots a day , and now maybe he has a bit of mental and physical freshness . it 's work , curry 's shooting routine , but it never looks like drudgery . it 's quick-paced and methodical , with u'ren rebounding , feeding fraser , who feeds curry , but the three never look like they 're paid to be there . three guys at the gym . nash added a professorial touch . ",
        "at one point , curry fastened on a wide rubberized belt with two resistance bands , one attached to the belt near each hip . fraser stood behind curry and grabbed a band in each hand , like a farmer hitching up the plow horse . curry dribbled forward against the band resistance , maneuvered , then shoot . fraser moved with him , looking like a puppet master . fraser said the gizmo is relatively new to the team , introduced by nash . it is designed to develop the core , and improve balance and positioning . so hey , maybe curry , who was playing at an mvp-discussion level , will come back better than ever . ",
        "if not , at least he 'll pick up some soccer moves from nash , who was playing hacky-sack with a basketball , and shooting baskets off his instep . curry looks good , is healing on schedule , will be re-evaluated next week , but there is a worry cloud over the rest of the season . every player rolls an ankle , but nobody has forgotten curry 's career-threatening ankle problems six seasons ago . the warriors have stocked up on extra superstars for a rainy day , but if we 're playing america 's silliest game , `` which warrior is most indispensable , '' i 'm taking curry . ",
        "short-term , though , curry 's absence is not without its benefits . in the warriors ' overtime win over the lakers monday , kevin durant missed his first seven shots . had curry been playing , durant might have backed off and looked for curry . durant knew he had to shoot himself back to reality immediately , so he kept jacking , and wound up scoring 36 points , shooting 10-for-22 after the cold start . it 's good for durant and klay thompson to know they have to help make up for curry 's lost 26 points every game . ",
        "thompson did it wednesday night by scoring 27 points in the first half against memphis . when all the warriors are healthy , one thing steve kerr has to worry about and fight against , is cruise control . sometimes for this group the game is too easy . that can be good , because you ca n't play six months with a white-hot intensity , but a team needs challenges . plenty of room for that kind of growth now , with draymond green , zaza pachulia and sean livingston also missing time with injuries . kerr loves it when the spotlight gets thrown on the non-superduperstars . ",
        "keeps morale up , and kerr knows those guys will be needed in the playoffs . omri casspi , for instance , has seen extended minutes , and has responded . he fits the warriors ' offense so well that bob myers must be embarrassed that he got casspi so cheaply . david west , whose playing time has gone up and is the guy who looked like he would be phased into an end-of-career mentorship role , is fly-swatting the shots of teen phenoms . we 'll all miss watching curry battle lebron on christmas day , but the big show is months away . ",
        "monday , before that warriors-cavaliers game , maybe curry can call in a stunt double , nash , to take that pregame tunnel shot . off his instep . scott ostler is a san francisco chronicle columnist . email : sostler@sfchronicle . com twitter : @scottostler .   "
