        "factors affecting the success of grizzly bear translocations . credit : journal of wildlife managementthe number of grizzly bear translocations has increased in recent years to protect the bears and reduce conflicts with humans . in a recent journal of wildlife management analysis of translocations in alberta , canada , researchers found that the most important factors for translocation success were the level of human-caused mortality risk at the release site and the time of year when the translocation occurred . in general , moving bears earlier in the year and releasing them in areas of low mortality risk and in proximity to rivers will improve the odds of translocation success . ",
        "`` to improve science-based management decisions regarding translocations , there must be greater effort to collect scientific data post release and greater effort to publish the results of translocations , even ones that are unsuccessful , in peer-reviewed journals , '' said lead author sarah milligan , of the grizzly bear program at fri research . `` we see our study as a first step toward improving the success of grizzly bear translocations when they are considered necessary , but also as an important contribution to the scientific literature necessary for understanding and advancing translocation science in general . more information : journal of wildlife management .
