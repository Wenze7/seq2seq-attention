        "we have planned that we will aware students of ninth class of a specific government or low level school about the drawbacks of cramming and rote learning and benefits of conceptual learning . in this regard we have a very broad plan for our awareness scheme . firstly , we will send proposal to a school where we would like to conduct our seminar . we may send proposal to more than one school so that if one reject our proposal we will have a safe side also . secondly , we will go to that school after the acceptance of our proposal . ",
        "we will conduct a small interacting session with the students . in that session we will try to know about our audience . we will try to know that which kind of difficulties do the students usually face and we try to encourage those students who feel problems in communicating and are shy to talk . our main focusing area these students because they do not know how to learn . they usually come up in the exams with the help of rote learning and are unable to get good remarks either . we will ask them that in which subject you guys think you have to rote learn and we will also ask the topics from that subject . ",
        "thirdly , we will conduct a test of that students and asses them by checking their tests . fourthly , we will conduct a seminar on the base of the test they will have taken . this seminar will be the most important part of our whole project because in this seminar or class we will discuss with the students about their test , about their mistakes , about the problems they have faced while preparing for the test . our test will be from the book of their curriculum . but we will change the shape of the question so that the questions become a bit tricky but at the same time understandable . ",
        "the one who will has learnt the concept will succeed but the one who just cram and did not catch the concept will be failed . in the same seminar we will teach students how they have to learn . we will tell them that if you only rote learn the thing you will not be able to teach it to others and you will not perform well in your life also . fifthly , we will conduct another test which will be different from the first test and we will again asses that which things have been changed in the students . ",
        "we will compare their first and second test and if you reach the fifty percent improvement in learning the importance of conceptual learning we will reach our goal of the project . and still if there will be no improvement we will repeat our third and fourth procedure again . sixthly , at the end we will again conduct a seminar and an interacting session with the students and ask from them that what they had learned and how they will implement this in their lives further . the last thing is that we will divide the tasks in our group very properly . ",
        "every member of our group will have to participate with all his/her efforts . we will have two speakers for interacting session , two speakers for the motivational or seminar session . each member of the group will be a speaker . we will also divide the minor task so that each member realize his duty and his participation . as this is an awareness project , so its outcome will be the difference in the first test the students will have given and the last test which we will conduct . we will also ask from our students what do you guys feel after giving these assessment test and receiving lecture on how to learn things and knowing the importance of conceptual study . ",
        "even if a single student start studying conceptually then it would be no less a big achievement for us . thank you .   "
