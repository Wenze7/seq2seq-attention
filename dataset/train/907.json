        "united continental holdings inc. . is exploring a deal to invest in regional airline expressjet to boost its pipeline of pilots and expand service in the eastern and midwestern u. s. , people familiar with the matter said . the chicago-based carrier is looking at acquiring an ownership stake in expressjet among other options in negotiations that are still developing , said the people , who asked not to be identified because the talks are private . there 's no guarantee the discussions will lead to a deal with expressjet , an unprofitable subsidiary of skywest inc. . that already flies for united . ",
        "the tie-up would help united beef up the domestic network that feeds travelers to other flights , as the no . 3 u. s. carrier works to close a profit gap with delta air lines inc. . and american airlines group inc. . united has been adding dozens of flights between smaller cities and its largest airports , trips that can be more lucrative than the heavily-trafficked routes between big hubs . financial details of the potential transaction could n't be determined . united declined to comment . skywest and expressjet did n't respond to requests for comment . skywest jumped on news of the talks , climbing as much as 3.5 percent in intraday trading . ",
        "the shares rose 1.8 percent to $ 52.60 at 2:26 p. m. in new york , while united climbed less than 1 percent to $ 64.12 . pilot recruitingunited , which has a minority stake in commutair , is the only one of the three largest u. s. carriers that does n't own a regional airline outright . that can put united at a disadvantage in recruiting pilots . delta 's endeavor air offers pilots a guaranteed interview at the mainline airline after a certain period . american 's wholly-owned regional units have `` flow-through agreements '' that enable pilot hires to advance straight to a job at the major carrier without an additional interview . ",
        "united is treading carefully to avoid the labor turmoil that would come with acquiring a regional airline carrier outright , the people said . united management and leaders of the pilots union are already taking steps toward opening contract talks ahead of schedule , with a goal of forging a new agreement by early 2019 , captain todd insler , chairman of the united airlines pilots master executive council , said in an oct. . 20 letter to pilots . one of the issues expected to loom large in the talks are the restrictions on the scope of united 's express unit , which subcontracts flying to commuter carriers . ",
        "while united would like to add more embraer sa e-175s to expand its reach to smaller markets , the regional operation has reached the maximum number of 76-seat aircraft allowed under the current pilot contract . annual lossesexpressjet , based in atlanta , had about $ 1 billion in sales last year , with an operating loss of $ 300 million that was widened by special items . the unit posted losses of $ 34.2 million in 2015 and $ 118 million in 2014 , according to regulatory filings by skywest . the carrier agreed in august to end a carriage deal with delta earlier than expected . ",
        "expressjet also serves american . until it was spun off in 2002 , expressjet had been a unit of continental airlines , which merged with united in 2010 . the main airports served by the regional carrier include atlanta , cleveland , chicago , houston and newark , new jersey .   "
