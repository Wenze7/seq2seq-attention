",
        "tourism is one of egypt 's main foreign currency sources that suffered from several blows in recent years . it was hit hard by a russian travel ban , in place since november 2015 , after a russian airliner was downed over sinai , killing all 224 people on board . however , russia has agreed to the resumption of direct flights to egypt last month in a positive sign for the sector . russian transport minister maxim sokolov said flights between moscow and cairo could restart by early february on both egyptair and aeroflot , the russian carrier . ",
        "the ban , however , was not lifted on flights to the popular red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh , but it is expected to be lifted soon . around 5.9 million tourists visited egypt during the first nine months of 2017 , already an improvement on 2016 which saw only 5.4 million tourists throughout the year , according to figures from the central agency for public mobilization and statistics . despite the leap in figures , they remain below the 2010 peak levels , when over 14.5 million tourists visited egypt , bringing in around $ 12.5 billion in revenue .
