        "photo credit : jim mone/apwe 're smack dab in the middle of post-holidays winter , when all there is to do is be pissed off about the fact that there 's nothing to look forward to in the immediate future other than some dark , cold days . this wears on everybody , but it seems to be wearing on nba players in particular . it felt like the whole league was in a bad mood yesterday . first came a report from adrian wojnarowski , which described a `` fiery '' and `` intense '' team meeting in which the legitimacy of kevin love 's weekend illness was apparently challenged by his very own teammates . ",
        "if you 've ever had a job you hated , you are familiar with that distinct , petty feeling that comes over you when one of your piece-of-shit coworkers -- who clearly does n't work as hard as you ! -- calls in sick . that motherfucker 's faking it ! is the thought process of a professionally unhappy person , and it does not speak well of the cavs ' championship aspirations . next came a hot beef cooked up by wizards point guard john wall and mavericks guard j. j. barea . the wizards , who are supposed to be good but actually stink , got rolled 98-75 . ",
        "in the fourth quarter , with the game out of hand , wall and barea got into it : then came the postgame shots , first from wall : `` just a little midget trying to get mad , '' wall said . `` i do n't pay him no mind . '' damn ! and then from barea : `` now i have somebody in the nba that i do n't like , '' barea said . `` that 's my first . i do n't like him at all now . but i do n't think his teammates like him , either . ",
        "so it 's nothing new for him . '' point to barea here for doing his homework . he seems to be aware of a recent washington post report about a wizards team meeting that apparently went very poorly . that report was hilarious because you usually hear about secret team meetings as a catalyst for a team finally getting its shit together and taking a step forward , but this one seems to have just made things worse . the wizards are a mess . now we turn towards golden state , where kevin durant is not happy that rockets center clint capela had the temerity to say that the rockets are better than the warriors after defeating them on saturday . ",
        "get a load of this smug response : may god one day grant us all the self-assurance necessary to do whatever the real-life equivalent of joining a 73-win team is , and then proceed to lecture people about not working hard enough . let 's see , what else do we have here ? it looks like doc rivers has joined the chorus of nba players and coaches who are fed up with the officials . damian lillard reportedly had a private meeting with blazers owner paul allen in which he urged allen to get his shit together . giannis antetokounmpo tried to undercut his own front office and prevent jason kidd from getting fired at the last second . ",
        "the spurs and kawhi leonard are apparently mad at each other . i think everyone is ready for the all-star break .   "
