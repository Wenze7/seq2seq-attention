        "howie long-short : this is a sports deal as much as it is entertainment play for dis ; with + / - 40 % of the deal 's value tied up in the rsns . fans consider rsns to be their most valuable cable channel and the 5th most important channel within their entire cable bundle . they also command the 2nd highest monthly fees within a cable bundle , so espn certainly acquired quality content . murdoch , of course , is n't nearly as high on rsn 's ; he 's watched broadcasting rights rise at a faster rate than affiliate revenue can grow .

        "assuming the deal is approved by antitrust regulators , foxa shareholders will receive 0.2745 dis shares for each share they own . dis shares closed at $ 110.57 on thursday . fan marino : dis is launching its ott service , espn + , in ' 18 . when the existing rsn contracts expire , look for the wwl to pursue streaming rights for those 5,500 local broadcasts . that 's the valuable content it needs to draw subscribers to the new platform . if you live in detroit and can get wings , tigers and pistons games on espn + , and lions games on yahoo! ; there is no longer a need to subscribe to a cable bundle .

        "espn , pro sports franchises prop up bowl systemhistorically , bowl games were put on by local non-profit civic organizations looking to drum up tourism business ; but since the introduction of the bcs in ' 98 , fan interest in attending non-bcs/nyd 6 bowl games has declined . depressed ticket and corporate sponsorship sales , combined with rising production costs led many non-profit game organizers to sell over the last 20 years . media networks and professional sports franchises have been beneficiaries , picking up the games at a discount ; espn treating the games as valuable programming content to sell advertising , while teams like the lions , 49ers and yankees rely on existing resources to turn a profit . ",
        "howie long-short : rights holders are n't the only ones making money in a bowl system that no longer relies on gate receipts . conferences have also gained from the change in business model , generating $ 517 million in net income last season . $ 422 million comes directly from the playoff system , which espn pays $ 470 million/year to broadcast . it 's not an exaggeration to say espn is propping up the entire bowl system . fan marino : bowl attendance has declined 9 years running , with average attendance in ’16 the lowest since the 40 's ; but that stat is misleading . ",
        "the number of games has grown from 18 in ’96 to 40 in ' 17 . as you dilute the quality of teams/play , you are going to lose the audience . there wo n't be any drop in the cost of 2018 cfb playoff tickets . according to ticketiq , a leading primary and secondary ticketing distributor for rights holders , prices to this season 's semifinals are up from $ 398 and $ 221 last season ; to $ 709 and $ 616 this year . note : bowl season kicks off tomorrow , with 6 games on the slate .

        "insinuated the nfl was to blame saying , `` the nfl has hurt wing stores '' ; basing the comment on reports received from `` wing places we service '' , not his own observations . just last month , papa john 's ceo john schnatter blamed his company 's disappointing results on the league 's handling of anthem protests . wingstop inc. . said it had not seen any impact related to declining football viewership . howie long-short : safm 's disappointing earnings report sent shares tumbling 13 % to $ 145.85 at thursday 's close ; the company 's biggest one-day decline since 2004 . ",
        "despite the drop , shares of the stock are up 86 % over the last 12 months . fan marino : scott van pelt was asked about his thoughts on people saying they 've cancelled espn . they align with my thoughts on sanderson suggesting people are boycotting chicken wings ; it 's simply an absurd notion to imply wing consumption and player protests are in any way tied together . `` if you truly wan na boycott the nfl and you wan na boycott espn , the notion that some guy sitting out there , decided , ` you know what , i 'm gon na cut my entire cable package and i 'm gon na sit around at night and read books by candlelight like olden times , that 's not happening .
