        "tim lincecum has fallen greatly from the pitcher that won two straight cy young awards back in 2008-2009 . lincecum was last seen pitching for the angels in 2016 and the results were not good . he had a 9.16 era through his nine starts , and he did not play this past season . however , it seems as if lincecum has n't given up on baseball , as he 's planning a showcase to get himself back in the league . and after posting this picture , there 's no doubt some teams will be interested . for release : yes , this is tim lincecum at @drivelinebb . ",
        "yes , adam ottavino took the picture while training here . yes , tim will throw for teams at a showcase in the near future . no , i have no other information for you . send all communication to kyle@drivelinebaseball . com . pic . twitter . com/0n0cxhvuq8 -- kyleb @ driveline december 19 , 2017 . `` the freak '' is looking ripped in that picture , which must pique the interest of all major league teams . players with lincecum 's resume will always get a look , especially if they 're working extra hard to get in better shape . ",
        "by adding bulk he may be able to capture some of that success again . lincecum is on the wrong side of 30 and it would be a shock if he was able to find the same success that he did earlier in his career . with that said , any fan will be excited if their team signs lincecum because he is fun to watch . it would be a great story if he can even become a serviceable starting pitcher again .
