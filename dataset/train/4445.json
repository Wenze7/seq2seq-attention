        "back in 2006 , sven goran eriksson was forced to defend his sanity to the british media after his decision to include theo walcott in england 's world cup squad . the swedish coach opted to plump for walcott -- then aged 17 years and 53 days -- ahead of jermain defoe , a decision that prompted ridicule in the press . not only had walcott never been capped by the three lions before receiving a call-up , but he 'd never before made a premier league appearance for arsenal , and erkisson sheepishly admitted that he 'd never before seen the forward play . ",
        "it proved to be a costly decision , particularly as michael owen limped out of action during the group stage and an unfit wayne rooney saw red against portugal as england fell in the quarter-finals . as the three lions , impotent in attack , laboured for a goal against the selecao das quinas , eriksson opted not to use walcott ... while defoe and darren bent , who had scored 22 goals for charlton athletic in the preceding campaign , watched on from home . perhaps eriksson harboured hopes that walcott , in time , would become a world-class star and he would receive credit for having the foresight to have placed his faith in him from such a young age . ",
        "almost 12 years on , and you could count walcott 's truly effective games for england on one hand , while he ended his frustrating spell at arsenal by moving onto everton this week . ahead of the 2018 african nations championship , nigeria coach salisu yusuf has largely sidestepped the ridicule aimed at erkisson back in 2006 despite his , ostensibly , even more baffling decision to include wonderkid muhammed nur in his squad . nur , only 15 after being born on december 2 2002 , was included in yusuf 's chan squad despite never yet making an appearance in the nigerian professional football league . ",
        "it 's intriguing that the nigerian press have n't come down as hard on yusuf as the british media did on eriksson all those years ago , for nur , two years younger than walcott was in 2006 , represents an even greater gamble . to date , the starlet 's only experience has come with el-kanemi warriors ' feeder side , and while his opening showing against rwanda -- he was handed a seven-minute cameo after replacing sunday faleye -- was encouraging , does his inclusion risk leaving nigeria short going forward ? `` is a young guy , the youngest in the team , '' yusuf told journalists after the match . ",
        "`` he has great potential , he 's very intelligent and very crafty at times . `` i believe he 'll grow to be a very important player for nigeria . '' that he may become a star is true , but ultimately irrelevant when it comes to picking a squad to win the african nations championship . at least when eriksson picked walcott in 2006 , he did so surely confident in the knowledge that his squad was full of goals . as well as owen and rooney , peter crouch was an attacking option , the kind of which many world cup defences would n't have known how to deal with , while joe cole , david beckham , steven gerrard and frank lampard all offered goals from midfield . ",
        "for a super eagles team where goalscoring may well be a problem , the decision to opt for muhammed ahead of the likes of sikiru olatunbosun or kingsley eduwo , or any mfm fc player , represents a major gamble by the coach . his squad selection has placed significant pressure on the shoulders of anthony okpotu , who may offer intelligent movement and fine finishing , but was fairly comfortably negated by rwanda 's defenders in nigeria 's opener . after struggling to make an impression against the amavubi , how will he fare against libya , or even the likes of morocco , sudan or zambia in the challenges to come ? ",
        "faleye , for all the promise he showed against rwanda , remains inexperienced and will require time to adapt to life with the chan eagles . it was intriguing that , when the moment did come for yusuf to shuffle his pack and introduce fresh legs going forward -- as the amavubi held firm -- he turned to nur and not to gabriel okechukwu . the latter 's inclusion in the nigeria squad has the potential to mitigate for absentees such as olatunbosun and eduwo , with the akwa united forward demonstrating his undisputed qualities -- including finishing and hold-up play -- in the aiteo cup final . ",
        "however , yusuf opted for nur , while okechukwu remained on the bench . in truth , it was an encouraging cameo for the youngster , who appeared remarkably composed and inventive considering his age . like faleye , however , he 's a new face within this team , and while there were moments that alluded to his creativity and instinct , it 's too much to expect the youngster to hit the ground running in morocco . perhaps , unlikely walcott , nur will emerge as a talent worthy of such a gamble one day , but at the time of writing , in a nigeria side that appeared so toothless against rwanda , his inclusion represents a high-risk decision by yusuf ... and one that threatens to leave nigeria short .
