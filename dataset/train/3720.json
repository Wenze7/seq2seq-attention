        "the stock market eased lower on thursday , pulling back from its gains earlier in the week as major benchmarks finished with modest losses of less than half a percent . despite ongoing optimism about corporate earnings , the fear of a possible government shutdown this weekend has some investors nervous about what could be a difficult political environment in washington throughout 2018 in the run-up to the midterm elections . some individual stocks also reacted negatively to specific news affecting their businesses . bp prudhoe bay royalty trust , albemarle , and adtran were among the worst performers on the day . ",
        "below , we 'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly . bp prudhoe bay drops following dividend . shares of bp prudhoe bay royalty trust fell 9 % after the crude oil-focused royalty trust locked in its quarterly distribution to investors . bp prudhoe bay 's payout was substantial , at $ 1.23 per unit , representing about 5 % of its price as of wednesday 's close . the price decline mentioned above was on top of the drop in value stemming from the dividend , indicating that at least some investors were only interested in capturing the greater-than-normal payout and getting out as quickly as possible . ",
        "with investors uncertain about how long the trust will continue to operate and therefore how long they can expect to keep receiving dividend distributions , that caution is warranted . albemarle loses its charge . shares of albemarle dropped 7 % in the wake of continued pressure on stocks related to the lithium market . lithium has been red-hot lately , helping to lift albemarle by more than 175 % over the past couple of years . yet with strong demand for lithium for use in batteries and other applications , rival suppliers are looking at ways to boost production , and that could in turn lead to price cuts that would dampen albemarle 's ability to sustain profit growth . ",
        "with today 's drop , the top lithium producer has seen its shares lose 12 % in just three days , but that 's only a small portion of the gains that long-term shareholders have enjoyed . adtran extends its losses . finally , adtran stock finished down 11.5 % . the networking and communications equipment provider continued to lose ground following the release of its fourth-quarter financial results late tuesday , which included massive sales declines of 22 % and a net loss for the period . the bad news had largely been anticipated , and ceo tom stanton tried to maintain a positive view on adtran 's business prospects , pointing to efforts to help customers make the transition to faster networks . ",
        "nevertheless , with the stock having lost 15 % in just two days , adtran shareholders are having a clear crisis of confidence that the company will need to fight aggressively in order to regain lost ground .   "
