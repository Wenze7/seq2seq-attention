        "kenneth branagh is eager to expand on his role as literary detective hercule poirot by turning author agatha christie 's books into a full `` cinematic universe '' . the dunkirk star portrayed the fictional belgian super sleuth in the recent murder on the orient express remake , and he is expected to return as both actor and director for another turn in a reboot of death on the nile . that project is currently in the early stages of development , but branagh would jump at the opportunity to help bring more of christie 's stories to life on the big screen as part of a `` cinematic universe '' , with various characters making repeated appearances in interlocking films , just like the marvel and dc comics film franchises . ",
        "`` i think there are possibilities , are n't there ? , '' branagh tells the associated press about the idea of weaving a variety of christie 's novels together . `` with 66 books and short stories and plays , she - and she often brings people together in her own books actually , so innately - she enjoyed that . `` you feel as though there is a world - just like with dickens , there 's a complete world that she 's created - certain kinds of characters who live in her world - that i think has real possibilities . '' ",
        "the brit has yet to raise the idea with studio bosses at 20th century fox , but he 's confident it 's already crossed their minds . `` i bet they 've been thinking about it though , '' he smiles . meanwhile , branagh is looking forward to reprising his role as poirot and has teased the possibility of bringing `` old friends '' from the star-studded murder on the orient express cast along for the ride in death on the nile . the murder mystery also featured dame judi dench , johnny depp , penelope cruz , michelle pfeiffer , and daisy ridley . ",
        "christie 's death on the nile , which was originally released as a novel in 1937 , was previously adapted into a movie in 1978 , with peter ustinov , bette davis , mia farrow , and maggie smith leading the cast .   "
