        "cartoon commentary on president xi 's southeast asia trip . the year 2017 saw china playing a more effective role in global governance , as it continued making efforts to maintain peace and strengthen communication among countries . at a time when regional conflicts , slow economic development and erratic diplomacy have aggravated global uncertainties , china remains committed to promoting cooperation for the betterment of the world . china has gone to great lengths to help maintain regional peace and cooperation . sticking to the principle of peaceful coexistence and mutual benefit , china has strengthened its ties with russia , the european union and the united states . ",
        "for instance , during us president donald trump 's state visit to china in november , the two countries `` shelved '' their disputes and agreed to deepen win-win cooperation in more areas of mutual benefit . on regional issues , china promoted multilateral talks to help resolve the korean peninsula , syria , afghanistan and middle east issues . since china is committed to helping build a community of shared future in its neighborhood , soon after the 19th national congress of the communist party of china in october , president xi jinping , also general secretary of the cpc central committee , paid state visits to vietnam and laos to promote regional development . ",
        "such diplomatic efforts have helped china to improve its ties with the other neighbors , too , including the republic of korea , japan and india . besides , as a responsible power , china has strove to advance communication and development , in order to promote globalization and improve global governance . and its belt and road initiative is the highlight of its contributions to the world . since xi proposed the belt and road initiative in 2013 , china has signed , as part of the initiative , cooperation agreements with 80 countries and organizations , carried out industrial cooperation with more than 30 countries , and helped build 75 economic and trade cooperation zones in 24 countries . ",
        "chinese companies ' investments in the countries involved in the belt and road initiative have crossed $ 50 billion and created about 180,000 jobs . representatives from 130 countries , including 29 heads of state or government , and scores of international organizations participated in the belt and road forum for international cooperation in beijing in may , where more than 270 projects aimed at strengthening the international cooperation network were finalized . china has shared its development experiences with the rest of the world and offered `` chinese solutions '' to global problems to help the international community boost global economic growth . ",
        "also , the chinese dream of national rejuvenation is directly connected with the development of the world . addressing the world economic forum in davos , switzerland , in january , xi called for innovative patterns of development , open cooperation and fairer global governance . and in geneva , he put forward the concept of a community of shared future for humankind , drawing worldwide praise . in september , the 9th brics summit in xiamen , east china 's fujian province , not only lifted the level of economic , security , cultural and communication cooperation , but also proposed a `` brics-plus '' mode of communication between developing countries and emerging markets to enhance cooperation among asian , middle east , african and latin american countries . ",
        "as such , the brics summit has become a new platform for south-south cooperation . and from nov 30 to dec 3 , beijing hosted the first cpc in dialogue with world political parties high-level meeting , a historic event where the cpc and political parties from across the world shared their experiences . addressing the opening session of the meeting , xi said the cpc will work to improve the life and livelihood of the chinese people and realize the chinese dream , as well as to build a community of shared future for humankind . it is thus clear china has been shouldering more responsibilities in global governance . ",
        "and while its development initiatives are yielding fruits , its efforts to maintain regional and global peace have helped safeguard its sovereignty and national interests . the author is jean monnet chair professor at renmin university of china .   "
