        "`` leadership requires two things : a vision of the world that does not yet exist and the ability to communicate it . '' -- simon sinek , start with why : how great leaders inspire everyone to take actiontwo years ago i purchased an dot-to-dot book for adults . mostly , i looked at the front cover and saw the finished product and decided i wanted to create that picture . `` this is cool , '' i affirmed myself . yet , to this day , it remains untouched . i loved the vision but joining the dots myself was too much to ask . ",
        "working with a raft of different organisations , i often hear similar rhetoric from the mouths of leaders : `` ... this way , they 'll get the flavour of what we 're trying to do . '' `` through this workshop , i want everyone onboard with what our focus is for the year . '' `` through looking at this data , they 'll see the need for xyz . '' can you see the problem here ? the leader is expecting his/her staff to join the dots in order to work out the vision , mission and direction of the organisation . ",
        "or , worse , expecting someone else to communicate it for them . it 's actually more than how this is viewed from the perspective of the staff ; there 's a waft of gingerliness , a touch of hesitancy like a wet-fish handshake , the sound of being in a muddle . as a leader , you may very well have lucid ambitions but , unless you communicate them explicitly with others , it 'll be assumed that the direction does n't exist or does n't matter . make 2018 the year you start communicating the vision , mission and directions clearly . ",
        "have your vision , mission and direction obvious and comprehendible . all of these are important . invest time in collecting and sorting data about the current state of your organisation and the future of your industry in order to create a vision , mission and direction that makes sense and is worth believing in . allow time for iterations of the language and slight pivots as new information comes to hand and feedback from stakeholders is accounted for before committing to one version . your mission should explain , in lay terms what everyone is working towards now . ",
        "the vision is focussed into the future . the directions are your true north statements . how might you ensure your ambitions are obvious , comprehendible and visible in the physical and virtual spaces of your organisation ? 2 . communicate the vision , mission and direction . there 's something about a new year that has people expectant . staff are expecting to be inspired afresh and this is a prime moment to explicitly present the vision , mission and directions for 2018 and beyond . use this time to explain how the statements were crafted , the impact these ambitions will have and why this course is the best for the organisation , it 's staff and the clients . ",
        "do more than speak the vision , mission and direction . model your belief in the vision , mission and direction . i worked for a boss who had a vision for de-siloed practice and a mission for cross-pollinisation of ideas and so he moved out of his office and hot-desked . he showed his commitment to the vision and mission through that direction . how might you show your belief in your organisation 's ambitions in 2018 ? 3 . revisit the vision , mission and directions throughout the year . it 's annoying but people forget stuff . ",
        "too easily we get caught up in our everyday tasks . we 're too busy checking our emails on our phones when crossing the street to look where we 're actually going . plan intervals through the year in which you can share progress and remind people of the ambitions . finish the year by celebrating the progress made so far and the amazing impact that has been made so people are ready for a fresh mission to be set the following year . when , next year , might you ensure that you revisit the mission , vision and directions ? ",
        "start 2018 well . i , and our team at notosh , wish you all the best over the festive season and a joyful and peaceful new year . meanwhile , i 've a massive dot-to-dot book if anyone would like it .   "
