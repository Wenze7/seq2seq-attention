        "living with health anxiety -- a kind of generalized anxiety disorder that focuses on the fear of becoming ill -- is a real , serious issue , but `` hypochondria , '' as it used to be called , is often stigmatized as a symptom of an overactive imagination , or a kind of attention-seeking behavior . health anxiety or illness anxiety , which can encompass general anxiety as well as somatic symptom disorder , in which symptoms appear without any underlying medical reason , affects people of all genders and ages , and is thought to be experienced by between 1 and 3 percent of the adult population . ",
        "but throughout history , anxiety , and particularly health anxiety , was viewed through a sexist , stereotypical , and stigmatizing lens : health anxiety was thought of primarily as a women 's issue , and one of the potential consequences of that association affects how women get healthcare even today . women often face medical bias when seeking help for their health , from medical professionals underestimating their levels of pain to doctors insisting they 're making their symptoms up . as many women know , this is not rooted in any proven truth ; while women do go to see their doctors more , they also tend to live longer and are more likely to utilize medical services . ",
        "but the roots of not believing women when they declare that they 're in pain are found in some very ancient and profoundly misogynistic ideas . in ancient greek medicine , `` hypochondria '' was n't thought of as anxiety is today ; in fact , it was associated with the abdomen , not the brain . but what 's interesting is that in ancient greece , only men were thought to be afflicted . psychotherapist susan baur , who wrote a history of hypochondria called hypochondria : woeful imaginings , explains that the idea first pops up in the work of the ancient greek physician hippocrates , to refer to problems with the region under the ribs . ",
        "eventually it became associated with mental states too , in the medieval period , but it was still seen as a problem only for men . jan steen/wikimedia commonswomen , instead , were diagnosed with hysteria , aka a wandering uterus , that caused anxiety , hallucinations , and sexual desire . hysteria , or `` having the vapors '' , was in many ways identical to hypochondria in men , at least up until the 19th century in europe . a doctor in 1708 writes of `` hysterical women and hypochondriac men . '' hypochondria and melancholy were thought to come from things like `` intense thinking '' and `` too much study '' and were believed to be rooted in men 's overuse of their rational brains , while women 's hysteria was thought to come from their `` delicacy '' and general nervous weakness . ",
        "they were also divided by gendered theories about emotions : an 18th century french doctor , jean-baptiste louyer-villermay , said that men were more inclined to feel ambition and hate , predisposing them to melancholia and hypochondria , while women felt love , making them hysterics . if you 're getting astonishingly sexist vibes , you 're not wrong . wikimedia commonsbut then the 19th century happened , and hysteria and hypochondria as categories began to be less gender-specific . the barriers , historians think , broke down because it became more fashionable for both men and women of the upper class to be `` sensitive '' and `` nervous , '' with people calling it a mark of higher breeding . ",
        "it was ok to say you were acutely affected by mysterious illnesses , or worried about catching them . everybody from dickens to proust to edgar allan poe to charlotte brontë had a reputation for being anxious about their health , or were known to be ill . hypochondria , historians barbara ehrenreich and deidre english have written , seemed to become a mark of status for rich women in the 19th century . `` boredom and confinement '' as part of their everyday lives , they say , meant that women often became part of a `` morbid cult of hypochondria or invalidism . '' ",
        "this was obviously hugely ableist , erasing the difficult experiences of non-upperclass people with physical disabilities at that time , and giving chronic illness a fashionable aura . eventually , however , baur argues , hypochondria crossed class lines and became seen as an illness that was experienced by all , but for a while , it was seen in the public consciousness as exclusively confined to rich women . gustave léonard de jonghe/wikimedia commonsthe way health anxiety came to be associated with women , with sigmund freud theorizing that women made up mental illnesses in particular to attempt to gain `` privileges '' like attention and space to think , evolved into one form of what we call medical bias today -- the systematic disbelieving of women 's pain . ",
        "medical bias and the practice of undervaluing or dismissing women 's medical complaints is a big deal . it means women can wait long periods for diagnosis for extremely painful conditions like endometriosis , and risk the serious health consequences of underestimated symptoms and untreated issues . and that 's not even touching the pretty miserable mental health issues that can be caused by systematically not being believed by doctors . sexism runs pretty deep in the way we view illness , including anxiety , but the tie between illness anxiety and gender is an entirely illusory one that continues to be damaging to people of all genders today .
