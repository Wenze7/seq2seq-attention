        "this year in august , i turned 20 . it 's been two complete decades of my life . living my life in a small town in rajasthan and keeping up with my studies , work and passion . life so far has been generous to me and filled with achievements , opportunities and failures . i wo n't say i have seen it all but i have experienced enough to survive in this nasty world . when socrates heard that the oracle had made such a comment , he believed that the statement was wrong . socrates said : `` i know one thing : that i know nothing . '' ",
        "how can the smartest man on earth know nothing ? i heard this paradoxical wisdom for the first time from my school teacher when i was 14 or 15 . that humility made such an impact on me that i used socrates 's quote as my learning strategy . also , all the 19 lessons are not based on my beliefs of life or what life should look like . however , there are more of learning from my own experiences . moreover , this is going to be a long series broken into 2 -- 3 small articles to have in depth analysis of each one of those lessons . ",
        "lessons i learnt : take initiative / being proactive : if you have to take away one simple lesson from this article , grab this one . you must have heard many time before . by being proactive and taking initiative you do something that others are n't doing . you take responsibility of your own situation and do stuff . you ask and you do stuff instead of waiting for things to happen . do n't just sit there , do something . without action , there is no outcome . most people live a reactive life . let 's talk about reactive life . ",
        "in simple words it is a life lived based on events happening around . people do stuff only when they are being asked to do it . reactive life moves from outside to inside . something happens on the outside and then we perform our reactive actions to it . on the other hand , proactive approach focuses on doing stuff at first and letting the outside world react to it . it 's about taking the first step towards your goal . achieving your goals by actually doing stuff and not waiting for things to happen . do n't let things happen , instead make things happen . ",
        "plan for things : planning is utmost important trait of an organized person . thinking about all the possible outcomes of situation , knowing what to do next , having a clear goal in mind -- it all comes in planning . do not procrastinate : kabir once said `` do n't push things on tomorrow , which can be done now . '' believe me this is a lifesaving advice . although , i still struggle with this problem and assume that there 's a lot to improve . when i compare myself from my younger self , i realize that i made quite a progress in it . ",
        "continuous improvement and learning : this one is really important . do you see people doing same stuff since years and still making same mistakes ? yes , that 's true with a lot of us . as a result , people do n't really grow . they keep doing same stuff for their lives . if you want to make a successful career , i realized this one habit / skill is what makes the most difference . workers who learn the ability to improve and learn are clearly see an upward moving graph in their careers instead of others who do n't have such learning mindset . ",
        "on the other hand , the other type struggle with their career growth and success . never put your time in something that you do n't love : sometimes we get stuck into things and work that we do n't love or are interested in doing . this is simply killing your time . seriously , you will never get anything out of it . i am not saying that you will not learn new things . but if you seek fulfilment with your work , then this is not your way . if you see it two three years down the line , you will not appreciate efforts and time that you invest . ",
        "this is not the end of it . more articles in the series will be coming forward . stay tuned . worth sharing ? please feel free to üëè üëè üëè it up . it helps more people find it .   "
