        "from behind his maroon helmet saturday night , patrick atkinson smiled at his best friend and teammate of a decade . the clock was ticking . years of sweat , heartbreak and work were finally about to pay off . some 250 miles away , a bar manager displaced by hurricane harvey in northwest harris county ignored her family 's christmas gift exchange , her eyes drawn to the cellphone screen in her palm . nearby , in jersey village , two sisters from philadelphia waited anxiously to celebrate a historic night for the school district that now employs them as grade-school teachers . ",
        "and then , just like that , the 78-year wait was over . a 51-35 victory over waco midway brought cy-fair high school - as well as the state 's third largest school district - its first state football championship . `` it was like i was in shock , '' atkinson , a linebacker , said of the win at arlington 's at&t stadium . `` it was a long road to get here . `` indeed . cy-fair 's first game of the season was cancelled because of harvey , and three months later , many cypress residents are still recovering from the storm . ",
        "players knew what was at stake saturday , `` this championship was n't just about football , '' said cornerback erick hallett . `` it was for everybody in cypress . `` shannon harris , 51 , agreed . some 120 days after harvey , she and her husband , bill , are still living in a trailer behind their sports bar , the texas tavern . cy-fair 's win wo n't fix their home . but , much like the houston astros ' world series win , the victory is a nice , albeit short , distraction from the last few months . ",
        "on saturday , she unwrapped christmas gifts at her sister-in-law 's home , an outing she said was dominated by talk about cy-fair 's championship game . `` i 'm so thrilled , '' shannon harris said . `` this community was just hit so hard . `` the team 's core group of players , meanwhile , have shared a sideline since their days at hamilton middle school and some even since elementary school . they 've lost one game since first teaming up in 7th-grade - a string of dominance that culminated this year with an undefeated season and uil 6a division ii state title . ",
        "`` this group of kids has been together for so long , '' said steve bell , whose son kyle was named player of the title game . `` they 've bonded so well - not just as teammates , but really just as family . '' `` they have each others backs , 100 percent , '' he said . `` and it 's not just during the football season . it 's been throughout this journey from the 7th grade on . '' ` it was their turn ` on sunday morning , rev. joel mckinnon delivered his first christmas eve sermon to a noticeably small congregation at cypress united methodist church . ",
        "about 350 parishioners attended the 10 a. m. service . he was expecting 500 , but said many were likely too tired from last night 's victory to make the early sermon . not that he minded . the church has long been attended by cy-fair students and athletes , and last week his parishioners made a point to `` lift up '' the team in prayer ahead of their final playoff games . `` this is huge , '' he said of the win . `` it 's a big deal . with everything that cypress has been through ... we just needed something that could take our minds off all of that . ",
        "`` nearby , at the texas tavern , cy-fair alumnus clayton kemp , 37 , briefly reminisced on his own football days , when championships were pipe dreams , and the team 's rare victories were celebrated at the sonic just down cypress north houston road . `` we just played to play , '' he said of his two-year stint as a wide receiver . `` we knew we did n't have a chance . `` even then , though , the community rallied around its team , with a loyal cohort of cypress residents following the team obsessively . ",
        "kenneth nieswiadomy , 67 , considers himself one such cy-fair superfan . he 's watched nearly every team game since moving to cypress with his wife in 1979 . his nephew played on the 1985 team that made it to the semifinals , the closest the school had previously come to a title . `` we just get so excited when we watch them , '' he said . `` they were destined to win . it was their turn . `` through good and badfor georgina baba , who teaches kindergarten at bang elementary school , the win was a reminder of the resilience of the district and its students . ",
        "she watched the game saturday with her sister , who like her moved to cypress from just outside philadelphia to teach in the district . `` after hurricane harvey hit , many people were affected and the community rallied together , '' baba said . `` this win solidified our amazing community . through the good and bad , we will always rally around each other . `` harris , meanwhile , was wondering about a parade . from a bar stool inside the texas tavern , she pointed outward to cypress north houston road , which she said would make for a perfect parade route . ",
        "the district has n't announced specific celebration plans yet . but harris will be ready when they do . `` this community is waiting to rally for them , '' she said . `` we 're just so , so proud . ''   "
