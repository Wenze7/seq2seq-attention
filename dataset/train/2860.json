        "the day has finally come -- microsoft has retired its groove music streaming service across all platforms . back in october of last year , microsoft announced it was winding down support for its `` groove music pass '' , and all features related to streaming and purchasing content via the groove music app . since its formal debut in 2015 , with the release of windows 10 , microsoft 's music streaming service failed to gain traction among strong competition . this eventually led to microsoft scheduling a shut-down of the service for december 31 , 2017 . while a new year passed and groove music was still fully operational , as of january 2 , the online elements of the app have been shut down entirely . ",
        "music can no longer be streamed through groove apps , songs can no longer be purchased from the microsoft store and music video playback has been shuttered . radio , explore and recommended features of the app have also been removed . by opening the microsoft store app on any windows 10 device , users will now be greeted by a new menu , lacking the music tab . microsoft recommends its groove music users move to spotify , with apps now available across windows 10 devices . for remaining groove music users , the local playback features of the app still remain functional following the shutdown . ",
        "the app also still supports streaming via onedrive , which allows local files to be played across various devices . but for those looking for a full-fledged music experience , better services can be found elsewhere . microsoft recommends users switch to spotify , with a partnership between the two companies that allows users to seamlessly migrate to the service . with apps across windows 10 , xbox one and mobile devices , the service is among the most universal on the market . if spotify is n't for you , make sure to take a look at our list of groove music replacements for pc .
