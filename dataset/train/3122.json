        "follow cbsmiami . com : facebook | twittercoconut grove -- a parking lot in coconut grove looks like sailboat showroom with racing boats getting ready for the sailing world cup series . nearby , there 's a junkyard of damaged boats left over by irma . drive down south bayshore drive and there 's an eyesore of damaged boats that sticks out like a sore thumb . the 27th avenue ramp is a constant reminder of hurricane irma . residents in the area are n't exactly happy to see the rusty and barnacle-filled vessels day in and day out . ",
        "`` yea the boat graveyard is a big eyesore . you ca n't even walk around this area . it seems like after the storm it was just boats . it 's an eye sore . they should get rid of them , '' said resident vish canaran . just a few yards away , racing boats are getting ready for the 2018 world cup series which brings olympic level competition to the area . charles heimler is in town for the event and is disappointed with the situation . `` sailing clubs here had docks damaged , all the marinas damaged . ",
        "they really lagged behind in getting anything back up to where it should be along the waterfront , '' said heimler . but why are the boats there ? according to a statement released by the city of miami back in november , it says it 's `` currently serving as a staging area for sunken vessels and marine debris removal . the u. s. coast guard and the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission are working in conjunction with the city of miami on this effort . '' cbs4 's mike cugno reached out to the city of miami for more information as to when these boats will be removed but , so far , they have not responded . "
