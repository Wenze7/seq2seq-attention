        "two out of three judges on a brazil appeals court have voted to uphold a graft sentence against former president luiz inacio lula da silva , a ruling that could prevent him from running in this year 's general election . barring a request by the third judge to delay his vote , the court will uphold lula 's conviction for money-laundering and corruption for having accepted an upgrade to a beach-side apartment from a construction company in exchange for favors . the ex-president has denied wrongdoing , saying the charges are politically motivated . brazilian assets including the currency accelerated gains as judge leandro paulsen read his arguments against the former head of state . ",
        "the second vote against lula was key because it rules out the possibility of an acquittal , which would be the worst-case scenario for markets , according to tullett prebon brasil currency trading head italo abucater . lula personally benefited from bribery , said judge paulsen , adding that the ex-president controlled the corruption scheme at state-run oil company petrobras . there was more than enough evidence to show that he perpetuated the scheme , he said . paulsen agreed with the the first judge that lula 's nine and a half year sentence should be extended to over 12 years . ",
        "click here for a quicktake q&a with more detail on the trialat stake is not only the legacy of the 72 year-old former union leader , but also the future of latin america 's largest economy . with elections scheduled in october , lula leads opinion polls and is pledging to roll back the market-friendly reforms of current president michel temer . while wednesday 's verdict would n't rule lula out of the running for good , it does represent a significant blow to his chances . the majority of investors expect a 3 to 0 tally against the former head of state . ",
        "while lula was a wall street favorite during his two terms in office from 2003 to 2010 , his opposition to temer 's polices including the deregulation of the labor market and implementation of public spending caps has spooked many investors . on the eve of the trial , a defiant lula reinforced investor fears , telling a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters that he did n't need the financial market anyway . security has been tight around the court house in porto alegre with sharpshooters on rooftops , naval ships patrolling nearby waters , and police cordoning off an area some 2.5 kilometers wide to keep protesters at arms length . ",
        "thousands of lula 's supporters camped out in the city during the trial . yet brazilian society is deeply divided over lula , who is viewed as a savior of the poor to some , and a reckless populist to others . the latest datafolha survey showed 36 percent of voters would back him in october 's election , roughly double that of his nearest rival , right-wing deputy jair bolsonaro . but 39 percent of those questioned in the same survey said they would not consider voting for him under any circumstances . while by law anyone with a criminal conviction upheld in an appellate court can not run for elected office , a likely appeal by lula would buy him time . ",
        "leaders of the workers ' party say they will symbolically launch lula 's candidacy on thursday , regardless of the outcome of the trial . -- with assistance by vinicius andrade .   "
