",
        "`` yes , maybe tomorrow , '' pochettino told reporters at his pre-match press conference when asked if he would make changes to his starting line up to take on the recently-promoted southerners . `` we are assessing the players , we need to make good decisions . the competition is tough and we have a lot of games ahead . i am sure i will make some changes . `` but the argentine refused to confirm whether or not erik lamela would start against the seagulls after three consecutive appearances off the bench in the league . the 25-year-old is available for just Â£ 6.3 m in the official fpl game after missing the 13 games of the season and could represent a massive bargain if he can rediscover his playmaking form . ",
