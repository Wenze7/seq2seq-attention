        "`` defense news '' `` that attitude should endear lord to sen. john mccain , the arizona republican who chairs the sasc . mccain often witnesses at his hearings if they know of anyone who had been fired for famously over-budget programs like the f-35 joint strike fighter of the army 's win-t tactical it network . '' _______________________________________________________________ `` ellen lord , the undersecretary of defense for acquisition , technology and logistics , told the senate armed services committee thursday that she intends to demand a higher level of accountability from program managers if their acquisition program goes away . ",
        "`` we as a team are working very closely together to look at functions and individuals in and in the services , the duties they are required to perform , and are determining whether or not we have the right people in the right slots , '' lord said , before saying she did not want to `` talk about individuals '' in a public forum but would brief the sasc in a future closed hearing if they required more details . `` i will take action if there are issues , no question about it , '' lord told reporters after the hearing .

        "`` there are constraints when you come into a government job -- you can not move anybody for 120 days . and if you check on my 120 days , it was just very recently . '' asked if that meant the department should expect personnel movements related to accountability , lord stated `` i think you should expect to see some movements .

",
        "he added that workforce training is also key , because `` if we have n't done the efforts to train them , certify them and make sure they are capable , then it 's hard to hold them accountable . that 's our fault , if we have n't given them the skills to actually be successful .
