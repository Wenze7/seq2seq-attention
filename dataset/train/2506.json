        "the birmingham city boss says there are no quick fixes at the clubsteve cotterill admitted there are no ` quick-fixes ' to birmingham city 's championship travails . the blues boss felt his side did not deserve to lose to qpr , who secured their first away victory in ten months thanks to the first two goals of jack robinson 's senior career . the reverse , combined with wins for both sunderland and burton , dumped blues at the bottom of the table . and cotterill says all they can do is try to work their way out of it . ",
        "asked if he felt blues are now in a perilous position , cotterill did not sugar coat the issue . `` we were in one before today , '' he said . `` i think that when i came in here we were second bottom , it was a starting point to get out of it . `` nothing changes as regards that , as regards work ethic , whatever you do . birmingham city player ratings : sam gallagher gets a 7 , the other scores are n't that high after qpr defeat `` obviously it makes it worse because you look at it and then you are bottom , i think at one stage we were out of it when we were drawing were n't we ? ",
        "`` then all of sudden a goal goes in and it drops you down one . `` for sure it is close , we have just got to work even harder at getting ourselves out of there . `` you guys have seen it longer than i have here . `` some of the problems we had last year , some of the problems we have had at the start of this year - we have still got here under me . `` we are trying hard and we are going to try even harder - if that 's possible - to get ourselves away from where we are . ",
        "`` we have go keep working hard on what we are doing because there is no quick fix to this . '' cotterill felt his team was hampered by anxiety in the first half - particularly after robinson scored from a set-piece in the 17th minute . `` in the first half we were nervous again and in the second half i think we let our anxiety go a little , the crowd were really upbeat again for us - that drives us on . `` it 's so important the crowd , they drove us on , we deservedly got the equaliser . ",
        "`` then we made an attacking substitution , flipped the midfield a little bit , put jacques in there and i thought we were going to go on and win the game . i really did . `` they were right on the back foot , they have ended up getting a corner from the clearance . `` we have defended the first phase but we have n't defended the second phase . `` we have actually been good at defending corners and good at defending wide free kicks . ''   "
