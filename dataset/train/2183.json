        "tennis - the frenchman analyzed his loss to the swissrichard gasquet lost to roger federer in straight sets , 6-2 7-5 6-4 . the frenchman was pretty disappointed at the end , as he lost his 17th match on 19 played in career to the swiss . itwas a difficult first set , he started well , gasquet said . he was stronger . in the second set there was 30-all every time , but he has that ability every time to serve on the line at 200km/h . the serve is an unbelievable weapon in his game , he has an enormous precision . ",
        "we know that the court is like last year , fast , and the ball bounces very less . its perfect for his game , and in the third set it was a pity , we had close points and he played in an unbelievable way . i moved well . i am disappointed that i didnt manage to win even a set . its frustrating . he is the best ever , without any doubt . its frustrating . it hurts to lose every time . phsyically i am doing well . you know that you can improve your game and when you play that way , your level raises . ",
        "you cant play at tonights level if you are not at the top . the ball is going so fast . i am healrhy and motivated . story by lequipe .   "
