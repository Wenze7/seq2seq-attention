        "daniel radcliffe has been our harry potter since the very beginning . but will he ever return to the role or is his time with harry done forever ? there is a lot of talk surrounding the return of daniel radcliffe as harry potter . with the fantastic beasts and where to find them series as well as harry potter and the cursed child , many are questioning whether or not any of the original trio will come back and make more movies . look , we all loved daniel as harry . yes , i personally was annoyed that he did n't have green eyes and he was n't tall enough but he was still my harry . ",
        "so would i love for him to take on the role of the boy who lived once again ? yes , of course . the thing about these movies are that they brought our favorites to life . we got to see our characters on our screens and everything was just as magical as we thought it to be when we read the series . so if daniel radcliffe wanted to come back and either play harry on broadway or in a movie again , it 'd be amazing . granted , we have n't heard talk of a cursed child movie yet but that has to be the next step right ? ",
        "why not bring the continuation to the big screen so everyone can enjoy it who could n't get to london or new york to see it ? hopefully that happens and hopefully daniel radcliffe is willing to do it ! so is this the end of the road for daniel as the boy who lived or do you think he 'll take over playing harry either on broadway in harry potter and the cursed child or in the film version ? sound off in the comments below and let us know what you think ! more from wizards and whatnot the score is important to the harry potter series but what about a soundtrack ?
