        "before i adopted a vegan lifestyle , like with much of the unknown , i perceived the possibilities very one dimensionally . to ` go vegan ' was an unnecessarily gruelling challenge , an affront to cultural traditions , a plea for attention or some combination of the three . the people i knew who were vegan did not espouse views that were particularly close to my heart and , if anything , the visible vegan movement was one of privileged white trustafarians able to throw themselves in front of police picket lines , safe in the knowledge their human rights are sacrosanct and never in fear of being violated . ",
        "against a societal backdrop of black lives consistently not mattering , brexit , trump , the rise of the right and an ever-unraveling social fabric from top to bottom , it is hard for the people who are prey to these traumatic human narratives to find redemption through humility and humanity toward animals . put the lives of others ahead of your own marginalised existence . put yourselves singularly in harms way to protect the animals globally . have n't we , the children of the african diaspora , been sold this story before ? whether it be the gospel according to christian missionaries , the governance according to colonial powers or the game according to the gatekeepers of western society , we are consistently bit part players in our own stories . ",
        "so when the idea of veganism was first broached to me by a couple of property heiresses over matcha lattes before they ` summered ' in mykonos , as much as i was seduced by their instagrammable physiques , i was totally turned off at the thought of their rarified company . if the requirements of ` being a vegan ' were deep family pockets , far-flung yoga events and organic cold-pressed juice bars then it was n't for me or the people i 've grown up with . however ... as an experienced human rights activist , especially pertaining to the plight of black people in the uk , i have long understood the terminal damage that our collective purchasing decisions are making to the economic potential of our communities . ",
        "whether it be cheap chicken and chips after school or expensive disposable fashions for ` turning up ' , there is a common theme of reactionary consumption as opposed to considered investment . to effect a paradigm shift amongst groups of people who do not necessarily share cultural commonality but have a blanket political identity is limited to that racialised common denominator . this positioning , as outliers , is the cornerstone of black vegan philosophy as i have come to understand it . this is stripping away the mantras of products we are sold and reclaiming our intrinsic selves . ",
        "reminding ourselves of our spiritual identities rather than our economic values . with an open and inquisitive mind it becomes extremely obvious that consumption is not our primary objective as humans . stuff serves it 's distractionary purpose of eroding human connection which in turn weakens our collective consciousness . the long and short of this is a philosophy akin to something our ancestors would have been more familiar with . long before the machinations of imperial globalisation began commoditising and harvesting all of the world 's natural resources , indigenous communities were thriving in all the regions they had settled . ",
        "there were relationships of respect with the environment and when animals were sacrificed -- whether for meat or for ritual -- it was recognised with revery and there were blessings and libations to commemorate this . respect , simplicity , empathy , freedom , communication , love -- concepts that are antithetical to the tenets of modern politics and finance . however , these are the building blocks of human capital and the black vegan mandate is very much about rediscovering our connection to each other , taking individual and collective responsibility for our societal positioning and drawing on our cultural capital to be thought leaders and activists for good . ",
        "the dietary element of my personal vegan journey is less of a talking point than i had first thought it would be . sure , it can still be occasionally troublesome when places you visit do n't sufficiently cater to your dietary requirements but to learn restraint through conscientiousness has been a worthy reward . i used to be greedy and would continue eating long after i knew i was full because i could . my food habits were very much guided by consumption and not survival . i always got the ` - itis ' , constantly suffered from reflux and assumed that constant stomach-aches were part and parcel of being a man in his thirties . ",
        "in retrospect , it was a wretched existence but the food products i was consuming were drugs to which i was addicted hence my appetite had increased to such levels to satiate my need for a high . since being vegan , my body has retrained my mind and has dialled down my consumption habits considerably . by having a firewall on what i will and will not put into my body , by way of a strict criteria , has changed me from a general feed to a closed group . so much toxic noise is gone and my body needs to expend less energy in processing the inbound stream . ",
        "the irony is not lost on me that this allegory is what current politicians refer to as ` a sensible immigration policy ' but whilst prepared to impose it on arbitrary land borders , they do not implement or advocate it personally as a more effective way of ` saving our people ' . i feel so many of the answers to the ails of modern life can be found on the pathway of the conscious vegan journey . it must begin from within , be honest in intention and with the humility to accept that what you had believed before was ill-informed . ",
        "from this starting point , the world becomes a very different place with very different opportunities ripe for the taking . i am doing everything i can now to impress and inspire the next generation of vegans to be the change that means we no longer need to be named . i can not stress enough that we can not build the world of tomorrow with the architects of the past . the baton is in all of our hands now to ensure that there is a tomorrow for our children and all of theirs to come . jay brave Â© 2017 .
