        "toward the end of 2017 , we saw partial recovery in oil prices . solid demand growth , declining inventories and the extension of opec-led supply cuts until the end of 2018 is keeping the market steady and supporting strong uptrend . while there might be a number of winners within the energy sector , refiners have stood out amid weakness in the commodity prices . moreover , the overhaul of the nation 's tax code is expected to benefit the refiners . with the implementation of the law , the corporate income tax will be lowered from 35 % to 21 % , which will benefit the refiners . ",
        "this is because unlike crude producers and equipment makers who have been victims of stubborn low oil price environment and struggled to generate positive cash flows , refiners have been among the handful of energy sub industries displaying strength during the shaky period . the business of downstream players is negatively correlated with crude prices . this is because the companies use oil as an input from which they derive refined petroleum products like gasoline , the prime transportation fuel in the united states . hence , lower the oil price , higher will be their profits . therefore , the income from converting crude into gasoline and diesel -- also known as refining margin or crack spread -- has been going up over the past few quarters . ",
        "consequently , these companies -- having generated positive income before taxes -- are in a much better shape to take advantage of the current situation . consequently , shares of the major downstream operators have been rising lately . in this context , we put the spotlight on two of the refining players -- phillips 66 psx and valero energy corporation vlo -- with market caps of $ 50.92 billion and $ 38.28 billion , respectively . since both stocks currently carry a zacks rank # 3 , it will be interesting to see which stock is better positioned in terms of fundamentals .
