        "a dutch court monday scrapped a 116,000-euro fine slapped on celebrated violinist andre rieu for allegedly allowing children to perform past a late night limit set by law . `` the court finds the reasons for the fine unfounded , '' the limburg district court said , adding `` there are too few indications that rieu employed the children . `` rieu 's lawyers in october said they were appealing the `` absurdly high '' fine after a group of young romanian pan flute players were on stage until midnight during a series of concerts in 2015 . rieu had invited the children , together with romanian pan flute virtuoso gheorghe zamfir , to play in his hometown of maastricht . ",
        "dutch law states that minors can not perform after 11:00 pm . rieu 's lawyers said the children were on stage `` for only a few minutes '' to wave at the crowd at the end of the concert , which they said `` was a standard practice '' for rieu . rieu also denied he was the children 's employer as the group performed with zamfir . with his curly locks and bubbly rock star personality , rieu is considered the world 's best-known modern violinist having sold more than 40 million records . he is particularly famous for his waltzes , opulent stage sets and costumes and has invited celebrities including anthony hopkins and david hasselhoff to join him at his concerts .
