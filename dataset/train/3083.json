        "archaeologists in israel have uncovered an ancient sweet spot in which early humans flourished some 500,000 years ago . the `` mega-site , '' located in jaljulia near the town of kfar saba , was discovered in november 2016 by developers who were surveying the area in preparation for urban development . over the past year , a collaborative effort by the israel antiquities authority and tel aviv university has uncovered thousands of artifacts at the one-hectare site , an area frequented by paleolithic hunter-gatherers some 500,000 years ago . the site , once the marshy bank of a meandering river , is located near one of israel 's busiest roads . ",
        "digging to a depth of 16 feet , the archaeologists uncovered layer after layer of tools and animals bones . at least six distinct sub-sites have been found within the excavation area . as reported in haaretz , the site is absolutely littered with flint hand-axes . this spot was likely inhabited by a now-extinct species of human known as homo erectus , who took full advantage of what this area had to offer . these early hunter-gatherers are a direct ancestor of modern humans , and were likely the first hominids to leave africa and spread through eurasia . ",
        "`` it was a perfect spot for humans , '' ran barkai , an archaeologist from tel aviv university , told haaretz . `` the water brought flint nodules from the hills , which were used to make tools on the spot , and it attracted animals , which were hunted and butchered here . they had everything that prehistoric people needed . `` hundreds of hand axes were uncovered by the archaeologists -- the so-called `` swiss army knife of the paleolithic . '' this tool , which had two blade ends , was typical of the ancient acheulian culture , which existed from about 1.5 million to 200,000 years ago . ",
        "the oval , pear-shaped hand axe was the killer app of the time , good for cutting , butchering , and digging . but the archaeologists also found tools made with the levallois technique , which requires considerable foresight and planning . the traditional acheulian hand axes were made by hammering a piece of flint into a desired shape , but lavallois tools were made in two stages : knapping a flint core into a specific shape , and then detaching the core with a single decisive strike . this technique requires the designer to envision the tool 's final shape and size within the flint core before shaping begins . ",
        "that 's a fairly sophisticated cognitive task , and the discovery of these tools shows how smart homo erectus actually were . the archaeologists also suspect that these early humans returned to the site repeatedly as part of a seasonal cycle . so in addition to their savvy tool-making skills , these early people also possessed the capacity for geographic memory . `` over time , the water changed course and the people moved with it . that 's why there are so many different sites , '' barkai told haaretz . `` it was like a prehistoric picnic spot , which people would return to over and over again . ",
        "`` the archaeologists feel that they 've only scratched the surface , and that more of these `` prehistoric mega-sites '' exist in this part of israel . in addition to looking for more signs of human habitability , the researchers would like to find traces of fire use . at any rate , the discovery is showing that many of the characteristics that define modern humans were already in place a half million years ago in a very closely related ancestor .
