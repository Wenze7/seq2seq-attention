        "sen. richard blumenthal said that he has asked that the justice department to investigate the comcast-nbcuniversal merger and whether it will pose a threat to consumers after conditions to the transaction expire in september , 2018 . he referenced the transaction , approved by the justice department and the fcc in 2011 , at a senate hearing on antitrust law and enforcement . but it also comes with renewed scrutiny on media mega-mergers , as the doj challenges at&t 's proposed merger with time warner and reports that the walt disney co. . is nearing a deal to purchase most of the assets of 21st century fox . ",
        "blumenthal said at the hearing that if the set of conditions placed on the comcast-nbcuniversal transaction are not extended , `` i believe that this will pose a very serious threat to competition . '' the conditions include provisions that prohibit comcast-nbcuniversal from withholding content from online , cable , and satellite rivals . the company also must comply with anti-retaliation provisions , which are overseen by the fcc and are set to expire on jan. . 20 . blumenthal even broached the idea that the justice department could unravel the merger altogether . in a letter to makan delrahim , the chief of the doj 's antitrust division , blumenthal said that `` if your investigation determines that the comcast -- nbcu acquisition will produce anticompetitive effects , even if the merger conditions are retained , you may need to consider separating comcast and nbcu in order to fully restore competition . '' ",
        "`` as a member of the senate judiciary subcommittee on antitrust , competition policy and consumer rights , i have previously raised concerns regarding whether the conditions imposed on comcast and nbcu have achieved their intended effects of promoting competition and protecting consumers and , more broadly , whether these types of conditions can actually work . '' a comcast spokesperson had no immediate comment . but the company has in the past defended its adherence to the set of conditions , and has noted that they have filed compliance reports with the fcc . the company has also noted the dramatic growth of over-the-top services , including netflix , hulu , and amazon , since the merger was approved . ",
        "blumenthal wrote that the doj case against at&t has relevance to the comcast-nbcu merger . he wrote that `` the very same principles that the department invoked to justify its suit to prevent the at&t - time warner acquisition suggest that the comcast-nbcu acquisition must be investigated further . '' blumenthal 's complete letter is here . u. s. district judge richard leon , who is presiding over the at&t - time warner case , also signed off on the settlement agreement that paved the way for the comcast-nbcuniversal deal .
