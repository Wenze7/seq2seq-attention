        "already backing out of that new year 's resolution to save more money ? well , the better business bureau serving connecticut says there are ways to lower monthly expenses without feeling too much of a pinch . `` in many cases , all you have to do is make a list of your monthly expenses to see where there is wiggle room to reduce those costs , '' said connecticut better business bureau spokesman howard schwartz in a news release . `` there are all sorts of monthly and annual services you can reassess to make sure you are getting the lowest price possible . ",
        "insurance policies are a good example of how you can save money by shopping around . '' for instance , insurance companies have many different pricing plans for the same coverage . consult an insurance agent to see whether you can benefit from any new markdowns , such as a safe driver discount . you can also lower your vehicle , dwelling and umbrella coverage by opting for a higher deductible . premiums decrease significantly if your deductible is high . your insurance will cost less if you agree to pay for the first 3 thousand dollars out of pocket instead of $ 500 . ",
        "another potential for saving money on utility bills is to purchase new , more energy-efficient appliances . `` smart '' thermostats can reduce electricity consumption by learning your habits and putting itself into `` night mode '' or `` away from home mode '' and automatically lower the air conditioning and heating . a tempting way to reduce the cost of a big ticket item or a full shopping cart is by signing up for a store-branded credit card . retailers will typically offer a discount of about 15 percent on the day or your purchases if you sign up for their card . ",
        "the downside is that the interest rates are higher than other credit cards , and if you do n't pay off the balance or miss a payment , you can get hit with charges that can outweigh the savings at the time of purchase . another downside is that an additional credit card can lower some people 's credit score . if you have been using a credit card that does n't give you any benefits , shop around for a card that offers money back on gasoline purchases , cash back on your monthly bill or points that can be redeemed for other products or services . ",
        "other bbb hints include looking for alternatives for monthly services such as cable or satellite tv and wireless providers . ask about discounts or alternative plans , but make sure that any discount is not contingent upon signing up for additional services . performing seasonal , preventative maintenance on your home such as changing air and water filters and having your furnace and chimney cleaned and inspected can also save money . a home is like a vehicle in the sense that you save money over the long term if your car is tuned up . and remember -- buying something you might not need because it 's on sale is not always as frugal as it might seem . ",
        "ask yourself whether you would buy the merchandise it if it was not discounted . if the answer is `` no , '' pass it by , say the experts .   "
