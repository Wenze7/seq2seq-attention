        "the older of two maryland girls found guilty of tormenting an autistic boy pleaded `` responsible '' to charges , the juvenile equivalent of `` guilty . '' 17-year-old lauren a. bush is being tried as a juvenile in the case . bush and her friend , a 15-year-old who has not been named , were accused of assaulting the 16-year-old disabled boy in march . they allegedly abused him by forcing him to walk on a frozen lake and refusing to help when he fell in the water , holding him at knifepoint , and attempting to force him into having sex with a dog . ",
        "the girls filmed the assault on the 15-year-old 's cell phone . they were netted by the sheriff 's department when another chopticon high school student tipped them off about the videos , according to the washington post . bush pleaded `` responsible '' to both misdemeanor charges of second-degree assault and distribution of an obscene video . despite the outrage that the case provoked , st. mary 's county circuit judge david densford transferred bush 's case from adult to juvenile court . `` the conduct on the dvds , and her statements to the police are outrageous . ",
        "there is a lack of empathy . . . a dramatic lack of empathy , '' densford said . `` you look at them and say , ` why would any human being treat another person like this ? ' `` however , the judge concluded that this `` ugliness '' `` did not constitute the `` sort of criminal activity that should subject lauren bush to the jessup women 's prison . '' the victim 's parents are divided about the fate of their son 's tormentor . having seen the videos , his mother things that juvenile rehabilitation is appropriate . ",
        "his father disagrees , believing bush presents a `` danger to herself and to the community . '' bush has been receiving treatment at a juvenile rehabilitation facility , where she has been found to present a `` low-to-moderate '' risk to herself and others . her father , larry bush , testified on his daughter 's behalf , telling the court that she had apologized to the victim and that the bush family was `` 100 percent committed to getting lauren all the help she needs .
