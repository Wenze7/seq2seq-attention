        "french director matthieu kassovitz has apologized `` for insulting '' french police after he described a group of officers as `` good for nothing bastards . '' he maintains though , that being harsh was essential to effect change . a police tweet on the outcome of a drug raid at the nantes university hospital served as the catalyst for kassovitz 's outburst and the wider social media storm . yves lefebvre , secretary general of the unite sgp police-force ouvriere police union , called on french interior minister gerard colomb to take action against the filmmaker over his unflattering comments of french law enforcement officials . ",
        "`` the tweet of mathieu kassovitz describing officials as , i quote , a bunch of bastards , is deeply intolerable and deserves a reaction from our highest authorities for insult to law enforcement officers , '' lefebvre wrote thursday . `` of course , i apologize for the insults , '' the prominent film maker tweeted friday , but , added , that things do not change unless one takes action . `` we have a problem of relationship with police in this country and the legalization of drugs . '' speaking on rmc radio friday , kassovitz said he was only voicing what `` many people '' thought about the police these days . ",
        "`` regret what ? i reacted like a citizen ... if the police are shocked , we will be in court , '' he responded when asked about his tweet . an anti-drug police operation in loire-atlantique , western france , came under fire on social media after officers revealed on twitter that as many as 24 cops , accompanied by two sniffer dogs , were deployed to a raid which yielded just 7 grams of cannabis last week . `` security and drug search operation at the st jacques hospital - 24 police officers mobilized , 10 people + 3 buildings controlled with the support of 2 dogs -- 7gr of cannabis found in the room of 1 patient , '' police said on twitter . ",
        "scores of frenchmen , kassovitz among them , took to twitter to voice indignation and ridicule over the resources involved in the ` successful ' police operation . `` 24 people and 2 dogs to target 7 grams of a product that is considered therapeutic in many countries . and you are proud of it ? '' one person posted . `` band of bastards . 7grams ! !! 24 policemen ! !! !! you are a band of good for nothing , '' kassovitz tweeted . several police officers who participated in the raid have reportedly filed complaints against the director .
