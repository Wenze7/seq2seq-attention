        "expand , a devotionalby elder kimberly williamson `` and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god , to them who are the called according to his purpose . '' romans 8:28 nkjvsometimes in the midst of our trials it 's difficult to remember that god is sovereign . by definition that means that he has ultimate power and is the supreme ruler with absolute , unlimited , boundless control and authority -- over everything ! the story of job demonstrates this best . in the first chapter of job , we see that satan had to get permission from god to meddle in job 's life . ",
        "satan was searching for someone to torment but god had placed a hedge of protection around job and his possessions that satan could not penetrate . only when god gave him permission , could satan touch job 's life . god will never allow us to go through more than we can bear without coming to our rescue -- he even sent simon from cyrene to help jesus carry the cross ! . but why would god allow satan to torment a faithful servant like job ? one answer is found in 2 corinthians : `` ... that we may be able to comfort those who are in trouble , with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by god . '' ",
        "i know for a fact , job 's story has comforted me in part , because his troubles make mine seem small but also because it reminds me that god is in control . it also illustrates that he restores , comforts and makes everything work together for my good ! job 's story gives us a glimpse of the breadth and depth of god 's rule . consider this : god blessed him with good health , children , a spouse , wealth and land . god restored job 's health . god restored job 's wealth . god gave job seven more children on the earth . ",
        "job acknowledged god 's sovereignty after the tragedy by dropping to his knees and worshipping god , saying , `` the lord gave , and the lord has taken away ; blessed be the name of the lord . '' . then , starting at chapter 37 , god offers a glimpse of his sovereignty with a list of unfathomable demonstrations of his power by asking job a series of questions to help him understand the awesomeness of the god he serves . the god we serve has a purpose in everything . he has a proper time and season for everything . ",
        "he is ruler over all . there is nothing greater than him . nothing is impossible with god . he will make all things work together for your good . points to ponder : do your problems sometimes seem bigger than god ? read and meditate on : job chapters 37 -- 39do your problems sometimes seem too much for you to bear ? read and meditate on 2 corinthians 1:3 -- 7 , 2 corinthians 12:7 -- 10 , 1 corinthians 10:13 .
