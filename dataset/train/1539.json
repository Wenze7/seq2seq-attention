        "albanysiena junior guard kadeem smithen made like a wide receiver and went long . afterward , he jokingly compared himself to the vikings ' stefon diggs , the hero of the `` minnesota miracle '' last weekend . while smithen left time on the clock , unlike diggs , his layup on a long pass from shenendehowa graduate thomas huerter with 11 seconds left sealed a 68-65 victory over marist before 5,662 at times union center on thursday night . siena built an 11-point lead in the second half and held on for an encouraging victory after losing close games at iona and manhattan last weekend . ",
        "`` it feels good because we know we 've been in a lot of games , so to close this one out , it 's a good booster for us , '' smithen said . `` we go right now to quinnipiac and get that one , too . `` freshman guard jordan horn had 15 points to lead siena . freshman center prince oduro scored all 11 of his points in the second half , including six during a 10-0 run that put the saints ahead 60-49 with 6:35 to play . `` after those losses , it to lose , but we got more confidence because we realized we could play with the best in the conference , '' oduro said . ",
        "`` we were confident we could win this game tonight . `` missing leading scorer brian parker , who sprained his ankle against fairfield last saturday , marist still pulled within 66-63 on austin williams ' conventional 3-point play with 1:17 to play . but siena 's thomas huerter , who filled the box score all night long , had one big play left with 14 seconds to go and the saints still protecting that three-point lead . coming out of a timeout and with marist pressing , huerter spotted smithen behind the red foxes defense for a breakaway layup and a 68-63 lead . ",
        "marist freshman ryan carmello , a walk-on from troy , scored on a layup with one second left to account for the final margin . `` i was just looking for somebody to be open to get the ball in , '' huerter said . `` i was thinking in the back of my head i had two timeouts . i was almost getting ready to use that , and then i saw kadeem flying down the court . i probably underthrew him , but he was athletic enough to come back and get it and finish at the other end . ",
        "`` huerter finished with six points , seven rebounds , five assists , two steals , one block and no turnovers in 29 minutes off the bench . sophomore guard khalil richard , who missed the manhattan game with the flu , and freshman guard roman penn added 12 points each as siena continued its solid play since the announcement last week that junior guard nico clareth was leaving the program . `` it 's going to be like that all year because there 's no star on this team , '' siena head coach jimmy patsos said . `` there is no star on this team anymore . ",
        "it 's going to be different guys . `` siena junior forward evan fisher , who 's been persistently bothered by cramps , sat for the final 14:14 . without him , oduro asserted himself in the second half after taking only one shot in the first half . `` coach got on me about bad habits i have early in the season , '' oduro said . `` i just focused when we got out of the locker room . i just was n't playing as hard as i possibly can . `` siena was n't guarding the 3-point line in the first half , either . ",
        "marist made 9 of its 14 shots from behind the arc in taking a 40-36 halftime lead . in the second half , the red foxes went only 2 for 5 from 3-point range and were held to 41.7 percent shooting from the field . `` we gave them a lot of wide-open looks , '' penn said . `` miscommunication , not talking . second half , we tightened up and everybody guarded their man . `` siena finished with a 32-25 rebounding advantage and had only 10 turnovers after committing 25 against manhattan last saturday . siena shot 48.2 percent from the field , including 50 percent in the second half . ",
        "siena built a 19-10 lead , including nine points from horn , who made his first four shots . marist , which beat siena in poughkeepsie last month , responded with a 10-0 run capped by a 3-pointer from david knudsen . msingelais@timesunion . com • 518-454-5509 • @marksingelais .   "
