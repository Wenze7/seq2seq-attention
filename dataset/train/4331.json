        "ukraine and russian-backed rebels wednesday began to exchange more than 300 prisoners in the war-torn east of the country , the largest such swap since the insurgency broke out in 2014 . the swap between the kiev army and rebels from the self-proclaimed donetsk and lugansk people 's republics took place at a checkpoint close to the town of gorlivka , 40 kilometres northeast of the rebels ' stronghold of donetsk , an afp reporter said . in the first exchange since september 2016 , the russian-backed eastern militia was handing over to kiev some 70 prisoners , officials from both sides said . ",
        "the ukrainian side for its part was releasing some 300 rebels and their supporters . an afp reporter at the scene saw a first group of around 15 people driven by bus to ukraine-controlled territory . the swap on the eve of the new year and orthodox christmas holidays was agreed following negotiations involving russian president vladimir putin and ukraine 's leader petro poroshenko . `` president poroshenko personally coordinated all the work of all our relevant departments , '' lawmaker iryna gerashchenko , one of ukraine 's peace negotiators , said before the exchange . the prisoner exchange is in line with the so-called minsk agreements brokered by germany and france in 2015 . ",
        "the last prisoner swap between ukraine and russian-backed rebels took place in september 2016 when two pro-kiev detainees were exchanged for four separatist fighters at a checkpoint outside the rebel-held city of lugansk . russian orthodox patriarch kirill helped mediate the talks on wednesday 's prisoner exchange . `` i hope that the process that has begun will continue and will guarantee the establishment of a just and long-lasting peace , '' he said on monday . the head of the separatist self-proclaimed donetsk people 's republic , alexander zakharchenko , thanked the patriarch for his involvement . `` people who have spent more than three years in captivity will be able to return home thanks to the church and the authorities , '' he said . ",
        "the war in the east of the former soviet republic broke out in april 2014 , after russia annexed crimea the previous month . the conflict has already claimed more than 10,000 lives . a series of truce deals has helped lower the level of violence but not fully end the bloodshed . ukraine and its western allies accuse russia of funnelling troops and arms across the border . moscow has denied the claims despite overwhelming evidence that it has been involved in the fighting and its explicit political support for the rebels .
