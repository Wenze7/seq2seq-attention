        "in a hidden site near garston , there is a special place which captures the story of peter rabbit and his lifestyle as it might have been had he lived locally . garston school teacher therese lagan co-ordinated the year long project , working with the school 's year 4 to 8 pupils focusing on the redevelopment of peter rabbit 's village . while learning about becoming town planners the pupils went to kingston to look at layout , amenities and signage and used this knowledge to develop a town plan for the miniature village . `` we had a community consultation meeting to set parameters and involve the local community in our planning process , run by the children with them making all the decisions . ",
        "`` the students chose the gold mining era because of its significance in the area , looking at the wants and needs of people living here then and what buildings would be needed . '' they used their mathematic skills involving geometry , learning about scale drawing , measuring , model making and site plans . miniature models were created out of natural materials such as clay , metal and stone . `` businesses , homes and farms were created , all with appropriate historical aspects included to make it realistic such as a nokomai gold dredge and the garston ice skating rink .
