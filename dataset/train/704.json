        "sen. marco rubio , r-fla . , criticized the corporate tax rate cut in the republican tax code overhaul during a friday interview . `` if i were king for a day , this tax bill would have looked different . i thought we probably went too far on corporations , '' he said , the news-press reported . `` you 're going to see a lot of these multinationals buy back shares to drive up the price . some of them will be forced , because they 're sitting on historic levels of cash , to pay out dividends to shareholders . ",
        "that is n't going to create dramatic growth , '' rubio said . the senator noted his success , along with sen. mike lee , r-utah , in pushing for an increase in the child tax credit . `` we had to spend a lot of time educating people on the reality about the child tax credit . it is n't welfare . it 's directly tied to work . you ca n't get it if you do n't have a tax return . you ca n't get it if you do n't have earned income , '' he said . ",
        "rubio said that the public opinion on the bill would change when americans see its effects . `` by the time we get to november of next year , their opinion about the tax bill is not going to be based on media coverage . it 's going to be based on what their paycheck is telling them . '' the republican tax bill cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent , which republicans have said would lead to higher wages and more jobs . while some u. s. corporations announced raises and bonuses , including boeing , wells fargo , comcast , and at&t , some corporations planned to funnel the savings into benefits for executives , according to the hill .
