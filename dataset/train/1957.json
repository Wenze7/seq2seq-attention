        "now , comes the sell . hours after congress sent a sweeping package of tax cuts to the white house for president donald trump 's signature , the powerful network of advocacy groups backed by billionaires charles and david koch went into high gear to turn around the bill 's dour poll numbers . planned to last at least six months -- heading right into the months when voters will turn their attention to the 2018 midterm elections -- the multi-platform koch-backed campaign will seek to explain the benefits of the tax package . `` given that the tax reform bill was just finalized , there 's a lot of work to be done educating americans about its benefits , '' said james davis , an executive vice president at freedom partners , the hub that coordinates koch-backed political activities . ",
        "`` we will make a massive push to show how pro-growth policies can revitalize the economy and open the floodgates to new opportunity , innovation and prosperity . '' the sales job will be tough . polls find the proposal incredibly unpopular with voters : a cnn poll released this week found 55 % of voters opposed to the bill . and for good reason . the bulk of the benefits will go to those who make more than $ 300,000 a year , according to the non-partisan tax policy center . and , by 2027 , those earning less than $ 75,000 annual will see a tax hike while the cuts for the ultra-rich remain , according to the center for budget and policy priorities . ",
        "democrats , who stood unified against the package , now plan to weaponize it against republicans next year and beyond . republicans grumble that they had little choice but to pass this unpopular bill . for years , they 've promised sweeping tax cuts . now , given control of the house , the senate and the white house , they delivered on campaign rhetoric in a big way . failing to do so would have meant they had control of all levers of official washington power and still accomplished nothing . they had to show they could , in fact , govern . ",
        "at the same time , it 's fast approaching the end of trump 's first year in office . aside from the confirmation of judges , including a supreme court justice , and regulatory moves , the gop has not passed a significant piece of legislation . the pressure is on to do so before next year 's elections , when the entire house and a third of the senate are up for grabs . a multi-million dollar campaign the koch-backed network spans interest groups , advocacy organizations , think tanks and p. r. machines . it went in with $ 20 million to push for these tax cuts and promised lawmakers that their backs would be covered if they supported it . ",
        "an internal report said the koch organizations knocked on more than 33,000 doors to tell voters about the tax bill 's potential , reached more than 16 million people via digital ads online and ran 111 different digital campaigns . the cost for wisconsin alone , where many worried about a defection from republican sen. ron johnson and the re-election bid next year of democratic sen. tammy baldwin , was $ 1.6 million . to build on that , the koch network on friday plans to let members of congress know that the team will be organizing town halls , seminars and workshops in their districts and states to try to re-frame the talk on the tax bill . ",
        "at the same time , the advocacy groups , such as americans for prosperity , will incorporate the pro-tax cuts message into their phone calls and door knocks . finally , there will be television , radio and digital ads to promote the bill and , in some cases , the lawmakers who cast votes that made it possible . all told , they 're eyeballing several million dollars to defend the bill and to try to take some of the sting off the vote backing it . koch-world officials say a tremendous about of `` misinformation '' about the bill made it unpopular , but perhaps not permanently . ",
        "they plan to cast the bill 's critics as tax-loving liberals who are sour that they lost a political fight . `` this tax plan is big , bold , and pro-growth . it 's about to ignite a new era of growth , and we 're going to make sure that americans understand how they and their community stand to benefit , '' said americans for prosperity president tim phillips . `` that means activating our grassroots infrastructure in 36 states to get the word out , having hundreds of thousands of direct conversations that cut through the rhetoric and misinformation . '' ",
        "still , the tax bill is just as unpopular on the day it is becoming law as the democrats ' health care bill was when it became law in 2010 . republicans used obamacare as to bludgeon their way into the majority that year . even so , views of obamacare have improved in the years since . republicans are hoping their tax cuts will fare as well .
