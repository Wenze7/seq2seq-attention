        "chelsea boss antonio conte has revealed that david luiz 's injury is worse than feared . the brazilian defender has n't played for the blues since a disastrous performance against roma in the champions league . getty - contributorhe has been missing from first team action for three weeks , but was expected to be fit for chelsea 's clash with southampton on saturday . however , conte has said that luiz , 30 , is n't ready to start and could be out for longer than expected . `` david has a big inflammation in his knee , '' conte told reporters in a press conference on friday . ",
        "`` we are trying and trying to solve this situation with the doctor . it 's important to assess the situation day by day and try to try to sort this problem . getty - contributor `` i do n't know when he 's able to come back with us . with the doctor and the medical department we are try to solve this situation . `` the player is working apart . he worked in the pool , i saw him running on the pitch but very slowly . `` this is a serious problem but we hope to solve this problem soon . '' ",
        "the italian also divulged that luiz was frustrated to be out . conte continued : `` i think every player is frustrated when they do n't play , especially when they have an injury . `` for sure there is a lot of frustration for the injury because every player likes to train and try to put the coach in difficulty with their selections . `` i understand because i was a player and when i was injured my feeling was very bad . '' last week chelsea felt their defender 's absence falling to a 1-0 defeat at west ham . ",
        "his below-par performances have been called to question this year after a star turn in chelsea 's title-winning team last season . it was claimed that luiz was dropped by conte after the roma after he questioned the manager 's tactics . he was axed for the win over man united and forced to watch their 1-0 win from the stands . `` it 's very simple . he can get on with the others , or he can sit in the stands , '' conte said after the victory . `` the coach has to make the best decision for the team . ",
        "`` and the best decision for the team was to play with andreas christensen and to have on the bench ethan ampadu , another young player . `` i must take the best decision for the club , not for a single player . `` luiz has to work and if he trains well , then he deserves to play . ''   "
