        "did you know there are four verses or that it was written by scottish poet robert burns ? we sing auld lang syne once a year , so ca n't be blamed for always forgetting the words . but new year 's eve 2017 could be the year you get it right . we 're not suggesting you quickly learn them by heart - but you could bookmark this story and you 'll have the lyrics at your fingertips when the clock strikes midnight . auld lang syne was originally a poem written in scots by robert burns in 1788 - although it is believed he collected some of the verses rather than wrote them from scratch himself . ",
        "the title loosely translates as `` long , long ago '' . the words were later set to a traditional folk tune . here they are in the simplified english version that is commonly sung . auld lang syneshould old acquaintance be forgot , and never brought to mind ? should old acquaintance be forgot , and old lang syne ? chorus : for auld lang syne , my dear , for auld lang syne , we 'll take a cup of kindness yet , for auld lang syne . and surely you 'll buy your pint cup ! and surely i 'll buy mine ! ",
        "and we 'll take a cup o ' kindness yet , for auld lang syne . choruswe two have run about the slopes , and picked the daisies fine ; but we 've wandered many a weary foot , since auld lang syne . choruswe two have paddled in the stream , from morning sun till dine ; but seas between us broad have roaredsince auld lang syne . chorusand there 's a hand my trusty friend ! and give me a hand o ' thine ! and we 'll take a right good-will draught , for auld lang syne .
