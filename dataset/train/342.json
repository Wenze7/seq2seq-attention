        "cllr richard kemp was warned by lawyers about a recent blog postliverpool 's liberal democrat leader has contacted police over alleged `` witness intimidation '' by lawyers representing liverpool city council . cllr richard kemp has written to the chief constable of lancashire police after receiving a strongly worded letter from law firm bevan brittan on behalf of liverpool city council . the lib dem chief has argued that the legal warning is both wrong and intimidatory - but the ruling labour group has criticised his `` scattergun criticisms '' and labelled him a `` pathetic martyr . '' the legal letter was in response to a blog post written by cllr kemp in november , in which he called for the removal of the posts of mayor of liverpool and liverpool city council chief executive - arguing that the roles are no longer needed following the city region 's devolution deal . ",
        "after the post was published online , he received the letter from the lawyers - who said that his words had also caught the attention of those representing suspended chief executive ged fitzgerald - who is currently on police bail relating to an investigation by lancashire police into his time there . liverpool city council / pa wirethe letter asserted that in his post , cllr kemp had `` breached '' a duty of care of elected members not to comment upon individual officers . the letter states : `` notwithstanding the general duty of care you are only too aware of the sensitive issues with which the city council is currently dealing in the context of the investigation by lancashire police . '' ",
        "liverpool council will loan everton millions for new stadium - but mayor says council will profitthe lawyers ask cllr kemp to `` consider the actions he is currently taking , '' which the firm says they have `` advised the city council are inappropriate in the current circumstances '' . the letter adds : `` i am advising the city council that , your unwillingness to heed the comments which i am making here , would constitute recklessness on your part and would mean you could not have the benefit of the city council indemnity were any action to be brought against you . '' ",
        "the letter concludes with a request for cllr kemp to `` cease publication of material of this nature , '' arguing that it is `` unhelpful , unfair to the chief executive as an employee and is not in accordance with your duty as a councillor in the context of officer/member relationships '' . cllr kemp has now referred the letter on to andy rhodes , chief constable of the lancashire force - which is conducting the investigation into mr fitzgerald . in his comments he states : `` my advisers think that this is an attempt at witness intimidation as i have given two statements to lancashire police about the whole ocl and ldl case and i am therefore a potential witness . ",
        "revealed : the 15-year plan for liverpool 's future with tens of thousands of jobs `` any attempt to withdraw a legal indemnity for actions i am legitimately taking as an elected representative in liverpool could have potentially disastrous consequences for my family and me . '' speaking to the echo , cllr kemp added that he felt the legal warning he was sent was based on incorrect assessments . he said : `` in the blog post i was talking about the post of chief executive , not the post holder - we said back in march that having a metro mayor has changed the whole way that liverpool city council should operate . ",
        "`` i feel that i have been threatened by something that is factually incorrect . '' revealed : council officers ' luxury cars - including arrested chief exec ged fitzgeraldin an official response , a liverpool city council spokesman said : `` the city council has a duty of care to its employees and was advised that certain postings by cllr kemp in relation to an employee were inappropriate . `` lawyers for the city council were instructed to contact cllr kemp - pursuant to the duty of care owed to the employee - and for no other motive . '' ",
        "in a more strongly worded response , a labour source added : `` as a councillor , richard was advised to stop making scattergun criticisms because it compromises the council 's legal position . he 's now trying to turn himself into a martyr as a political stunt . it wo n't wash . it 's pathetic stuff by the lib dems .
