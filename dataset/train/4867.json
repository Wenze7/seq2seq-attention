        "arsenal have suffered a recurring nightmare with aaron ramsey biting the dust while in top form . here are five things we will hope to learn in his access . arsenal , aaron ramsey arsenal 's disappointing draw with southampton was cut from the same cloth as the loss to manchester united . only this one did n't involve quite as many heroic saves from the opposing keeper or copious amounts of beautiful attacking moves . related story : arsenal vs southampton player ratingsstill , the disappointment was as ripe as a green avocado , and it took a last gasp effort from olivier giroud to spare us the humiliation of another defeat . ",
        "in the process , aaron ramsey was again the biggest threat on the pitch and , again , aaron ramsey came up hobbling with a hamstring injury . towards the end of the match , he was seen testing it out , but completely unable to sprint . but we were out of subs . in the aftermath of the match , no exact timeline has been set for his return , but three weeks has been tossed around . which would count him out right through the most important and hectic period of the season . it 's what we always feared would happen . ",
        "the only difference is that it happened early on in the hectic period and not smack in the middle of it . which is even worse . regardless , not that we need to learn anymore lessons , but here are five things we will/can/will hope to learn from ramsey 's absence . for the sake of not wasting a point `` we need him '' is not on this list . we should know that by now . if you do n't , i ca n't help you . on to no . 5.5 . his success is volatilemaybe i fell into this trap all on my own , but i doubt that . ",
        "i was really , really convinced that we were just going to have aaron ramsey at full health for the entire season . that obviously is n't going to happen . while we do n't know how long he is going to be out for , it did n't look good . any time out will be a keen reminder , or a lesson learned , given the theme , that for as good as ramsey can be , there is always a risk in banking on his continued success . he will come and go at the whimsy of his bum hamstring . ",
        "that sucks . i hate learning this lesson again . but here i am , trying to deal with it . at no . 4 , it 's rather important . 4 . we need another superstarit 's obvious that any team that wants to be successful has to function as a unit , or as a cohesive body . an amoeba of sorts , if you will . without that chemistry , the superstar mass will flail and die and no one will be any the wiser . more money will be spent to try to compensate or an overhaul will be needed . ",
        "more from pain in the arsenal arsenal : alexandre lacazette better than alexis sanchez , plain and simple2h ago arsenal : laurent koscielny and/or his achilles need major repairs4h ago arsenal : it 's not jack wilshere , but granit xhaka needs to be replaced6h ago arsenal : no , olivier giroud still should n't start8h ago arsenal vs southampton : 5 things we learned -- last-gasp draw not enough10h ago anyway , despite the need for the team mentality , there are times when that team will fail as a whole and it 's times like that when you need a superstar that can create something out of nothing .",
        "chelsea have eden hazard , manchester city have sergio aguero , kevin de bruyne . arsenal have alexis sanchez and , as i like to classify him , aaron ramsey . i 'm not saying that these guys are any better than , say , mesut ozil . i am saying that they have the mentality and the capability to create for themselves without the help of others . with alexis drilling himself into the ground , frustrated as all hell , and ramsey now out , they do n't have someone of that capability . and , with alexis half way out the door and this kind reminder that ramsey is n't always reliable because of his health , we may soon learn yet again that we need another self-sustaining superstar . ",
        "let 's start extrapolating at no . 3.3 . how tough is mesut ozil really ? the first two lessons were things we essentially had to re-learn . or , we probably should n't have had to re-learn them , but we are being forced to nonetheless . these next three lessons are more so things we will have to see and learn from as we go . naturally , any time something happens lately that effects the layout of the club , my no . 1 question is how does this effect mesut ozil and his ongoing run of form . ",
        "check out the pain in the arsenal podcast herethe big question that i want to have answered is simply that -- how does it effective his successes ? i believe that ramsey has taken a lot of the pressure of of ozil with his fantastic form this season , as can be seen in his numbers . he provides tremendous cover for the german , especially in the wake of alexis 's fizzling effectiveness . with ramsey out ozil is going to have to step up and learn to gel with whoever happens to fill the welshman 's shoes while he is out . ",
        "it 's a nervy lesson , because i do n't know what to expect . i ca n't help but think that any good run of form from ozil is fragile and anything can upset it . i would love to be proven wrong . at no . 2 , a potential long-term answer . 2 . leon goretzka is the manthis lesson opens up a can of worms , and i do n't want to dig into most of those worms right now . the main thing i want to talk about is how this formation was seemingly built around ramsey , to give him the freedom he needed to be at his best . ",
        "needless to say it has worked exceptionally well .   ",
        "more from pain in the arsenal arsenal : alexandre lacazette better than alexis sanchez , plain and simple2h ago arsenal : laurent koscielny and/or his achilles need major repairs4h ago arsenal : it 's not jack wilshere , but granit xhaka needs to be replaced6h ago arsenal : no , olivier giroud still should n't start8h ago arsenal vs southampton : 5 things we learned -- last-gasp draw not enough10h ago if the plan is to stick with the formation , then the best thing we can do is notice what his absence does , which i assume will be rather negative , and see how important it is that we find cover for him , while in the process accepting that the midfield is still rather thin .",
        "i do n't think many people still believe that francis coquelin or mohamed elneny can amount to much and santi cazorla 's setbacks are just never-ending . that leaves jack wilshere and aaron ramsey . leon goretzka is the german aaron ramsey without the leg break that ruined two years of his career . he is prolific . he is a creator , a scorer , an everything midfielder . adding him to the stable and potentially shaping a formation around ramsey and goretzka could be the best way forward . finally , at no . 1.1 . jack wilshere 's readinesswell , here we are . ",
        "back at the point of believing that there is no possible way arsene wenger can get out of starting jack wilshere now . wenger has said that wilshere `` is back '' and wilshere has said that he feels better than ever . the fans see it . it 's just time . and it 's been time . it has to be wilshere that steps into ramsey 's assumed void and that will teach us the greatest lesson of all . it will show us if wilshere is ready for a prime time role , if he can bring what ramsey brought and if his future is with this club . ",
        "the thing with wilshere is that we waited so long for him to get healthy and when it looked like that was n't going to happen , the club moved on . they could n't save his spot any longer . there is a great deal of fighting left for wilshere to get back to where he was before -- as an indispensable , but this is where we start . depending on how long ramsey is out for , we should learn the extent of wilshere 's future viability . we should learn just how much of an impact he can have . ",
        "and if i 've learned anything from watching wilshere all these years , it 's that we should have rather high expectations of what we are about to find out . arsenal have suffered a recurring nightmare with aaron ramsey biting the dust while in top form . here are five things we will hope to learn in his access . arsenal 's disappointing draw with southampton was cut from the same cloth as the loss to manchester united . only this one did n't i. . .
