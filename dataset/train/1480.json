        "last week i wrote a piece on what bitcoin futures would bring for crypto investors . i want to thank everyone who reached out afterwards , and give a special shout to ellen dasilva for helping spread the word . i concluded the last piece suggesting investors consider re-balancing their crypto portfolios , which led to a host of follow up questions including : what are the other cryptoassets out there ? why would i diversify my bitcoin when it 's doing so well ? this piece will attempt to answer all of those questions . seeing as the investment acumen of readers can vary , i am going to begin broadly and then get narrower by answering the following questions : what is diversification ? ",
        "why is it important ? how can one achieve diversification in a crypto portfolio ? why should she ? diversificationthe concept of diversification in investing was brought to the fore by harry markowitz in his 1952 paper ` portfolio selection ' , formulating the basis for what has since been coined modern portfolio theory . to summarize his work : generating a return is not possible without taking risk . therefore , the quality of an investment can not be measured simply by how much of a return it might generate , but must also take into account the risk necessary to achieve that return . ",
        "consider : winning a $ 500 million mega ball lottery with a $ 7 ticket seems great , until you realize that your chances of doing so are approximately 1 in 175 million . your expected return in this case is - $ 4.14 , or -60 % . knowing that , would you invest your life savings into one big lottery ticket ? continuing with this line of thinking , risk in a portfolio can be lowered by investing in a broad array of assets , or by diversifying . the benefits of diversification are especially pronounced when assets in a portfolio exhibit low correlation to one another . ",
        "even assets that are inherently risky in isolation might not be so risky when held in a portfolio with other uncorrelated assets . through diversification , investors who lower their risk without eroding much expected return will create higher quality portfolios . this argument has been used by many in crypto land to encourage investors to invest at least part of their savings in bitcoin . because it has exhibited low correlation to conventional investment assets , an allocation to bitcoin might reduce rather than increase the portfolio 's risk despite the fact that bitcoin itself is an extremely risky investment . ",
        "while that may be true , the purpose of this piece is not to encourage readers to diversify by allocating to crypto . rather , it is to encourage those who already have invested in crypto to diversify within that crypto allocation . how can one achieve diversification in a crypto portfolio ? first off , for those less familiar with the space , bitcoin is not the only crypto asset out there -- far from it . there are thousands in existence . bitcoin 's code is open sourced , meaning anyone who does n't like aspects of its functionality has the freedom to pull the source code , make the changes they want , and launch their own crypto asset . ",
        "investors and users can then vote with their feet based on which asset generates the most utility . this has created a fast moving , highly innovative environment from which some very interesting projects have emerged . the top 10 crypto assets by market cap are listed in the chart below . i am going to touch on a few i find interesting : ethereum , ripple , and iota , assessing each asset 's team , technology , and target market . please note that the purpose of this article is not to take a deep dive on any one crypto , but rather to quickly describe them before demonstrating why it makes sense for those who want to invest in crypto assets to diversify when doing so .

        "ethereum · team : ethereum was launched in 2015 by a team spearheaded by the crypto legend / child prodigy vitalik buterin . because ethereum 's application potential is so vast , it has attracted many of the best and brightest minds in blockchain tech . furthermore , ethereum has attracted interest from many of the world 's leading businesses including jpmorgan , intel , and microsoft in the ethereum enterprise alliance , a group that seeks to employ ethereum for the enterprise . · tech : ethereum is different from bitcoin because its purpose is not to be a digital currency , but to be the world 's super computer . ",
        "the ethereum blockchain supports more than just a distributed ledger of ownership , it supports code or `` smart contracts '' written in ethereum 's own programming language solidity . developers can build and publish distributed applications which are sustained by ether , or the ` currency ' of ethereum . ether is the incentive for those contributing the computational power to maintain the network , and is used by individuals leveraging ethereum smart contracts . · target market : because it aims to be a platform for any and all applications of blockchain technology , ethereum has more potential applications than nearly all other crypto assets . ",
        "developer teams are attempting to use it to disrupt everything from the pension industry , to supply chain management , to contract law . ripple · team : ripple is an open source network , but also has a venture-backed management company behind it . ripple 's leadership is anything but the eccentric computer geeks crypto skeptics might assume are behind the blockchain movement . ceo brad garlinghouse is a harvard mba with experience in vc/pe and in operating roles in some of the world 's largest tech companies . his management team is littered with high octane tenured professionals from finance and tech . ",
        "it is important to note that while ripple is a company , its network is decentralized in that transactions are validated by its participants , and can therefore operate autonomously without the ripple company behind it . enterprise users of ripple include ubs , rbc , banco santander , standard charter , and other large financial companies . · tech : ripple is different from bitcoin because it is a transaction network rather than a digital currency . ripple provides a peer-to-peer platform connecting banks , payment providers , and digital asset exchanges via its network to provide frictionless transfers of currency . ",
        "in those transfers , the digital currency of ripple acts as a bridge currency to other currencies . transactions in xrp are verified by consensus among members of the network , rather than the proof-of-work `` mining '' process used by bitcoin . consequently , payments on the ripple network are significantly faster and cheaper than those facilitated by traditional banks or by bitcoin . · target market : focused solely on business-to-business currency transfers , ripple has the most defined and tangible target market of the cryptos in this article . with over $ 155 trillion transferring across boarders each year , ripple 's total addressable market is substantial . ",
        "iota · team : iota was founded by the visionary david sonstebo with the goal of formulating the backbone to the internet of things . large companies who have entered into cooperation agreements with iota include microsoft , accenture , fujitsu , and bosch . · tech : iota 's technology aims to connect machines rather than people . iota creates an incentive for owners of data to share it through zero-fee transactions . its decentralized ledger ensures the integrity of that data . rather than a blockchain , iota uses a directed acyclic graph or `` tangle , '' allowing iota necessary scalability to address the iot market , and removing the reliance on miners to verify transactions . ",
        "· target market : the boston consulting group estimates that the internet of things market will reach nearly $ 270 billion by 2020 . should iota 's developer community continue its progress , it could be a meaningful part of the future of iot . the technology , team and target market of each of the aforementioned could be articles in and of themselves . the above teasers are merely to demonstrate that there are other cryptos with viable value propositions that make them materially different from each other and bitcoin , meaning that they stand to provide attractive uncorrelated return streams that might be beneficial to a portfolio . ",
        "the benefits of diversificationwhether you are only investing a small amount of money in crypto assets , or you are a substantial investor , diversifying pays . to demonstrate the benefits , i analyzed pricing data from the beginning of december through the 16th . i then graphed the returns of a portfolio allocated 30 % to btc , 30 % to eth , 20 % to xrp , and 20 % to iota . all of the investments had incredible returns , but the returns of the diversified portfolio were highest quality , or were the best when adjusted for risk . ",
        "to demonstrate this , i created a table showing the average daily return of each asset , the standard deviation of daily returns , and then a metric where i divided the average return by the standard deviation to measure quality . the portfolio 's quality is the highest by a significant margin ; meaning it had the highest return relative to its risk . a major factor playing into its risk is the correlation of the portfolio 's components . as mentioned earlier , a portfolio 's volatility can be reduced if its components are uncorrelated . despite the strong performance in each of the analyzed crypto assets , their returns exhibited low correlation . ",
        "as a result , the portfolio 's volatility was lower than any of the underlying assets in isolation by a significant margin . in closing , i want to impress upon everyone that any investment in crypto is extremely risky . while some still tout crypto as a good investment in portfolios , others dismiss the space as the largest speculative bubble ever . there are very smart people on both sides of the isle . neither is entirely wrong , and neither is entirely right . the purpose of this article is merely to point out that there are other cryptos out there that have tremendous potential , and that it is always prudent to be diversified , even if your investment in cryptos is small .
