        "four months back , the sportscastr team and i set out on an ambitious rebrand . i would n't call it a complete overhaul by any means , but for various reasons we thought it was a smart decision moving forward for the company . fortunately , we were able to keep some of the most recognizable elements of the logomark , making it a smooth transition . in order to tackle the challenge , we had to prioritize certain aspects over others . to provide a little context on what sportscastr is : sportscastr is an ultra-fast , lowest-latency live video streaming platform for the sports community . ",
        "fans from around the world can tune in on any device to watch any broadcaster live and interact with other fans . when you 're ready to stream , simply download the app or go live on your laptop or desktop computer . from automatically-generated and interactive on-screen graphics , to opening and closing sequences , sportscastr will make it look like you 're on tv , regardless of where you are . let 's dive into how we tackled the rebrand , why we made the decisions we did and what we learned throughout the process . logomarkbeing an app and website based product , we knew the app icon and logomark was a good place to start . ",
        "knowing we were starting with a solid foundation , we had somewhat of a safety net to explore . we tried out hundreds of different ideas , both similar and quite different from where we started . we bounced around various ideas that were more literal , some more symbolic and abstract , but eventually came back to a cleaner iteration of the old logomark . as with the old logomark , we were able to maintain the camera shape that is made out of the negative space inside of the c , a subtle ` easter egg ' that most people wo n't notice right away . ",
        "the s was changed to be more modern , sleek and sporty with a less collegiate feel by chopping off the terminals . the resulting mark is much more legible at small sizes and does a good job of fitting the future vision for the company . logotypeone of the most significant changes to the brand was the logotype we landed on . we changed from a roboto light & roboto bold sandwich to a simple , monospaced , stacked logotype utilizing the typeface industry bold . we had already been using industry as a display typeface for headlines and other occasional uses , so implementing it in a more front-facing way really helped tie the entire brand together better than it was before the rebrand . ",
        "logo lockup & extensionsinterestingly , the old logo lockup did n't include a version with the logomark . those two elements were always used individually , but it really made for a headache . the logomark used in the app store and the logo on the website hardly looked like the same company . as you can see in the new logo , we have removed the red `` . live '' tag from the brand standards . this is due to the fact that sportscastr now owns the domain name sportscastr . com and the trademark `` sportscastr '' , so we felt it was n't necessary in the logo anymore . ",
        "it also did n't get represented in the logomark , so we felt that it made it more confusing all together . sportscastr being a tech startup and all , our products are still in the beta stage and as such we needed a logo version to signify this quickly on the website and on the app . similar to the old beta logo version , it uses a wide tracked , all-caps roboto bold positioned below the logotype . knowing that the word `` sportscastr '' would be used often in marketing materials and would often have words come before it , we designed the logo with this in mind . ",
        "there is a dedicated space above the logotype that can be used to display phrases like `` be the sportscastr '' , `` find your sportscastr '' and `` live on sportscastr '' . typographysportscastr had a very well defined and clean typographic palette going into the rebrand , something we knew we wanted to leave essentially untouched . after the rebrand , we are still using industry bold as a display font and the versatile roboto family of weights for basically everything else . color palettethe color palette remained essentially unchanged , with our 5 main colors and their respective tints and shades . ",
        "what we have done with the rebrand is bring the signature heatmap gradient to the forefront , which was previously used on the broadcast stats viewer chart . it beautifully fills the outer c of the logomark , creating an eye-catching and unique mark in both small uses like a website favicon or larger use cases like on the front of a t-shirt or on the jumbotron at the madison square garden . the heatmap gradient was also applied in other cases where solid red or blue were previously used , including on the real-time on-screen overlays and in the custom video player . ",
        "patternssportscastr is n't a pattern-heavy brand , but early on when we first created the initial sportscastr identity , we began naturally using a pattern of dashed lines with arrows , x 's and o 's , showing movement , organization and mirroring a play drawn in a huddle by a coach on the field or a sportscaster noting player movements on a monitor in a studio . we named the pattern `` axo '' and left it unchanged during the rebrand . one addition we did make was to have the highlighted arrows utilize the heatmap gradient , but this was a fairly small addition compared to other changes . ",
        "in addition to the axo pattern , we also occasionally use a blown-up version of the sportscastr logomark , only displaying a portion of it at a time , to create a subtle watermark background on some marketing materials . this only had to be updated to the new logomark . the sportscastr brand standards had already laid out a clear photographic direction that we decided did n't need to change with the rebrand . the sportscastr brand blends a nice mix of black & white , isolated and full-color imagery , with a focus on live broadcasters , broadcasting tools , top-tier athletes , sporting equipment , venues and large cities that have a big sports presence like new york city . ",
        "websitethe website is easily one of the largest parts of the sportscastr system when you factor in the various responsive states , device and browser restraints , additional screens needed to support the business that are n't included the app , admin panels , legal sections , marketing pages , overlays , graphic generators and more . working closely with the cto , we combed through everything with a fine tooth comb updating each logo , logomark , app icon , graphic , product mockup and image meticulously . luckily , we were n't changing the name or how it 's used on the products , so that avoided a lot of headaches . ",
        "appinterestingly , the app itself does n't really use the logo or logomark too often . essentially the idea is that once you 're in an app , you pretty much know what app it is . there 's no need to plaster it everywhere , you only have so much screen real estate after all . app ui updates included things like the app icon , the logo on the loading screen , the background video on the splash screen and the real-time on-screen overlays used in broadcasts , among other things . social media feedsstill widely neglected by many companies , social media feeds like facebook , twitter , instagram and snapchat have become one of the most public-facing ways for somebody to find out about your brand . ",
        "once they know about you , they might end up at your website or app , but social media is many people 's gate to the majority of the content they consume online . the sportscastr social media feeds are managed in house , which allow us to be nimble and maintain a high-quality stream of content that aligns with the new brand vision . we also have an in house community support team that provides our power users a direct line of contact with the people making product decisions and managing the sportscastr community . working closely with and highlighting our most popular content creators has proven to be a great way to both drive traffic to our users broadcasts and fill our feeds with exclusive , high-quality content you ca n't find anywhere else . ",
        "over time , we have been able to create a system of unique video and graphic templates that allow us to showcase content created on the sportscastr platform in a beautiful and unique way . these templates have all been shifted to the new brand and we are expanding the templates , allowing us to have more variation in content and provide our broadcasters more opportunities to acquire more fans . marketing materialsthis category includes a wide variety of elements , including everything from advertisements to various video assets , a downloadable press kit , press releases , pitch decks , email signatures , email templates , business cards , letterheads , notepads , office signage , backdrops , branded swag and more . ",
        "this is probably the most extensive section , but also one that we knew could come toward the end of the process while the developers were implementing the website and app changes globally . it 's never really completeimplementing a complete rebrand for an existing company of any size is an ongoing process . people will always end up finding old documents that need to be updated to match the current brand standards . it 's not always possible to make sure everybody 's copy of every document is updated , so it 's important to make sure people know it 's a team effort to ensure the rebrand is a success . ",
        "throughout the 4-month rebranding process , the product also progressed a lot in it 's own right and we have some other cool stuff on the way . if you have n't yet , i 'd highly suggest checking it out at sportscastr . com or on the ios app store . stay tuned , this is only the beginning . about the authordakota is an entrepreneur & designer from the pacific northwest . owner of dktb design , partner at black hatchet & lead designer at sportscastr .
