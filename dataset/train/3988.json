        "the google pixel 2 and samsung galaxy note 8 crush the iphone x 's performance on the most common lte band in north america , according to new test data from cellular insights given exclusively to pcmag . the pixel 2 is tuned to get up to 36 percent better download speeds using the same band , channel size , and number of antennas than the best iphone x model , the tests found . with their full complement of antennas turned on , the pixel 2 , note 8 , and lg v30 can get double the speeds per channel compared to the iphone . ",
        "we asked cellular insights to test these phones because they all use qualcomm 's latest x16 `` gigabit '' modem . that 's the best modem out there , but the results showed that phone makers ' design choices can still make a huge difference . according to its report , `` because of the added antenna diversity , devices with 4-branch antenna design perform better than the devices with two antennas in all situations , including the areas of coverage where 4x4 mimo is n't supported . added diversity aids in extracting and processing a cleaner signal which reduces retransmission , improves spectral efficiency of the network and overall user experience . ",
        "`` to compare the phones on an apples-to-apples basis , cellular insights looked at performance using one 20 mhz channel of band 4 , in 2x2 mimo mode . that means the phone is using two upload and two download antenna branches . different us carriers cobble together spectrum in different ways , and some support 4x4 mimo in various cities . but 2x2 mimo is a commonly used transmission method for us networks . the tests used lte band 4 , which is used by at&t , t-mobile , verizon , and the major canadian wireless carriers , and attenuated an lte signal from a strong -85 dbm until the modems showed no performance . ",
        "qualcomm beats intel ; android beats applethere are two main models of the iphone x , which use qualcomm and intel modems . the qualcomm-powered one performs better , as an earlier cellular insights test showed . throwing the android phones into the mix , the phones ' modem quality was in a consistent order , until you got to very weak signals . the pixel 2 was the fastest , followed by the note 8 , the v30 , the qualcomm-based iphone , and finally the intel iphone . the v30 and note 8 performed very well in extremely low signal conditions with 2x2 mimo , squeezing a tiny bit of bandwidth out of failing connections . ",
        "the differences between android phones and the iphone become much greater when you turn on 4x4 mimo . by doubling the use of transmit and receive antennas , 4x4 mimo doubles potential speeds on an lte channel . the note 8 , pixel 2 and lg v30 all support 4x4 mimo on band 4 . apple iphones do not , possibly because the intel modem apple used this year does n't support the feature . the pixel 2 performed best of the group in weak signal conditions using 4x4 mimo . cellular insights also looked at an international unit of the huawei mate 10 pro , which we had high hopes for because it 's the first lte category 18 modem we 've seen , capable of 1.2 gbps speeds . ",
        "but the lesson we learned was just not to use international models in the us . the mate 10 pro showed the poorest performance of any of the test devices , which we chalk up to its not being tuned for the us 's band 4 . did apple do this on purpose ? the cellular insights tests did n't reveal conclusively whether apple is turning down its qualcomm modem performance to try to match the weaker intel modem on purpose . while some industry sources have told me this is the case , the lg v30 performed similarly enough to the iphone that apple may just not be all that great with band 4 . ",
        "the android phones had other advantages over the iphone that did n't show up in the pure speed tests . both the v30 and note 8 support laa , or licensed assisted access , a new method of transmitting lte that the carriers are starting to roll out . and the v30 supports t-mobile 's new band 71 , which that carrier is starting to roll out for additional rural coverage . rohde & schwarz , the global leader in test and measurement equipment , provided cellular insights with the cutting-edge cmwflexx solution consisting of two cmw500 wideband communication tester boxes , cmwc controller , and r&s ts7124 rf shielded box equipped with four vivaldi antennas for up to 4 Ã— 4 mimo , ensuring high reproducibility of near-field ota mimo measurements . ",
        "the study was done independently by cellular insights and shared with pcmag . the two iphone x units were running ios 11.1.2 . cellular insights ' methodology was the same as last year 's , which you can read in its 2016 report .   "
