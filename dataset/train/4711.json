        "in the 1980s reebok was on top of the world . the company emerged from obscurity and essentially zero sales at the beginning of the decade thanks to the aerobics craze and the soon-to-be ubiquitous reebok freestyle . building on that hit , the company moved into tennis , basketball , and running sneakers later in the decade , signing star athletes like dominique wilkins , michael chang , and eventually shaquille o'neal . in just a few short years , the company went from nothing to being the # 1 footwear company in the world , moving past nike . ",
        "however , after that initial reign as the `` new thing '' , which was extended by innovative shoes like the pump , reebok eventually faded away , falling far behind nike . marketing mistakes , an inability to match nike in performance footwear , and misguided acquisitions like the boston whaler boat brand seemed to doom the brand . in 2005 adidas acquired reebok for $ 3.8 billion , less than the company was worth in its heady growth days in the 1980s and 1990s . since then , reebok 's sales have continued to stagnate , on track for just $ 2 billion in sales this year . ",
        "compared to adidas brand sales , reebok is essentially a rounding error . a cautionary tale . for under armour investors , it 's worth taking note of reebok 's experience , which may be a cautionary tale for the one-time market darling . like reebok , under armour had its own meteoric rise : the stock gained about 1,500 % between its 2005 ipo and its peak in 2015 . however , since then the stock has lost three quarters of those gains . susquehanna analyst sam poser also drew a comparison between the two sportswear brands when he downgraded under armour , saying , `` given poor brand distribution decisions , we believe risks are becoming more like reebok than nike . '' ",
        "under armour has made a number of mistakes of late that , in addition to the ongoing retail unraveling , have caused north american sales to turn south and the stock to plummet . among those errors , it damaged its brand by discounting its product at retailers like dsw and kohl 's . under armour sees itself as a premium brand , but in its urgency to replace bankrupt retailers like the sports authority , the brand may be losing some of its aspirational value . management has also seemed out of step with its customer base at times . ",
        "ceo kevin plank praised president trump at a time when millions of americans were irate over the travel ban he had just implemented , and the customers under armour most needs to cultivate , young urbanites , tend to be more anti-trump than the country as a whole . the company 's top sponsor , steph curry , even spoke out against plank 's endorsement , and plank eventually resigned from the trump advisory board he served on . the company misfired with its signature line of sneakers from the nba star as well ; the curry 3 was a bust , with sales widely missing expectations , and the curry 2 all-white lows were roundly mocked on twitter , with some dismissing them as seinfeld shoes and saying they were for the elderly . ",
        "for a company desperate to transition from performance sportswear to fashion and streetwear , those two lackluster models were significant setbacks . betting on connected fitness also looks like a mistake , as that category has delivered minimal growth despite expensive acquisitions , and under armour recently announced it would stop making connected hardware . meanwhile , under armour 's c-suite has also seen its own share of shake-ups . in november the company 's chief marketing officer and the head of its women 's business departed , and its president of sport fashion also left last year . new coo patrik frisk appears to want fresh blood in the leadership ranks , but such changes can be signs of conflict or dissatisfaction among management with the direction of company . ",
        "even plank himself has acknowledged that he was distracted by other business ventures , including a distillery and horse racing , and pledged to recommit his full attention to under armour . going for the gold . plank 's pledge should be a positive sign , and it 's worth remembering that the company has challenged nike in a way that no other brand since reebok has . still , investors should be mindful that plenty of other wannabes have come and gone in the sneaker game , among them and1 , la gear , british knights , kangaroos , fila , and others . ",
        "under armour 's sales in north america , by far the company 's biggest region , declined 12 % in its most recent quarter . that should set off alarm bells for this supposed growth stock , which still trades at a p/e of 42 . its brand has n't devolved to reebok depths yet , but the company needs a resonant marketing campaign or a product that will get people excited again . pay close attention when the company reports fourth-quarter earnings at the end of the month . under armour normally gets a boost from the holiday season , but analysts are only expecting flat revenue growth and breakeven earnings . ",
        "management 's 2018 earnings guidance will be particularly key . under armour still has time to bail itself out , but if it experiences a few more quarters of double-digit sales declines in north america , the company may be closer to being the next reebok than the next nike .   "
