        "becky vercoe has always loved food . she started working in kitchens at the age of 14 , cooking in cafes and restaurants all over the south island . `` food is a way of bringing people together and creating happiness , and doing something that not everyone can do for people , '' she says . becky worked in cafes , bars and restaurants in christchurch , nelson and the west coast , before moving to marlborough five years ago . she creates food she describes as `` home style comfort '' . for the past four-and-a-half years becky has crafted decadent cakes from her home-based business , mrs vercoe 's cakes . ",
        "but it 's her latest venture , mrs vercoe 's diner , which has locals salivating . `` four years ago on honeymoon in the us we went to ruby 's diner in hollywood and fell in love with the atmosphere and the quick , easy food . so i decided that it was part of my long term goal to come home and create something similar to what we 'd experienced overseas , '' says becky . the american diner became a passion for becky and her husband chris , who returned to the united states of america and canada multiple times - on one visit spending a month travelling from los angeles to new orleans by car , stopping at a different diner in every town . ",
        "the trip was a chance to gather inspiration and sample dishes from truck stops to urban diners . `` we found all sorts of different things that wowed us , '' becky explains . mrs vercoe 's diner is the result of plenty of north american inspiration fused with some kiwi style . the american style eatery on high st in blenheim opened in early october , with hundreds of marlburians rushing to sample becky 's food . `` the response has far exceeded our expectations . i had no idea it would be this crazy , '' becky says . ",
        "`` we started with five staff and now have 11 . we sold over 2000 donuts in our opening week . '' but it 's not only the american-style comfort food that people are visiting for . the decor features red and white booth seats , pop art decals , bar stools , a jukebox and a traditional black and white checked floor . the staff are decked out in flared red check dresses and vibrant red lipstick , adding to the unique atmosphere . `` i really wanted to achieve a style of service that is exceptionally different to the kiwi style of dining , '' becky explains . ",
        "`` i want the girls to sit down to have a chat with customers , find out why they 're here and what they 're all about - giving an individual experience to everyone , '' she adds . becky and her team are working hard to create a lasting impression on those who visit the diner . `` we want people to think about what they 've eaten when they go away and want to come back again , '' she says . her pick from the rather impressive looking menu is the bltc sandwich , which is stacked with bacon , lettuce , tomato , smoked chicken , cheese and mayo . ",
        "`` you know it 's going to be good . ''   "
