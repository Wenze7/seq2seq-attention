        "listening skills are not dead . you can help your students get better at listening . the pacing of classes , especially as students get older require the ability to have fine-tuned listening skills . understanding sequence and ordering of steps is hugely important when considering word problems in math . sometimes we need to almost `` drag '' our students through the work to get the results that we need . how about something that can help shore up these weaknesses and maybe even make them strengths ? keyword understanding from aptus can unlock some of these puzzles for you and help these students with improving their listening and language skills . ",
        "one of the earlier levels in information carrying wordsfirst and foremost , you need to check out `` information carrying words '' within the app . it 's my favorite one to work in right now ! this mini-game targets listening for attributes and target words . while the initial stages can be `` easy '' for some kids , there are other levels that challenge both visual and auditory processing of informationa more complex level in information carrying words `` temporal directions '' allows you to work on those all important `` before '' and `` after '' concepts . ",
        "what 's fantastic about this mini-game is the ability to set levels , type of concept , and the positioning of the concept . in all of the years i have worked on following directions , i highlight positioning of the cues as an important way to `` know '' how to be successful with a direction . it is fantastic to be able to choose this aspect ahead of time . before concepts being targeted in temporal directionsfurthermore , as i have talked about in other posts , the ability to change and adapt levels is crucial for the strength of an app as well as for improving the skills of our students . ",
        "`` temporal directions '' allows you to target one concept in one position on one day , and change it if needed another day . one of my students has been inconsistent in his performance with this mini-game . the flexibility of `` temporal directions '' allows me to move with the student 's skill level easily . check out how you can adjust position of your `` before '' and `` after '' words , or even randomizethis is what it looks like when `` after '' is moved to middle of the sentence `` sequential directions '' give student 's input on first/then directions . ",
        "similar to the other mini-games , there are steady increases in challenge as you go up levels . i find that first/then directions are a great skill to target for some of my speech/language students because it requires them to listen through the whole direction , and not impulsively guess or start too early . this is particularly true for student 's work in classrooms , sometimes they need to wait before doing the next task . what 's nice about the last mini-game `` comprehension check '' is that it breaks skills down into objects , colors , and sizes . ",
        "for some of my students , this is a good assessment to see what they know and do n't know , while for other students , i am happy to get the more basic vocabulary and attributes mastered . once again , you can cycle back to these items when your student shows inconsistency . in the menu screen , there are a lot of options available to tailor for individual students . the ability to set these parameters ahead of time is a great feature . too often , apps or programs can one `` one size , '' and it 's helpful to meet a child 's need with the appropriate level . ",
        "you can set levels , pick the vocabulary , number of trials , and also the kinds of reinforcement . the app uses the built in text to speech feature which i think is superior to a recorded voice . text to speech voices are getting better and better , and i feel as though most people understand them . another outstanding feature is the ability to email scores after completing a level . what a seamless way to communicate with parents , teachers , or monitor data collection . overall , keyword understanding is a comprehensive auditory processing and receptive language application . ",
        "you can set levels , monitor data collection , and help your students with multiple listening challenges . i have already found success with it for some of my students with autism as well as language delays . looking forward to using it with some of my younger students too - especially for following directions . check it out ! if you liked the information you got here , please hold your finger down on the clap button for at least 1 minute - or you can also just tap it 17times ! seriously though , your claps help others to see this information more easily , so feel free to share !
