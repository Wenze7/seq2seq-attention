        "mel kiper has released his first mock draft for the upcoming season , and in some cases it is really surprising . however , kiper did make some predictions that seem to be very likely and logical , such as his guess with who the atlanta falcons may choose at pick 26 . this makes sense because the falcons offense may be losing some slot production with taylor gabriel becoming a free agent , so adding another vertical threat like kirk alongside stud julio jones and mohamed sanu could lead to a lethal trio for matt ryan . kirk had a very productive , yet seemingly underappreciated career at texas a&m . ",
        "he tallied a total of 234 catches , 2,856 yards and 26 touchdown catches in three years . kirk comes off as under-appreciated because when you look at the numbers , he 's actually better than alabama standout calvin ridley . kiper predicted ridley to go no . 8 to the bears . both kirk and ridley played in the same powerhouse conference in the sec , so if the falcons can snag kirk at the end of the round , it may be a steal .
