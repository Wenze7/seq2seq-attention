        "file photo of a mormon church . carson city , nv -- new research indicates a growing number of white americans feel they are the victims of discrimination , and says the perception of bias grew rapidly after barack obama was elected president . the number of white americans who believe they are being discriminated against is rising . according to a recent poll , 55 percent of white americans think they 're facing racial discrimination . clara wilkins , a psychology professor at wesleyan university who studies prejudice , says this perception has grown rapidly since barack obama was elected president . ",
        "wilkins says a subset of white americans saw this not as progress , but as upsetting the social order . but her research finds people who believe the county is `` fair and just '' also are more likely to now see discrimination against white people . `` for people who think society is fair , they 're the ones who sort of ten to think that the order of society where whites have greater access to wealth , power , status , etc. - that is legitimate and it 's fair and it 's not based in bias . ",
        "and so , if you reject those beliefs , you think that it 's not fair , then those are the people who actually welcome social change , '' wilkins said . as wilkins pointed out , the reality is that vast inequalities in wealth and electoral representation still exist for racial minorities . and she sees the growing number of hate groups nationwide after obama 's election as a real danger . observers note that the white supremacists who gathered in charlottesville last summer seemed motivated by what they described as a sense of `` injured entitlement . '' ",
        "wilkins said she 's been able to measure similar feelings . in one study , participants either read an article on racial progress or one that had nothing to do with race . those who read the article on racial progress were more likely to believe white people experience discrimination . and according to wilkins , further research shows this group is n't likely to stay on the sidelines . `` the problem is that for these people who really think that the order of society should be a particular way , what they experience by perceiving bias is that they should do something to re-establish that order , '' wilkins said . ",
        "wilkins said demographic projections showing that white americans will become the minority in the next few decades is contributing to the idea that white people are under attack . she says while fighting back against this perception is hard , the best way might be to downplay the idea of competition between different groups of people .
