        "pittsburgh -- the new england patriots have built a dynasty on second chances . miss an opportunity to bury the super bowl champions and they will find a way to find a way , usually behind a mix of tom brady and rob gronkowski , and defensive playmaking at just the right time . it 's a lesson the pittsburgh steelers have learned through the years , one they were determined to finally learn from this time around . instead , more of the same . ben roethlisberger was intercepted in the end zone with 5 seconds remaining , securing new england 's 27-24 comeback victory sunday built on more brady and gronkowski magic . ",
        "another afc east title , a record ninth in a row . another shot at home-field advantage throughout the afc playoffs . this one came with an assist from the nfl rule book that will add `` surviving the ground '' to the league 's ever-expanding and ever-perplexing lexicon . plus , the risky decision by the steelers quarterback not to spike the ball and set up a tying field goal , which could reverberate well into january . `` it was a tight game , '' said brady , who fed gronkowski repeatedly to set up dion lewis ' go-ahead 8-yard touchdown with 56 seconds remaining . ",
        "`` we just made one more play than they did . `` same as it ever was . the patriots can make sure they do n't have to leave foxborough in january if they finish up the regular season with wins over buffalo and the new york jets . brady finished with 298 yards passing with two touchdowns and an interception . gronkowski , fresh off a one-game suspension , finished with nine receptions for 168 yards , including three on the winning drive . that drive , by the way , started with pittsburgh safety sean davis letting a tipped pass slip off his fingertips . ",
        "instead of a game-sealing interception , the steelers gave new england another shot . brady responded by finding gronkowski for gains of 26 , 26 and 17 yards . `` i think they were trying to challenge us and he made a lot of good plays , '' brady said . `` other guys make a lot of good plays , too , but when he 's open , he gets it . `` it briefly looked like it would n't be enough . the steelers played most of the game without star wide receiver antonio brown , who left in the second quarter with a left calf injury . ",
        "still , the afc north champions gamely hung in and appeared to take the lead when roethlisberger connected with tight end jesse james for a 10-yard touchdown with 28 seconds to go . the play was overturned on review , with official tony corrente explaining that because the ball shifted as james twisted his way into the end zone , it did not `` survive the ground '' and therefore was n't a catch . `` he lost complete control of the football , '' corrente told a pool reporter . that decision that left james stunned . `` i guess i do n't know a lot of things about football , '' james said . ",
        "`` i ca n't call it , obviously . they think they made the right call . i 'm sure we 'll see it over the next couple days . `` probably far longer than that . roethlisberger hit darrius heyward-bey for a short gain on the next snap , but heyward-bey was tackled in bounds . with the clock running and no timeouts , roethlisberger hurried to the line . rather than spike it to set up a short kick , roethlisberger tried to win it . instead , he lost it . his pass to eli rogers was batted into the air , and new england safety duron harmon came down with it . ",
        "the patriots had their fifth straight victory in a series that would feel more like a rivalry if the outcome was n't always the same . `` we 're not going to look back and second-guess anything or anybody , '' roethlisberger said . `` we lost a game and i threw a pick in the end zone at the end of the game to lose it . `` roethlisberger completed 22 of 30 passes for 281 yards with two touchdowns and the pick . le'veon bell ran for 117 yards and added another 48 receiving . still , it did little to take away the sting of a near miss . ",
        "`` i 'm not into moral victories right now , '' roethlisberger said . `` we just lost a game . it does n't sit well . but the season is not over . `` shazier stops bypittsburgh received an early emotional jolt when cameras cut to injured linebacker ryan shazier sitting in a private box less than two weeks removed from spinal stabilization surgery . the crowd at rainy heinz field roared as shazier , who appeared to be seated , waved a terrible towe l . the 25-year-old is recovering from spinal stabilization surgery on dec. . 6 , two days after leaving a monday night victory over cincinnati on a stretcher following a routine hit on bengals wide receiver josh malone . ",
        "`` we had no idea he was going to be here , '' steelers linebacker bud dupree said . `` we were excited . it was good to see him smiling and cheering . `` injuriesthe patriots lost running back rex burkhead with a knee injury in the first half . burkhead did not return . pittsburgh rookie running back james conner exited with a sprained knee in the fourth quarter . up nextnew england : host the bills on christmas eve . the patriots handled the bills 23-3 earlier this month in buffalo . pittsburgh : visits houston on christmas day .
