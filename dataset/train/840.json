        "there is a unique commerce system at work along the narrowest stretch of the tajaparu river in amazonia , northern brazil . this is where the boats pass close to the shore and it is the best place for the small canoes selling sweets and jams to do their business . the children who operate the canoes weave in and out among the boats , shouting directions and warnings to one another as the propellers of ferries churn just below them . they then climb aboard in a bid to sell their wares to the ferry passengers . the best-selling item is the ingas , a jungle fruit that is only found around this stretch of the river and which is much in demand among the ferry passengers . ",
        "but it is a dangerous harvest . the ingas is only found at the top of some trees , often more than 30 metres above ground . four ingas sell for one real , barely $ 0.25 . santos , the captain of the bom jesus , is worried about just how young some of the children who climb aboard his ferry are . `` i keep a list of all the children 's names . there seems to be more of them lately , '' santos explains . `` there are so many now , especially little ones , less than six years old , on their own . ",
        "`` about a dozen canoes attach themselves to the bom jesus as it approaches the shore , but the captain must maintain his speed as he has a schedule to keep to . brazilian law holds a river captain responsible in the case of accidents . `` i let the authorities know about them , because it 's dangerous what they do , especially at night , '' he says . `` i tell them not to do it at night . by day , it 's okay . '' ` sometimes we eat , sometimes we do n't ` fourteen-year-old jesse is among those who risk death just to make a few pennies . ",
        "the little money jesse brings home is a small contribution to his family 's income . his family of 12 adults and 16 children live in a house on stilts over the water . theirs is a life that revolves entirely around the river . jesse 's mother , benedicta , wakes him up each morning to work the river boats . `` my husband 's too old to work now , '' benedicta explains . `` sometimes we get up in the morning and there 's nothing to eat for the whole day . `` we hope there 'll be something for the next day . ",
        "that 's the way it is here ; sometimes we eat , and sometimes we do n't . `` in the amazonian basin , the rivers are the main arteries for virtually everything . the waterways are a constant ebb and flow of people and trade , with barges forming the public transport system - bus , train and tram all rolled into one . the passenger ferries - 1,500 tonnes of iron and steel travelling at 30 km an hour - are the hardest ships to board . but jesse knows the safest place to board is in the bow , far from the dangerous eddies at the stern . ",
        "the trickiest are the merchant ships and barges , whose crews are much less accommodating and do not tolerate the children climbing on board . but the crews have good reason to be cautious . in recent months incidents of piracy have increased on the river . bandits , who hold the merchant boats at gunpoint during the night , use the same type of canoes as the children . the river traders of brazil follows jesse , but his is a story that ends in tragedy . the youngster turns to piracy and is shot dead by the captain of a river barge during an attempted robbery . ",
        "but , as this film shows , life and trade on the river goes on . and for the children of this area , there is little alternative . editor 's note : this film was first broadcast on al jazeera english in 2011 .   "
