        "melbourne - britain 's kyle edmund eliminated us open finalist kevin anderson in his biggest win at a grand slam at the australian open on monday . the 49th-ranked edmund , the only british man in the main draw after five-times finalist andy murray 's injury withdrawal , toughed out a 6-7 , 6-3 , 3-6 , 6-3 , 6-4 win in almost four hours . it reversed his loss to the 11th seeded anderson over five sets in the third round at last year 's french open . edmund 's previous best result at a slam was his defeat of no. 15 richard gasquet in the first round at the 2016 us open . ",
        "`` really good result for me . it was great to win at the end like that , '' he said . `` so many positive reasons . just getting through a tough match like that . also a quality player . had a good year last year , started the year this year really well . `` my first overall thought -- personal satisfaction , the hours you put in , training , so many things like that . those type of results make it . `` anderson is one of the biggest servers on the atp tour and cranked up a total of 35 aces with a 67 percent first serve , yet edmund broke him four times . ",
        "`` kevin just serves himself out of trouble so much . very difficult to read it , ' edmund said . `` so when you get a racquet on the ball , it really has to go in the court . i thought i did a pretty good job . `` it is only the second time he has reached the second round in melbourne , while south african anderson , who lost the 2017 flushing meadows final to rafael nadal , had made the round of 16 in australia three times . the victory set edmund up with an encounter with uzbek journeyman denis istomin . ",
        "`` you know what you 're going to get with him . he 's going to bring out a level that 's going to be tough to beat because he 's that solid player , '' edmund said . by robert smith .   "
