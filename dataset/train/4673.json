        "a parc-extension restaurant is in hot water for allegedly not allowing a blind woman to bring her guide dog into the restaurant , according to cjad news . ottawa resident diane bergeron contacted the radio station , saying that staff at restaurant lyla , a vietnamese eatery on jean-talon west , told her that she could enter the premises , but her dog would need to remain in-between the restaurant 's entrance doors . bergeron is also an executive for the canadian national institute for the blind and is well-acquainted with the laws about service animals , and told the restaurant that it 's a legal requirement to accommodate service animals such as guide dogs . ",
        "`` the dog does n't actually have a right to be in the restaurant . it 's my right to be accompanied by my dog . the dog does n't care if she 's in the restaurant , '' she told cjad 's shuyee lee , adding that it was `` extremely embarrassing '' . the restaurant appears to have admitted to cjad that they barred the woman 's dog : an employee noted to the radio station that a waiter who is scared of dogs was working , and that the restaurant staff were worried about the effect it could have on an allergic customer .
