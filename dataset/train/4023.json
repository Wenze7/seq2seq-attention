        "jerusalem -- israel 's defense minister called sunday for a boycott of arab businesses in an area where residents took part in violent protests against president donald trump 's recognition of jerusalem as israel 's capital . avigdor lieberman , who heads the nationalist yisrael beiteinu party , said the arabs of wadi ara in northern israel were `` not part of us '' and that jewish israelis should no longer visit their villages and buy their products . hundreds of israeli arabs protested saturday along a major highway in northern israel , where dozens of masked rioters hurled stones at buses and police vehicles . ",
        "three israelis were wounded and several vehicles were damaged . `` these people do not belong to the state of israel . they have no connection to this country , '' lieberman told israel 's army radio . `` moreover , i would call on all citizens of israel -- stop going to their stores , stop buying , stop getting services , simply a boycott on wadi ara . they need to feel that they are not welcome here . `` lieberman has long called for wadi ara to be included in his proposed swap of lands and populations as part of a future peace agreement with the palestinians . ",
        "the residents , like many of israel 's arab minority , sympathize with the palestinians of the west bank and often openly identify with them . but they are also israeli citizens who largely reject the notion of becoming part of a future palestinian state . ayman odeh , the head of the arab joint list in parliament , said lieberman 's call for a boycott of arabs was reminiscent of the worst regimes in history . gilad erdan , the minister of public security from the ruling likud party , said that lieberman 's diplomatic plan was not applicable and he rejected the notion of giving up the country 's sovereignty just because it had arab citizens . ",
        "the violent protests were part of the larger palestinian `` day of rage '' following trump 's announcement that he recognized jerusalem as the capital of israel and planned to move the u. s. embassy there . protests and demonstrations took place in dozens of locations across the west bank , east jerusalem and the gaza strip , lands captured by israel during the 1967 war that the palestinians want to be part of their future state . four palestinians were killed in gaza in israeli airstrikes following rocket fire from there and in clashes along the border . overall , however , the three days of protests passed relatively peacefully amid fears that they could spark another violent palestinian uprising . ",
        "the status of jerusalem lies at the core of the israeli-palestinian conflict , and trump 's move was widely perceived as siding with israel . even small crises over jerusalem and the status of the holy sites in its old city have sparked deadly bloodshed in the past . trump 's announcement triggered denunciations from around the world , even from close allies , that suggested he had needlessly stirred more conflict in an already volatile region . in israel , the move was embraced as a long overdue acknowledgement of israel 's seat of parliament and government and the historic capital of the jewish people dating back 3,000 years . ",
        "upon departing for a diplomatic visit to paris and brussels , prime minister benjamin netanyahu said he was prepared to respond to critics . `` while i respect europe , i am not prepared to accept a double standard from it . i hear voices from there condemning president trump 's historic statement but i have not heard condemnations of the rockets fired at israel or the terrible incitement against it , '' he said . `` i am not prepared to accept this hypocrisy , and as usual at this important forum i will present israel 's truth without fear and with head held high .
