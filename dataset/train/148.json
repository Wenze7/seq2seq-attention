        "by mark matousekwhile tesla is n't expected to start producing its electric semi-truck , the semi , until 2019 , a video showing what may be a prototype of the truck was uploaded to youtube on january 17 . the seven-second clip shows the truck driving down a residential street in sunnyvale , california , which is located between the company 's factory in fremont and its palo alto headquarters . the truck is not hauling any cargo in the video . the semi has impressive features , including a 500-mile range per charge , the ability to drive 400 miles on a 30-minute charge , the ability to go from 0-60 mph in five seconds without any cargo and in 20 seconds while carrying 80,000 pounds of cargo , which will make the vehicle a significant test of tesla 's production capabilities . ",
        "the company has struggled in the early stages of production for each of its vehicles so far . most recently , ceo elon musk revealed the company did n't come close to reaching its 2017 production goals for the model 3 , its first mass-market electric car . the companies who have pre-ordered the semi so far , including pepsi , walmart , and anheuser-busch , may not be as patient as consumers if tesla ca n't hit its production timeline . the model 3 's production troubles have n't had a significant negative impact on tesla 's stock price so far , but a handful of frustrated , big-name clients could begin to scare investors if the company ca n't deliver on its promises for the semi .
