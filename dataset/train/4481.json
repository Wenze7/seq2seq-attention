        "it 's got a whole ranger games now . i never thought i 'd see wasteland 2 and nintendo switch in the same sentence but here we are . inxile boss brian fargo has tweeted a picture of the wasteland 2 : director 's cut menu on a switch console . it prompted a mild frenzy , which in turn prompted fargo to say , `` i have to give props to nintendo owners for your love of the machine . my wasteland switch screenshot had the quickest traction of most anything i 've ever tweeted . `` no details were shared other than confirmation the team which ported a bard 's tale to ios and android will handle the conversion , although i 'm not sure which team that is . ",
        "wasteland 2 heading to switch bodes well for other isometric role-playing games of a similar ilk - games like pillars of eternity and divinity : original sin 1 . all three are already available on ps4 and xbox one so presumably the conversion work wo n't be colossal . perhaps torment : tides of numenera could make the transition too . wasteland 2 , a poster-game of the kickstarter revolution , came out three years ago now . `` computer rpg fans have n't had it this good in ages , '' wrote an impressed rich cobbett in his wasteland 2 review . ",
        "in the years since , inxile has released torment : tides of numenera , a thematic successor to planescape : torment , and is currently developing not only bard 's tale 4 but also wasteland 3 .   "
