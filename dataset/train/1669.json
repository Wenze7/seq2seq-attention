        "in recent weeks , we have seen tensions between saudi arabia and iran skyrocket to unprecedented levels . both countries have been hurling accusations at one another , from the saudis `` interfering in lebanon 's internal affairs '' to iran 's `` act of war '' . despite all the sudden hype in the media about how the two middle-eastern hegemons are on the verge of war , the saudis will not sacrifice their remaining ounce of political stability for a conflict they would , without a doubt , lose . saudi arabia has , for a long time , been dependent upon their historical ally - the united states . ",
        "although the united states would not be willing to make colossal sacrifices for a clear no-win situation , especially when its own strategic interests are not directly in the crosshairs . instead the us has other plans . saudi arabia 's usefulness has expired and it is time for the kingdom to be divided whilst its banks and oil-rich lands are drained to fuel future american endeavours in the region : divide et impera . taking a leaf out of iran 's book , the us has been baiting the saudis with their words . on 14 december , nikki haley , the us envoy to the united nations , presented evidence of `` illegal iranian weapons proliferation '' , declaring that that iran had been supplying the houthi rebels in yemen with short-range ballistic missiles which were later fired at saudi arabia . ",
        "interestingly , the evidence was declassified and inspection from other nations was permitted . the question on everybody 's mind is ` how long until we see a military confrontation ? ' - the simple answer to that question would be : an eternity . exploring the situation in more detail , this bitter rivalry is not a new concept ; imperial iran , a rapidly westernising empire under mohammad reza shah , was also considered a geopolitical enemy by its neighbours . the only difference between the past and the present is that it is now more about religion than culture - and all of iran 's ties with america and israel are disguised . ",
        "the saudis have been quick to liken any iranian moves to `` an act of war '' or `` direct military aggression . '' however , these words will not be coupled with any physical response , owing to the extensive iranian proxy network in the region . over the past decade , iran has been expanding its sphere of influence , developing an intricate web of proxies throughout the region ; which ultimately provides the upper hand in any conflict and is therefore a device for deterrence against proximate military aggressors . take the recent houthi missile launches on riyadh as examples where iran has used its proxies to threaten its adversaries . ",
        "general hossein salami of the revolutionary guards warned saudi arabia that if they or their allies used military force against iran , the houthis would not hesitate to release a barrage of missiles upon the kingdom . this leads onto the failing saudi-led intervention in yemen , where after two and a half years a stalemate still persists . if the saudis can not attain a swift victory against rebels in yemen , how would they fare against an opponent which outnumbers them on land , sea , and air . furthermore , trade is pertinent topic for discussion - especially in relation to oil . ",
        "iran has exercised control over one of the world 's most strategic chokepoint , the strait of hormuz , where an approximate 19 million barrels of oil passes through daily . gulf nations depend heavily upon the revenues from oil exportation out of the persian gulf , any disruption in the strait could have disastrous effects for not only the exporter but the importers who rely on timely delivery . saudi arabia has maintained crude oil exports at around 7 million barrels per day , with most of this liquid gold forced to pass through the straits of hormuz due to limited options . ",
        "the east-west petroline which the saudis use to direct oil to the red sea only maintains a maximum capacity of 4.8 million barrels of oil per day , and other pipelines such as the trans-arabian pipeline are out of service due to war damage , disuse and political and military conflict . so far we have looked into the issues of security and long-term economic devastation , but to complete the triad there is also the topic of political instability within saudi arabia 's borders . with king salman 's health deteriorating , his son and future successor , mohammad bin salman , has been exercising his powers to excess . ",
        "mbs 's brash and reckless style of leadership has presented him with a plethora of enemies , especially after the waves of ` anti-corruption ' investigations which have proven to be nothing more than an opportunity for mbs to solidify his position by sweeping his rivals under the rug . not only has the crown prince disturbed the balance amongst the nobility , but after declaring that he will reduce the tonality of islam , he is also a cause of concern for the clergy and conservative islamists of which there are many . mbs would have a hard time justifying any long-term military conflict if those who command the civilian population are against him . ",
        "for saudi arabia to enter into a large-scale warfare under these conditions would create such an uproar in the political scene that the iranian ` threat ' would be the least of their worries . how does the ` democratic republic of hejaz and nejd ' sound ?   "
