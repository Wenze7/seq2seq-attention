        "the u. s. department of labor just announced that it will abandon its six-part test for determining whether interns qualify as employees after yet another court favored the alternative , primary beneficiary test . as we have blogged about before , the agency historically has taken the position that six factors control whether an intern of a for-profit employer is , in fact , an employee . the usdol 's articulated test required that each and every factor be met to exclude the individual from the flsa 's minimum wage and overtime protections . but with friday 's announcement , the agency instead lined up with a number of federal courts that have adopted a more flexible approach . ",
        "overwhelming lack of support for usdol test by federal courtsin recent years , there has been a wave of litigation filed by `` interns '' across various industries . however , the four federal circuit courts that have faced the question have consistently rejected the usdol 's clunky , all-or-nothing approach . instead , the courts favored adopting some version of a primary beneficiary test , whereby they may be guided by several different , non-dispositive factors that seek to determine who receives more of the benefit from the internship arrangement . most recently in benjamin v. b&h education , inc. , the ninth circuit court of appeals expressly rejected the `` rigid '' test adopted by the usdol , and instead adopted the primary beneficiary test as articulated by the second circuit . ",
        "this test focuses on the economic realities of the relationship , weighing and balancing seven different factors : 1 . the extent to which the intern and the employer clearly understand that there is no expectation of compensation . any promise of compensation , express or implied , suggests that the intern is an employee -- and vice versa . 2 . the extent to which the internship provides training that would be similar to that which would be given in an educational environment , including the clinical and other hands-on training provided by educational institutions . 3 . the extent to which the internship is tied to the intern 's formal education program by integrated coursework or the receipt of academic credit . ",
        "4 . the extent to which the internship accommodates the intern 's academic commitments by corresponding to the academic calendar . 5 . the extent to which the internship 's duration is limited to the period in which the internship provides the intern with beneficial learning . 6 . the extent to which the intern 's work complements , rather than displaces , the work of paid employees while providing significant educational benefits to the intern . 7 . the extent to which the intern and the employer understand that the internship is conducted without entitlement to a paid job at the conclusion of the internship . ",
        "shortly after the recent ninth circuit decision was released , the usdol issued a press release which `` clarified that going forward , the department will conform to these appellate court rulings by using the same ` primary beneficiary ' test that these courts use to determine whether interns are employees under the flsa . '' the agency has updated fact sheet # 71 to reflect the more flexible test , though it remains to be seen exactly how it will address the test in its weightier materials . bottom linesince no circuit court adopted the usdol 's test , the agency 's decision to abandon it and adopt the standard accepted by these circuit courts is not surprising . ",
        "having said that , the decision does n't necessarily mean that it will be easier to properly establish non-employee internships . an employer that currently has unpaid interns , or is considering unpaid interns in the future , should be very deliberate and strategic in its actions . decision makers should carefully review the primary beneficiary test with legal counsel before concluding that the interns are , in fact , non-employees for flsa or other purposes .
