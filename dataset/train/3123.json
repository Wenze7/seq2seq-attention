        "henry bolton hits back at critics after he is seen meeting former girlfriend who sent racist textspeter walker and jessica elgotthe ukip leader , henry bolton , has admitted he is still in love with his former girlfriend after their relationship ended amid allegations she had sent racist text messages . bolton said he had been the victim of an internal plot to oust him , comparing his time as leader to facing the taliban . `` i 'm going nowhere , '' the ex-british army officer told the telegraph . `` i have seen people die , i have seen people blown up , i have seen people shot . ",
        "even the taliban does n't quite prepare you for ukip , though . '' bolton , who has been facing calls from within his own party to resign , said he and his former girlfriend jo marney had been through a difficult time , after the pair were spotted together at a restaurant in westminster . marney was revealed to have made racial slurs in text messages including against meghan markle , prince harry 's fiancee . bolton said he had broken off the relationship and marney has been suspended from the party , with bolton due to have his conduct examined by ukip 's national executive committee on sunday . ",
        "overnight , bolton wrote on facebook that an `` organised coup and insurgency against my leadership of our party has begun '' . `` prominent individuals both inside and outside the party have cooperated with leftwing media to intentionally destabilise the party during this time and turn the members against me , '' he wrote . `` i was elected to lead this party and shall continue doing so against interest groups that i will unveil . '' on thursday , bolton told the telegraph he would not rule out rekindling his relationship with marney , for whom he left his wife shortly before christmas . ",
        "`` i do n't rule it out , not at all , '' he said . asked if he still loved her , bolton said : `` yeah , absolutely . `` this is all pretty fast and furious . there 's pressure to really understand what our relationship is . the feelings are there . `` i have to say that in that brief time we had ... i have n't been that happy in many years . that relaxed , that comfortable . she needs to sort her life out , i need to sort my life out . ",
        "we will see what happens going forward . '' the ukip leader said he had found marney to be `` politically very aware '' when they met in a pub and began talking about immigration . bill etheridge , a ukip mep and former leadership candidate , resigned as a party spokesman over the row and called for bolton to go `` before his ego finally drags the party down '' . suzanne evans , a former ukip deputy leader , also said she expected bolton to either resign or be sacked because of how he handled his relationship . ",
        "should bolton resign or be forced out , the party would need to seek its fourth leader since mid-2016 , when nigel farage resigned after the eu referendum .   "
