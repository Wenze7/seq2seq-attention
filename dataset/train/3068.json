        "a new 13-hour clock has been created so women can work longer and and reduce the gender pay gap . in a tongue-in-cheek video made by the public service association , it also suggests a 13-month calendar would allow more time to make up the 12 per cent more a man in new zealand earns than his female colleague in the same job . the psa say the video is intended to be `` tongue-in-cheek '' , but it serves as a `` visual reminder that when it comes to fairness at work , we 've still got a long way to go '' . ",
        "the psa has been campaigning for equal pay for more than 100 years . read more : psa national secretary erin polaczuk said the office stationery for working women kit is `` a tongue-in-cheek solution to a very serious problem '' . `` all we need to do to fix pay discrimination in aotearoa is ensure women have an extra hour a day or an extra month a year , '' she said . the kit , with the clock and calendar , has been sent to prominent women across new zealand . polaczuk said the idea of women working these extra hours for free should be upsetting to new zealanders . ",
        "`` women and men should be paid the same for the same number of hours worked , because equal pay is a human right . '' currently , women in new zealand earn 12 per cent less on average than men doing the same job . for mƒÅori women , the gender pay gap is 23 per cent and for pasifika women it is 27.9 percent , according to statistics nz data . according to the psa the government is one of the worst offenders , with some gender pay gaps in the state services being more than 35 per cent . ",
        "`` while we have a supportive government ready to stand up for women 's rights to fair and equal treatment , when it comes to equal pay , we 've still got a way to go , '' polaczuk said .   "
