        "washington - us president donald trump 's decision to freeze aid to pakistan could affect almost two billion dollars ' worth of assistance , a senior administration official said on friday -- substantially more than first thought . after an announcement designed to force pakistan 's military and intelligence apparatus to cut support for the taliban and other islamist groups , the official said that both us military assistance and afghanistan coalition funding to islamabad could be suspended . it is `` approximately two billion worth of equipment and coalition support funding that is in play , '' the official said on condition of anonymity . ",
        "after more than a decade of simmering us anger at links between islamabad and the taliban and the haqqani network -- a taliban affiliate -- president donald trump is trying to draw a line in the sand . on the hook is almost $ 1 billion of us military equipment that has allowed pakistan access to advanced military technology , but also funding that is meant to pay pakistan for helping get us and nato materiel into afghanistan . analysts believe the united states is highly unlikely to freeze all that funding , which totals $ 1.9 billion , according to the source . ",
        "us officials have already indicated that there could be `` exemptions '' for programs deemed vital to us national security -- likely including cash for keeping pakistan 's nuclear weapons safe . but nevertheless , the total figure of $ 1.9 billion is much higher than first indicated and is a signal of washington 's seriousness . the senior administration official said `` all options are on the table '' when it comes to further moves , including stripping pakistan of its status as a `` major non-nato ally '' or calling in vital imf loans . the white house is demanding pakistan crack down on taliban elements and other groups that raise funds and take refuge in the border areas with afghanistan . ",
        "it believes that a pakistani crackdown could be pivotal in deciding the outcome of the war in afghanistan -- entering its 17th year -- by weakening the taliban militarily and forcing the organization to the negotiating table . us officials believe that pakistan 's inter-services intelligence agency and other military bodies have long helped fund and arm the taliban for ideological reasons , but also to counter rising indian influence in afghanistan . islamabad denies those allegations and has called trump 's decision to threaten funding `` counterproductive . `` pakistan 's foreign ministry issued a cautious statement in which it said it was `` engaged '' with us officials and awaiting further details . ",
        "without referring to the decision directly , it warned that `` arbitrary deadlines , unilateral pronouncements and shifting goalposts are counterproductive in addressing common threats . `` the announcement ignited some small protests in pakistan on friday , including in chaman , one of the two main crossings on the border with afghanistan where several hundred people gathered to chant anti-us slogans . us officials admit that pakistan could make life difficult for washington by closing land routes that are vital to supply us troops in afghanistan . but , the official said , it was `` difficult but not impossible '' to find other ways to get equipment in .
