        "people want to be smart by default . you can see it in the way a child becomes frustrated if another child understands faster whatever information . the manipulated gets information and arguments and chains of inference and deduction with no effort . they do not verify information because they have the same . human problem with giving back what it was given in the first place to them for free . manipulation is simple information economics . you ca n't beat free . the truth is luxury . the second best is common sense . the mass market is manipulation . ",
        "the only way to control anticompetitive practices is to make them against the law . manipulation is unfair information competition . good information has high cognitive cost . poor information is dumped on the market with no price tag attached . in this sense any media that transmits information free of cognitive load should be highly scrutinized and if the information is found to be wrong fined up to license withdrawal . i think information economy should be taken out of the scope of morals . currently we think of truth in all the wrong ways . truth as character , or moral choice , truth as obligation , we even expect the truth . ",
        "in our reality though , truth is nothing but a bare merchandise . it is handled as merchandise and priced accordingly . it is also in high demand , therefore very expensive . it requires craftsmanship to obtain , therefore it is a luxury merchandise . common sense is innate in most people , therefore highly available . it does have a cost and the cost is highly dependent on distribution of biological traits and social circumstances across the populace . sometimes common sense is very expensive . just like water , for example , is abundant in places where it is wasted and free , and in places is a pricy thing to obtain . ",
        "everything else is manipulation . manipulation is all non neutral information . non neutral information contains a desired direction of conclusions manipulation is free and widely available because it is cheap to make , cheap to bite and , most important , cheap to understand . the cognitive cost of accepting manipulation is extremely low . the effect of having a rich and complex , albeit distorted and argument filled , network of information is very desirable . i think that a manipulated human , one who has taken on the full depth of misinformation on some subject , has the same level of intellectual reward feedback as a recognized world leading expert . ",
        "it is important to remember that we do n't need a ministry of truth . it would be the same as having a ministry of kitsch .   "
