        "los angeles - with an acclaimed starring role in `` the shawshank redemption '' and an oscar nomination for directing `` dead man walking , '' tim robbins owes many of his career highlights to the prison system . but the 59-year-old hollywood star 's interest in criminal justice and the incarcerated extends far beyond his efforts to win critical approval or awards . over a decade , robbins has made a dramatic dent in reoffending rates among californian prisoners taking part in a drama program that encourages hardened criminals to put on make-up and get in touch with their emotions . ",
        "`` we 're not in there to make theater with them , we 're not there to do plays with them , and we 're certainly not there to turn them into actors , '' he says at a presentation on the prison project in downtown los angeles . `` we do n't want them coming out and competing with us -- particularly if they are good , '' he jokes . `` but it does provide them with a path , a path that leads toward transformation . '' crime rates in the us are at historic lows , yet incarcerations have soared since the 1970s , with 2.3 million american prisoners making up almost a quarter of the world 's prison population . ",
        "california has among the highest recidivism rates nationwide , yet in 2008 all public funding to prison arts programs was cut , despite evidence of their positive impact . the prison project brings together rival gang members , convicted murderers and white supremacists in workshops where it is not taboo to express emotions , as it is elsewhere in prison . groups of inmates sit in white make-up and masks , improvising scenes as stock characters from the 16th century italian commedia dell ` arte movement that represent happiness , sadness , fear or anger . - ` rough crowd ' - `` in prison , there 's one appropriate emotion : anger . ",
        "to survive you have your angry face on , you have to project an aura of invincibility and toughness , '' says robbins . `` you do not express fear or sadness , and the only happiness you express usually has to do with mocking someone , not true joy . `` robbins says the workshops have a transformative effect on inmates , allowing them `` a safe zone '' to express feelings that had been buried , in some cases for decades . before long , participants begin to realize that they can be the master of their emotions in real life as well as in drama workshops . ",
        "born near los angeles to a devoutly roman catholic folk singer father , robbins moved with his family to new york 's greenwich village , where he began performing at the age of 12 . the actor , who won an oscar for 2003 's `` mystic river , '' often muses that he might have ended up behind bars like several of his friends , but for the good fortune of having discovered theater . `` the kids i ran with were a rough crowd . in order to prove yourself on the streets of new york you had to be tough , or fast , '' robbins says . ",
        "`` i learned how to be both . `` he moved to los angeles in his 20s and founded experimental collective the actors ' gang in 1981 along with young artists from his college , including john cusack . british actress sabra williams joined up and , in 2006 , came up with the idea for the prison project , having been inspired by the benefits of work she had done in jails back home as a member of the royal shakespeare company . - ` hug a thug ' liberals - dismissed initially as another band of well-meaning but essentially useless `` hug a thug '' liberals , robbins and williams have proved that their approach works . ",
        "the return-to-prison rate in california has been as high as 67.5 percent in recent years , according to a recent study by the california department of corrections and rehabilitation . encouraging preliminary data for inmates who completed the prison project , according to the department , showed that number dropped to 10.6 percent . and a 2015 study by impact justice showed an 89 percent drop in in-custody offenses for inmates participating in the prison project . the program has expanded into 12 california prisons , two community re-entry programs and two juvenile detention centers and , thanks to relentless lobbying by williams , funding for arts in prison has been reinstated . ",
        "last year , governor jerry brown made $ 6 million available for california 's arts in corrections program and all 35 of the state 's prisons now have some kind of publicly funded arts -- up from exactly zero a decade ago . `` if i were to tell you i had developed a pharmaceutical that could reduce recidivism to 10 percent and reduce in-prison infractions by 89 percent , you 'd fast-track that drug and have it in every inmates ' mouth , '' robbins said . `` this is a public safety issue . you ca n't keep people in prison forever , they 're going to get out at some point .
