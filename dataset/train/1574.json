        "on november 28th 2017 , i did the first big step to achieve my dream . i know this is just the beginning and that the first try might not be so successful , but at least i 'm doing something about it . so what happened ? i made the decision of incorporating a company in the state of delaware , united states of america . it was a big decision for me , but i finally did it . so , here is what happened . i had to decide whether to form a llc or a c-corp business type . ",
        "i had to do some intensive research on which direction to go to . if you do a google search you 'll find a lot of conflicting information about this topic . some people say , `` its a mistake to form a c-corp instead of an llc as a startup '' , while others say `` it 's a mistake to form an llc instead of a c-corp '' . this was driving me nuts that i end up asking a friend of mine why he formed his company as an llc and not a c-corp and he did mention some good points . ",
        "however , i ended up following this advise from startup lawyer ; i formed a c-corp . to be honest , i was actually really afraid that i would have to take care of a lot of requirements by the state to maintain a c-corp company while i do n't have any revenue or customers or even a complete product yet . nonetheless , i end up adjusting my brain to ` not give a f *** and just do it ' . fast forward -- i have a co-founder who provided the seed capital to form this company . ",
        "he is an american citizen and might potentially be my little sister 's husband soon . i 'm not sure how much he can help me running this company because i do n't think he is really qualified but at least for now i trust him . i do n't have american citizenship therefore , i think it would have been more complicated and take longer to form this company without his help . in addition , we only have two things pending to start and actually get a product in the market ; open a bank account , finalize our business address and partner with a potential b2b company . ",
        "after that , building the app/website would n't take more than a month to build and allow customers to signup . hopefully we get those three things done by the end of this month . it would be a great reason to celebrate the end of this year if we partner up with another company soon . by the way , i do n't know what i 'm doing . i literary feel like the following meme : my knowledge in law is minimal . i only know some business concepts from my mba degree that is useful to manage this company but i still do n't think its enough . ",
        "got ta keep reading more and sleeping less . oh , well ! i 'll keep my stories updated here in medium when i have more time .   "
