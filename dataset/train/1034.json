        "both of these teams are in desperate need of a win in order to try and turn their conference season around . so , who comes away with the victory ? tv schedule : thursday , jan. . 11 , 8:00 p. m. et , fs1arena : state farm center in champaign , illinoisthis is a battle between the lone two teams who have yet to win a big ten game so far this season . both teams have a lot to improve on , but also have some young talent that makes the future bright . for illinois , consistency is the key . ",
        "there have been multiple games that the illini have put together one good half but just ca n't put a full game together . they have been in multiple games that they have lost down the stretch , which is very frustrating for the fans . believe it or not , the illini may not be out of the ncaa tournament race just yet . last season , brad underwood had a very similar situation at oklahoma state , as his cowboys team started off the year losing their first six big 12 conference games . he is known for developing his teams as the season goes on , so it would n't be a surprise if illinois was able to rattle off some wins in the coming weeks . ",
        "but , this is an absolute must-win game for the illini at home . on the other hand , iowa may have solidified themselves as the worst team in the conference after their disappointing and subpar performance to begin the season . the hawkeyes have no quality wins on their resume and have gotten blown out on multiple occasions this season . this hawkeyes team was expected to be one of the better teams in the conference this year after returning the majority of their players from last year 's bubble team . but , they are really missing the leadership of peter jok , as they ca n't seem to find that toughness and togetherness that jok gave them . ",
        "in this game , the key will be whether iowa can handle illinois ' pressure and if the illini can take advantage of turnovers . they average 8.0 steals per game , which is second in the big ten . iowa has also really struggled defensively in big ten play as well , so it will be interesting to see how they manage the illini attack . a key matchup to watch in this game will be between post players leron black of illinois and tyler cook of iowa . these guys have been the leaders of their respective teams so far , so expect them to go right at each other in this one . ",
        "next : current bracketologyall in all , the illini are the better team and are 9-1 at home this year . they should handle the hawkeyes and get their first conference win of underwood 's young illinois career . prediction : illinois 78 -- iowa 68more from busting brackets nc state basketball : blake harris transfers to the wolf pack34m ago xavier at villanova : college basketball game preview , tv , prediction2h ago wichita state basketball : what makes the shockers a contender ? 3h ago big ten basketball : week 9 power rankings8h ago duke basketball : 5 questions for the blue devils against pittsburgh23h ago both of these teams are in desperate need of a win in order to try and turn their conference season around .
