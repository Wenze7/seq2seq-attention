        "the former bake off champion said she found skating difficult . candice brown has said she was `` upset '' to be the first celebrity to be voted off dancing on ice . the former great british bake off champion , who lost in the skate-off against singer lemar on sunday night , also said that taking part in the show was the `` hardest '' thing she has ever done . asked on itv 's this morning about her departure , the 33-year-old said : `` i was upset . i 've loved every single second of it . ",
        "`` there has not been one day since i started this where i thought ` i do n't want to do this today ' . '' brown and professional partner matt evers received the fewest votes in the first show of the series , so had to compete against the lowest-placed competitors in the latest outing . she faced lemar and his partner melody le moal on the ice in a bid to hold on to her place in the competition . judges jason gardiner and ashley banjo chose to save brown , while jayne torvill opted to save lemar and head judge christopher dean cast the deciding vote to save lemar . ",
        "asked by this morning hosts phillip schofield and holly willoughby , who also present dancing on ice , if she had assumed she was safe from elimination at first , brown said : `` i did n't think anything . `` i did n't know how it was going to go ; we 'd watched lemar and he was amazing , we were stood there cheering him on . he was incredible . '' evers praised brown for working hard to improve in the week between shows . `` she put in so much time and so much effort , the big improvement that everybody noticed -- it 's night and day , '' he said . ",
        "brown said of the experience : `` it was the hardest thing i have ever done . i had to ask how to bow two weeks ago , and i 've been practising my smile every day . '' evers added that brown , who won bake off in 2016 , lacks television experience , and that he had to `` teach her what a tv camera looks like '' and `` what it feels like to be in the spotlight , to bow , to be live in front of an audience '' . brown said of evers : `` i just adore him . ",
        "he has taught me more than anybody will ever realise about myself . `` three months ago , if someone said to me ` you 're going to be spinning around , upside down , holding on to matt 's boot , then you 're going to land it , then you 're going to snog his face off on live television ' , i 'd have gone ` no ! ' '' brown 's comments came as it was revealed that the second episode of dancing on ice , which has been rebooted after a four-year absence from screens , dropped nearly one million viewers compared with the launch episode . ",
        "sunday 's programme was watched by an average of 6.5 million viewers , compared with the series ' opener the previous week , which pulled in an average overnight audience of 7.4 million .   "
