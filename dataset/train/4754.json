        "around 160 requests a day were made in late 2017 to access pornography websites from computers within the houses of parliament , britain 's press association reported monday . a total of 24,473 attempts were made since last june 's general election from devices connected to the parliamentary network , according to data obtained by a pa freedom of information request . prime minister theresa may is already reeling from a wave of sexual misconduct allegations in westminster . she was forced to dump minister and long-time friend damian green last month after he apparently misled police over claims pornography was found on computers in his westminster office in 2008 . ",
        "the parliamentary internet network is used by mps , lords in the upper house and their staff . authorities claim most attempts are not deliberate and point to a decrease in recent years . parliament blocked 113,208 attempts in 2016 , down from 213,020 the previous year . `` all pornographic websites are blocked by parliament 's computer network , '' a parliamentary spokesman said . `` the vast majority of ` attempts ' to access them are not deliberate . `` this data also covers personal devices used when logged on to parliament 's guest wi-fi .
