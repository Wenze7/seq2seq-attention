        "well , i believe it 's time to start with this question . how could `` this '' affect my life ? to start off , i 'd like to say that there have been many things that i have previously wished were in my life . events that i have dreamt of living , pursuing my passion for mental health , my purpose , to having a romantic relationship with someone special and so much more . but you know none of those dreams or wishes will come true until i put in the work to make the right progress to reach my destination ; my goal , my wish coming true . ",
        "to share the rest , what is explained next will cover remotely enough from where i 've left off ! you know you can relate when others actually put the effort and choice to speak of things that can be hard to hear . though it can be easier to relate . but with the one i have in mind is not exactly the one you may be thinking of . and that i believe is having all those high expectations of how we want our life to be and to follow a timeline . dating someone special , reaching the stage of the `` l '' word : `` i love you '' , marriage , starting a family , career changes , and so on . ",
        "but not necessarily in that order . and it can really disappoint you when your life does n't look or end up nearly to what you had expected . you thought it all through though you were missing a key ingredient . i 'm not gon na tell you by giving you a label precisely but more relating it to a quote : `` dreams do n't work unless you do '' . get what i 'm saying here ? as hard as it may be to actually put the right kind of energy , and work to make progress towards our goals and dreams , we know if we want it badly enough and remind ourselves of that , we can use it as motivation to keep holding on and keep making progress towards the results we want . ",
        "to basically make our dreams a reality ! and the other thing here is that we can get lost and caught up in what we want in our dreams , we lose sight and track of what 's going on in reality and things get messy and people get hurt . multi-tasking can cause little and big injuries . so if we wan na keep a good mind and a good vision of what we want and making the right steps towards achieving it , we got ta do our best to put it into reality without getting into what others believe and losing sight of the main objective or goal at hand . ",
        "such as dreams like ours being impossible or rather to say unrealistic , or a waste of time . it can be hard not to listen to them . because being negative and hopeless is just as easy as doing things in the lounge mode . lounging around on your day off which is n't bad , wrong in any way . but when it comes to being positive , staying strong and doing any kind of hard work ; it takes a lot in someone to fully succeed and achieve at . in the meantime , it 's good to focus on what we can actually gain once we have reached our goals or dreams . ",
        "but just as important , be in the present moment to prevent any small or big injuries . keep your mind focused on one thing at a time . and just do what you need to do to succeed in the normal day to day stuff and let life handle the rest . though i got ta admit , i 'm not too comfortable with letting life handle the rest . you know because if you do n't put any effort , it wo n't happen , like your dreams . though as long as you are making process in any area one moment at a time , doing everything you normally do , everything else will just fall into place . ",
        "as hard and challenging as this may be , i know i should and i 'm more than committed to doing all i need to and letting life do the rest ! `` do n't look back with regret ; move forward with hope . '' ~ unknown .   "
