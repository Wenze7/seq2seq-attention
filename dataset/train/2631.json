        "on crocodile tearsblack mirror season 4 episode 6 : black museumas a rule , each episode of black mirror presents a new faustian bargain : technology extends our mortality , community , or knowledge at the price of unforeseen consequences . viewers recognize technologies of the present , while charlie brooker teases excitement in what their futures might hold , and horror at the new realities they 're creating . season 4 delivers another critique : we 're already living in the future of an earlier time , with its own exuberances and horrors -- the future world of cars . ",
        "~ 100 years ago , the age of the automobile ushered in rapid personal transportation for human civilization . it also delivered one of the the leading causes of death among children and adults , a force that , though normalized , ca n't be understated . black mirror reminds us that we 're the inhabitants of that age . crocodile opens to a night and morning of drugs , sex , and driving , set to goldfrapp 's ` strict machine . ' as rob and mia cruise across expanses of icelandic mountains , we could very well be in a car commercial . ",
        "technologies of driving and neurochemistry unlock new and heretofore unimagined freedoms for our protagonists , until things devolve into a hit-and-run : in a moment , someone is killed by the driver . human finitude -- of awareness , response time and control -- mixes with1 ,500 kilos of metal , for a life-defining tragedy , one that 's repeated 1.25 million times per year according to the world health organization 's last count in 2012 . likewise , in black museum , a new family is irrevocably destroyed when the mother steps back for a quick photo : should have used a selfie stick ! ",
        "besides these two instances , crocodile features a collision between a self-driving-pizza-truck and a musician : while archangel presents a near miss with a truck , as a girl walks to school . in all , a season of only six episodes features four near-fatal encounters with cars . despite this staggering frequency , cars barely register as a theme of the show , and receive little mention in post-season criticism . charles bramesco suggests that the title of the episode crocodile might allude to crocodile tears -- hypocritical displays of sadness and emotion -- shed by mia . instead , let 's imagine that the eponymous crocodile tears are those shed by the audience : aghast at the near future horrors presented across four seasons of black mirror , but inured to the tragedies of technologies of the present .
