        "the new year is off to a chilly start in san antonio -- and across much of the nation -- with a low of 26 degrees reported here monday and even colder conditions forecast in coming days . the national weather service , which reported freezing drizzle overnight in the alamo city and a trace of snowfall near austin , issued a winter weather advisory early monday that should last until nightfall . sleet and snow are possible on monday throughout the region , according to nws meteorologist yvette benavides , who sees little chance of snow accumulation except on raised structures such as bridges and overpasses . ",
        "`` we 're probably not really going to reach much above freezing on monday , '' she said . `` it 's going to stay cold on tuesday , with a high only forecast of 35 degrees . '' despite gusting winds , freezing temperatures and scattered precipitation , no road closures or major travel problems were reported by sheriff 's dispatchers in area counties early monday . `` all the roads are clear , to our knowledge . no ice or anything , '' said a gillespie county sheriff 's department staffer . `` it 's looking pretty good . '' ",
        "a comal county dispatcher said 2018 came in on a quiet note , noting , `` it 's too cold for anybody to do anything . '' a dispatcher at the department of public safety office in san antonio said , `` we have n't had any major crashes or anything else going on . i heard that it 's supposed to get worse , so who knows . `` the arctic air mass that sent shivers across the country in recent days is expected to persist until the weekend . the coldest temperatures here this week should arrive tuesday night and early wednesday , dropping to 22 degrees , before a warming trend pushes temperatures back above freezing . ",
        "`` it 's still going to be pretty cold all the way up until saturday , '' she said , noting a high of only about 50 degrees is forecast friday and saturday , with lows around 39 degrees . as cold as it was for new year 's revelers celebrating outdoors , benavides said it was n't close to the historic low of 19 degrees recorded in 1928 for jan. . 1 .
