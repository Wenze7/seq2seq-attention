        "live toronto more streams the number of toronto police officers quitting the force is at the highest level seen in five years , according to data obtained by cbc toronto . as of dec. . 11 , 86 uniformed police officers resigned from the force in 2017 , with more than half of the officers who left opting to join another police force . the police service , which does n't conduct exit interviews , says that 's due in part to aggressive recruitment plans from neighbouring forces , but the union representing police disagree . the union , which conducts exit interviews with departing officers , says the departures are due to low morale and staffing shortages putting unnecessary pressure on front-line officers . ",
        "`` we are past burning out , we are burned out , '' said mike mccormack , president of the toronto police association . toronto police open to hiring more officers toronto police , which currently has around 5,000 uniformed officers , says it is working to replace officers leaving the force . `` the chief has committed to hiring more members , '' said police spokesperson meaghan gray , in a written statement to cbc toronto . she said the service is hiring 80 new officers -- 20 by the end of 2017 and an another 60 in the new year . ",
        "but the union said it wo n't make up for the losses . `` the reality is they have 80 new officers hired that will be on the street in 2019 , '' said mccormack . `` so far this year for january and february i have another 41 uniformed police officers leaving . what kind of policing is this ? '' safety a concern for some officers the union says minimum staffing requirements are not always met , causing some officers to feel unsafe at work . in an internal email sent earlier this month obtained by cbc toronto , one officer said he felt he was put `` at risk '' in 55 division as the only car on patrol on a tuesday afternoon . ",
        "`` i officially do no feel safe as a police officer , and am tired with the politics of the service and upper management , '' the officer wrote . `` our lives are on the lines , and the service does n't care until something bad happens . '' data from the toronto police service show that short-staffing the union is concerned about is n't contained to one division . in a four-week period from oct. . 30 to nov. . 26 of this year , nine of the force 's 17 divisions had more than 50 per cent of their shifts understaffed . ",
        "in that same period , in order to meet the minimum staffing requirements , toronto police would have had to call in people to cover an additional 1,510 shifts . that means to meet its staffing needs toronto police would have to foot the bill for thousands of overtime hours , or hire additional officers . `` this is putting people at risk and that 's where the buck has to stop , '' said mccormack . `` we have a duty to report and say what 's happening and what 's going on in the city . '' front-line officers a priority , chief says toronto police chief mark saunders said front-line officers are a priority as the force moves toward modernization . ",
        "part of that initiative is taking low-threshold calls like thefts under $ 5,000 away from trained police officers , relying on other tools and a support unit staffed by civilians . `` we 're looking at enhancing these things so we can reduce the pressures off the front-line officers . the answer is not putting more bodies into play , '' saunders said in an interview tuesday with cbc toronto 's dwight drummond . this year the force rolled out the criminal investigations support unit , which has civilian staff work with police to assist in daily duties . since the end of may , the csiu in 42 division has completed 2,800 calls for service and submitted approximately 900 general occurrences , according to data from toronto police . ",
        "in that division , the move has accounted for approximately 3,892 officer hours that can now be spent on other duties , the force said . `` we have to start thinking differently , we have to start rolling out differently and we have to starting learning how to perform differently when it comes to the task that we 're doing right now , '' saunders said .
