        "my conversations about cryptocurrencies with many people continue to seed new ideas . the most interesting conversations are with people who have a diametrically opposed view . one of the things i 'm coming to realize is that a significant segment of people have a need to trust some authority . it 's difficult to process the idea that we can trust something non-centralized , something that does not have a face . in the case of cryptoassets , what we are really trusting is some mathematical properties and their implementation using computer code . as long as certain preconditions are met , we can continue to trust this code , as the outcomes are deterministic . ",
        "perhaps an understanding of how computer programs works plays into this . there is always a possibility of bugs , but the same can be said of many critical computer programs that manage financial services , or the autopilot that fly 's an airplane . we have mitigated the risk substantially in those applications . for sure , many projects being funded by ico 's today will turn out to be failures . some ico 's are conducted by purely opportunistic people . some have overestimated the potential of their idea . some ideas will just not resonate with people as much . ",
        "many might fail because of poor execution of the idea in a competitive space . this is all part of the natural process of creative destruction . the failure of many of these projects would n't suggest a failure of blockchain solutions and cryptoassets in general . i also wonder if some proponents opposing cryptocurrencies do so because of regret of missing out . since i could n't join the party , the party sucks , i did n't want to go the party anyway , i do n't like parties , shame on you for going to the party . ",
        "in my opinion the party has just begun my friends , its not too late . its going to be a wild ride and things are going to change quite rapidly , so i 'd caution you only join if you can handle the heat .   "
