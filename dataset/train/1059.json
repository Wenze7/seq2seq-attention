        "south korea is preparing to shut down cryptocurrency exchanges in the country , its justice minister warned thursday , sending prices of bitcoin and other virtual units into a tailspin . south korea is preparing to shut down cryptocurrency exchanges in the country , its justice minister warned thursday , sending prices of bitcoin and other virtual units into a tailspin . a series of measures have failed to curb overheated virtual currency speculation in the country and justice minister park sang-ki said it would be `` devastating if the bubble bursts '' . `` the ministry is preparing legislation that basically bans any transactions based on a virtual currency through the trading floor , '' he told journalists . ",
        "authorities had `` grave concerns '' over the craze and were `` aiming to close virtual currency exchanges '' in the country , he said . `` it has started to resemble gambling and speculation , '' park added . the hyper-wired south has emerged as a hotbed for cryptocurrency trading , accounting for some 20 percent of global bitcoin transactions -- about 10 times the country 's share of the world economy . park 's remarks sent bitcoin prices plunging 18 percent on south korean exchange bithumb , while ethereum slumped 23 percent . bithumb -- one of around 20 virtual currency exchanges in south korea -- was raided by tax authorities on wednesday who inspected the company 's documents . ",
        "on the same day financial authorities inspected six local banks that offered virtual accounts for corporate customers . last month seoul banned its financial firms from dealing in virtual currencies . two weeks later , it announced a ban on opening anonymous cryptocurrency accounts and a crackdown on money laundering activities using them . it has also warned most cryptocurrencies were being traded in south korea at far higher prices than elsewhere in the world , blaming factors including `` blind speculation '' . an official at the financial supervisory service , south korea 's top financial regulator , said the closure of local exchanges represented a `` very strong measure '' against virtual coins . ",
        "the move would `` effectively suffocate '' cryptocurrency transactions within the country by creating `` enormous obstacles '' for traders , he told afp . us billionaire investor warren buffet told cnbc on wednesday the global craze over bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies would meet a `` bad ending '' . `` in terms of cryptocurrencies , generally , i can say with almost certainty that they will come to a bad ending , '' told financial tv channel cnbc , but added : `` when it happens or how or anything else , i do n't know . `` the price of bitcoin surged in 2017 from a low of around $ 750 in early january to a record above $ 19,500 in mid-december , before tumbling on global exchanges , according to bloomberg news .
