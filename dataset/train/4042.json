        "welcome back to the six-digit club , in which we take a look at a newish-to-market listing priced under $ 1 million , because nice things sometimes come in small packages . send nominations to the tipline . the listing description does n't reveal what the square footage is for this compact sutton place studio , but it does n't take much to see that it is tiny . while its size is n't quite the strongest selling point , perhaps the fact that is has been renovated in part , and is asking just $ 379,000 is . the floorplan here is a simple one : there is a light-filled living room that has been appointed with new hardwood floors , high beamed ceilings , and some pretty decent views of the city 's skyline . ",
        "a murphy bed that is tucked away next to a closet , that opens up onto the living room area . the windowed kitchen is tiny but does a pretty good job at making the most of its size , meaning you actually get some counter space along with plenty of cabinets . the kitchen also boasts a dishwasher along with a full refrigerator . storage space is n't exactly overflowing but there are two closets situated within the co-op . maintenance is going for $ 940/month .
