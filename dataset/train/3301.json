        "jan. . 17 -- all night tuesday , marta trains ran on their tracks , keeping mechanisms warm for the morning commute . but early wednesday , with many businesses closed and schools out , fewer than 5,000 people decided to use marta to get around metropolitan atlanta -- less than a quarter of the normal ridership . so at 7:30 a. m. , marta officials decided to operate a weekend schedule , with trains running every 20 minutes as opposed to every 10 minutes , said stephany fisher , a marta spokesperson . bus service also was curtailed . ",
        "as of 4 p. m. , it seemed like the decision was on track with the number of riders . just 28,000 people had stepped on a marta bus or train , a 76 percent decrease from the 118,000 riders who used marta services last wednesday . but demand is expected to be higher thursday . marta again planned to run trains overnight in order to keep everything working , though fisher said the system will continue its modified schedules , with trains coming every 10 to 20 minutes . limited bus service will continue , with buses sticking to major roads and routes with medical centers . ",
        "the agency reported several problems related to the weather wednesday , including train delays and some stuck vehicles . but fisher said no one was injured . most of the delays on trains were related to cold weather , fisher said . cold weather is often more of an issue than ice and snow , she said , because it affects how braking systems work -- and marta 's trains were n't built to handle it . there was a 40-minute delay on the gold line on wednesday when there was a problem with a train 's air compressor at the doraville station , fisher said , and both red and gold lines had a 24-minute delay just before 11:30 a. m. when a train at the lindbergh station had an air pressure issue . ",
        "on the red line , ice kept some trains ' doors from closing , fisher said , causing a 20-minute delay . fisher said the primary issues were on buses because roads were not clear enough to run routes . twenty-five slid off roads or got stuck wednesday morning , before they picked up passengers . randy clarke , vice president of operations and member services for the american public transportation association , said southern cities like atlanta are less prepared for , and less culturally used to , the elements . he said from clearing platforms to making sure buses can run , `` there 's a lot to this . '' ",
        "`` it 's not just vehicles going up and down the tracks , '' he said . residents are used to school closings , `` but if transit somehow gets impacted , people are just astonished , '' clarke said . simon berrebi , a software developer who has a doctorate in bus operations from georgia tech , said even with some delays , marta has shown an `` amazing capacity '' to keep its system running and get people where they need to go . berrebi said marta has done a good job of upkeep , which helped prevent further delays . ",
        "even with the agency 's switch to a weekend schedule , he said , people were able to use the service as they needed it . wednesday morning , greg amroso was one of those people . he is not a regular marta rider , but he 'd left his laptop on his desk at his office tuesday evening and had work to do . he walked a short distance from his home to the station in downtown decatur and was headed to 10th and peachtree streets . `` i did n't want to drive because the streets were icy , '' he said . ",
        "`` it 's not a good day to drive . `` the usually busy five points station was like ghost town . there were no people pushing through the turnstiles at the plaza and only a smattering of passengers were waiting on the platforms . mohamed saleh , who was taking marta to the airport for the first time in about 10 years , was shivering on the platform at the five points station , waiting for a south-bound train . he said on the drive from his home in clarkston to the kensington station he saw two wrecks , including one in which one car appeared to have slid into a police car on memorial drive . ",
        "`` people know that they can count on marta , '' berrebi said . `` it 's days like these , you really see the impact of public transportation . `` staff writer rhonda cook contributed to this story .   "
