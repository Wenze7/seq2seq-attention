        "several months ago , andréa and olivier englebert reached out to co-create the proxideal app with the ambition to empower local shops and reduce food waste . their idea was simple , yet efficient : local shops do n't have the means to promote their goods online , so proxideal allow them to share promotions instantly and get nearby users to notice them . on the way back home , you can now : shop for discounted products , encourage nearby shops , andreduce food waste . with their great team , a pretty strong story and a successful crowdfunding , most of the ingredients for a success were present ... except two : the technical abilities and previous startup experience -- exactly what we offer at cocreation . ",
        "studio . most non-technical startup teams end up hiring a development agency to handle the development of their application . the kind that asks for detailed specs and everything you forgot to mention will be paid double . but how could you , write proper specs if you do n't understand the underlying technology ? a development agency is not enough . a startup needs to work with entrepreneurs with a business sense . if you separate business and technology from the start , you separate your product from your strategy . worst , if you outsource the development to where-ever-it-is-cheap , you lose control of the quality ... while the `` manager '' takes a split on each and every euro you spend . ",
        "is cheap outsourcing a way to look for traction or a corporate nightmare from the 90 's ? when we started working with andréa and olivier , the quality of the team was pretty clear . they chose to bootstrap the business with a well scoped mvp . they made the hard choice to initially keep any payment system out of the loop . for each problem identified with the customers , they had a simple solution to validate ... and they did a tremendous job at acquiring shops and initial users ! at each iteration , jérémy , jean and i did our best to contribute to the project . ",
        "sometimes by sharing a first hand experience we had with one of our previous startups . sometimes by suggesting the most appropriate and innovative technical solution . the result : a confident team with 2 apps delivered on time and no bug observed in the first 2 months . to cocreation . studio and proxideal , it is clear in 2017 that traditional client-supplier relationships for cash are outdated . tech and sales are but some of the many rare talents needed to create a startup , but it 's hard to put together a full team at the very beginning with limited resources . ",
        "in order to move faster , we need more open and smarter ways to collaborate -- co-creation is one of them . if you also believe in startup co-creation , be sure to ♥︎ below ! at cocreation . studio , we are `` entrepreneurs as a service '' with a focus on mobile application development and startup strategy . rather than working `` for '' our clients , we believe in working `` with '' them .
