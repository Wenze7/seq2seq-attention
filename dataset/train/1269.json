        "with a red carpet dyed black by actresses dressed in a color-coordinated statement , the golden globes were transformed into an a-list expression of female empowerment in the post-harvey weinstein era . oprah winfrey led the charge . `` for too long women have not been heard or believed if they dared to speak their truth to the power of those men , '' said winfrey , accepting the cecil b. demille award for lifetime achievement . `` but their time is up . their time is up ! `` more than any award handed out sunday at the beverly hilton hotel in beverly hills , california , winfrey 's moment -- one greeted by a rousing , ongoing standing ovation and that left many attendees and viewers in tears -- encapsulated the `` me too '' mood at an atypically powerful golden globes . ",
        "the night served as hollywood 's fullest response yet to the sexual harassment scandals that have roiled the film industry and laid bare its gender inequalities . `` a new day is on the horizon ! '' promised winfrey , who noted she was the first black woman to be given the honor . with a cutting stare , presenter natalie portman followed winfrey 's speech by introducing , as she said , `` the all-male '' nominees for best director . the movie that many consider speaks most directly to the moment -- the revenge dark comedy `` three billboards outside ebbing , missouri , '' about a mother avenging the rape and murder of her daughter -- emerged as the night 's top film . ",
        "it won best picture , drama , best actress for frances mcdormand , best supporting actor for sam rockwell and best screenplay for writer-director martin mcdonagh . mcdormand granted she was befuddled at the identities of the hollywood foreign press association , but gave them credit . `` at least they managed to elect a female president , '' she said . mcdormand added that the evening has a special feeling . `` trust me , the women in this room tonight are not here for the food , '' said mcdormand . host seth meyers opened the night by diving straight into material about the sex scandals . ",
        "`` good evening ladies and remaining gentlemen , '' he began . in punchlines on weinstein -- `` the elephant not in the room '' -- kevin spacey and hollywood 's deeper gender biases , meyers scored laughs throughout the ballroom , and maybe a sense of release . `` for the male nominees in the room tonight , this is the first time in three months it wo n't be terrifying to hear your name read out loud , '' said meyers . the first award of the night , perhaps fittingly , went to one of hollywood 's most powerful women : nicole kidman , for her performance in hbo 's `` the big little lies , '' a series she and reese witherspoon also produced . ",
        "kidman chalked the win up to `` the power of women . '' `` big little lies '' won a leading four awards , including best limited series and best supporting actress for laura dern . like seven other female stars , dern walked the red carpet with a women 's rights activist as part of an effort to keep the globes spotlight trained on sexual harassment . dern was joined by farmworker advocate monica ramirez , michelle williams with `` me too '' founder tarana burke , and meryl streep with domestic worker advocate ai-jen poo . `` may we teach all of our children that speaking out without fear of retribution is our new north star , '' said dern , accepting her globe . ",
        "other winners continued the theme . amazon 's recently debuted `` the marvelous mrs. maisel , '' about a 1950s housewife who takes up stand-up comedy , won best tv series comedy , and best actress for rachel brosnahan . elisabeth moss , accepting an award for her performance in hulu 's `` the handmaid 's tale , '' movingly dedicated her award to margaret atwood , whose book the show is based on , and the women who came before her and after her . `` the handmaid 's tale '' later added the award for best tv series , drama . ",
        "`` we no longer live in the blank white spaces at the edge of print , '' said moss , referencing atwood 's prose . `` we no longer live in the gaps between the stories . we are the stories in print and we are writing the stories ourselves . `` hollywood 's awards season is seen as wide open , and a handful of movies came away with big wins . greta gerwig 's mother-daughter tale `` lady bird '' won best picture , comedy or musical , and best actress for saoirse ronan . guillermo del toro 's cold war-era fantasy `` the shape of water '' won for its score and del toro 's directing . ",
        "the emotional mexican-born filmmaker wiped back tears and managed to quiet the music that urged him off . notably left empty-handed was christopher nolan 's `` dunkirk , '' jordan peele 's horror sensation `` get out '' and steven spielberg 's `` the post , '' which meyers , alluding to its awards-season bona fides , feigned to present an armful of globes before the show even started . the globes had long been the stomping grounds of disgraced mogul weinstein , whose downfall precipitated allegations against james toback , kevin spacey and many others . weinstein presided over two decades of globes winners and was well-known for his savvy manipulation of the hollywood foreign press association , the 89-member group that puts on the globes . ",
        "though it bills itself as hollywood 's biggest party , the golden globes stroke a slightly more formal , oscar-like tone , complete with moments of appreciation for movie legends . kirk douglas , 101 , appearing with his daughter-in-law , catherin zeta-jones , received a warm standing ovation . best actor in a comedy or musical went to james franco for his performance as the infamous `` the room '' filmmaker tommy wiseau . franco dragged his co-star and brother , dave , to the stage and called up wiseau . when the wiseau , wearing his trademark sunglasses , got to the stage , he moved for the microphone before franco turned him back . ",
        "`` whoa , whoa , whoa , '' said franco as the audience chuckled . gary oldman , considered by some to be the best actor front runner , won for his winston churchill in `` darkest hour , '' edging out newcomer timothee chalamet and tom hanks . best foreign language film went to germany 's `` in the fade . '' allison janney took best supporting actress in a comedy for the tonya harding tale `` i , tonya . '' aziz ansari took best actor in a comedy series for his netflix show `` master of none . ",
        "`` best animated film went to the pixar release `` coco . '' pixar co-founder john lasseter is taking a `` six-month sabbatical '' after acknowledging `` missteps '' in his workplace behavior . backstage sunday , `` coco '' director lee unkrich was asked about changes at pixar . `` we can all be better , '' he said . `` we have been taking steps and continue to move forward to create art . `` sunday night 's black-clad demonstration was promoted by the recently formed time 's up : an initiative of hundreds of women in the entertainment industry -- including streep , williams , dern and winfrey -- who have banded together to advocate for gender parity in executive ranks and legal defense aid for sexual harassment victims . ",
        "ashley judd , the first big name to go on record with her weinstein experience , and salma hayek , who last month penned an op-ed about her nightmare with weinstein , arrived together . `` we feel sort of emboldened in this particular moment to stand together in a thick black line , '' streep said . `` it 's not a fashion statement . it 's a solidarity statement , '' said `` the crown '' actress claire foy . just about everyone , woman and man , celebrity and red-carpet reporters , was dressed in black sunday , many of them wearing a time 's up pin . ",
        "`` this is us '' star chris sullivan even sported black fingernails . later , his co-star sterling k. brown won for best drama actor . brown , the first black man to win the category , thanked `` this is us '' creator dan fogelman . `` you wrote a role for a black man that can only be played by a black man , '' said brown . `` i 'm being seen for who i am . `` though the atmosphere was still buoyant and positive , the usually superficial red carpet had unusual exchanges . while being interviewed live on e! , debra messing called out the network for allegedly not paying its female hosts the same as its male hosts . ",
        "e! 's catt sadler recently departed after she said she learned she was making about half the pay of her male counterpart , jason kennedy . the exchange was just another illustration of how the `` metoo '' reckoning that has plowed through hollywood has upended awards season . the ongoing scandals have derailed oscar campaigns and prompted new ones . among the nominees sunday was christopher plummer , who was brought in at the last minute to erase spacey from `` all the money in the world . '' ___ associated press writers andrew dalton and lindsey bahr contributed to his report from beverly hills . ",
