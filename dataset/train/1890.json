        "michael beasley was the unlikely hero in the new york knicks ' upset of nba eastern conference leaders boston thursday , exploding for 32 points to fuel a 102-93 triumph over the celtics . beasley 's effort off the bench -- including 28 points in the second half -- had `` m-v-p '' chants ringing around madison square garden . he more than compensated for kristaps porzingis ' worst nba game : an 0-for-11 shooting display that yielded one point and saw the knicks ' latvian star sit out the final 17 minutes . with the knicks down by nine , beasley came in for porzingis with 5:37 left in the third quarter and promptly scored 10 points in five minutes . ",
        "`` i 'm just here for the team , '' beasley said . `` whatever they need , whenever they need it . scoring , rebounding , defense , just trying my best . as humbly as i can say it , i just feel like every shot that i shoot is going in . `` his jump shot sealed the victory with 1:06 left to play , handing the celtics a second defeat in as many nights after a one-point loss to the miami heat in boston on wednesday . `` mike knows his role . if kp 's out he obviously gets the bigger minutes , '' knicks coach jeff hornacek said . ",
        "`` i thought he played great in filling in for him . he really helped us get some points on the board . `` porzingis , who had missed two games with a sore knee , was hoping to expunge the memory of a dismal shooting night against the celtics in the first week of the season , when he connected on just three of 14 shots from the floor . instead , he was even worse , missing all 11 of his shots in the first half and not even attempting one in the second . kyrie irving scored 32 points for the celtics , who lost back-to-back games for the first time this campaign . ",
        "their closest pursuers in the east , meanwhile , notched victories . - derozan on fire - demar derozan scored a career-high 45 points to lead the toronto raptors to a 114-109 comeback victory over the 76ers in philadelphia and the cleveland cavaliers warmed up for their nba finals rematch with the golden state warriors on christmas day with a hard-fought 115-112 home win over the chicago bulls . derozan made 13 of his 21 shots from the floor , including six of nine from three-point range . australian rookie ben simmons scored 20 points to pace the 76ers , who were without cameroonian center joel embiid , their leading scorer and rebounder , for a third straight game because of tightness in his back . ",
        "kyle lowry added 23 points for the raptors , who erased a 22-point third-quarter deficit to win their fifth straight and 11th in 12 games . they are now just 1.5 games behind the celtics in the east , with the cavaliers a further game back . cleveland shook off the absence of ailing coach tyronn lue and injured guard j. r. smith to end the bulls ' seven-game winning streak . in a contest that featured 26 lead changes , lebron james scored 11 of his 34 points in the fourth quarter and the cavs held on for a 12th straight home win . ",
        "james pushed the cavs lead to six points with a difficult fadeaway jump shot with 1:01 left to play . a layup by chicago 's denzel valentine cut the deficit to 113-112 with 14.3 seconds left , but james drained two free throws with 11.1 seconds left to put cleveland up by three . dwyane wade then blocked kris dunn 's three-point attempt and valentine , with jae crowder defending him , missed a three-point attempt in the final second . in phoenix , tj warren scored 27 points and troy daniels drained the go-ahead three-pointer with 17 seconds to play as the suns downed the memphis grizzlies 97-95 . ",
        "a suns turnover gave the grizzlies a last chance to win , but tyreke evans missed a three-point attempt at the buzzer .   "
