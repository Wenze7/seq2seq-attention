        "the kings visit the air canada centre . while the raptors are clearly the better team , they need to ensure they do n't take their youthful opponents lightly . the sacramento kings , owners of an perfect mirror image of the toronto raptors ' record , visit the air canada center . this is the second and final meeting this season between the teams . we just saw these guys last week . despite the raptors ' less than stellar effort , our team had enough defense to hold the kings at bay for a 102-87 victory . that game was typical of sacramento 's troubles -- they ca n't score enough .

        "sacramento , ca -- december 10 : the toronto raptors bench reacts during the game against the sacramento kings on december 10 , 2017 at golden 1 center in sacramento , california . note to user : user expressly acknowledges and agrees that , by downloading and or using this photograph , user is consenting to the terms and conditions of the getty images agreement . mandatory copyright notice : copyright 2017 nbae the kings are the nba 's lowest scoring team , a full point worse than memphis 's 97.2 point per game . they are also the league 's worst team in point differential , a wretched minus _ 9.3 . ",
        "their record should be much worse , but they have two 1-point victories and another in overtime . george hill , their starting point guard , did n't face the raptors last week but should be on hand tomorrow . he 's a useful journeyman and no more , so why they coughed up huge money for him is beyond me . more from raptors rapture deandre jordan to raptors ? both sides now trade proposal4h ago raptors 120 -- nets 87 -- blowing out a bad team9h ago nets at raptors : preview & 3 keys to victory1 d ago raptors fans rank in fandom 250 -- we 're # 240 ... that 's all ?

        "1 d ago moving serge to center2d ago in fairness , hill and promising rookie backup de'aaron fox are n't likely to rack up impressive assist numbers for a team that does n't make buckets . the kings are last in 3-point attempts with 22.1 pg , although they connect at an eminently respectable 38.4 % rate . that percentage is spiked by one-trick-pony buddy hield , who 's at 46 % . 3 keys to raptors victory make them one and done . while i do n't think of the raptors as a great rebounding team , our guys have a plus _ 0.4 ranking , which is 13th . ",
        "sac is minus _ 3.6 . if we keep them off the boards , their scoring will be even more constrained than it already is . let 's keep dwane casey away from a coronary by minimizing those second-chance opportunities . hit those long balls . the kings rank 28th in 3-point defense , allowing 38 % of opponents ' attempts . i suspect that 's partially because their big men are n't fast enough to rotate successfully , but what do you expect from zach randolph ? other than serge ibaka , the raptors shot poorly from beyond the arc in sacramento . ",
        "if our guys are just average , they will shred their defense . keep working the ball inside . both jonas valanciunas and ibaka have made strong contributions to the raptors ' scoring lately . if their defenders have to collapse on our big men because they are filling it up , more space for our shooters will be available . our frontcourt stalwarts are happy to pass out of double teams . predictionwhile i ca n't imagine another beat-down of the kind the raptors just laid on the nets , a victory against a weak visitor like sacramento should be nearly automatic .
