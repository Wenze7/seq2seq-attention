        "the accessibility of information on social media in the modern era has significantly changed the way we consume information and news , make decisions and even shape opinion . however , an `` echo chamber '' may arise , creating filters on information used to formalize opinions and points of views . as such , an echo chamber is referred to as a phenomenon in which a network of like-minded people shares controversial theories , biased views , and selective news . that information is then simply repeated back to them and accepted as facts . in the digital world , this occurrence has been reinforced by the machine learning algorithms employed by companies like google and facebook , which aim to serve their users content that is tailored to their interests . ",
        "pariser the author of `` the filter bubble '' says that `` the echo chambers are clearly harmful to the public 's awareness of important issues , as it actually limits who can discover information about certain current events '' . furthermore , situations where people are only exposed to information that reinforces their current beliefs causes polarization , because individuals become more convinced of their correctness when they are not seeing a diverse set of expert opinions , then they become more aggressive towards opposing opinions and they start filtering friends and colleagues . i personally have witnessed this trend since the outcome of the 2011 syrian war . ",
        "i saw a number of friends following specific sites and pages that supported their political affiliation , while others blocked social media sites that went against their beliefs . likewise , friends and family members started blocking each other on social media because of opposing opinions on what 's going on in syria . social media in this case created a bigger divide between the people of syria . people stopped listening to differing ideas , causing a less informed and a less open minded generation who only accept information that adheres to their beliefs , formed by their gated communities . ",
        "the echo chamber in this case will lead to a thorny road to democracy , as people close their ears and eyes from conflicting thoughts . ideally , social media should be a space for generating new ideas , helping shape democracy by providing an open platform for open communication , allowing people to listen and learn from deferring ideologies . however , social media nowadays often establishes people 's identities and may even make some more extreme . given that we 've become so attached to social media , we are no longer obliged to interact with people who have different opinions than ours . ",
        "today , technology made it much easier for us to find people who share our principles and beliefs , driving users into small homogenous communities , where the sweet bitterness of diversity and dissimilarity do n't exist anymore .   "
