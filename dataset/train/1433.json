        "during our recent webcam chat , jakob schuh reveals he was drawn to adapt roald dahl ` s `` revolting rhymes '' into an animated short because `` it has a lot of quite modern themes in it of empowerment and of strong females . '' plus , `` it 's a lot of fun to read . '' the two-part film retells and intertwines five of the six poems in the book , including modern takes on little red riding hood , snow white , the three little pigs , and the big bad wolf . `` the more you think about it , the more relevant it becomes . '' ",
        "schuh co-directed the film with jan lachauer . the pair were influenced by the iconic illustrations of quentin blake , whose work is intrinsically linked with that of the author . `` we were happy to have them as a base for an adaptation , '' lachauer divulges . `` it 's very daunting , '' adds schuh , `` because if you love quentin 's work as much as we do , and you think about adapting it to animation , it becomes clear quite quickly that you do n't want to actually copy his actual style .
