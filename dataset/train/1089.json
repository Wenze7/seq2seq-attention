        "about 150 years ago , at the end of japan 's edo period , a civil war resulted in the end of the samurai culture and the birth of modern japan . one rebel clan of samurai chose mass suicide . but in the remote , mountainous shonai region , the sakai clan of samurai opted for a dignified surrender . they gave up their swords and destroyed their castle , created a regional bank and a silk farming industry , and threw their support behind the new meiji government . sixteen generations have passed since the first feudal sakai clan leader presided over shonai , but his legacy lives on . ",
        "today , 71-year-old tadahisa sakai -- whom locals refer to as `` the last descendant '' -- is a revered man in the shonai region , which is a two-hour flight or four-hour train ride from tokyo . sakai is the curator of the chido museum in yamagata prefecture , founded in 1950 by one of his ancestors . designed to preserve samurai culture , the museum houses a collection of invaluable samurai helmets , swords , jackets that were worn into battle , fishing poles and drums used during battles to signal warriors . in december , as shonai was blanketed in knee-deep snow , i spoke to the impeccably groomed sakai through a translator at the museum about how the teachings of his samurai ancestors apply to issues we face today . ",
        "he began with conflict , which may arise at work , while traveling , at home and in relationships . many people try to avoid it at all costs , sakai said . `` never walk or run away from difficult situations , '' he added . `` face the situation from the bottom of your heart , which means honestly and sincerely . '' once you decide to deal directly with conflict , sakai said , try to be neither optimistic nor pessimistic , and do n't dwell on the outcome . `` do your best to deal with the problem , '' he explained , `` but the results are beyond your control . ",
        "que será , será ... what will be will be . '' when asked how he faces conflict in his intimate relationships , sakai -- who , according to his translator , is almost never asked personal questions -- was refreshingly forthcoming . `` i understand that western males want to escape confrontation and conflict , but if i am angry or upset , i debate or argue with my wife , '' he said . `` in most cases , i try to settle everything then and there . even if it takes many hours , i try not to carry it over . '' ",
        "he paused for a moment , laughed , and added , `` maybe my wife is always correct . '' sakai said he used the same principles when he had conflicts with his young children . if he needed to scold his children , he did . he also praised them when it was called for , he said . in addition to the shonai museum , sakai is opening a sword museum in tokyo in january . it is the first exhibition of modern art swords that were created using ancient techniques . `` art swords are used for rituals or in religious facilities , '' he said . ",
        "`` the surface of the sword is like human skin . it is not just metal . it is a living being . '' when asked if he feels successful , sakai took a moment to reflect . `` what i do is a tiny achievement compared to my ancestors , '' he said . `` i ca n't even call myself traditional because i am not up to the accomplishments of those who came before me . '' `` what i do is a tiny achievement compared to my ancestors . '' -- tadahisa sakai . he did n't hesitate in addressing increasing japanese militarism and whether it concerns him . ",
        "sakai said he does n't worry because he trusts the younger generation . he said they are trying to adjust to the world today so they can fit in and maneuver in their own way . `` they will inherit the traditions that came before them -- the essence of the traditions , '' sakai said . `` it is essential that we trust them . '' sakai spoke with pride about his own son , who is a 17th-generation sakai : `` he is already at the mastery level of kendo . that level is quite high , a bit less than black belt . '' ",
        "sakai paused for a moment before adding : `` i send my best wishes and regards to the younger generation . '' he said they will know what is important from their ancestors and apply it to their own lives . he smiled and said , `` the future of the world depends on them . ''   "
