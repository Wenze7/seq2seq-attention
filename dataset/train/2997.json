        "just because he was born in minnesota does n't mean cameron jordan will take it easy on the vikings . the saints defensive end , whose father , steve , was a pro bowl tight end for the vikings during a 13-year nfl career , plans to wreak havoc on the minnesota offense . `` i want to destroy them just the same , '' jordan said thursday , via the associated press . `` there 's going to be an offensive line that i want to destroy . there 's going to be a running back i want to destroy . ",
        "there 's going to be a quarterback that i have to destroy . '' steve jordan was selected to six consecutive pro bowls from 1986 through 1991 and finished his nfl career with 498 receptions for 6,307 yards and 28 touchdowns . he retired from the 1994 season and moved to arizona when his son was just 6 . `` i spent the first six years of my life there , but my first kiss was in arizona , '' the younger jordan told reporters on thursday . jordan was a full participant in practice on thursday after being limited wednesday with a knee injury . ",
        "the three-time pro bowler led the saints this season with 13 sacks and 17 tackles for loss . he added another sack in last sunday 's 31-26 win over the panthers in the wild-card round . jordan referred to panthers left tackle matt kalil as `` speed bump mcgee '' and sent a bottle of jordan cabernet to panthers quarterback cam newton . jordan 's father asked if he would tone down his antics and think about possible ramifications . `` i shot my shot and said what i said and had to back it up , '' jordan said . ",
        "`` at 28 , i 'm in my physical prime so at this point i feel like i can back it up . '' he will be tasked with helping the fourth-seeded saints upset the second-seed vikings at u. s. bank stadium , the site of super bowl lii . the vikings beat the visiting saints in the season opener , but the vikings had a different starting quarterback and running back in that 29-19 victory . jordan had a sack of sam bradford in week 1 and would like to drop case keenum on sunday . the vikings will try to prevent that from happening and have kept keenum fairly clean with just 22 sacks this season . ",
        "`` he 's had a great career , great year , and it 's going to be a tough battle , '' vikings offensive tackle mike remmers said , via the ap . `` the first thing that we 'd like to do is just block him ... he 's just fast , physical , just a smart player . he 's really got a little bit of everything . '' while his father may have played for the vikings , jordan said he has no allegiance to the nfc north norsemen . `` you grow up and you get drafted by the saints , '' jordan added . ",
        "`` this is my team . this is my family . this is who i 'm playing for . ''   "
