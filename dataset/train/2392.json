        "nearly all modern metropolitan areas are awash in traffic congestion and concerns about safety . well , it seems the one tool that state roadway planners and legislators have turned to for an effective and financially viable tool to address these concerns is ramp metering . denver is actually taking the first step with a newer `` on-ramp system '' that feeds cars onto interstate 25 , when there is an actual gap in traffic and holds drivers back when there is n't any access gap . the colorado department of transportation plans to test out the new system between ridge gate and university before implementing the plan elsewhere . ",
        "`` what they are going to notice on i-25 is that it will be flowing at highway speeds even during the peak hours when we have congestion now , '' said peter kozinski , director of cdot 's road x program , adding , `` this is a new concept never deployed in north america before .

        "here is what the new $ 8 million on-ramp road x program will look like at a snapshot : cdot will install software and traffic sensors to the aging segment of highway between the ridgegate and university exits . devices will be installed every 1/3 of a mile that will shoot lasers across traffic . the lasers will register natural gaps in traffic , and then trigger on-ramp signals to green to feed vehicles onto the highway filling gaps . the on-ramp lights will remain red when traffic is full , holding cars on the on-ramp , until the next natural gap occurs . ",
        "the timing at the lights will change according to traffic , and wo n't be a set pattern . where possible , cdot hopes to add an additional lane at the top of the on-ramp to help get more cars integrated onto the highway faster . cdot officials say they 've analyzed the system and do n't expect any delays or backups on side streets . the system has already been implemented in melbourne , australia , and has proven to be immensely successful . hardware will be installed this fall , and the system is expected to go live soon after the first of the year .
