        "hurricane harvey making landfall on the gulf coast on august 25 . houston is a city accustomed to flooding . there have been 30 major floods there since the 1940s , with three massive surges in the past three years alone . but when hurricane harvey hit the houston , texas area in august , it dealt a blow much harder than expected . it lingered on the coast dumping massive quantities of water on the region . the storm ultimately killed 82 people , displaced tens of thousands of households , and caused an estimated $ 180 billion in damage . ",
        "in total , between 24 trillion and 34 trillion gallons of water fell on the gulf coast during harvey , equivalent to the amount of water melted off the west antarctic ice shelf in a single year . according to adrian borsa , a geophysicist with the scripps research institute , that 's enough to push down the crust of the earth itself by over half an inch in some areas . this week , results from two new studies on harvey 's rainfall were announced at the american geophysical union annual meeting in new orleans . they back up early predictions that human-caused climate change increased the intensity of the precipitation . ",
        "in the first study , published in geophysical research letters , authors looked at the hurricane 's total rainfall and calculated the chances of that volume of rain falling under present climate conditions . then , they ran their calculations again , but this time looked at the likelihood of that same storm occurring during the 1950s , when there were lower levels of greenhouse gases in the environment . they thought the increase in rainfall attributable to climate change might be somewhere around six percent . instead , their analysis suggests that global warming increased the precipitation by at least 19 percent , with around 38 percent being the more likely figure . ",
        "they also found that anthropogenic climate change likely increased the chances of the observed rainfall by a factor of at least 3.5 , with a best estimate of about 10 . that means that harvey 's rainfall was 10 times more likely to happen thanks to anthropogenic climate change . but even without human greenhouse gas emissions , harvey would still a massive , rare , and extreme event . `` harvey was an essentially unforeseen , classic black swan event , '' says michael wehner of lawrence berkeley national laboratory in berkeley , california , a co-author of the geophysical research letters study . ",
        "even in 2017 , he notes , the chances of that kind of rain dump on texas are only 1 in 3,000 . but we might have to get more used to such massive events . the geophysical research letters study was n't the only one to take a look at harvey and come to this conclusion . in the study published in environmental research letters , researchers from the netherlands looked at rainfall intensity levels along the gulf coast from the start of record keeping , and two global climate change models . `` we were trying to figure out how extreme or rare was this event , and did climate change change the odds of this event ? '' ",
        "karin van der wiel , of the the royal netherlands meteorological institute and a co-author of the new environmental research letters paper says . they found that harvey 's rainfall was about three times more likely to happen now than in pre-industrial times , and that it was about 15 percent more intense than it would have been in the past . `` while in pre-industrial times you might only expect to have one of these events in 2,500 years , in the present day within the same period there would be three , '' van der wiel says . ",
        "the grl and erl studies are the most recent to attribute harvey 's intensity to anthropogenic climate change , but another group recently came to very similar conclusions . back in november , mit meteorologist kerry emanuel published a paper in pnas that found harvey 's prolific rainfall was about six times more likely thanks to climate change . `` the public wants to know , '' wehner says , `` did climate change affect the fact that my house got flooded ? '' though the three papers may have come up with slightly different numbers , he says , they 're all within one another 's range of uncertainty . ",
        "and that suggests there really was a human influence on the storm . researchers are assembling data from the 2017 season 's other devastating storms , including irma and maria , which caused immense damages that are still being tallied today . some researchers fear that if we do n't stem our flow of greenhouse gases into the ever-warming atmosphere , these storms could continue to become more frequent and intense . `` these storms are a foretaste of our future -- if we do n't change our future . '' emanuel says .   "
