        "today , the federal communications commission voted to repeal net neutrality , meaning america 's access to an equal and open internet could become a thing of the past . democrats in congress have vowed to fight the decision , but if they are unsuccessful , this vote could have major consequences for society . the end of net neutrality will suck for a lot of people , but the negative impacts of ending net neutrality will especially hurt black people . essentially , the repeal of the obama-era net neutrality protections means the fcc can control what is and is n't accessible on the internet . ",
        "they 'll be able to do this by slowing down or speeding up the connection to certain websites and blocking specific content and apps . companies that provide internet access will have the ability to charge extra for access to websites you probably use everyday . want to listen to `` bodak yellow '' on pandora ? sorry , that 'll be $ 2.99 . and while the end of net neutrality will hurt millionaire musical artists ' sales , many black people have gained a following and an income by subverting traditional gatekeepers and power structures by using social media and other platforms that will be limited by this repeal . ",
        "artists and innovators who crowdfund their income , relying on people who believe in their vision to donate , use websites like patreon and kickstarter , but with restrictions on the internet , people will be less likely to visit these sites and support individual creators . another aspect of american life that gained traction , in part thanks to an open internet , was the black lives matter movement . social movements in recent years relied heavily on social media to share messages quickly and display powerful images traditional media outlets originally ignored . think back to the protests in ferguson after the killing of michael brown . ",
        "cable news did n't run stories until the images were had trended on twitter for several hours , and when news crews left the city , the world continued to get on-the-ground coverage from protesters who were using twitter . activists also often use free , secure messaging platforms like whatsapp to communicate information that could be used against them . this repeal could limit access to whatsapp and similar resources . the fbi has recently coined the term `` black identity extremists , '' a move that was met by widespread backlash and called an `` attempt to criminalize blackness '' by one twitter user . ",
        "the recent repeal of net neutrality could potentially halt the spreading of ideas deemed `` extreme , '' but the idea the black lives matter is n't a dangerous idea that needs to be censored . the economic burden of the end of net neutrality will disproportionately impact black communities as well . black people have less disposable income than other racial groups . according to the u. s. census bureau , pay for black women ranges from 48 to 69 cents for every dollar paid to white , non-hispanic men in those states . a report from the economic policy institute stated that more than one in four black households have zero or negative net worth , compared to less than one in ten white families without wealth . ",
        "additionally , the average wealth for white families is seven times higher than average wealth for black families . having to pay extra to access certain content on the internet will put an undue burden on black americans , creating a regressive tax , aka a tax that causes lower-income people to pay a larger share of their income than wealthier people . the repeal of net neutrality sucks for pretty much anyone who is n't a rich white man , whether you use the internet to make a living or you just like to scroll on twitter and laugh at the latest meme , but it really , really sucks for black folks . ",
        "however , net neutrality is n't exactly dead yet : congress can still overrule the fcc vote . if you want an open and accessible internet , you can write , text , or call your representatives to let them know you oppose the repeal of net neutrality .   "
