        "1 . like darth vader , steve bannon is beatablethe former white house chief strategist has compared himself to the star wars villain , but this was the moment he dropped his lightsaber . in 2016 bannon helped pull off one of the greatest election upsets in american history . but in 2017 he backed one of the worst senate candidates in american history , making light of allegations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls , and went down in flames . the old playbook , such as blaming the media , did not work even in a republican stronghold . ",
        "among those questioning bannon 's judgment is likely to be donald trump , who was persuaded to throw in his lot with moore - and who notoriously hates losing . 2 . the republican civil war is about to get even uglierthe alabama special election had turned into a lose-lose situation and , unsurprisingly , republicans lost . a moore win would have been bad , saddling them with demands for an ethics investigation or expulsion and tarnishing the brand for years . but a republican senate defeat in alabama for first time in 1992 is hardly cause for celebration , reducing the party 's majority to 51-49 in the chamber . ",
        "divisions were painfully exposed by the failure to pass healthcare legislation . now there will be soul searching and recriminations over this self-inflicted wound . questions will be asked about bannon 's undue influence on the party . is he driving them over a cliff ? 3 . there 's a pattern emerginghistorically , the party that occupies the white house struggles in special and mid-term elections . in 2010 democrats received what president barack obama called a `` shellacking '' . there is a now growing body of evidence that , despite trump 's ability to change the rules , this pattern is not only holding but becoming turbocharged . ",
        "republicans performed badly in virginia and elsewhere last month . now they have lost alabama , which in sporting terms would be the equivalent of new zealand losing to jamaica at rugby . with trump 's approval rating at a record low , a potential meltdown in the 2018 mid-terms awaits . 4 . the anti-trump coalition has been emboldenedlast month 's elections were dubbed `` the revenge of the suburbs '' , as women , minorities and university-educated voters joined to deliver a rebuke to trump by voting in a new slate of female , african american and transgender democrats . ",
        "what happened in alabama appears to confirm this trend . african americans turned out in big numbers in one of america 's most racially divided states . many women were appalled by the accusations against moore . suburbia , including establishment republicans , again appears to have dealt a decisive blow . 5 . trump did indeed scramble the electoral maptrump defied all conventional wisdom to win the presidency , turning some traditionally blue states red . but it cuts both ways . democrats , who lost the white south in the 1960s , suddenly find that even a state such as alabama is in play , albeit thanks to moore 's uniquely negative characteristics . ",
        "this will give fresh hope to progressives in cities such as austin , texas , nashville , tennessee , and other islands of blue surrounded by red . paradoxically , at a moment when america is at its most divided since the vietnam war , the battle lines are being redrawn .   "
