        "already battered by three years of war , yemen is in danger of tipping into famine in 2018 if fighting continues to disrupt imports of food aid , aid agencies warned . in the worst-case scenario , the war-torn nation `` faces a risk of famine '' if there is prolonged and significant disruption to imports through its two red sea ports , said a specialist us-based agency . more people are predicted to go hungry in july 2018 than in the same month last year , added the famine early warning systems network in its latest analysis , which focuses on projected food needs for july . ",
        "a saudi-led military coalition fighting the iran-backed houthi movement had closed key ports , hodeidah , which is the country 's main entry point for food and humanitarian supplies , and saleef , in early november . the us-backed coalition accuses iran of sending weapons to its houthi allies through hodeidah . more than 10,000 people have been killed in the conflict . yemen , a nation of 28 million people , imports more than 85 per cent of its food and medicine . the ports have temporarily re-opened for 30 days , and cranes arrived on monday to help with the aid flow , but it 's unclear if they will stay that way , said stephen anderson , yemen country director for the world food programme . ",
        "`` if the ports are restricted again we could face a catastrophic loss of life if we ca n't get supplies to people , '' he told the reuters from hodeidah on monday . yemenis are facing `` an extremely bleak outlook '' , with continued conflict , high fuel and food prices and disease concerns such as the cholera outbreak and the spread of diphtheria , anderson added . disrupting humanitarian access would deepen what the united nations already calls the world 's worst humanitarian crisis , said rosanne marchesich , a rome-based emergency response team leader at the un 's food and agriculture organization . ",
        "in 2017 , 17 million yemenis , or about two-thirds of the population , were considered hungry , with 6.8 million needing immediate , adequate and sustained food assistance , wfp said . the numbers have gone up with 8.4 million now on the brink of famine , it added . with 70 per cent of the rural population dependent on agriculture for food and income , sustaining production is crucial , fao 's marchesich told reuters . yet , below average rainfall , fighting and limited , expensive inputs such as fertilizers , have pushed down yields , she added . ",
        "yemenis have exhausted strategies to cope with the crisis and some are selling off their assets for short-term survival , deepening poverty and food insecurity , she warned .   "
