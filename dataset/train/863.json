        "`` do n't crash . '' two simple words , but with a lot of emphasis when you 're talking about the brand new 2018 lamborghini huracan performante . the line-up of professional drivers responsible for coaxing faster and faster lap times -- not to mention more and more trophies for the automaker 's awards cabinet -- currently facing me does nothing to disabuse the knowledge that , on a track , i 'm a novice at best . suddenly , the idea of planting a raging $ 280k supercar into a wall seems all too possible . lamborghini , it 's fair to say , markets its fearsome reputation well . ",
        "in age when a bugatti chiron can take you to 261 mph with little more than a shrug , while ferrari has become the de-facto choice for the riviera gt jaunt , the raging bull promises nothing but pure , unbridled aggression . the countach may be long behind us , but its spirit lives on . couple that with a price tag that puts even the `` base '' huracan out of the reach of most , and it 's no surprise i was feeling apprehensive about the performante , the most potent of its clan . it may be too sneeringly aloof to say it , but you ca n't spend too much time near -- or inside -- a modern lamborghini without getting the impression that it might want to kill you . ",
        "the performante more than most , in fact . it 's lighter , more agile than the usual huracan : lamborghini has been pushing forged composites as a way to deliver strength without heft , chopping carbon fibers and then embedding them into a matrix of resins . it allows for bodywork and chassis structures that are as strong as traditional woven carbon fiber , but allow for complex geometries to be molded , and won the automaker the 2016 jec award for innovation . as you might expect , then , it shows up in several areas . forged composites are used on the front lower spoiler , the rear hood , the wing , and the lower fascia and bumper . ",
        "overall , it saves around 88 pounds from the regular huracan . there 's only so much you can do with light weighting , mind , and so lamborghini 's engineers looked to another problem all performance cars face . aerodynamics are a tricky topic : on the one hand , you want your car to be as slippery through the air as possible , to minimize resistance and maximize your top speed . at the same time , though , you need downforce in order to stick to the road . the two are n't commonly mutually compatible , yet lamborghini came up with a solution . ",
        "it 's called aero vectoring , and it 's fascinating both in how effective and how simple it is . other cars have aerodynamic features that adjust according to whether you want to increase downforce or cut drag : the ford gt 's huge , hydraulically-powered rear wing is a prime example . what lamborghini has done is boil that down in a fiendishly clever way . at the front , a flap in the lower spoiler can direct air either across the underside of the car or bypass it . that means the performante can adjust whether it 's super-sticky to the tarmac for high-speed cornering and stability , or super-slippery to the air for maximum speed . ",
        "it gets even more interesting at the back , mind . at the base of each slender strut holding up the fixed spoiler , there 's a channel diving deep into the bodywork . peer down one , and you see a tiny square flap , which lamborghini can open or close in just 0.2 seconds . if they 're open , air flows down those channels , up the spoiler supports , and then out of a row of vents on the underside of the wing . since the huracan performante can control each of those vents independently , it can control whether the flow of air arrives out of the left or the right side of the wing . ",
        "that pays dividends when you 're cornering , since the car can increase downforce over the inside wheel alone for better traction . factor in the all-wheel steering , and you have improved cornering with less steering angle , and without a huge aero element fighting against the rush of air . the result is a car that grips , and grips , and grips . hurtling down a slalom i flicked the wheel and promptly wiped out a cone : the performante had thoroughly beaten every expectation of turn-in ability i 'd expected . on the track , there 's no sawing at the controls , just deft twists with your grip never shifting from 9 and 3 . ",
        "lamborghini 's anima drive mode system still has three modes , though their characters have been spread out more in the huracan performante than in the regular car . strada is the default , the italian coupe keeping its evocative soundtrack but sufficiently docile from behind the wheel to drive to the market and back . sport dials up the eagerness , pushing most of the 631 hp to the rear wheels and making the huracan more drift-friendly . finally , there 's corsa , which dials back the rwd-emphasis in favor of track stability and handling , while minimizing the electronic nannying . ",
        "it also puts the 7-speed dual-clutch ldf transmission into full-manual mode , leaving gear changes solely to the driver and their paddles . there 's no auto-upshift when you hit the 8,500 rpm redline , either . that redline may be high -- one of the joys of a naturally-aspirated 5.7-liter v10 -- but you reach it shockingly quickly . time after embarrassing time in corsa mode i found myself hitting the redline , losing vital seconds -- vital , that is , were this a competition -- before it registered that yes , it was time to upshift . ",
        "even so , the huracan performante is forgiving . here 's the thing . i 'd expected the fiery embrace of death or , more likely and less melodramatic , the shameful and expensive embrace of bodywork repairs . yet the performante shrugged off my occasional ineptitude with latin insouciance . when i screwed up my line into the corners , the all-wheel drive finessed me back into place . when i carried too much speed , the carbon ceramic brakes hauled me to sensible levels without wheel-spin , clouds of smoke , or a backend that wanted to overtake the front . ",
        "all of the raw angst that i 'd expected , the refusal to compromise to me , a dumb human who had been stupidly entrusted with the keys , failed to materialize . could it be that lamborghini 's engineers have made the performante simply too good ? the consensus is that the new , more extreme model easily out-performs the regular huracan . it grips more , turns more sharply , does a better job at getting its power to the asphalt . `` at the limit , '' one of lamborghini 's pro-drivers explained to me as he threw me around the track on a hot lap , `` it 's super-tuned to what you 're doing with your feet . '' ",
        "i do n't doubt it , but since i 'm far , far from the level of a professional racing driver , i suspect i 'd never get anywhere close . do n't get me wrong , the performante wants to go fast . aches to , indeed : it 's where it sings , where it demonstrates every advantage of its impressive technology . never , whether i was fumbling at the wheel or lamborghini 's pro was in control , did i feel like it was about to break loose and ruin my day , dramatically and expensively . ",
        "that might almost sound like a disappointment , if you 're primed by temperamental cars in the automaker 's history , but i strongly suspect it 's more welcome when you 're the one footing the bill . barring driver stupidity , i feel like there 's no way you could reach its limits on public roads , at anywhere in the ballpark of legal speeds . in a twist i never saw coming , the huracan performante is actually eminently approachable . it looks like a lamborghini , it sounds like a lamborghini , but i would not have expected the controlled fury i found behind the wheel .
