        "for some reason , flossing just seems so time consuming . is it even all that necessary ? does n't brushing get in all the nooks and crannies in your smile ? we hate to break it to you , but flossing is just as important as your dentist has been telling you for years . to get the real story on how often we really need to floss to have healthy gums and teeth , we talked to kevin b. sands , dds , a cosmetic dentist in beverly hills , ca . with a patient list including kim kardashian , justin bieber , and miley cyrus , he must know a thing or two about maintaining an amazing smile ! ",
        "brace yourself , because flossing needs to become part of your daily routine . how often do you need to floss ? `` you have to floss your teeth every day , because plaque builds up in 24 hours , '' sands said , adding that the american dental association guidelines agree that that 's the minimum . twice a day would be ideal , but even this dentist acknowledges that people are n't likely to go that far . so if you 're going to choose one time to do it , opt for flossing at night since your salivary glands start producing plaque while you sleep , sands explained . ",
        "how long should it take to floss your teeth properly ? you need to get in between each tooth and you need to hug the tooth to get down to the gums , sands said . this is n't a 30-second process , so do n't skimp on taking a couple minutes to make sure you get each tooth ! is there a difference between using traditional floss or floss picks ? `` i do n't recommend the picks because you can really be messing your gums up , '' sands said . if it 's not used right , you can damage your papilla . ",
        "since it does n't grow back , you might want to ditch those picks altogether and stick with the original stuff to avoid a serious problem . moral of the story : take a few minutes before bed each night to floss your teeth ! you 'll thank yourself in the long-run .   "
