        "nine years after sending the first notice to price waterhouse for anomalies in auditing the books of scam-hit erstwhile satyam computers system , the market regulator sebi on wednesday barred its network entities from issuing audit certificates to any listed company in india for two years . it also ordered disgorgement of over rs 13 crore wrongful gains from the audit major and its two erstwhile partners who worked on the it major 's accounts . in a 108-page order posted on its website , the markets regulator imposed a two-year ban on `` entities or firms practicing as chartered accountants in india under the brand and banner of price waterhouse from directly or indirectly issuing any certificate of audit of listed companies , compliance of obligations of listed companies and intermediaries registered with sebi . '' ",
        "the order will not impact audit assignments relating to the financial year 2017-18 undertaken by the firms forming part of the pw network , sebi clarified . besides , price waterhouse bangalore and its two erstwhile partners -- s gopalakrishnan and srinivas talluri -- have been directed to `` jointly and severally disgorge wrongful gains of rs 13,09,01,664 with interest calculated at the rate of 12 percent per annum from january 7 , 2009 , till the date of payment . '' they have to pay the amount within 45 days . we are disappointed with the findings of the sebi investigations and the adjudication order , price waterhouse said , in an emailed response . ",
        "price waterhouse , in an email responsewe believe that the order is also not in line with the directions of the hon ` ble bombay high court order of 2010 and so we are confident of getting a stay before this order becomes effective . price waterhouse statementthe order comes after several rounds of litigation before the securities appellate tribunal , bombay high court and the supreme court . the action stems from india 's biggest accounting fraud at satyam after its founder ramalinga raju admitted to cooking up books in 2009 . the securities and exchange board of india had sent a notice to price waterhouse pointing out that it had accepted satyam 's monthly bank statements as final even though they did n't match with the company 's daily bank statements . ",
        "sebi had also found price waterhouse non-compliant with the auditing standards prescribed by the institute of chartered accountants of india . s gopalakrishnan and srinivas talluri had certified satyam 's audit reports during that period . price waterhouse challenged the notice before the bombay high court on grounds that sebi had no jurisdiction over auditors . the court rejected the argument . it later contested the notice before the securities appellate tribunal , saying the auditor was not given access to the entire material collected during the investigation and had been denied the right to cross-examine persons whose statements sebi had relied upon . ",
        "the appellate tribunal held that sebi had violated principles of natural justice and directed the market regulator to allow price waterhouse to cross-examine several individuals , including raju . sebi challenged the order before the supreme court , which rejected its plea in january last year and directed the market regulator to give price waterhouse access to investigation material .
