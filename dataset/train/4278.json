        "the iphone has been named the `` best-selling tech product of 2017 '' by analyst daniel ives of gbh insights . apple 's smartphone achieved the same ranking in 2016 , and ives said that the company will sell a total of 223 million iphones in 2017 , increasing from 211 million sold in 2016 . the iphone was followed by samsung galaxy s8 and note 8 , amazon echo dot , apple watch , and nintendo switch . the rankings include all models of iphone grouped together , explaining why the gap is so large between apple 's iphone and samsung 's galaxy s8 and note 8 . ",
        "but all in all , apple sold more iphones total , although less than the peak year of 2015 , when it moved 230 million units . ives thinks apple will have an even bigger 2018 , with a spring update to its compact se iphone and more new phones in the fall . out of the billion-plus consumer base of the iphone , `` 350 million of them will upgrade next year , '' says ives . in the fourth spot , ives described apple watch as a product that 's now `` found its niche '' in the wearables market , thanks to the lte series 3 update that makes it less reliant on the iphone . ",
        "the analyst also cited ongoing discounts for older models , improved battery life on the series 3 , and apple 's pivot away from marketing the apple watch as a fashion accessory to one mainly used for fitness and working out . earlier this week , data shared by mobile analytics firm flurry described the iphone and ipad as the most popular items gifted around the world for the holidays . flurry looked at device activations from december 19 to december 25 and noted that 44 percent of new device activations were for apple products , with the iphone 7 leading the pack at 15.1 percent of apple product activations . ",
        "for the newer models , the iphone x was at 14.7 percent while the iphone 8 and 8 plus sat at 8.1 and 8.7 percent , respectively . related roundups : apple watch , watchos 4 , iphone 8 , iphone xbuyer 's guide : apple watch , iphone 8 , iphone x discuss this article in our forums .   "
