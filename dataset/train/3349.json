        "ali smith , born in inverness , scotland , and cambridge-educated , has become a literary eminence in britain . she 's been shortlisted four times for the prestigious man booker prize , among assorted distinguished awards ; playwright sebastian barry called her `` scotland 's nobel laureate in waiting . '' i have long admired smith , and am thankful her work 's in the world . that said , `` winter '' did n't take my heart in both hands . i wanted it to . it promised to -- with its cheeky overture : `` god was dead : to begin with . ",
        "and romance ... chivalry ... poetry , the novel , painting , they were all dead , and art was dead . theatre and cinema were both dead . literature ... the book ... history ... political correctness ... thought ... hope ... truth and fiction ... '' happily : `` life was n't yet dead . '' but neither , alas , is hatred . it is in fact `` the dead of winter when happens , a bright sunny post-millennial global-warming christmas eve morning . '' our winter of discontent ? just so -- opening on sophia cleves , a 71-year-old woman who lives alone in a big , shabby , multi-bedroomed house in cornwall , chatting with a floating , disembodied child 's head that 's chosen to keep her company . ",
        "the head -- `` very well mannered , polite '' -- is actually fun-loving , following her around the house like the loyal red balloon in the classic french film . magical realism ? fantasy ? is sophia bonkers ? smith lets that uncertainty float while her asides dart about , pondering history , sex , politics , music , eco-correctness -- and especially art . sophia considers taking the little head on an outing to london 's national gallery , but businesses will be closing early on christmas eve . she contemplates the head perched on her dining table `` like a tabletop still life by c√©zanne . '' ",
        "sophia turns out not to be crazy , just lonely and depressed -- like heaven knows how many of us these days . brexit has happened . trump 's been elected . sophia has her eyes examined , after googling `` seeing a little green-blue sphere off to the side of my vision '' . it soon becomes a small `` sputnik '' ; later a wheezing , green-moss-plugged thing ; later still , a smooth stone . is the spheroid a ghost ? our embattled planet ? the true spirit of christmas ? maybe all three ? what 's clear is that an aging woman , numbed by the nonstop avalanche of modern atrocity , has walled herself off -- again , like so many . ",
        "also foregrounded are soph 's grown son arthur , who writes a faked , unfeeling eco-blog ; his angry ex-girlfriend charlotte , and a young croatian immigrant named lux , a kind samaritan whom art spots at a bus stop . he pays lux to pretend to be charlotte on his visit home for christmas . they 're joined there by sophia 's estranged , activist/boho sister iris , `` brilliant ... trouble , '' who lives nearby but never visits . these individuals converge to confront each other in the big shabby house , like characters in a chekhov play . ",
        "at first , hellish implosion looms . slowly , erratically , connection creeps in . lux quietly mediates . ire softens . sophia at last eats something . art resees nature . their mad hatter table talk mirrors our own . climate change , misogyny , greed , xenophobia : smith has at them all , naming names . and this bent , while valiant , is where the novel 's cohesiveness begins to quiver , because it makes the story and characters start to feel almost incidental . charlotte rants at art : `` hat was truly new ... was that the people in power were self-servers who 'd ... felt no responsibility towards history ... like a new kind of being ... who 'd been birthed not by real historied time and people but by ... plastic carrier bags . ",
        "... that unhistoried ... that inhuman ... that damaging to the environment for years and years after they 've outgrown their use . damage for generations . '' it 's not that such tirades are untrue or untimely . it 's that they 're soapboxy , and `` winter 's '' characters verge on becoming mouthpieces . granted , smith 's playfulness ranges like a riffing keyboardist 's : word games , quotes and allusions , time travel , even mockery of literary form : `` nd here instead 's another version of what was happening that morning , as if from a novel in which sophia is the kind of character she 'd choose to be ... the kind of quality literary fiction where ... there are no heads divided from bodies ... '' oddly or not , nobody else runs into the head . ",
        "`` winter '' gives the patient reader a colorful , witty -- yes , warming -- divertissement . but for me the global alarms and laments , while utterly accurate , are so numerous that the whole structure finally seems more a billboard for smith 's passionate concerns about the fate of us all . maybe , for now , that can be enough . joan frank 's latest novel is `` all the news i need , '' winner of the juniper prize for fiction , published by the university of massachusetts press . email : books@sfchronicle . comwinterby ali smith .
