        "birstonas , lithuania -- lavar ball says los angeles lakers coach luke walton has lost the team . ball , who woke up at 5 a. m. local time saturday morning to watch his son lonzo ball return for the lakers , expressed his frustration with walton in an exclusive interview with espn . `` you can see they 're not playing for luke no more , '' lavar said from the spa resort in birstonas where he is staying while his two youngest sons get ready to make their professional debuts . `` luke does n't have control of the team no more . ",
        "they do n't want to play for him . '' `` that 's a good team , '' he added of the lakers , who have lost nine straight games . `` nobody wants to play for him . i can see it . no high five 's when they come out of the game . people do n't know why they 're in the game . he 's too young . he 's too young . ... he ai n't connecting with them anymore . you can look at every player , he 's not connecting with not one player . ",
        "`` lavar has had issues with his sons ' coaches the last few years and even pulled lamelo from chino hills high prior to the start of the season due to problems with first-year coach dennis latimore . `` lonzo looked good , but he also looked disgusted , '' lavar said . `` he was ready to play . four minutes left in the first quarter , he dunked it , getting in a flow and coach sits him down . sat him down . now game goes from 4 points to 10 to 15 to 20 . i do n't know what they 're doing . ",
        "if he 's ready to play , let him play . do n't try and monitor no minutes , put on restrictions . `` ball made his return after missing six games with a sprained shoulder . he finished with 11 points and five assists in 27 minutes in the loss to charlotte . lavar also said he is confident that lebron james , whom he has never met , will be coming to the lakers this offseason as a free agent . `` lebron 's coming to la . i know he 's coming to la , '' lavar said . ",
        "`` lebron is not a fool . what 's the only way he can beat jordan ? you ca n't get more championships . only one way , to say every team i 've gone to i 've won a championship . go to lakers and win a championship , then you 're better than jordan . '' `` you ca n't give my son the best player in the league , and do n't expect them not to win , '' he added . `` get rid of everybody . give him lebron and gelo . you got a 2 and a 3 . ",
        "and it 's a win . it 's a wrap . then all you need are two rebounders -- randle and nance jr. . but even with lebron , ball does n't feel that walton is the right man to lead the lakers to a title . `` even if you bring in a lebron or a george , he ca n't coach them guys , '' he said . `` what is he gon na tell them ? he 's too young . he has no control . ''   "
