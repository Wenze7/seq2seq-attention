        "u. s. soldiers attend welcoming ceremony for u. s.-led nato troops at polygon near orzysz , poland , april 13 , 2017 . Â© kacper pempe / reuterstwo thirds of russians believe their country has enemies in the international arena , with the us , ukraine and the eu topping the list , a fresh survey by independent pollster levada center has revealed . according to research conducted in early december , 66 percent of respondents considered that russia has enemies , while 21 percent believed that the country exists in a peaceful international environment . levada center has been carrying out similar surveys for the last 23 years . ",
        "the highest result in response to this question was recorded at the beginning of the ukrainian conflict in 2014 , when 84 percent of those surveyed said that russia had enemies . russian attitudes to us and eu deteriorate , but more citizens want relations mendedwhen asked to specifically name russia 's foreign enemies , the majority of respondents -- 68 percent -- singled out the us , which is no surprise as relations between moscow and washington are at their lowest in decades over accusations of election meddling , the imposition of sanctions , and other issues . second-placed ukraine was far behind the us on the enemy list on 29 percent , followed by the european union on 14 percent . ",
        "poland , the baltic states and other former soviet republics , germany and the uk were also among the answers . meanwhile , nato , which has been boosting its presence near russian borders in recent years , was cited by just 6 percent of respondents , which was still more than terrorists from islamic state , al-nusra front , and other groups . 23 percent of those surveyed also said ` yes ' when asked if they believed that russia was `` surrounded by enemies from all sides . '' `` the us has been on the list of russia 's main enemies since the late 1990s , while europe and ukraine appeared on it after the outbreak of the conflict over crimea , in which the west unequivocally supported ukraine , '' said denis volkov , levada center sociologist , as cited by rbc . ",
        "`` from the very beginning , the conflict was perceived not as russian-ukrainian , but as one between russia and the west . `` another survey , carried out by the all-russian public opinion research center in summer 2017 , showed that 38 percent of russians feared that the country may face a military attack . 63 percent of respondents considered the us to be the most likely source of aggression , followed by ukraine and nato .
