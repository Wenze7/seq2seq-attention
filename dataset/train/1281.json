        "kobe bryant ` s jersey retirement game got off to a late start . it tipped around 7:30 p. m. in los angeles , and it was the culmination of what was likely a long day for bryant . the ceremony itself did n't end until after 9 p. m. pst , and then the lakers and warriors had an entire second half of hoops to play . so if you 're kobe bean bryant and you have your family with you , there is no way on earth that you want overtime . it 's been an emotionally-charged day where he had to do stuff like sit through a press conference and give a speech to the staples center . ",
        "you can not blame him if he wants to go to sleep . that 's especially the case when neither kevin durant nor kentavious caldwell-pope could break a 102-102 tie at the end of regulation . bryant decided to do what anyone who had a full day would do in the same situation : go home . bryant said during his pre-ceremony press conference that his routine involves waking up at 5 a. m. to work out , and assuming he wants to get a solid 7-8 hours of sleep before he starts grinding , that means getting to bed by like 10 p. m . ",
        "he was already past his bedtime under that assumption , and i know that if i was bryant , i 'd have considered packing it in by the time the third quarter ended . the bad news is that he missed a fun game , one that ended with durant making up for his previous miss by doing this to lonzo ball . the good news , though , is he got to get a head start on traffic so he could get to bed . mamba out .
