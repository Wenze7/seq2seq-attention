        "one day after the announcement that richie sambora will be inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame alongside the other founding members of bon jovi next april , the guitarist is releasing a new song , `` one night of peace , '' that captures the spirit of the holiday season . sambora and his musical partner , former michael jackson guitarist orianthi , will include the song on the forthcoming ep , `` making history , '' set for release friday . the ep is the follow-up to `` rise , '' the first of what sambora says are at leave five eps that will be released under the pair 's project , rso . ",
        "`` it just rolls off the tongue , '' sambora says . `` what were we going to call it ? samborianthi ? it seems okay ! '' written years ago , `` one night of peace '' was inspired by a close friend of the guitarist who served in the military during the first iraq war . `` that song was written twenty-something years ago , when the first invasion of iraq happened , '' sambora tells variety . `` a good friend of mine was in the service and he called me the night before . he could n't tell me where he was -- i imagine it would be kuwait -- and he goes , ` hey , i 'm going in tomorrow . ",
        "i ca n't tell you for what and what i 'm doing or anything like that , but do me a favor , can you take care of my kids ? ' he had two kids and a wife , and he wanted me look out for them . that 's when the song really was born . it 's been sitting there for a long time . `` i usually do n't take songs from the past , but for some reason i think that song is going to be relevant at any time , '' he continues . ",
        "`` i just performed on a tv show for the troops in new york and there and it was not a dry eye in the house . it 's one of those songs that that can potentially really be around and be a real healing kind of song for a lot of people , because we all want one night of peace . it 's a pipe dream but let 's hope it happens . '' the `` making history '' ep explores those themes as well as personal relationships , continuing the musical conversation began in september with the `` rise '' ep , he says . ",
        "`` they 're really songs about hope and positivity , '' sambora says . `` it 's about trying to be positive in such a wild time in this world when there 's so many crazy things that are happening . '' others explore the couple 's relationship as it happens in `` real time '' -- with many of the tracks recorded in the kitchen located in their home in casablasas , calif. . `` ` walk with me ' is one of our favorites because it 's one of the earliest songs that we wrote together . it 's really about togetherness . ",
        "i think if two people believe in the same thing , it 's a very powerful thing . if you got two 2,000 people and then 2,000,000 and then the whole world to believe in that , then you 've got something . '' to bring the music to life , sambora enlisted producer bob rock , who worked with bon jovi back in the '80s . `` he is just unbelievable , '' sambora says . `` obviously bob and i have a history -- we sold maybe 70 something thousand million records or whatever together . '' there is more in store for 2018 : sambora and orianthi wrote three songs just this week while on vacation in hawaii . ",
        "there are 25 masters finished , he says . plus , there is the touring schedule , which includes shows in australia , and a gig at carnegie hall honoring the music of led zeppelin on march 7 . `` jimmy page is a good friend of mine and robert plant t is an acquaintance and it came through stan martin , one of ori 's friends , and we 're looking forward to doing it . , '' he says . having two musicians in the house is ideal for sambora , who first got together with orianthi when he needed a guitar player for an australian solo tour . ",
        "`` people look at me as jon bon jovi 's side guy and they look at her as michael jackson 's side arm , '' he says . `` they do n't know that we write songs and we can actually sing besides just being the shredding guitar people , '' he says . `` when people come to see ori and i play , they see two people that are really sincere about what they do and we do have a lot of life experience in us , so we bring that to the table on every performance and every show . ",
        "it 's really a beautiful thing , '' he says . and then there is the induction ceremony for the rock and roll hall of fame in april . jon bon jovi told variety that both sambora and former bassist alec john such are welcome to join himself , drummer tico torres , keyboardist dave bryan , bassist hugh mcdonald and new guitarist phil x in the celebrations . sambora says he has no problem with playing at the show . `` it 's wonderful to be recognized for your achievements , '' he says .
