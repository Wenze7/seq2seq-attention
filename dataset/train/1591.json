        "bangkok -- bangladesh and myanmar have agreed that they will try to complete the repatriation of hundreds of thousands of rohingya muslim refugees who fled from violence in myanmar within two years , bangladesh 's foreign ministry said tuesday . the ministry said a joint working group from the two countries finalized an agreement on monday on the physical arrangements for the repatriation of the ethnic rohingya . it said they agreed that the process `` would be completed preferably within two years from the commencement of repatriation . `` myanmar and bangladesh signed an initial agreement in november to repatriate the rohingya , and the 30-member working group was set up last month to oversee the process . ",
        "many have questions whether rohingya would return to myanmar under the current circumstances , and whether myanmar would accept them and allow them to live freely . under the november agreement , rohingya will need to provide evidence of their residency in myanmar in order to return -- something many say they do not have . more than 650,000 ethnic rohingya have fled to bangladesh since august , when myanmar 's military launched a brutal crackdown in rakhine state after a militant group attacked police posts . myanmar 's army described it as `` clearance operations '' against terrorists , but the united nations and the u. s. have called it `` ethnic cleansing . ",
        "`` despite having lived in predominantly buddhist myanmar for generations , rohingya muslims have been denied citizenship , freedom of movement and access to basic social rights . they are generally called `` bengalis , '' a reference to the belief that they migrated illegally from bangladesh . myanmar officials said the length of the repatriation will depend on how quickly bangladesh can provide documentation of refugees ' previous residency and how fast applications are submitted . `` even though we are talking about a two-year process , it totally depends on how the two countries cooperate , '' myanmar government spokesman zaw htay said . ",
        "`` bangladesh authorities also need to proceed with the paperwork and documents for refugees and send it to us fast . `` since the november agreement , myanmar 's civilian government led by aung san suu kyi has pledged to take measures to halt the outflow of rohingya to bangladesh and restore normalcy in the rakhine region . myanmar officials plan to start the repatriation process next tuesday . zaw htay said at least 500 hindus and 500 muslims will be in the first group to return . state-run media in myanmar reported monday that a camp is being prepared that can accommodate about 30,000 people in 625 buildings , and that at least 100 buildings will be completed by the end of the month . ",
        "it would be the first camp built in the repatriation process . the international community and rights groups have stressed that the myanmar government must guarantee the `` safe and voluntary '' return of the refugees , and urged that international organizations be allowed to participate . however , the u. n. refugee agency said tuesday that it has not been invited to take part or given full access to the areas where refugees are to return . `` unchr and our partners need urgent , unhindered access in rakhine state , in order to assess the situation and provide support to those in need , '' unchr spokesman andrej mahecic said in geneva . ",
        "u.s. - based human rights watch said the discussions between myanmar and bangladesh failed to include any understanding of what the rohingya want . `` where are considerations for protection of the rohingya from myanmar security forces who months ago were raping and killing them ? '' said phil robertson , deputy director of the group 's asia division . `` why are basic issues like citizenship , freedom of movement , and livelihoods not discussed now so refugees can make informed choices ?
