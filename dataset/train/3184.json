        "for many years , one of the biggest complaints with the kansas city chiefs has been their lack of talented wide receivers . it looks like those days might finally be behind us , my friends . in 2014 , the kansas city chiefs wide receivers failed to score a touchdown all season long . that brought to light just how bad the corps had been for years , but the chiefs actually have a pretty good group on the roster heading into 2018 . people wondered how tyreek hill would perform as the number one wideout , but he did his part beautifully . ",
        "hill captured 75 receptions for 1,183 yards and seven touchdowns in his first official year as the chiefs starting wide receiver and he definitely did n't disappoint . while sometimes i wonder how long of a career hill will have due to his size , he 's proving to be as good as advertised in his given role . the chiefs wo n't need a number one option to replace him , at least not next year . the chiefs will likely have chris conley in the second wide receiver spot . conley has n't really done a whole lot in his now three seasons with the franchise , but his 2017 campaign was cut short due to a season ending injury in week five . ",
        "conley has only racked up 904 yards and one touchdown in three seasons , but patrick mahomes could be the difference maker regarding conley 's production . if conley still fails to produce with a new quarterback , then that 'll answer that question . after those two , the chiefs have demarcus robinson , who was given more opportunities to prove himself as the 2017 season rolled along . robinson had 21 receptions for 212 yards and had a touchdown in the wild card game . the only other receivers currently on kansas city 's roster who wo n't be free agents are jehu chesson and marcus kemp . ",
        "chesson was a fourth round pick last year and saw limited action as a rookie . kemp had good chemistry with mahomes during the preseason and he 'd be a good under the radar guy to keep around . the practice squad also has two receivers on it : gehrig dieter and daniel braverman . dieter played at alabama and spent the entire 2017 season with the chiefs while braverman was a member of the bears in 2016 and appeared in three games with chicago . we did n't even touch on albert wilson in this article , who i previously made the case should be re-signed this offseason . ",
        "wilson had his best year in 2017 and if he comes back , that 's an even stronger argument as to why kansas city does n't need to add another receiver through the draft . kansas city chiefs : all-time leaders in receiving touchdownsit 's always a popular sentiment for the kansas city chiefs to draft a wide receiver every year , but for the first time in a long time , that 's not a strong need for this team . the chiefs need to focus mostly on defense in the draft , upgrading at cornerback and linebacker . ",
        "if they 're going to draft some offensive players , depth on the offensive line and at the running back position are the ways to go there . after years with mediocre wide receivers , the kansas city chiefs are finally set up to succeed there and it 's a good feeling . let 's hope these guys deliver in 2018 and make mahomes look like a superstar ! more from kc kingdom kansas city royals 2018 : jorge bonifacio vs jorge soler in right field3h ago k-state basketball : brutal stretch ahead for the wildcats4h ago kansas city chiefs : a weapon on the practice squad is chiefs best kept secret5h ago kansas city royals : trade with padres last season could still pay off1 d ago kansas city chiefs : 5 reasons chiefs will be better in 20181 d ago for many years , one of the biggest complaints with the kansas city chiefs has been their lack of talented wide receivers .
