'' ",
        "the show will run jan. . 16 and 17 at pier 94 in new york . the opportunity to work with schoeller , the 2017 fashion smart creation prize at the last pv awards , was a selling point for cornejo who also commended the company 's avant-garde reputation in this arena . the swiss textiles maker was honored for its double-face fabric with a color-contrasting back in econyl yarn . `` this was an amazing opportunity . there was no reservation for me to do it because it was also about spotlighting sustainability , showing that it does n't have to be boring , '' she said .
