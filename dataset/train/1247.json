        "the actor michelle williams has welcomed co-star mark wahlberg 's decision to donate his $ 1.5 m pay cheque for reshoots of all the money in the world to time 's up , thanking fellow actors who `` stood by me and stood up for me '' . wahlberg said on saturday his donation to the initiative , which was set up to help fund accusers of sexual harassment and abuse , would be made in the name of williams . she was reportedly paid less than $ 1,000 for the reshoots , which were necessary after director ridley scott replaced kevin spacey in the lead role of j paul getty with christopher plummer less than two months before the film 's world premiere . ",
        "spacey was the subject of a number of accusations of sexual misconduct , the first by actor anthony rapp , who alleged he was 14 when spacey sexually harassed him . initially , scott told the guardian all actors involved did reshoots for free . days later , anonymous sources told usa today wahlberg was paid $ 1.5 m and williams less than $ 1,000 . `` i heard for the reshoot she got $ 80 a day compared to his millions , '' the actor jessica chastain tweeted . `` would anyone like to clarify ? i really hope that with everything coming to light , she was paid fairly . ",
        "she 's a brilliant actress and is wonderful in the film . `` wahlberg was the highest paid male actor in 2017 , according to forbes . williams was a founding member of time 's up . in her statement , williams praised the move by wahlberg and the talent agency william morris endeavor , which said it would donate an additional $ 500,000 to time 's up . in a statement , williams said : `` today is n't about me . my fellow actresses stood by me and stood up for me , my activist friends taught me to use my voice and the most powerful men in charge , they listened and they acted . ",
        "`` if we truly envision an equal world , it takes equal effort and sacrifice . today is one of the most indelible days of my life because of mark wahlberg , wme and a community of women and men who share in this accomplishment . anthony rapp , for all the shoulders you stood on , now we stand on yours .
