        "the playstation 4 was once again on top of the video game industry for november 2017 , beating the massively popular nintendo switch and setting a record for most number of units sold in a month . the feat is certainly not bad for a 4-year-old console , with sony claiming that playstation 4 all-time sales reached the 70 million mark this month . playstation 4 beats nintendo switch , sets new record in the processthe nintendo switch dominated the hardware sales charts for four straight months until october , with the hybrid console looking like it had all the momentum heading in the holiday season .

        "however , according to the npd group , it was the playstation 4 that ruled november , beating the nintendo switch and the xbox one . even more impressive for the 4-year-old console is that it set a new record for units sold , selling more units in november compared to any other month since the playstation 4 was released in november 2013 . the playstation 4 was not expected to sell well in november , as nintendo had all the momentum with the late october release of super mario odyssey and microsoft finally released the highly anticipated xbox one x . however , sony 's console turned around the predictions and instead sold the most units ever in its history . ",
        "however , the xbox one also made waves in november . while there were more playstation 4 units sold , customers spent the most in buying new xbox one units , as it appeared that gamers were waiting to shell out $ 500 for the xbox one x. overall , the video game industry looks like it is at its healthiest in recent memory , which is good news for everyone . according to npd analyst mat piscatella , year to date , gamers spent $ 3.4 billion in hardware , which is a 28 percent increase compared to the same month of 2016 .
