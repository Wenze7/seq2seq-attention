        "i responded to your text late at night after he left . now i know why you did that . i know because i just watched myself doing the exact same thing for the first time . what is that they say about empathy ? something about walking a mile in someone 's shoes . i responded to your text late at night after he left , when i had n't thought about you in weeks . and now i know why i occasionally hear from you out of the blue , and late at night , too . and it is n't because you are in love with me , or that you secretly want to be with me , or any of the reasons i thought . ",
        "because texts late at night and out of the blue are n't how love looks . i know that now . it was a cry for help , a lapse in self-control . those are more likely at nighttime . the darkness houses our subjectively shameful thoughts and impulses . subjectively , because all shame is . it does n't exist outside of us . now i know that like me , you were probably trying to escape a feeling . one that felt too much to process . my feeling was that specific sort of loneliness : when you 're physically close to someone you like , but at an emotional distance from them . ",
        "we do not have a name for it in english yet . what were you escaping ? when i realized why you did that , it upset me a little . because now i know for sure that you do not love me . but if you did love me , that would be a problem , because i do not love you . the ego is a funny thing . ` phone'i think i know why you do that . you have your phone between you and i when we are together . it is there although its been six months since i saw you , and you have been pestering me to spend time with you . ",
        "and now i am here in front of you , but you can not focus , because you are ` in a funk ' . actually you 've always been in a funk , which is why i do not spend time with you . i feel frustrated with you . but not so much , because i know why you do that . the fact that i do not put my phone between you and i is not because i am better than you , it is because my emotional weaknesses are different . because now i know what yours are , i know why you do that . ",
        "and it is not because you do not care about me , or wish to insult me . you do that because in a way , you do not know how not to do it . although i know why you do that , it is still not okay . i am not willing for that behavior to be a part of my relationship with you , or any of my relationships . empathizing is different to embracing . ` fallacy'i think i know why you did that . but i could be wrong . because i do n't know exactly how it is to walk in your shoes . ",
        "i only have my ability to see things from your perspective . and it is n't flawless , that ability . i am still refining it . ` dumbfounded ' why did i just do that ? not to even try to understand is unthinkable . ` anything you can do ... ' i know why you did that . because even though i have n't done what you did , i can imagine doing it if the feeling was powerful enough . everything you do i am capable of . that acknowledgement lives inside my heart now . it has to . ",
        "i know why you did that because increasingly , i know why i do what i do . how else can i stand next to you ? now i know why you did that because although the lens is slightly different for us all , we have the same filters . the happy filter . the despair one . anger , envy , pure hate . i can be with all your filters , as i have been with mine . nothing you can do would make me balk from you . ` response'now i know why you did that , i neither accept nor support your actions . ",
        "knowing why just means i need not add confusion to the gamut of emotions i feel right now . now i know why you did that , i can effectively respond . which only ever means one thing : compassion . compassion , which is n't always gentle , but is never not strong . unlike indifference , blame , or denial . now i know why you did that , i know for sure that you do not have to . you have a choice . one that does not involve violence , against yourself or others . now i know why you did that , i am still angry , just not with you . ",
        "well a bit with you . i 'm angry because of your seeming unwillingness to see that you can make this better for yourself . my anger is not your problem . provided that i do not act on it , it is n't a problem at all . it is just anger . it shows me what i care the most about . ` request ' i have no idea why you did that . you 're going to need to help me out .
