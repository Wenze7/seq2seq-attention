        "washington -- opposition to the trump administration 's plan to expand offshore drilling is mounting as democrats from coastal states accuse president donald trump of punishing states with democratic leaders and a second republican governor asks to withdraw his state from the plan . democrats said trump and interior secretary ryan zinke were being hypocritical by agreeing to a request by florida 's republican governor to withdraw from the drilling plan , but not making the same accommodation to states with democratic governors . democratic rep. adam schiff of california said on twitter that his state , `` like florida , has hundreds of miles of beautiful coastline and a governor who wants to keep it that way . ",
        "or is that not enough for blue states ? '' `` if local voices matter why have n't they excluded virginia ? '' asked sen. tim kaine , d-va . `` is it because the governor of florida is a republican and the virginia governor is a democrat ? `` the complaints came as south carolina 's republican governor said wednesday he is seeking an exemption from the proposed drilling expansion , a move that will test the relationship between trump and one of his earliest supporters . gov. henry mcmaster told reporters that risks associated with drilling pose a serious threat to south carolina 's lush coastline and $ 20 billion tourism industry . ",
        "`` we can not afford to take a chance with the beauty , the majesty and the economic value and vitality of our wonderful coastline in south carolina , '' mcmaster said . opposition to drilling is bipartisan within south carolina 's congressional delegation : all three house members who represent the state 's 190 miles of coastline told the associated press they are against the expansion plan . two of the three are republicans , including rep. mark sanford , a former governor who said zinke had set a precedent by honoring florida 's request for an exemption . ",
        "`` what 's good for the goose is good for the gander , '' sanford said , adding that republicans should respect local wishes . in virginia , gop rep. scott taylor joined kaine and gov. - elect ralph northam in opposing the drilling plan . sen. mark warner , d-va . , called trump 's plan `` a complete non-starter . `` sen. jeff merkley , d-ore . , said on twitter that `` the only science @secretaryzinke follows is political science . he 'll reverse course to protect fellow republicans in florida , but not to protect coastlines and jobs across the rest of the country ? ",
        "totally unacceptable . `` heather swift , a spokeswoman for zinke , accused kaine and other democrats of taking cheap shots at her boss . `` the secretary has said since day one that he is interested in the local voice . if those governors would like to request meetings with the secretary , they are absolutely welcome to do so , '' she said . `` their criticism is empty pandering . `` as of wednesday , only mcmaster and democratic gov. roy cooper of north carolina had requested a meeting with zinke on offshore drilling , swift said . ",
        "in oregon , democratic gov. kate brown took to twitter to ask zinke for relief . linking to zinke tweet about florida , brown wrote : `` hey @secretaryzinke , how about doing the same for #oregon ? `` zinke said after a brief meeting with scott at the tallahassee airport tuesday that drilling in florida waters would be `` off the table , '' despite a plan that proposed drilling in the eastern gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean off florida . the change of course -- just five days after zinke announced the offshore drilling plan -- highlights the political importance of florida , where trump narrowly won the state 's 29 electoral votes in the 2016 election and has encouraged scott to run for senate . ",
        "the state is also important economically , with a multibillion-dollar tourism business built on sunshine and miles of white sandy beaches . and florida is where trump has a winter home in palm beach . trump spent his christmas and new year 's break at his mar-a-lago resort . former white house ethics chief walter shaub said zinke 's decision to exempt florida from the drilling plan appears to be a conflict of interest for trump . trump is `` exempting the state that is home to the festering cankerous conflict of interest that the administration likes to call the ` winter white house ' and none of the other affected states , '' shaub tweeted . ",
        "zinke said tuesday that `` florida is obviously unique '' and that the decision to remove the state came after meetings and discussion with scott , a trump ally and a likely candidate for the senate seat now held by democrat bill nelson . nelson called scott 's meeting with zinke `` a political stunt '' and said scott has long wanted to drill off florida 's coast , despite his recent opposition . scott 's office said he repeatedly voiced his opposition to drilling to zinke , including at an october meeting in washington . `` senator nelson and anyone else who opposes oil drilling off florida 's coast should be happy the governor was able to secure this commitment . ",
        "this is n't about politics . this is good policy for florida , '' said john tupps , a scott spokesman . zinke announced plans last week to greatly expand offshore oil drilling from the atlantic to the arctic and pacific oceans , including multiple areas where drilling is now blocked . the plan was immediately met with bipartisan opposition on both the atlantic and pacific coasts . democratic governors along both coasts unanimously oppose drilling , as do a number of republican governors , including mcmaster , maryland gov. larry hogan and massachusetts gov. charles baker . the five-year plan announced by zinke would open 90 percent of the nation 's offshore reserves to development by private companies . ",
        "industry groups praised the announcement , while environmental groups denounced the plan , saying it would impose `` severe and unacceptable harm '' to america 's oceans , coastal economies , public health and marine life . ___ associated press writers meg kinnard in columbia , s. c. , ben finley in norfolk , va. , and gary fineout in tallahassee , fla. , contributed to this report .
