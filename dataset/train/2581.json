        "the u. s. state department will reduce the number of organizations authorized to resettle refugees for 2018 as part of president trump 's plan to prevent more refugees from entering the united states . the state department announced its downsizing plan at a meeting in washington on december 1 with officials and representatives from nine major refugee agencies , several executives of the agencies said , as reported by reuters . dozens of refugee resettlement offices out of some 300 spread across the states may close as a result , since refugee resettlement is handled by non-profit agencies that rely on government funding and require its approval for refugees ' relocation . ",
        "the plan calls for the closure of any offices that will have fewer than 100 refugees cases in 2018 , which is more likely to occur due to trump 's tightened immigration policy . the trump administration already cut in half the cap set by obama from roughly 100,000 to 50,000 refugees allowed into the united states . in september , trump announced a cap of 45,000 for 2018 , the lowest number since the establishment of the u. s. refugee program in 1980 . resettlement offices provide refugees with a slew of services to help them integrate into american life , from helping with proper documentation and arranging services such as medical appointments , enrolling children in schools , applying for social security . ",
        "notwithstanding the expected closures , the trump administration has emphasized assimilating refugees quickly and effectively for national security and fiscal purposes . if refugees lose access to resettlement services a job , then `` it will take longer for them to navigate life in the united states and contribute to our economy , '' said robert carey , who directed the office of refugee resettlement under former president barack obama . the resettlement agencies are now scrambling to reorganize and consolidate offices in a geographically sensible and practical fashion . `` we 're hoping that they only close sites where there is possible duplication , '' said mark hetfield , president of hias , one of the nine agencies . ",
        "`` this is going to have to be a negotiation and a process . ''   "
