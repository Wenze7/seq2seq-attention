        "an appetite of galactic proportions . the revolution will not be televised . it 'll be sent to your inbox by us . with the help of high-power telescopes , scientific measurements , and a little creativity , astronomers can usually understand what 's going on in the cosmos hundreds of light-years away . of course , there will always be some anomalies , that 's how the story of the star rz piscium beings . this star is 550 light-years away in the constellation pisces and has been `` winking '' at astronomers since they 've discovered it . ",
        "from earth , the star seemed to dim and then brighten up again in erratic cycles that could last for up to two days . in a paper published thursday in the astronomical journal , a team of u. s. astronomers explain that this sporadic `` winking '' is caused by the star 's insatiable appetite for other planets . by measuring the energy radiating from the star , the team of researchers discovered that a significant portion of the lightwaves coming from rz piscium are infrared . this suggests it 's surrounded by a giant cloud of space dust . ",
        "when stars are born , gravity mashes massive amounts of gas and dust into a insanely hot orb . during this process , a gigantic cyclone of particles forms around this new star . so it makes sense newborn stars would have clouds of dust around them -- but rz picsium is n't a baby star at all . astronomers observing the star found that it 's extremely rich in lithium . stars only start developing that much lithium after they 've been around for a few million years . according to their estimates , rz picsium is roughly 30 to 50 million-years-old , which is way too old to still have its original cloud of dust around it . ",
        "this means the cloud surrounding the star has to come from other sources . `` most sun-like stars have lost their planet-forming disks within a few million years of their birth , '' said team member ben zuckerman , an astronomy professor at the university of california in a statement . `` the fact that rz piscium hosts so much gas and dust after tens of millions of years means it 's probably destroying , rather than building , planets . '' while they do n't have a concrete answer , the team came up with two possible explanations . ",
        "the debris could have come from planets in the star 's orbit crashing into each other and being swallowed up by rz picsium . or the star 's gravitational pull is stripping parts of the planets that surround it . in times like these , we 're thankful that our sun is n't starving . if you liked this article , check out this video : `` a dusty hamburger feeds a protostar ''   "
