        "photo credit patrick george/jalopnikin december 1977 , steve mcqueen wrote the owner of one of two mustangs used in the iconic chase scene from bullitt . `` again , '' mcqueen wrote , `` i would like to appeal to you to get back my '68 mustang . '' but he was rebuffed and , for nearly 40 years , the car pretty much disappeared . it was sitting in various states of disrepair until its owner , who inherited it from his father , contacted ford in 2016 . the timing was perfect ; ford was planning to introduce a 2019 bullitt mustang to celebrate the movie 's 50th-ish anniversary . ",
        "journalist larry webster has the complete story over at hagerty . com . the most satisfying part has to be mcqueen , a notorious dirtbag , getting turned down in his attempts to get his mustang back . the car had passed through two other buyers before an insurance executive named bob kiernan bought it in the mid - '70s . not long after , mcqueen himself came calling . but bob was steadfast in keeping it . the rich and famous are often allergic to the word `` no , '' and so was mcqueen . his impatience over being rebuked in his quest emerged in the last sentence : `` i would be happy to try to find you another mustang similar to the one you have , '' he wrote , `` if there is not too much monies involved in it . ",
        "otherwise , we had better forget it . '' the owner was just fine with forgetting it , and then the bullitt mustang made an exit , stage left , from recorded history . `` it was n't about the money , '' said . `` my dad was n't stubborn , he just loved the thing . he wanted it in his garage forever . '' sean added with pride , `` my dad told steve mcqueen thanks but no thanks . he was a bad-ass . '' photo credit fordbob kiernan mostly used a company car to get around , which left the bullitt mustang for his wife to use as a daily driver . ",
        "`` the bullitt likes to drink the gas , '' she said back then . in 1980 , the car 's clutch went out , and with 65,000 miles on the clock , it was moved into the garage , for what turned out to be a long stay . after that the mustang mostly sat in the various places bob kiernan lived around the country , first starting in new jersey , then ohio , then kentucky , and , finally , nashville , with various false starts in trying to get it back in shape . finally , bob 's son sean kiernan got ford involved , who were eager to unveil the original alongside the 2019 bullitt mustang at the detroit auto show . ",
        "webster was given access ahead of that unveiling , though everyone tried to keep a veil of secrecy , since , as webster says , this was something like an automotive holy grail . what he saw sounds like it could use some work . the v-8 does n't look like anything special . it was originally modified by max balchowsky , the same guy who opened hollywood motors and built the old yeller ii race car plus several movie cars . sean and his father had the engine rebuilt using as many original parts as they could . before installing it , they had the engine tested , and it produced 315 horsepower at 4500 rpm and 400 pound-feet of torque at 3000 . ",
        "the air cleaner is not original ; sean says it was stolen by someone who broke into the kentucky barn at some point . i see new screws holding the fenders to the frame and ask about them . `` the original ones were junk , '' sean says , `` but believe me , i tried to save them . '' i lie on the floor to get a look at the underside . the only shiny bits are new brake lines and a few bolts . the welded camera bars still jut out from both rockers ; the original custom exhaust is still in place . ",
        "the rear axle with its 4:10 gear ratio and limited-slip differential does n't have the usual oil coating . even with all of its issues , kiernan 's mustang is in significantly better shape than the other mustang used in the movie , which was recovered in mexico in march 2017 . that car had been extensively stripped for parts and restored , making kiernan 's the more valuable of the two , a value , some think , is probably in the millions . you can read webster 's full story here .
