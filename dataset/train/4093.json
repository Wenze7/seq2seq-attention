        "as you may have seen from nintendo 's nindies showcase earlier in the year , the switch is set to be the latest shu box . the shu 's on the other foot now , eh ? or console . whatever . the initial announcement was laced with anticipation , and set tongues wagging . developer coatsink has put its heart and sole into the port , announcing that they 've achieved 60 fps in both handheld and docked modes . we now have a solid release date , too ; shu will hit the switch ground running on january 23rd , with a price tag of £ 7.69 / $ 9.99 / € 8.49 . ",
        "already available for pc , ps4 & vita , the switch version will include the ` caverns of the nightjars ' dlc . if you 're unfamiliar with the game , it 's a really rather pretty platformer with a cartoon vibe . hand-drawn characters give the adventure a distinctive look , and shu should fit the switch nicely . nintendo 's latest little box of tricks is becoming something of an indie hotspot in fact , and this will make a welcome addition . are you excited ? ca n't wait to boot the game up ? well , do your best to shu away your frustration . ",
        "perhaps we shu have warned you how far away the release date is . yeah , okay , we 'll stop now .   "
