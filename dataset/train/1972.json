        "credit : university of liverpoolresearch by the university of liverpool has found a strong correlation between the north atlantic oscillation and synchronised tree reproduction across europe , supporting the idea that this phenomenon plays a greater role in large scale masting , the process whereby forest trees produce large numbers of seeds in the same year . the north atlantic oscillation refers to the large scale changes in pressure that occur naturally in the north atlantic region . it has been shown to have a strong effect on atmospheric circulation and european climate . it is known that tree reproduction tends to be strongly synchronised within local populations , so that if one tree is producing a very heavy seed or fruit crop , it is very likely that a neighbouring tree will also be heavily fruiting . ",
        "however , in a study , published in nature communications researchers analysed tree masting observational data taken over a 190-year period for two key tree species in europe , european beech and norway spruce , and compared this to data on the northern atlantic oscillation . they found that in 1976 , 1995 and 2011 , both of these species across all of europe simultaneously produced heavy seed crops . the researchers found finds that for the last sixty years continent-wide masting in beech and spruce coincided with high-frequency summer - and spring-nao and low-frequency winter-nao . it also reveals a weaker relationship between nao and masting for the first part of the twentieth centurydr .

        "andrew hacket-pain , lecturer in biogeography and ecology at the university 's department of geography and planning , said : `` our work shows that the remarkable synchronisation of behaviour across such vast distances is linked to the north atlantic oscillation . `` we think this is because a strong nao synchronises climate across large parts of europe , especially during key phases of the tree reproduction cycle . this helps to synchronise seed crops across such large areas , but future work will be required to firmly establish this mechanism . `` the synchronisation of seed production is important , as it has knock-on effects on forest ecosystems . ",
        "for example , heavy seed crops increase food availability for woodland-based birds and small animals , and consequently tend to increase the size of such animal populations in the short-term . additionally , it has implications for human health , as the increase in animal hosts has a positive effect on tick numbers . `` more information : davide ascoli et al. . inter-annual and decadal changes in teleconnections drive continental-scale synchronization of tree reproduction , nature communications . doi : 10.1038 / s41467-017-02348-9provided by university of liverpoolthis story is republished courtesy and copyrighted by phys . org , a popular site that covers news about science research .
