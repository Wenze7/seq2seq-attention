        "president blue ivy carter ? music power couple jay-z and beyonce have imagined their daughter as a transformative us leader in a new video . blue ivy , who turns six on january 7 , is depicted as leading an all-female constitutional convention in 2050 in a video released friday for her father 's song `` family feud . `` the video -- shot by `` selma '' director ava duvernay , one of the most prominent african-american women in hollywood -- tells a story with echoes of `` game of thrones '' and shakespearean tragedy as it depicts a futuristic conflict . ",
        "the plot cuts back to 2050 as `` america 's founding mothers '' -- a cheeky take on the `` founding fathers '' who established the us political system -- passionately debate whether to preserve the constitution 's second amendment , which protects the right to bear arms . the women needed to revise the constitution at a time `` when some thought that making america great meant making us afraid of each other , '' a descendant is heard saying -- in an unmistakable critique of president donald trump and his campaign slogan . the convention ends with a forceful appeal from the meeting 's leader : `` america is a family , and the whole family should be free . ",
        "`` the descendant mentions wisdom she learned from her father -- and her identity becomes clear as the story shifts to the year 2018 and the real-life blue ivy is seen with jay-z in church . jay-z then opens his song , appearing as if he is giving confession as beyonce -- sporting robes and a cap resembling the miter worn by catholic cardinals -- dances about . `` family feud '' does not explicitly depict blue ivy as president , but the video quickly sparked chatter online . `` president blue ivy 2050 . #familyfeud . i 'll be 79 when i cast this vote , '' hip-hop drummer and producer questlove wrote on twitter . ",
        "the song appeared on jay-z 's grammy-nominated album `` 4:44 , '' in which the rapper acknowledged infidelity to beyonce , although `` family feud '' lyrically looks largely at his place in hip-hop . jay-z and beyonce , who together are worth an estimated $ 1 billion , have been increasingly outspoken about their left-leaning political views and are friendly with former president barack obama . the `` family feud '' video , which appears only on jay-z 's tidal streaming platform , features cameos by multiple film and television stars including jessica chastain , america ferrera , rashida jones , mindy kaling and brie larson .
