        "the past 12 months have been largely positive for the stock markets , but the macroeconomic scenario appears increasingly uncertain as we enter 2018 . the main question still concerns the future of stock markets : after the great rally of recent months , is there still room for further rallies next year or is the bear going to dominate the scene again after a long bullish round ? and what of crude oil ? even if its price has doubled compared to the lows in early 2016 , can it really continue on this path or will investors be more interested in assets like gold ? ",
        "macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties undoubtedly remain concerning . skepticism over the federal reserve 's real objectives and policies has grown significantly , as the central bank does not seem able to realise its goal of raising interest rates . on this side of the pond , european quantitative easing will continue at least until september 2018 . the progress of the so-called populist parties will paint new scenarios for europe , while germany remains without a government . significant uncertainty is also on the table in great britain . in fact , doubts about the brexit negotiations and the political weakness of theresa may have offered a scenario that observers are struggling to analyse , even if the general picture seems to mean a slow-down of british economic growth . ",
        "last but not least , tensions between north korea and the united states is far from being resolved . the currency markets were characterised by the clear recovery of the euro during the first 8 months of 2017 , as the eur / usd rate has increasingly moved away from parity , rising from 1.05 to over 1.20 in september . however , the area around 1.20 / 1.21 worked as a significant resistance level and lowered prices . market perspectives for 2018stock marketsthe general trend remains positive , but there are growing signs that a conciliatory pause in the markets - especially the united states - will be needed after an unstoppable rally . ",
        "the weakness of the us currency , which was one of the most important issues of 2017 , helped this wall street rally . if the greenback manages to recover , we could have a slowing down of this climb and some fund managers could shift their investments to the european market or assets such as gold . eur/usdthe future of eur/usd depends crucially on the uncertain macroeconomic scenario described above . markets are trying to predict central bank decisions for 2018 . any delay in interest rises aroused by the fed could push the greenback down , while any dovish statements from mario draghi will have a similar effect on the euro . ",
        "the general trend is still positive for the eurozone currency , although we are ending 2017 with an important consolidation between 1.16 and 1.205 . if this pair could return above 1.21 we will have the first positive sign they could rally during 2018 up to 1.26 / 1.27 . vice versa , a decomposition of 1,155 will generate a negative scenario , with an increasing possibility of the pair returning to the previous interval between 1.08 and 1.15 . so at least for the first part of 2018 , the scenario will likely be a continuation of the consolidation recorded in the last months of 2017 between 1.16 and 1.21 . ",
        "gbp/usdthe british currency recovered almost 10 % in 2017 against the dollar . overall , the pound continues to dance on the news coming from the brexit negotiations . at the end of november , we had a breakup of the resistance area at 1.33 . this helped the pound to recover up to 1.35 . the trend still looks favourable for the pound and the first target will be the september peak registered at 1.362-1.365 . if there is an agreement with the eu on brexit we could also expect the pound to continue its recovery up to 1.40-1.42 during 2018 . ",
        "otherwise , if there is another deadlock in the negotiations , the pound could fall back into the range 1.26-1.30 against the greenback . eur/gbpin recent months the eur/gbp has moved in the trading range between 1.11 and 1.14 . a breakout in either direction will tell us the main story for 2018 . an agreement on brexit could probably push the pound to break 1.14 and return to a higher range between 1.14 and 1.20 , which could be the trading range for the next year with a positive outlook . any problem with the brexit talks could push the uk currency down . ",
        "we will have a weakened first sign below 1.11 , with a `` danger zone '' if prices fall below 1.08 . goldgold is claiming attention and next year could be a good year for bullion . after over a decade , mining production has begun to slow down , while asian demand is expected to recover slowly . any correction in the stock markets or any delay on interest raised by the fed could lead investors to bet on gold , which in 2018 we can expect to regain its role of safe haven in the markets . cryptocurrenciesthe year 2017 was definitely a great one for bitcoins and cryptocurrencies . ",
        "after this incredible rally where the price has risen from just $ 758.81 a year ago , to $ 11,636 . the story going forward may be one of government regulations and increased activity in the derivative markets for the coins . in 2018 , investors will be wondering if this will become the huge bubble many have suggested or if the investment can continue to provide unmatched growth and go for further rallies . either way , it may start to not feel too dissimilar to red and black in a casino . carlo alberto de casa is chief analyst of activtrades , a company he joined in 2011 .
