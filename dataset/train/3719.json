        "what happened . progenics pharmaceuticals was up as much as 23 % this morning after announcing that the fda accepted the marketing application for its cancer drug azedra . investors have since come to their senses , with shares trading up 4.2 % at 12:09 p. m. est. . so what . the fda does a cursory review when it accepts the application and can refuse to file the application if it does n't meet the agency 's standards ; getting a refuse to file ruling would typically send shares down , but meeting the low bar of getting the application accepted does n't justify a double-digit increase . ",
        "that goes double for progenics since the fda had already signed off on the clinical trial design under a special protocol assessment . essentially , an spa says the fda agrees the trial will meet its standards if the study meets its primary endpoint , which azedra did when it produced a 50 % or greater reduction of all antihypertensive medication for at least six months in patients with pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma , which are rare neuroendocrine tumors . the fda gave the marketing application a priority review , shaving four months off the standard review time , which is good news , but again , should have been widely expected since the drug already had breakthrough therapy designation . ",
        "there are n't any drugs approved for patients with malignant pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma , which is exactly the type of medication the priority review program is supposed to support . now what . it 's now just a waiting game for progenics pharmaceuticals ' investors . the fda 's goal is to make a decision by april 30 , but it 's not bound to honor that date . recently , though , companies -- especially those being reviewed by the fda 's oncology division -- have seen their applications approved earlier than expected . a couple of weeks early , on tax day perhaps , would certainly brighten up the day , but a decision a month or so earlier is n't out of the question .
