        "barclays equity research sent out a recent note to investors that said , in essence , that the firm predicts the end of the year to be a relatively peaceful time in the united states wireless industry . competition with holiday promotions seems to be far less fierce this year than it usually is , and that trend is expected to remain unchanged all through the remainder of the year . to be sure , that 's not a very long time ; there are less than three weeks left in the calendar year at this point . regardless , barclay 's has issued a statement saying that it does not expect wireless carriers to delve into stiff competition or make mad grabs for subscribers for at least that duration . ",
        "at&t , verizon , and sprint have all backed up barclay 's claims , saying that they all do n't have anything major planned for the remainder of 2017 . t-mobile did not submit any such commentary , but did not say anything to the contrary , either . while the three carriers that had something to say did all agree that nothing major will happen for the remainder of this year , nobody commented on possible new year promotions , which are fairly common industry practice . this comes at the end of a year that has essentially been an all-out war between carriers over subscribers , even seeing sprint giving away free service time to switchers from other carriers , despite its somewhat precarious financial standings . ",
        "holiday gift guide 2017 - 2018 : the ultimate smartphone & tech gift guidelooking forward , barclay 's sees the price war in wireless largely falling by the wayside as carriers ' wallets run too slim to continue supporting it . sprint , who has positioned itself as a leader in low pricing , has expressed an intention to increase prices next year . as the march toward 5g moves on and carriers invest more and more into making their networks as fast , high-capacity , and reliable as possible , barclay 's sees customers moving en masse to higher-end devices and looking more to network quality . ",
        "prices in the industry will likely equalize to some degree in due time , with the rush to move subscribers largely over . this all points to an overall more tame and focused 2018 among wireless carriers in the us .   "
