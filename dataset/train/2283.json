        "on halloween 2015 , an asteroid shaped eerily similar to a human skull flew past earth without issue . the timing was a fun coincidence , perhaps , but it wo n't be the last time we see this particular space rock . researchers say the skull asteroid is destined to fly by earth again next year , doing so a little later than the first time around : in november 2018 . the asteroid was first discovered by researchers in mid-october 2015 . it flew by a couple weeks later on halloween , doing so at a relatively close distance : about 1.3 times that of the moon . ",
        "this gave researchers a chance to snap shots of the space rock , and that 's when one feature became apparent -- in the right lighting , the asteroid greatly resembles a human skull . the similarities are eerie , including the general skull shape , the location and shape of the two `` eyes , '' plus a nose and the tapering for the jaw . the asteroid 's halloween timing helped underscore the creepiness of the entire thing . researchers estimate that the skull-shaped asteroid , which is officially named 2015 tb145 , is somewhere between 625m to 700m in length -- that is , 2,050 ft to 2,296 ft. nasa got in on the action the first time around , managing to get a shot of the rock using the arecibo radio telescope in puerto rico and the green bank radio telescope in west virginia . ",
        "while the first image in this article shows an artist 's interpretation of what the asteroid looks like , the second image , above , is an actual photo of the 2015 tb145 asteroid . skull-like indeed . the asteroid will shoot past earth at a much farther distance next year , but researchers have time to prepare for that event , and they plan to learn more about the rock when it happens .
