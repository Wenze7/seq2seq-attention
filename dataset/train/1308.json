        "ryanair holdings plc faces its first-ever strike as crews in italy prepare to walk out as part of a push toward unionization . pilots and flight attendants plan to strike for four hours from 1 p. m. local time on dec. . 15 , the anpac union said in a letter to the airline , adding that they 're campaigning for the right to negotiate collective labor agreements , as well as on issues including social security , health care and vacation planning . the fit-cisl union said separately that the action had been deferred from dec. . 10 at the request of the italian transport ministry . ",
        "pilots in ireland , spain , germany , sweden and portugal , as well as italy , have formed local labor councils in the past few weeks in order to press for collective bargaining outside of ryanair 's in-house employee representative committees . the move also opened up the possibility of strike action . ryanair has been left vulnerable after a staffing mix-up required it to squeeze six months of pilot leave into half that time . the crisis was exacerbated by the poaching of crew by other airlines , forcing the dublin-based carrier to cancel more than 20,000 flights and propose a new pay deal in order to maintain other services . ",
        "the take-up of the offer has been slow as some staff seek to exploit the opportunity to boost their leverage with the company . ryanair said that the anpac and fit-cisl unions represent employees of italian carrier alitalia spa and have `` no role '' at the irish carrier , having threatened walkouts five times in the past only to call them off . `` we expect this latest threatened strike will also be postponed or canceled , '' spokesman robin kiely said .
