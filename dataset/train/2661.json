        "most people wrongly judge smaller objects to be heavier than larger ones if they weigh the same . credit : lauren jenningspeople with prosthetic arms or hands do not experience the `` size-weight illusion '' as strongly as other people , new research shows . the size-weight illusion , which affects about 98 per cent of people , causes them to experience smaller objects as feeling heavier than larger objects of the same weight . the study -- led by the university of exeter and the university of strathclyde -- compared the perception of people using their anatomical hands with that of amputees using prosthetic limbs . ",
        "the researchers were surprised to find that the size-weight illusion was twice as strong in non-amputees lifting with their hand as it was in the prosthetic users . `` this unexpected finding suggests that using a prosthesis might fundamentally affect the way people perceive the world , '' said dr. gavin buckingham of the department of sport and health sciences at the university of exeter . `` people using a prosthetic hand perceive real weight differences just like everybody else , but the effect of the size-weight illusion is halved . `` the reasons for this are a little mysterious . ",
        "it might be to do with the lack of sensory receptors in a prosthetic hand , or might depend on how the prosthetic hand is attached to the stump . `` in a second experiment , the researchers tested how the illusion affected non-amputees who used a prosthetic hand simulator to lift objects . the results were similar to those for amputees with prosthetic limbs -- the effect of the size-weight illusion was halved . sarah day , of the national centre for prosthetics and orthotics in the department of biomedical engineering at the university of strathclyde , added : `` many amputees prefer not to use prosthetic arms or hands , but the reasons for this are not well understood . ",
        "research like this might help us better understand why . `` the research was carried out by academics at the university of exeter , liverpool hope university , manchester metropolitan university , heriot-watt university and the university of strathclyde . the paper , published in the journal psychonomic bulletin and review , is titled `` the impact of using an upper-limb prosthesis on the perception of real and illusory weight differences . `` more information : gavin buckingham et al. . the impact of using an upper-limb prosthesis on the perception of real and illusory weight differences , psychonomic bulletin & review .
