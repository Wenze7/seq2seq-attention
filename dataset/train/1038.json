        "by david gaffen new york - oil fell 2 percent on wednesday after a sharp rise in u. s. inventories of refined fuel suggested demand may be flagging , while u. s. crude production hit another weekly record . government data showed that u. s. crude stocks fell 5.6 million barrels , more than expected , though that was partially the result of the closure of the keystone pipeline after a leak in south dakota in mid-november , which cut flows to cushing , oklahoma . that line reopened tuesday . however , gasoline stocks rose by 6.8 million barrels and distillate inventories were up 1.7 million barrels , both exceeding expectations in a reuters poll . ",
        "that hit prices of both crude and products in a market which is already heavily tilted bullish and thus potentially vulnerable to a selloff , analysts said . gasoline stocks tend to build in december , but at 221 million barrels of inventory , stocks are slightly above the five-year average for this time of year . u. s. crude production rose to 9.7 million barrels per day , another weekly record , though short of all-time records reached in the 1970s . that increase may undermine efforts by global producers to cut supply . supply cuts by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries , russia and other producers that were extended at a meeting last week for the whole of 2018 have helped lift brent prices by more than 40 percent since june . ",
        "prices have slipped from november 's peak , which represented two-year highs . `` the sentiment-driven support to crude oil prices has somewhat dissipated as market participants look beyond last week 's opec meeting , '' said abhishek kumar , senior energy analyst at interfax energy 's global gas analytics in london . brent crude futures were down $ 1.23 , or 2 percent , at $ 61.63 a barrel by 11:21 a. m. est , after reaching a session high of $ 62.93 , while u. s. crude futures dropped $ 1.29 , or 2.3 percent , to $ 56.33 . ",
        "russian oil minister alexander novak said it was too early to talk about exiting the opec agreement , and that the process would be gradual . analysts such as goldman sachs have said that the expected rise in demand in 2018 would mostly be offset by u. s. and canadian supply growth . u. s. oil production has climbed by 15 percent since mid-2016 to 9.7 million bpd , close to levels of top producers russia and saudi arabia . `` with u. s. production , we 're still in the throes of seeing that go ever higher . there 's only going to be more production coming which is very problematic for opec non-opec deal adherence , '' said john kilduff , partner at again capital in new york .
