        "marijuana stocks took it on the chin today following comments by attorney general jeff sessions . attorney general jeff sessions is no friend to the pro-marijuana movement , and earlier today he solidified his opposition to the herb by rolling back obama-era guidance to ease enforcement of federal marijuana laws in states where marijuana has been legalized . sessions decision sent shockwaves throughout the industry , causing a sharp sell-off in marijuana stocks . among the stocks hit hardest were aphria inc. . , a canadian marijuana company that 's investing in medical marijuana in florida . its shares finished the trading day down more than 13 % . ",
        "image source : getty images . marijuana companies that are n't even impacted directly by sessions ' decision fell , too . canopy growth , which is purposefully avoiding the u. s. market until federal marijuana laws are repealed , declined almost 10 % , and insys therapeutics , which is working on marijuana drugs that it hopes will be fda approved , tumbled more than 26 % . what 's going on ? pro-pot momentum has increased considerably over the past decade and according to gallup polls , more americans favor legalizing marijuana than ever before . in response to shifting public opinions , 29 states have passed laws legalizing marijuana in one form or another , including eight states that have passed recreational marijuana laws . ",
        "the biggest of those states , california , opened its recreational marijuana market on jan. . 1 , clearing the way to what greenwave advisors estimates will become an $ 8 billion market . because legal marijuana markets are heavily taxed , states increasingly use marijuana legalization as an important source of new tax revenue . in colorado , where recreational marijuana has been regulated since 2014 , the government has already collected over $ 500 million in taxes . the tax revenue associated with legalizing marijuana in california could someday eclipse $ 1 billion . although many states are embracing marijuana , it remains illegal at the federal level and its classified by the drug enforcement agency as a schedule 1 narcotic that 's as risky as heroin . ",
        "image source : getty images . until now , federal law enforcement has turned a blind eye toward states passing recreational laws . that 's in part because of an august 2013 memorandum from then deputy attorney general james cole . in his memorandum , cole shifted attention away from individuals and companies legally participating in pro-pot states , and toward prosecuting behaviors that remained illegal , such as interstate trafficking and distributing marijuana to children . cole 's memorandum , which you can read in full , does n't do away with the federal authority to prosecute marijuana violators in states that have legalized it , but it pretty clearly spells out that the view from the top was that enforcement within states should mostly be left up to state and local authorities , not the u. s. government . ",
        "on the surface , sessions ' decision to roll back cole 's guidance does n't change anything materially . the federal government could always intervene under cole 's memorandum , however , it does increase uncertainty for emerging marijuana businesses that are already struggling to secure adequate financing and access to banking services governed under federal laws . image source : getty images . what 's the takeaway ? in july 2017 , aphria announced it would be investing in a third-party company that would manage medical marijuana production and distribution in florida . that investment , however , is tiny compared to the market opportunity that exists for aphria in canada , where medical marijuana is legal nationally and recreational laws are set to be in place in july 2018 . ",
        "the canadian market could double in the coming year , according to comments from canopy growth 's ceo bruce linton , and his company is even more insulated than aphria against sessions . rather than risk a u. s. federal crackdown , canopy growth -- the largest pure-play marijuana company in canada -- has concentrated on markets elsewhere , including germany . similarly , the impact of sessions action on drug companies including gw pharmaceuticals and insys therapeutics is limited . both gw pharma and insys therapeutics are developing marijuana medicines based on marijuana cannabinoids . gw pharmaceuticals , for example , is awaiting fda approval of epidiolex , a cannabidiol drug for use in specific and rare forms of epilepsy . ",
        "insys therapeutics already has fda approval and dea scheduling for syndros , its liquid formulation of the long-used thc-based drug , marinol . companies that secure fda approval for marijuana drugs , and patients who use these drugs under the direction of a doctor , would n't be in federal cross-hairs . the stocks that this shift in guidance does impact , however , are high-risk penny stocks that rely solely on u. s. marijuana markets for revenue . penny stocks do n't trade on the major market exchanges , and historically they 're more prone to fraud . as a result , they 're unsuitable investments for most investors anyway . ",
        "overall , it remains to be seen whether any state attorney generals will crackdown on marijuana activity following sessions decision , but it may not matter . for pro-marijuana advocates and marijuana investors , the hope has been for a friendlier federal government , and , it seems that remains unlikely , at least under this administration .
