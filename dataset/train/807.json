        "the christian life does not begin and end with accepting jesus as your savior . life with jesus means living like him . the bible tells us that we should live and love like jesus . would you like to know how to do that ? the bible is a great source for that too . it tells us a lot about how jesus lived and loved . read it ! you can see for yourself . jesus loved . he lived love . i can tell you what living like jesus is not about . it 's not about health , wealth , and prosperity . ",
        "these are things that god chooses to bless us with as he sees fit . living like jesus is also not about your `` best life now . '' not all the time . sometimes christians say that once you 're saved , everything 's going to be hunky dory . that 's a tactic they use to get you saved . and it works ! people hear a promise like that , and of course they get saved . they think they 're going to become rich ! but when they do n't become rich , they say there is no god . ",
        "we christians get into this salvation mentality . we think we just have to get people saved and then we 're done . but i do n't believe that 's where it ends . salvation is just the beginning . getting saved is just the beginning . what follows is a life of discipleship . it 's living out an understanding of what the gospel means . so what is the jesus gospel ? do you think people hear `` good news '' when you say that they have to accept christ or rot in hell ? actually , there are people who sincerely believe that `` accept or rot '' is good news ! ",
        "but to most people , it probably sounds like a threat . the good news is found in the lifestyle of jesus . the life that he lived and taught us to live is good news . the gospel is the discipleship lifestyle . salvation and justification are part of it , yes . that 's where we begin . but we 're also called to live it . i have heard people ask , `` did jesus speak the gospel ? '' some people will say he did n't . they will say he could n't have . they will say the gospel did n't come until after he died . ",
        "that 's a little mind-boggling to me ! jesus is the gospel ! jesus is the good news ! whatever jesus did was the good news . he was it ! of course he preached the gospel . he did the gospel ! i 'm so surprised when people do n't think like that . it shows me where we 're at . we 're stuck in a salvation mentality . we focus everything on jesus 's death . we think we 're done being christians when we acknowledge his death for our sins . well , we 're not . ",
        "when we focus on his life , we realize we 're never done . we 've begun a new life with him ! how can we ignore it , when the bible contains a detailed account of it ? it records the things he did and said . it contains the instructions jesus gives to everybody who wants to be his disciple . i do n't ask myself why i am the way i am . i know the answer to that . it 's because i 'm saved . i 'm justified by christ . that does n't mean i 'm good . ",
        "i have to ask myself why i live the way i live . i examine my life . i check my motives . i 'm not necessarily good . i 'm not necessarily right . i 'm not necessarily on the right path . i examine the way i live because i want to be his disciple . do i mess up ? yes . am i always good ? no . am i always on the right path ? no . but when i get off on the wrong path , i can ask the spirit to lead me back . ",
        "and i believe that the spirit responds to me because i want to live a disciple 's lifestyle . i want to go deeper . i want to go further . i want to be on god 's path . how do i know when i 'm on his path ? i 'm there when i 'm fulfilled and full of joy . would you like to experience fulfillment ? live the discipleship lifestyle . live and love like jesus ! i am the author of to stir a movement : life , justice , and major league baseball , and my second book is in the works .
