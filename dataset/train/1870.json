        "self magazine , condé nast 's fitness and wellness title , became a digital-only brand last december . now , just over a year later , editor in chief carolyn klystra , formerly the magazine 's digital director who was promoted as part of the overall changes last year , reflects on self 's first year without a print product . `` when the magazine folded , it was really scary and upsetting because we had to say goodbye to colleagues who we really loved , '' klystra said . self 's switch to digital-only resulted in the loss of around 20 jobs , including the departure of self editor in chief joyce chang , whose contract expired . ",
        "self touts comscore data that shows six million unique views per month between january to july -- a 22 percent year-over-year increase in unique views -- as evidence that going digital has been a boon to the brand 's online presence . and self 's switch to digital-only offered a template for other condé titles . teen vogue announced it was shuttering its print edition in november , and various other titles have reduced their print frequency . earlier this month , w magazine announced that , in addition to decreasing its frequency to eight issues a year , it would reposition its print product as a luxury collectible . ",
        "`` i feel very proud that we were able to show the industry that losing a magazine as one of your platforms does not mean that your brand is going away , and in fact can potentially be a very necessary thing for the growth of the brand , '' klystra said . among the challenges of going online only , klystra explained , is the pace of change . `` with a magazine , you understand what the platform is and it does n't change all that much . but with digital , the platforms you are working on may change from one week to another . ",
        "the challenge is making sure you know what your brand is well enough for it to make sense no matter what the platform looks like , '' she said . `` it forced us to really put in time and thought to what the brand is and what it stands , and how we can best serve our audience , '' she said . according to klystra , that meant establishing self 's core mission , which she summed up as `` wellness you can trust '' and identifying three core values : accuracy , inclusivity , and empathy . ",
        "another challenge has been one familiar to many self readers : figuring out a life/work balance . while making the transition to digital-only and finding out she was promoted to editor in chief , kylstra also found out she was pregnant . at the same time , executive editor leta shy was , coincidentally , in the hospital after having given birth to her first child . `` on a more personal level , i feel incredibly proud that the two most senior people in charge of this brand both became new mothers this year , and each took 12 weeks of maternity leave and have new babies at home , and were still able to do a really damn good job at work . ",
        "i hope that we 're sending a positive messages on those fronts , '' klystra said . `` it has been an absolutely wild year .
