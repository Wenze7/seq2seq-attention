        "it 's not as clear as you might think ... there is no doubt liverpool would miss philippe coutinho . the brazilian is one of the club 's best players and has been in magnificent form this season ; his influence and impact is clear to all . yet despite some magical moments -- his solo goal at bournemouth , his stunner against swansea , his hat trick against spartak moscow -- the reds have actually fared better without him so far in this campaign . in the 13 games coutinho has started in the premier league this season , liverpool have picked up 24 points , averaging 1.8 points per game . ",
        "they also average 2.2 goals scored per game , and concede 1.07 . in the nine games the south american has n't started this season , the reds have won 20 points , an average of 2.2 points per game , and scoring an average of 2.33 goals . they do concede more however , at a rate of 1.22 per game . somewhat surprisingly , then , liverpool win more points and score more goals without coutinho than with . this does not offer conclusive evidence , of course . of the games liverpool have faced with coutinho in the side , opposition includes manchester united , tottenham , chelsea and arsenal -- four of the toughest fixtures . ",
        "and while the 4-0 demolition of arsenal came without their playmaker , other wins in his absence included kinder games such as crystal palace , huddersfield , stoke and west ham . the champions league offers a gloomier picture of liverpool 's prospects without coutinho , although it is unfair to draw conclusions with such a small sample size . he did , however , feature in both 7-0 wins over maribor and spartak moscow , with the only game he missed coming in the routine 3-0 victory against the slovenians at anfield .
