        "friday was a great day on wall street , with the dow climbing by more than 140 points and broader benchmarks rising even more on a percentage basis . market participants celebrated the republicans ' apparent success in coming up with a tax reform package that could get passed by both the house and senate as early as next week , and the corresponding drop in corporate taxes could bolster earnings for stocks beginning in 2018 . yet some companies still missed out on the rally , and csx , fitbit , and sirius xm holdings were among the worst performers on the day . ",
        "below , we 'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly . csx investors worry about its ceoshares of csx dropped nearly 8 % following news that ceo hunter harrison has taken a medical leave due to unforeseen complications from a recent illness . the railroad giant said that coo james foote will take over as acting ceo during harrison 's absence . foote tried to reassure investors that much of the tough work in helping to transform csx into a more efficient and successful railroad has already been accomplished , making it unlikely that harrison 's absence will have any negative impact on csx 's expectations for future progress . ",
        "nevertheless , investors were n't entirely comfortable seeing a new engineer at the front of the csx train , and they 're hoping that harrison will come back better than ever in the near future . train on a track next to a tall grain silo , running through a prairie . image source : csx . fitbit takes a hitfitbit stock declined almost 8 % in the wake of a negative analyst report about the wearable fitness device maker . analysts at stifel dropped their rating on the stock from hold to sell , maintaining their share price target of $ 6 . ",
        "stifel acknowledged that fitbit has come out with new products during the past year , but the analysts believe that those products failed to break enough new ground to spur the business toward profitability in the near future . with rising competition in the wearables space , fitbit needs to move aggressively in order to protect its business and try to maintain its perceived leadership role in the industry . higher royalties could plague sirius xmfinally , shares of sirius xm holdings fell 5 % . the satellite radio specialist will have to start paying more in royalties beginning in 2018 for its music content , with the copyright royalty board raising the royalty percentages from 11 % to 15.5 % . ",
        "sirius did n't offer any estimates of specifically how much more it might have to pay , presumably because the satellite provider will take steps to substitute high-royalty content with alternatives in order to cut costs . nevertheless , for a company that 's already dealing with competition on multiple fronts , news of higher expenses came as an unwelcome shock for a stock that had been on the ascendancy for much of the year . dan caplinger has no position in any of the stocks mentioned . the motley fool owns shares of and recommends fitbit . the motley fool has a disclosure policy .
