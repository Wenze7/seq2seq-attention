        "while baker mayfield is drawing a ton of interest from nfl teams , there 's a false narrative floating around the league that has the heisman trophy winner frustrated . his behavior may have been questionable at times . he displayed obscene gestures . he voiced his opinion more than most in his position but mayfield does n't want to be portrayed as a ` bad boy . ` more importantly , mayfield does n't want to be thought of as the next johnny manziel . instead of talking about his antics , mayfield said he is a player that will `` do anything it takes to win . '' ",
        "even though mayfield has a point , showing up late to senior bowl practice probably wo n't sit well with scouts regardless of the actual reason . on the big stage , perception is rather often reality . if he truly wants to ditch the narrative of being just another manziel , he 's lucky that he has months of practice to prove it . it wo n't be easy for mayfield , as scouts and media members will constantly knock his persona . this will be his chance though to prove that he 's more of an odell beckham jr. - level star than an undersized prospect bound for the cfl . ",
        "they might have similar attributes , accomplishments , and height , but mayfield seems poised to develop into the legitimate quarterback that johnny football could n't . hopefully for baker mayfield , the only similarity he shares with manziel is the team they were drafted by .   "
