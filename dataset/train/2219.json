        "lake buena vista , fla. . - one of the most fun eras in oakland history was the `` billy ball '' team managed by combative berkeley-born billy martin , who is the subject of an excellent new documentary . martin , best known as a barroom brawler who managed the yankees five times , found a brief measure of calm in oakland in the early 80s , as detailed by his son , billy martin jr. , a 's employees mickey morabito and steve vucinich , and oakland great rickey henderson in the mlb network production `` billy , '' which screened at the winter meetings and is scheduled to air at 5 p. m. thursday . ",
        "`` my dad was really happy being back in the bay area , '' martin jr. . said in an interview at the winter meetings this week . `` he gained weight , he had better color , he just did n't have all the stress he had in new york . and back home in the east bay , he was like the pope , the man . it was billy ball , they had it all over every commercial and billboard . i 've never seen him so at ease . '' the documentary does not shy away from martin 's many controversies , including fights with players and members of the public , his up-and-down relationship with yankees owner george steinbrenner , and his complicated personal life . ",
        "his death , in a car accident on christmas day 1989 , is examined in detail ; martin at one point was reported to have been behind the wheel , but his friend , william reedy , was later convicted of drunken driving in the case . the only portion of the documentary that rankles martin jr. . is former yankee and a 's outfielder reggie jackson 's suggestion that martin 's dislike for him was racist . as martin jr. . notes , numerous african american players , including hall of famers henderson and rod carew , appear in the program to describe their close relationships with martin . ",
        "`` that has no basis in fact , '' martin jr. . said of jackson 's jab . `` my father was the least racist man i 've ever known , he did n't see color at all . carew , willie randolph , rickey , all those guys loved my dad . '' those close to martin hope the program revives the possibility that the veterans ' committee , which has had martin on its ballot four times , will reexamine martin 's hall of fame candidacy . he had six seasons with 90-plus wins , winning records with five different teams and he led the yankees to back-to-back pennants and one title . ",
        "`` billy 's record stands for itself , '' said vucinich , who noted that martin loved oakland so much , he took a break from a minor-league managing job to come back for an oakland oaks old-timers ' game . `` i know there was negative stuff with the drinking and the brawling , getting fired five times - but the bottom line is that billy was a great baseball man , '' morabito said at the winter meetings . `` he was brilliant . tony la russa told me he learned so much just managing against billy . ",
        "i hope this creates a new dialog about billy . put the peripheral stuff aside , just look what he did as a manager . '' stadium thoughts : manager bob melvin said during a media that he 's not certain the a 's have given up on the laney college site for a new ballpark , despite an end to the talks with the peralta community college district after a decision by the peralta board of trustees . `` it obviously stunned everybody , '' melvin said . `` i ca n't speak for the dialogue with peralta , but definitely felt like they 'd done enough , had enough conversations to feel like they were confident in the site . ",
        "`` now , i think any time you do something like this in california on land that 's not yours , there are going to be some hurdles . ... my guess is kind of sitting back and looking and see what the options are , and i 'm not 100 percent sure that they 're done with this site . maybe you come back and take a look at it from another angle . '' briefly : melvin said that moving into the dh role wo n't bother khris davis but `` he does n't want to do it every single day . ",
        "i think in the outfield he does well enough for us , certainly tracking balls and so forth to where we 'll get him out there some . '' ... oakland is n't expected to take any players in thursday 's rule 5 draft . susan slusser is a san francisco chronicle staff writer . email : sslusser@sfchronicle . com twitter : @susanslusser .
