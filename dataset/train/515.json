        "fears of a world economic slump have receded among chief executive officers , who are instead preoccupied with hiring and retaining top employees , an annual survey found . global ceos polled by the conference board , a new york-based researcher , ranked a global recession as their 19th concern out of 28 choices , down from being the top worry a year earlier . failure to attract and retain talent was the no . 1 concern , followed by creating new business models and cash-flow volatility , according to the c-suite challenge survey , conducted from september to november . ",
        "the shift in concerns from a cold economy to a hot one mirrors an upswing in global growth and declines in unemployment , including the lowest level in the u. s. since 2000 and an eight-year low in the euro-area . other major worries include new competitors , developing leaders and cybersecurity , while brexit , terrorism and america 's departure from the paris climate accord were at the bottom of the list . `` a big change from last year 's survey was factors that ceos ca n't control are further down on the list and ones that they can control are further up , '' conference board chief economist bart van ark , a co-author of the report , said in an interview . ",
        "the report , out thursday , is based on responses from 561 ceos and 475 other senior executives from more than 50 countries . formerly called the ceo challenge , the survey began in 1999 and was expanded this year to include other officials such as chief financial officers and chief information officers . ceos ' top concerns . global . u. s. asia . europe . latin america . failure to attract/retain top talent . 1 . 1 . 1 . 2 . 1 . creating new business models because of disruptive technologies . 2 . 2 . 2 .

",
        "among other issues , concern about income inequality rose to seventh from 18th among global chiefs . threats to global trade jumped to eighth worldwide from 15th , as the trump administration withdrew the u. s. from the trans-pacific partnership and considered pulling out of nafta . above all , though , companies are trying to cope with a tight labor market and find workers with needed skills . `` they are trying to get the talent piece right , '' said rebecca ray , another co-author and an executive vice president at the conference board . one way to deal with the issue is to tap temporary or freelance workers , according to the report . ",
        "in one portion of the survey , about 80 percent of chief human resources officers said they agree with the statement that the share of contingent workers and freelancers will increase . the use of automation and robots is also likely to rise , according to the survey .   "
