        "the white sox acquisition of james shields was a head scratcher for some . now it might not look so bad . rick hahn has done a phenomenal job reshaping the chicago white sox roster . it seems like every trade he makes , he strikes gold . just look at all the talent he added to the farm system in 2017 . the acquisition of james shields may be the one trade that makes you scratch your head . i mean , the sox gave up a top 100 prospect in fernando tatis jr. . for shields during the 2016 season . ",
        "a veteran pitcher who 's had better days . is it possible , though , that this trade is n't as bad as it seems ? hindsight is definitely 20-20 and it usually takes awhile to figure out how a trade will work out . when you look at shields ' production , it 's easy to say the white sox lost this trade miserably . in 33 starts , he is 9-19 with an era well over five . that 's pretty bad . and in return , hahn gave the san diego padres erik johnson and the aforementioned tatis jr. . ",
        "sports is all about the money . so let 's take a look at it . shields signed a four year $ 75 million contract with an option for 2019 with san diego back in 2014 . the club option in 2019 is for $ 16 million or a $ 2 million buyout . the right-hander was sent to chicago after just one year into his deal . so he was still owed $ 63 million over the final three seasons . and guess how much the sox are going to pay ? if you include his buyout , they will pay him just $ 27 million . ",
        "from an economics standpoint , that 's not bad . they are basically paying shields an average of $ 9 million per season . sure , hahn gave up a top prospect but he also got just over $ 30 million , as well . and at the time it filled a need . shields was struggling to start the season but did go 13-7 with a 3.91 era in 2015 . let 's also not forget the white sox had tim anderson , who they viewed as the shortstop of the future , in the system . in a way that made tatis jr. . ",
        "expendable . and now they have a ton of other talents in the minors . there 's no way hahn could 've known he would bring in the talent he did but i do n't think the sox are kicking themselves for not having tatis jr. . in their system right now . and by the way , johnson has n't amounted to much . was the trade for shields bad ? absolutely . but it 's not as bad as it seems . he 's been pretty durable throughout his career and when healthy , has really eaten up innings . ",
        "that 's all you can really ask from the veteran pitcher . maybe they trade him at the deadline in 2018 and get something for him . if not , then they will happily pay him the $ 2 million buyout and then be on their way . more from southside showdown white sox : who will become backup catcher for 2018 season ? 16h ago white sox : failed pursuit of machado keeps future intact22h ago white sox : which free agent starting pitchers are good fits ? 1 d ago white sox still need to address lack of bullpen depth1 d ago white sox : why should team trade for manny machado ?
