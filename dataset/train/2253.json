        "the potters boss is preparing to welcome wba to the bet365 stadiumstoke boss mark hughes has denied that a west brom victory this weekend would be the end of his time at the club . hughes has come under increasing pressure in recent weeks , culminating in the damaging 3-0 defeat to west ham last weekend , which sparked chants of `` hughes out '' from among the home fans . now , ahead another crucial encounter with a relegation rival , the welshman does n't believe an albion win would cost him his job . `` i do n't think that is where we are at to be perfectly honest , '' hughes said . ",
        "`` the media will set time lines and time tables on it , but that is not what is happening within the corridors here in my view . `` it 's a huge game , there 's no getting away from that . it is one we need to win . '' `` maybe it 'd be written in the stars ... '' - saido berahino on a west brom reunionhughes says he can see the changes in albion 's style already taking effect since alan pardew took over from tony pulis . `` we look at every game as an opportunity to return to winning ways , '' hughes continued . ",
        "`` west brom are always a good team who will try to frustrate . they look a bit freer in their approach of late though . '' hughes has also revealed that he 'll likely be without two first-team defenders and a midfielder when albion rock up in the potteries . `` erik pieters is very doubtful , as is kurt zouma , '' hughes confirmed . `` charlie adam has an issue with his hip and has been with the physios this week . that 's it in terms of injuries . '' hughes also added that jese rodriguez had arrived back in england this week , but would `` need a little bit of time to get back up and running . '' ",
        "no shying awaywest brom winger oliver burke could n't play down the importance of the trip to stoke city this weekend , as albion look to put an end to a winless run that boss alan pardew believes is a `` pendant around the club 's neck '' . pardew handed burke his first start in baggies colours in the 2-1 defeat to manchester united at the hawthorns on sunday and the summer signing completed just over an hour before being hooked for jay rodriguez . there were glimpses of burke 's potential in his performance , however , and it was a display that offered food for thought for many albion fans as to whether the scot should retain his place for the pivotal match at the bet365 stadium . ",
        "stoke are in awful form themselves ; they 're two points and two places above albion but have the worst goal difference and leakiest defence in the entire premier league . after passing up chances to end their run against crystal palace and swansea in recent weeks , this next match represents another real opportunity for albion to get three points on the board - and so a significant monkey off their back . chadli , phillips , barry and brunt : where west brom boss alan pardew could change it at stokejust how big then , in the grand scheme of things , is this visit of the potteries ? ",
        "`` very big , '' burke admitted . `` every game is a big game , we should treat every game like that . `` where we are at the moment , it 's even more important . `` i 'm sure all the boys know that - we do n't need to tell each other but we 've got to get that morale going and we 've got to get behind each other and push other . `` that 's important . it 's just about us going out and putting in a display . i 'm sure we 'll do that . ",
        "`` for me personally and as a team i do n't think we 'll go into a game thinking we 're going to lose at all . `` we want to go into this game with confidence and get behind each other and get the win , get the three points . that 's what we need . ''   "
