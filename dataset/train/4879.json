        "each year , newborn crabs make the perilous trek from the sea shore to the forests of christmas island . this year was no exception , as new video taken of the migration makes abundantly clear . around a week ago , the baby crabs began to emerge from the indonesian ocean . numbering in the millions , and seeming more like a flowing mass of liquid than tiny crustaceans on the march , these crabs are heading inland to find suitable locations to live . christmas island national park is located about 500 km south of jakarta , indonesia . ",
        "the island features two red crab migration events : adult crabs leaving the forest en masse for the shoreline to mate , and the resulting baby crabs making their first journey into the island 's interior several months later . the adult migration is triggered by the coming monsoons , which start in november . mature red crabs head to the beach in vast numbers , ploughing through any obstacle that dares to get in their way . to offset the risks posed by roads , special bridges have been constructed to corral the crustaceans and provide safe passage . ",
        "image : ian usher/wikimediaonce at the beach , both the males and females take a dip in the ocean to rehydrate ; life in the forest tends to be dry . breeding requires the cooperation of both the males and females , with the male digging a love burrow for the female . after mating , the males retreat back into the interior , while the females stay behind in the burrows , brooding their eggs . after about two weeks , and when the tides are just right , the females head into the ocean with their mature eggs . ",
        "after depositing the eggs , the females join their male partners in the forest . the eggs turn into larvae the moment they 're plopped into the salty sea . they go through multiple larval stages , finally transforming into prawn-like creatures known as megalops . roughly four weeks later , the megalops leave the sea , molting into baby crabs . and thus begins one of the most extraordinary sights in nature , as hoards of the baby crabs move inland to find a cosy place to live . the crabs pile on top of each other , cascading off rocks like red waterfalls . ",
        "from a distance , the migration looks like a giant red carpet , and only a close-up view shows the conglomeration for what it is . some years , the number of migrating crabs is small . sometimes there are n't any at all . this year 's crop , however , was definitely bountiful . it takes about four years for the crabs to reach maturity . the precise timing of the adult migrations is unpredictable , but it typically happens during the last quarter of the moon in either november or december . the baby crabs usually head for the hills in january or february .
