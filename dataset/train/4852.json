        "president trump floated an idea last month for a contest to determine which news network is the most dishonest , and now he 's making it a reality . in a thursday email to supporters , the trump campaign sent out `` fake news trophy '' candidates , listing stories from top publications that required a correction . the email said americans `` are sick and tired of being lied to , insulted , and treated with outright condescension , '' so `` president trump is crowning the 2017 king of fake news before the end of the year , '' the hill reports . ",
        "the email linked to a poll listing candidates such as an abc news story that incorrectly said trump ordered michael flynn to contact russian officials while a presidential candidate ; a cnn story that initially stated trump and his son had private access to wikileaks documents when the files were public ; and a time magazine report that claimed a statue of martin luther king , jr. . was removed from the oval office , which was n't true . all three stories were quickly corrected , and both time and cnn issued statements explaining how the mistakes were made . ",
        "`` the president and white house aides have cited this mistake as an example of ` deliberately false reporting . ' it was no such thing , '' time 's statement read . the trump campaign email invited supporters to rate the `` most fake news stories of 2017 '' to determine which news organization should receive the `` fake news trophy , '' boasting an illustration of a gold trophy that read `` king of fake news . '' the options under each story sounded like they were written by trump himself , including `` fake news , '' `` faker news , '' and `` fakest news . '' ",
        "the poll also had a section to `` let the president know if there is another story you think should be crowned as the 2017 king of fake news . `` the president first mentioned a `` fake news trophy '' in november when he tweeted , `` we should have a contest as to which of the networks , plus cnn and not including fox , is the most dishonest , corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite president . '' he added : `` they are all bad . winner to receive the fake news trophy ! ",
        "`` although trump asserted fox news should be left out of the contest , a rasmussen poll following the november tweet found that about 40 percent of americans think fox news should receive the `` fake news trophy . '' cnn came in second place with 25 percent of votes , followed by msnbc with 9 percent . trump 's continuous use of the phrase `` fake news '' has even made its way around the globe , and myanmar officials used the same tactic to deny the existence of the rohingya people being persecuted and driven out of the small nation . ",
        "authoritarian leaders across the globe have also begun using trump 's `` fake news '' chant for their own gain . the president has stuck by his claims that the mainstream media spreads `` fake news '' since taking office , and has tweeted about it more than a 150 times by the new yorker 's count . `` judging from the president 's tweets , his definition of ` fake news ' is credible reporting that he does n't like , '' the new yorker 's steve coll wrote . `` but he complicates the matter by issuing demonstrably false statements of his own , which , inevitably , make news . ",
        "`` his campaign doubled down on the phrase in its latest email to supporters , claiming journalists are trying to dupe the american people . `` the fake news has utterly abandoned their duty to fairly report the news to the american people , '' thursday 's email said . `` some journalists and liberal pundits think that americans are too stupid to see through their amateur efforts to manipulate public opinion , but they 're wrong . `` if you 're interested , you can visit the poll website here .
