        "we 're 16 . we 're both kind of special , socially uncool . but we live each other . i 'm hot , she is mediocre but i love her for who she is . she is n't fat or anything . used to be in the past before i met her . we talk a lot at school and on the phone . make out when we 're chilling in the morning before 1st hour . make out at my house . sometimes her house . we 're quite similar . both have something to give the other for christmas . ",
        "she only told me my present was `` pretty sweet '' but that 's it . . i got her a $ 29 google home and a really cute card made out of wood on the front that says love happens in the little moments . she specifically wanted to give the gifts to each other on thursday . it 's tuesday . also i am her first boyfriend . she has anxiety and i do too . she is just more worrisome than i . but i have my anxious moments too . and depressed moments like she has them too . ",
        "i happen to find her parents incredibly weird though . any input or advice would be awesome . thank you for your help . i seriously give you my appreciation .   "
