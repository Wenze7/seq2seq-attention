        "goodbye , photoshop . pharmacy giant cvs said it will stop significant touchups of images used in its advertising for beauty products . the company said it has a responsibility to think about sending messages of unrealistic body images to girls and young women . cvs health corp. . said monday it will not `` materially '' alter photos used in stores , on websites and on social media by changing a model 's shape , size , skin or eye color or wrinkles . cvs , which was founded in lowell , massachusetts , in 1963 but now is based in woonsocket , rhode island , said it will use a watermark to highlight images that have not been materially altered beginning this year . ",
        "the change affects marketing materials produced by cvs , which said that if suppliers use altered photos in their material they will be labeled . cvs said it hopes the beauty sections of all its stores will comply with the new policy by the end of 2020 . most of the chain 's retail customers are women . helena foulkes , president of the pharmacy division , said there is a connection between unrealistic body images and bad health effects , especially in girls and young women . foulkes said cvs was trying to ensure that the messages it sends help customers attain better health . ",
        "she said many of the companies that make beauty brands carried by cvs were already thinking about the issue . cvs has previously made changes in its stores to support broader health issues . it stopped selling tobacco products in 2014 , and last year it announced it would remove certain chemicals from about 600 beauty and personal-care products by the end of 2019 . cvs runs more than 9,700 retail locations .
