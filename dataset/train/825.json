        "i do n't know about you , but i 've been looking forward to this weekend all year long -- but not for the release of a new video game . i 've been looking forward to star wars : the last jedi . its one of the few fandoms i have that i can share with my parents . it 's also a huge part of my history as a gamer . my first online shooter ? jedi knight : dark forces ii . my first arcade flight sim ? star wars : tie fighter . from knights of the old republic and rebel assault ii to the delightful mmorpg mess that was star wars : galaxies , many of my favorite games growing up were the ones that let me live in the star wars universe . ",
        "every time a new film comes out , i want to play them all again . lucky for me , then , that almost of my favorite star wars games are on sale on steam . if the mythos of george lucas ' space opera is n't your speed , there 's plenty of other games to play this week -- not to mention a playstation holiday sale and the gog winter sale . just looking for what 's brand new ? okay , let 's get this started . new releases : okami hd -- after twilight princess , a lot of people might balk at the idea of a zelda-type game where you play as a dog the -- but okami is a modern classic for a reason . ",
        "now it 's back in hd , making its already gorgeous cell-shaded ink-wash painting visuals look even better . night in the woods -- if you missed this quirky college drop-out homecoming adventure story when it came to pc and playstation earlier this year , now 's your chance . i hear it can be a little depressing and emotional -- but i 've also heard it 's worth it . hammerwatch -- a hack and slash dungeon crawler in a charming pixel style . it 's exactly what it looks like . ultimate chicken horse -- ever thought it might be fun to play a game with the creation aspect of mario maker , the challenge of super meat boy and the goal of frustrating your friends in a multiplayer race through a crowdsourced platforming death-trap ? ",
        "that 's ultimate chicken horse . honestly , i included the game on this list for the name alone but ... it actually looks like a ton of fun . yooka-laylee -- this crowdfunded retro-platformer landed to mixed reviews earlier this year , but this switch releases is still worth a mention . despite its flaws , yooka-laylee is an interesting take on collectathon platforming games from the n64 era . something like that belongs on a nintendo console . brawlout -- nintendo has n't announced a super smash bros. . game for its new console -- but if you just ca n't wait for something official , brawlout might be for you . ",
        "it looks an awful lot like a certain smash game with a similar name -- albeit without the nintendo branding . romancing saga 2 -- in the 1990s squaresoft was the king of jrpgs , but a few of their games never made it outside of japan . romancing saga 2 for the super famicom was one of them . the game has only ever seen one western release -- as an ios and android last year . now the game is finally available on us consoles . poly bridge -- how hard is it to drive across a bridge ? ",
        "pretty hard , actually . you 've probably seen a gif somewhere of the ridiculous , car-flinging contraptions that pass for bridges in this game . either way , it 's a wacky , fun and challenging puzzler . now it 's mobile , too ! animus : stand alone -- looking for something kind of like dark souls that fits in your pocket ? well , here you are . oddworld : new and tasty -- oddworld : abe 's odyssey was one of my favorite puzzle platform games growing up . it had a creepy story , great character design and a ton of challenging levels . ",
        "the new and tasty remake is great , and now it 's on my phone . i ca n't ask for much more . fez pocket edition -- speaking of puzzle platformers that now fit in your pocket , fez pocket edition is exactly that . fez is one of the biggest indie gaming successes in the last decade . if you 've never tried it , there 's no time like the present . playerunknown 's battlegrounds for xbox one -- if you have n't heard of pubg , you have n't been paying attention to one of the biggest gaming trends of the year . ",
        "if you 've heard wind of a `` battle royale '' game recently , this is the game you have to thank . it 's sold over 24 million copies on pc , and now its available on the xbox one . better still ? if you 're thinking about buying an xbox one x before the end of the year , you 'll get it for free .
