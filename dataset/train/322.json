        "let me start off by saying that commitment and following things through until the end is something that i 've always struggled with . growing up , some of my goals early on were influenced by my caring mother who wanted the best for her kids . things like going to school every day and applying yourself led to accomplishments like perfect attendance and honor cards . of course , the older i got the more independent i became and the more i had to hold myself accountable . those small achievements made both my mother and i proud at that time , but would soon fade once graduating from elementary school and directing my interest and energy elsewhere . ",
        "being raised in a single parent household , i learned at an early age that if i wanted something in life i had to go out and work for it . i began working around the young age of 12 years old . there was a neighborhood convenient store that i would go to every saturday to clean and replenish merchandise for . after completing my duties , i would receive a whopping $ 10 in cash and got to choose up to $ 1 worth of a merchandise ; usually i chose a drink and a bag of chips . ",
        "although quite young at the time , i learned how to save up money for that which i desired . my first big purchase was a 150-watt rca stereo system with a 5-disc changer , which i still have to this day although i no longer use . in middle school , i was one of few that had their own cell phone and probably the only one that paid their own bill . granted it was a prepaid phone , these accomplishments that seem so small now , meant the world to me at the time and would ideally lead me to one of my biggest accomplishments to this day of starting my own business . ",
        "i worked all throughout high school at a couple different jobs , one of which was a part-time job for the same convenient store i earned my first dollar at . following high school , i joined the military and afterwards lived in san diego for a couple of years . then one day various reasons lead me back home where i eventually started working at that very first job i started with ; felt like i was back to square one . how did i work so hard in life , haven taken a different career path than most after high school , the opportunity to travel the world and live on my own in california of all places just to end up back where i started ? ",
        "after working there for a couple more years , i finally decided that i wanted more out of life . i had great ideas for the business that were never listened to as just an employee and did n't want to get stuck working the same job for the rest of my life . so , i chose another path and enrolled in an undergrad program at mercyhurst university . here is where i would eventually discover my true passion in life that would lead to one of my greatest accomplishments . of course , the universe has ways of balancing things out and with great accomplishments come even greater struggles . ",
        "during one of my most challenging times in life came biggest achievement thus far . i took my strong work ethic , determination , and desire to not be stuck at a job for the rest of my life and combined it with a long-time passion of mine ; web design . over the past 2 years , i 've successfully built my own digital marketing agency while maintaining my status as a full-time student . all those small accomplishments along with the obstacles i had to overcome , led me to pursue my true passion and one of my greatest achievements thus far in life , working for myself .
