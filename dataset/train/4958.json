        "boise , idaho -- idaho courts director sara thomas said tuesday the state has made big gains on improving court access and technology , but idaho is barely hanging on when it comes to judicial turnover and vacancies . `` we are holding on by the skin of our teeth , '' thomas told members of idaho 's legislative budget-writing committee . `` we are seeing huge turnover -- it is having a strong effect . `` as a result , the judicial branch is recommending lawmakers approve a plan that would both fund a new magistrate judge position in jerome county and allow the courts to cover more cases using retired judges on `` senior status . '' ",
        "the senior judge program pays retired judges to cover cases as needed when the local court would otherwise be overwhelmed by caseloads . jerome county currently sees more than 3,100 magistrate cases each year , not including infractions . `` we simply ca n't keep up with the resources we have , so we are looking for an additional magistrate position in jerome , '' she said . the judicial branch is recommending that lawmakers approve a budget increase of just $ 1 million from the general fund , for a total of about $ 72 million for fiscal year 2019 . ",
        "that total would include about $ 49 million from the general fund , about $ 21 million from dedicated funds like court fees and alcohol surcharges , and roughly $ 2 million in federal funding . built into the budget is roughly $ 3.7 million and 17 additional staff positions for the state 's online court access system , called odyssey , part of an ongoing effort to modernize court technology and replace a 25-year-old statewide computerized case management system . a few idaho counties have already switched to the new system , and another 14 counties are expected to go live this april . ",
        "by the end of the year , thomas said , every county in idaho will be at least partially using the new system . `` sometimes like odysseus , we are sailing very smooth seas and sometimes we are on exceptionally rough seas , '' thomas said of occasional bugs that have popped up during the transition . thomas said the state ca n't go back to the old system , though , and most of the bugs have been worked out . `` the reality is that we can not fail , '' she said .
