        "by day , amy young is an art professor at city college . but , when she 's not lecturing on the history of graffiti , she 's engaging in a little illicit art-making of her own . `` i 'm less of a vandal than a graffiti artist , '' the carroll gardens resident who works under the name see me tell me told the post . `` the only reason i would get into trouble is if consider it littering . '' young makes miniature artworks -- 6-inch paper collages of vintage photos and seashells , or 4-inch figurines covered with yarn and glitter -- and tapes them up at locations such as subway stations and the grand central holiday train show .

        "each piece includes a tag with an instagram handle , @seemetellmenyc , so people can `` tell her '' on social media when they find her treasures . she started the project in 2011 but recently , see me tell me has become a much bigger endeavor . young and her helpers have planted some 4,500 `` gifts '' all over the world ; in the past year alone , she has produced more than 1,000 pieces . `` one guy picked a piece up in new york and took it to japan , '' she said . `` a woman found one of my pieces in arizona and took it home to seattle . '' ",
        "another time , a construction worker placed one of her figures on top of the manhattan bridge . `` he left it there all night , and then went up the next day and picked it up .

",
        "`` what excites people is the discovery , the adventure in finding that work . . . so , i started creating work and putting it out for free . '' see me tell me is still a guerrilla project , so young does have to be sneaky when she puts up a new work . she once got caught leaving coin-shaped trinkets at the barnes foundation in philadelphia . `` the guards escorted me down to the atrium and gave me a good talking to , '' she said with a laugh . `` they kicked me out of the museum , and i 'm ` never to return . ' '' ",
        "that has n't stopped her -- but it has spooked her husband . `` i like to put pieces up at the met and at the moma , '' she said . `` when he sees me about to , he runs away . ''   "
