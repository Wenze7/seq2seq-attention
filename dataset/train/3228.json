        "for those who are shopping about for a new laptop that is both sturdy and has a decent battery life , you will be pleased to learn that lg has announced its new 2018 series of gram laptops . lg has been releasing its gram laptops over the past couple of years , so this announcement does n't really come as a surprise . one of the key features of the new laptops is its battery life , in which lg claims will feature 72wh batteries that will last users up to a day 's worth of usage on a single charge , although this will probably vary from user to user depending on how and what you use your laptop for , but a full day on paper certainly does sound impressive . ",
        "the new laptops are also expected to come with intel 's 8th-generation core i5 and i7 processors , which according to lg will allow users to boot up computers in as little time as 10 seconds . in addition to being long-lasting and powerful , lg is also claiming that the new models are rugged and will feature mil-std 810g durability . this means that it will be able to withstand a beating or two , which will probably be useful when you 're out traveling and might accidentally bump your bag into something along the way . no word on pricing just yet , but lg is expected to show off the new laptops at ces 2018 next year .
