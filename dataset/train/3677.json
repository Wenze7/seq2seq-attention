        "the ico 's has taken formal action against the moj after finding a backlog of hundreds of information requests , some dating back to 2012the information commissioner 's office has taken the ministry of justice to task for what it called an `` undue delay '' in processing information requests and obliging the department to clear its backlog of hundreds of requests , some dating back to 2012 , by the end of next october . the office issued an enforcement action last week after it determined the moj 's current procedures were not in compliance with section 7 of the data protection act of 1998 , which requires organisations that hold data on individuals to respond to `` subject access requests '' . ",
        "responses to such requests inform the individual whether the organisation -- or `` data controller '' -- is processing data on them , and if , so , what that information is . the ico said it initially looked into the moj 's response process for subject access requests after complaints were lodged . ` unlikely to achieve compliance ' `` in dealing with the requests for assessment and associated correspondence relating to the complainants , as well as correspondence and discussions with the data controller , it became apparent to the commissioner that the data controller 's internal systems , procedures and policies for dealing with subject access requests made under the dpa were unlikely to achieve compliance , '' the ico wrote in the enforcement action . ",
        "it noted that as of 28 july 2017 the moj had a backlog of 919 unanswered requests dating as far back as 2012 . the moj presented a recovery plan to the information commissioner that involved clearing the backlog by october 2018 and answering requests without `` undue delay '' from january 2018 . under the dpa organisations are required to answer requests within 40 days . an update on 10 november of this year found that the oldest unanswered requests now dated from 2014 , with 14 cases from that year . in all there were 793 cases more than 40 days old , with the other cases on the list dating from 2015 , 2016 and 2017 . ",
        "` no reasonable explanatio n'the ico said the moj had n't provided any `` reasonable explanation '' for its failure to respond to subject access requests in a timely manner , and took the view that the issue was likely to cause `` damage or distress to individuals '' because they were `` denied the opportunity of correcting inaccurate personal data about them '' . the office issued the enforcement notice as a result of such factors , placing a legal requirement on the moj to clear its backlog by 31 october of next year and to update its systems to ensure information requests are responded to more quickly . ",
        "the justice secretary is also required to submit monthly progress reports and to `` continue to his best endeavours to surpass the milestones '' set out in the notice . according to a report by the register , the moj responded that it had `` left no stone unturned '' in ensuring the backlog of information requests by offenders was addressed , and said the information commissioner had recognised it had a plan in place that was delivering results `` at pace and ahead of schedule '' . it said it was therefore `` very disappointed '' the information commissioner had considered it necessary to take formal action . ",
        "the moj said the delays of multiple years that hundreds of information requests have met with were due to the nature of the information the department deals with . `` the information we handle is often highly sensitive and we must weigh these interests with our responsibility never to put children , vulnerable victims , witnesses , staff or criminal investigations at risk , '' the moj said . the department did not immediately respond to a request for further comment . put your knowledge of artificial intelligence to the test . try our quiz !
