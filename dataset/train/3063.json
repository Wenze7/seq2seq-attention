        "townsville and rockhampton councils to spend $ 34m on airport hundreds of kilometres from either citymichael mcgowanoutspoken federal mp bob katter has questioned why two queensland councils are paying $ 34m to build an airport to service a massive adani coalmine , saying there is an `` unpleasant odour '' to the deal . in october townsville and rockhampton councils announced they would spend $ 18.5 m and $ 15.5 m respectively on an airport , hundreds of kilometres away from either city , at the carmichael coalmine , as part of a funding deal with adani . parts of the deal are now subject to an investigation by queensland 's local government department , and last week the guardian revealed that despite previously claiming they were paying to own the airport , the two councils will merely lease it from adani . ",
        "related : queensland councils say they wo n't own adani airport despite paying $ 34mnow katter has weighed in . the katter 's australian party mp represents the seat of kennedy in queensland 's far north , including the city of townsville . he said the fact the councils were being asked to pay for the airport raised questions about the mine 's viability . `` i did not believe the news item when i heard it , that ratepayers of townsville were going to be building an airport 200 to 300 km away for a foreign corporation , '' he said . ",
        "`` if the foreign corporation needs $ 18.5 m , then i think we can safely assume the project is in real trouble . '' townsville council has argued the financial contribution to the airport was necessary to secure 900 jobs for the city as one of adani 's fly-in , fly-out hubs and the location for the company 's headquarters . but the council has refused to release the terms of the deal with adani , and katter questioned how the agreement will guarantee job numbers . `` we have written a letter to the council , asking specifically whether they have secured any agreement in writing with respect to jobs , '' he said . ",
        "`` have they asked the adani corporation how many jobs they will control ? how many will be controlled by contractors ? related : queensland accused of breaking ` no public funds for adani ' promise `` have they had a legal opinion of what their chances would be enforcing a contract against one of the bigger corporations on earth ? why does mr adani need $ 18m off the townsville city council for a project when he is purportedly outlaying $ 6,000 m ? '' the guardian has previously asked the council whether the terms of the deal restrict adani from flying in workers from airports outside of rockhampton or townsville such as brisbane , but did not get a direct response . ",
        "instead , a spokesman for townsville council said there were `` conditions in place to make sure the fifo jobs , and positions in adani 's headquarters , go to people living in townsville '' . `` there are also protections to ensure council does n't spend money on the airstrip if the mine does not go ahead , '' a townsville council spokesman said . `` townsville ratepayers will not be financially penalised if the mine does not proceed . ''   "
