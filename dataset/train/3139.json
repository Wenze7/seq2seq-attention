        "teams of british dogs will for the first time be sent into half a dozen war-torn countries to sniff out landmines . the labradors , springer spaniels , golden retrievers and malinois detect mines nearly three times faster than human experts . and they are too light to trigger blasts , so there is no danger for them . they will be deployed in syria , iraq , lebanon , sudan , yemen and angola as part of an aid package to boost the late princess diana 's campaign to rid the world of landmines . international development secretary penny mordaunt pledged to match public donations to the mine advisory group 's christmas appeal . ",
        "ms mordaunt said : `` landmines have left a shameful legacy of suffering across the world , and the british public can be proud of their contribution to eradicating this hidden , indiscriminate killer . epa `` these barbaric weapons of war kill innocent people years after a conflict has ended , and have left so many devastated families mourning the loss of loved ones . `` the thousands that do survive have been left maimed and seriously disabled forever , unable to work , unable to feed their families and suffering from a lifetime of debilitating pain . `` twenty years after princess diana 's call for action resonated in every corner of the world , britain is at the forefront in saving thousands of lives and ensuring that future generations will now have the chance to live without fear of being killed by a weapon from the past .
