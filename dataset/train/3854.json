        "heed my word and never fail againreason . purpose . motivation . if you do n't yet see a theme that unites these words , it 's that all are essential in every decision you make . these words should be the north stars that guide all actions , and the steadfast cornerstones that support the structure of goals . this is the first principle in doing meaningful work that can last . my motivation was clear at first : i reveled in the idea of learning valuable skills to then produce potentially popular mobile games , and in turn make a large sums of cash . ",
        "i understood this first principle before i spent large portions of my savings on software and business certificates . i actively knew that in order to take action and sustain that action , i would need a proper motivation/purpose in which my habits would stem out of . how else could one wake up to a pink dawn and troubleshoot a foreign software for hours throughout the day ? constantly hitting the crown of your skull against a proverbial concrete wall would prove too daunting and discouraging if it were n't for a purpose with which to carry on . ",
        "despite bumps in the road and a barrage of infinite obstacles between me and my goals , i produced five to apple and android within the next three years . the second principle to persistence however , not only are the concepts of an underlying purpose and motivation to be used as a trusty guide , they should be protected . a proper reason has the power to stir anyone to action . if the motivation is strong enough , it can spring even the most sedentary individuals to work , but without a custodian to keep watch over its origin , purpose will begin to decay , and eventually , crumble under its own weight . ",
        "what does this mean ? in layman 's terms , my realization , the revelation of this story , and eventually my downfall were all caused by one thing . the ability to reaffirm a purpose frequently enough to maintain a crystal clear image , and the mental fortitude to constantly remind oneself of an underlying motivation , was the missing piece to the greatest puzzle in my life , and presumably in others ' lives as well . why does this remain as such a widespread dilemma today ? why does it become increasingly difficult to meet goals the longer one strives for them ? ",
        "the answer is primitive and easy to grasp . as long as we continuously mistake preoccupation for productivity , and let the daily drudgery of life erode away at our god-given dreams , it may as well be impossible to retain a purpose .   "
