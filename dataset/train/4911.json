",
        "she was devastated to find it missing . a local homeless man , raymond ahlstrom , heard about gajek 's story from a reporter and decided to help . he went out into the street community to find the man that gajek accidentally gave the diamond ring to . ahlstrom eventually tracked the man down , saying that the young man was living in a tent . when he asked if the man still had the ring , the homeless youth handed it over . `` he 'd been keeping it safe in his water bottle , '' said ahlstrom .
