        "the houston rockets and los angeles clippers got into it on monday night , and by `` into it '' i mean chris paul used a secret entrance to lead the rockets into the clippers locker room to confront austin rivers and blake griffin . just seeing that written out , even now , is incredibly strange . but imagine hearing about this incident live on tv and having to react to it . would your reaction be riotous laughter ? because that 's what happened with the inside the nba crew -- specifically charles barkley and shaq . the two learned of the incident after the game , and could n't control their giggles . ",
        "after the report , shaq threw his head back in laughter , and barkley tried to fight through his chuckles to make a point . `` i played in the nba for 16 years and i 've been on tv for 18 years , this is the first time i 've ever heard ` police presence , ' '' barkley said , laughing . `` wait . they got a police presence ? are you kidding me ? `` ernie johnson cited social media reports that the los angeles police department was indeed called , which set off both shaq and chuck again . ",
        "look at shaq here , who at one point threw papers into the air in disbelief . i call this portrait of an analyst losing it . truly a work of art . the full segment has some other pretty funny lines , too . `` hello , police ? '' barkley said , pretending to call the lapd . `` chris paul tryin ' to beat me up . get down here and save me . `` it 's clear that , while odd and very funny , chuck and shaq did n't think this was that big of a deal . ",
        "at least not big enough to call the cops .   "
