        "the la liga table does n`t make for pretty viewing for real madrid supporters at the moment . the huge 16-point gap between ourselves and the leaders barcelona , means our hopes of retaining the title are very remote . this saturday we welcome villarreal to the bernabeu for a la liga fixture , it ` s a fixture that could be a tough one . villarreal are having a decent season , they sit sixth in the table and rarely lose games . at his pre-match press conference , ahead of the game , zinedine spoke about what lies ahead , remarking to the media , ` our concentration will be at 100 per cent because we 're up against very good opposition , who are having a fantastic season . ",
        "they have not lost many games . ` we 're going to try all we can to win the game . that 's our goal and it 's what we 're preparing for . they know how to use the ball very well and they cover a lot of ground . they 're a positive team and their results reflect that . ` with regards to team selection , we ` re informed that karim benzema is back in training following his injury but will not be risked . as for villarreal , their defender victor ruiz will be absent through suspension whilst the trio of bruno , roberto soriano and andres fernandez will all miss out courtesy of injuries .
