        "kathmandu , nepal -- millions of people in southern nepal voted thursday in the final phase of mostly peaceful elections for members of national and provincial assemblies . the two-phase election is the first for the seven provincial assemblies established under the constitution adopted in 2015 after initial rejection from ethnic groups in southern nepal . the assemblies will name the seven provinces formed under the constitution and draft provincial laws . thursday 's voting involves about 12 million people in the southern half of the himalayan nation , nearly 80 percent of the population . the northern , mountainous region voted on nov. . ",
        "26 , and counting in some of those areas began thursday evening . vote tallying in the rest of the country is expected to start friday and take several days because some ballot boxes must be transported from remote villages to counting centers . chief election commissioner ayodhee prasad yadav estimated voter turnout at 67 percent and said there were no major problems . people holding voting cards began lining up before polling stations opened at 7 a. m. in the capital , kathmandu . `` i am here to vote today because it is the first election for provinces , with the hope these provincial governments will be able to deliver development , '' said kedar sharan raya , a 74-year-old retired lawyer .

        "`` i am voting after many years because there is new hope in the country with the establishment of provinces , '' said iswor prasad shrestha , 70 , a businessman . security was stepped up for the election , with thousands of police and soldiers deployed . vehicles were banned from the streets and voters walked to polling stations in their neighborhoods . foreign and local observers monitored the polling . european union observer zeljana zovko said they did not note any major issues in the places they visited . nepal 's slow path to democracy began in 2006 , when protesters forced the king to give up his rule . ",
        "two years later , nepal officially abolished the centuries-old monarchy and decided a federal system would best serve all areas of one of the poorest nations in the world . but bickering among political parties delayed until 2015 the implementation of the new constitution , which declared nepal a republic . soon after the constitution took force , protests by ethnic groups in southern nepal turned violent and left some 50 people dead . the ethnic madhesi group complained that they deserved more territory in the province assigned to them because they represented a bigger population . their protests blocked the border with india for months , cutting off fuel and other supplies in nepal .
