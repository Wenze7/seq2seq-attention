        "this fund carries a 5-year annualized total return of 14.38 % , and it sits in the top third among its category peers . investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of 13.73 % , which places it in the top third during this time-frame . when looking at a fund 's performance , it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns . the lower the standard deviation , the less volatility the fund experiences . over the past three years , fismx 's standard deviation comes in at 10.07 % , compared to the category average of 9.49 % . ",
        "over the past 5 years , the standard deviation of the fund is 10.53 % compared to the category average of 12.08 % . this makes the fund less volatile than its peers over the past half-decade . risk factorsinvestors can not discount the risks to this segment though , as it is always important to remember the downside for any potential investment . in fismx 's case , the fund lost 58.46 % in the most recent bear market and underperformed its peer group by 0.09 % . this could mean that the fund is a worse choice than comparable funds during a bear market .
