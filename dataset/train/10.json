        "a christmas card from in i have this vision of a small , dimly lit bar at 3 am , only the bartender and me . puddles outside reflect the neon christmas glow of the city . i do n't smoke , but the bartender does , cleaning glasses with a rag . and as i tumble my drink in silence , the world folds in around me and soften into a half-dream ; less substantive for its lack of sound and motion . then someone walks in , sighing dramatically as they seat themselves . `` have you read ` the fountainhead ' ? '' ",
        "and the illusion shatters . i wrote something approximating the above as a fake , intentionally abrasive tinder bio a while back , mostly to amuse myself , but there 's some truth to it . now , i love love love christmas . i love the `` holiday season '' , i love schmaltzy christmas movies and christmas music and christmas oreos . i want to decorate the tree and go caroling and drink gl√ºhwein and eat gingerbread and wear ugly sweaters and spend time with my loved ones . and i was a * very * frequent visitor of every christmas market i found during my travels . ",
        "of course , christmas is supposed to be a joyous holiday . it 's a celebration of family , and i am lucky to have an amazing family with strong christmas traditions . so once you buy in to the holiday cheer , everything else follows . i could eat oreos during the rest of the year , but it 's more fun when they turn the cream red and engrave little trees on the cookies because it 's a reminder that christmas is upon us . but christmas is , of course , also the saddest holiday . what could be more painful than being surrounded by open displays of affection , good cheer , and community and not being a part of it ? ",
        "the best christmas movies and tv episodes acknowledge this blue undercurrent to such a green and red day . like the above clip from ping-pong : the animation , a very good and gorgeously drawn anime with an incredible , heart-wrenching christmas episode that floors me every time i watch it . christmas was n't originally a significant holiday in japan -- there is a christian population , but it 's fairly small -- until it was exported via american holiday commercialization * , but what 's especially interesting is that both aspects of christmas made it across the pacific . ",
        "i suppose when `` it 's a wonderful life '' is the standard-bearer for christmas movies , it 's unavoidable . even so , despite understandable attempts to sell christmas as a time of happiness , the inherent sub-narrative persists across cultures . and furthermore , i think there 's also a tendency in american culture -- undoubtedly tied to damaging ideas about masculinity -- to romanticize melancholy . tom waits has made a career out of doing it extremely well . i know i 'm guilty of it at times . i do n't actually * enjoy * being unhappy , but there 's a part of me that wants to be a bit grizzled . ",
        "i think , working through it now as i put pen to paper , that it 's less about wanting to * feel * grizzled and more about * performing * a mysterious history of pain and weariness . performing being a ghost . this is my first christmas away from family and friends . i never knew what it was like before to be alone on christmas eve . and i was n't sure what i wanted to do with my night -- i often face this dilemma of considering how to ensure a day or night has a certain character to it , a certain mood , but it feels like since i am artificially creating it , it fails . ",
        "i am too concerned with the process of creating this environment that any organic development has no room to grow . so i had indeed imagined a night of indulging melancholy . but honestly , i was n't motivated enough . i could n't drum up the enthusiasm to take the vaporetto to a main district of venice and find a quiet dive bar to soak in the atmosphere of other lonely souls . even now , again , on the night of christmas day , i find myself quietly whiling away the time , writing blog posts in the hostel . ",
        "to be fair , venice is already a very quiet city and especially so on christmas , so my island does not have much going on , but regardless i still do n't feel any desire to venture out . i am still often asked `` do n't you get lonely ? traveling by yourself for so long ... '' and i still answer `` not really ? '' obviously i miss my friends and family , and i miss having a home to return to , but for the most part i 'm too busy and/or making new friends along the way . ",
        "but i think for this christmas , i wanted to feel lonely . i wanted to find myself feeling the absence of those i care about . and i do a bit , but not enough . not enough to be unhappy . and that should probably be a good thing : i am not unhappy ! but i feel like this christmas has now slipped away without meaning or significance . it felt , mostly , like just another day abroad . and for such a christmas lover as i am , that is disappointing . i would prefer a happy , joyous christmas ; but barring that , i would still prefer * some * vibrant emotional response to this day , if not happiness then melancholy . ",
        "and that 's been lacking . i would say i have a strange relationship with holidays , broadly , and the key for me is to not think about them too much , but me being me , i also ca n't help but think about them too much . this was written over the course of a few days -- i started planning and writing it a few days before christmas , then wrote some last night , and finished it tonight on christmas , so i fear my thought pattern has been a bit scattered . but perhaps that 's best . ",
        "it better captures my thought process for how i view christmas : messily and full of contradictions . i have started joking to people today that i told santa he did n't have to bring me any presents because my trip has been such a gift -- what more could i want ? . and it 's true . i am so thankful to have been able to take this trip . to have been able to travel and study theater . to all of the friends i have made along the way . it has felt for a while now that traveling is just my default mode of being -- the fact that i am traveling the world is no longer novel to me , even as new places invite new discoveries on a specific level . ",
        "but i ca n't take this for granted . i do n't have the resources or the mental bandwidth to choose and send a present to everyone deserving of one this year , but please accept this unwieldy christmas card as a token of my affection and gratitude . thank you for reading , as always , and merry christmas , if you celebrate . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- * especially of note is how kfc marketed itself into being * the * christmas food of japan . ",
        "it is now an established tradition to get the colonel 's chicken on christmas . americans , of course , appreciate their kfc , but we do not have any christmas traditions surrounding it . and yet : now a nation of 127 million people is more invested in an american brand than we are . capitalism at work is both terrifying and impressive .
