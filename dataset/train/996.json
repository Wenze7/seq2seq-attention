        "so , ... . something wicked this way passed and tried to warn us . but we would n't listen , loud though she cried . i just realized that the most meaningful cinematic scene i ever experienced first occurred seven years before i was born , over three quarters of a century ago . and that as gregory maguire intuited , the protagonist was really the purported villain , a verdant seeress in cassandric style , and that the most meaningful scene and the most meaningful lines , the climax , was hidden in allegory and allusion , in metaphor and distraction , hidden in the past but declaimed in orwellian dialect . ",
        "`` what a world , what a world '' she tried to warn us as she slowly melted , murdered in what appeared an innocent attempt to save her , water the bane . interesting that her domain was the west . that green , the verdant savior , the real imagery of the benign , was her hue . that her prophetic role was so misunderstood , or perhaps , perverted by those whose role is perversity . a rebel with all too many causes , a martyr complex , a quantum princess whose shield was chaos and whose helm was unknowable . ",
        "avatar 's progenitress . `` wicked '' became synonymous with cool in the late sixties , not for naught . its origins in old english stem from wicca , the benign worship of nature perverted by the worshippers of death and its god into an analog of evil , and its power has never been totally obviated , not totally , not permanently ; notwithstanding layer upon layer upon layer of hypocrisy and distortion . elphaba and margaret hamilton , fated bookends , translations and interpretations incorporating sophistry and divinity . who knew then ? who could doubt today ?
