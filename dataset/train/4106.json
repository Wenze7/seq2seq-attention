        "interaction & feedbackbrief : the goal of this project is to create two digital pieces that communicate the definitions of a pair of heteronyms or homographs by engaging audiences in meaningful experiences using only the letters of the word , time , motion , sound , and interaction . decoding artifacts before we briefed over what kind of project our first project was going to be , our class gathered around a table with quite a few toys that were laid out . at first glance , most of the toys seemed to be wind-ups -- since many of them had large keys attached to the sides of them . ",
        "as a class , we discussed and interpreted the aspects of each toy and what they conveyed through their forms and movement and ultimately , what kind of experience we had once we saw how it worked . during the discussion , we brought up factors in each of the artifacts that included : how refined/finished vs unrefined/abstract -- we discussed this when we observed some metal non-moving or difficult to move objects that were put together in an unrefined way compared to the marketed products . however , at the same time they had a creative aspect that was considerate of each metal piece of the object . ",
        "movement and sound -- before `` turning on '' the toy , we would discuss how we thought the object would move by considering the form . we would guess how fast it would go , how it would move , and which direction it would go . the sound that was the byproduct of the movement was important to consider since it was part of the overall experience of the toy . material -- the discussion on material was brought up since some of the toys were made up of mostly plastic or mostly metal , so we considered whether or not each material was chosen for longevity . ",
        "the color used on some of objects were important to consider as well since the ones that were more brightly colored seemed to have caught most of our eyes first , whereas the metal ones without any color looked interesting in a technical way , almost like a toy meant for adults . element of surprise -- the element of surprise was important to consider since it was an important aspect of the overall experience of the artifacts . we brought this up when we played with the jumping dragonfly that uses a suction cup to push it down , and after an amount of time it pops back up ! ",
        "we all knew it would pop back up , but the anticipation of it made it much more fun and surprising -- almost like a reward for the audience . artifacts that were laid out on the tablein class notesexercise : as practice for finding definitions for homework , our class split up into pairs and were told to analyze and decode a word 's definition through its actual meaning , its characteristics , how one might visualize it , and how one might be able to hear it . i was paired up with jacob , and we were given the work ` clutter ' . ",
        "we first found multiple dictionary definitions of the word online , but ultimately we came up with `` the disorder of objects that have built up and obstructs both visually and spatially '' . we reached this conclusion by first writing down what we thought a clutter was to us . for jacob , he saw a clutter as a messy desktop or his old roommates side of the room . for me , i saw a clutter as many old paper stacked up and taking up space or having many things getting dropped everywhere . from there , we gathered the definitions of clutter online while also observing the images of clutters found on google . ",
        "we also consider the sounds that would go with a clutter , such as ` thud ' or ` rustle ' or even ` ow ! ' from someone stepping on something painful in the mess . research of the word `` content '' the word i chose for this project is `` content '' . i started researching the official definition on merriam-webster , then from there , i gathered imagery , videos , and sounds that i thought best represented each definition . noun : the topics or matter treated in a written work ie . table of contentscontent is the subject matter , theme , or issue in a written work . ",
        "the materials surrounding it in a temporary form would include ink/graphite , paper , and/or binding -- creating a book . going through the content would create a familiar sound of the rustling of paper . however , content can also be written and seen digitally when written and preserved onto the internet -- such as articles . it would ultimately be written using a clicking keyboard and be read by scrolling through the content 's page -- whether it could be read by pressing the down arrow on the keyboard or the swipe of the fingers on the keypad . ",
        "content is the manifestation of knowledge that takes up an amount of space . adjective : contented , satisfied ie . she was content with her life as it was . content is also the satisfaction with an objective or oneself . the familiar sigh of relief can be heard ; the comforting warmth of the fireplace on a cold winters night as you 're wrapped up in a blanket beside your cat , sipping a steaming cup of hot chocolate . the feeling of relaxation and completion at that moment -- almost as if you could melt from the tenseness you felt the day before . ",
        "the meditation ritual with calm , quiet music playing that you put aside time for everyday to help you to relax and focus . even sitting down and reading the content of your favorite book on a holiday gives you that feeling of satisfaction , a contented feeling .   "
