        "guillermo del toro 's beautifully crafted , fully realized new film the shape of water is a smart , funny , passionate sendup of cold war hysteria and current right-wing white supremacy . writer-director del toro may have set his noir thriller , anti-militarist love story in the early 1960s , but he adroitly uses the past to comment on the future . a triumvirate of marginalized heroes leads this resistance . character actor sally hawkins plays a lonely , mute latina night-shift janitor at a top-secret government military lab . she is ably supported by her african-american co-worker octavia spencer . ",
        "richard jenkins plays giles , hawkins ' next door neighbor best friend , a closeted gay man . michael shannon 's wide-eyed , hysterical colonel strickland has brought to the lab a mysterious creature he caught in the wilds of south america . coincidentally , the captured thing looks almost identical to the creature from the black lagoon , from the classic film that influenced del toro . shannon and his commander general frank hoyt want to kill and dissect their otherworldly captive for use in the american space program . while shannon and hoyt plan to exploit the creature , hawkins has , unbeknownst to them , befriended it . ",
        "first she feeds it treats . then she teaches it sign language . quickly a bond forms . when hawkins learns of the military 's plans , she springs into action . she enlists the help of spencer and jenkins in a plan to rescue the creature and release it to freedom in the sea . dan laustsen 's cinematography and the production designs of paul austerberry and art director nigel churcher create an ethereal early sixties , an attenuated curvilinear baroque , glowing from the center but darkly approaching the edges . characters and context have an over the top , cartoonish look and swagger of a world where almost anything is possible . ",
        "alexandre desplat 's lush score supports and carries the action without foreshadow or overwhelming . in this world , del toro 's seemingly powerless characters fight for life against death . fueled by love and outraged by injustice , they use the energy bred from a higher morality to challenge the prevailing power . del toro reminds us , just as he did in the academy award winning pan 's labyrinth , that hope and change may come from the unlikeliest of sources and forms .
