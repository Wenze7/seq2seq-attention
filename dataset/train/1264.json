        "when i logged on to my huffpo contributor 's account today , i was instantly greeted with a strange popup . it was a doozie . basically , they cut off all ties with past contributors . sure , they did keep some on , but for the most part i 'm guessing thousands of people got this message and were stupefied as to why it happened . i went on to read about the list of changes and reasoning behind their decision . at first , it sounded interesting . they were launching two new sections called opinion and personal . ",
        "both are for staff writers and commissioned one-off guest writers . in just a few lines , they clearly put up a huge barrier to entry for random , inspiring , or previous contributors . i can understand this : quality over quantity . they mention that their `` goal is to help our audience better understand the breakneck news cycle , and shed light on stories that are n't getting enough attention . '' that makes sense . however , my problem is how they broke the news to old contributors . to their count , they have over 100,000 contributors on the u. s. site . ",
        "i know they did n't keep them all . what has been the reaction to this so far ? it 's too soon to tell . though their announcement article garnered over 400 shares , no one is really talking/raving about their strategic virtual writer cuts . why huffpo gate-keeping is a game changer for medium authorsi could be sore about being cut from the huffpo a-team , but i understand because i 'm still new on the scene and working on my chops . however , had i known they were going to do this i would have edited and posted a dozen of my unpublished articles last week ! ",
        "huffpo 's traffic is still staggering and getting my material on their site is an asset . but alas , they caught me with my pants down . now all i can do is delete old articles i wrote for them : i ca n't add or edit anything . this is quite a bummer . something tells me they anticipated this reaction en masse which is why they decided to do things this way . i know a lot of writers who write for huffpo and medium . i 'm one of them . i suppose i 'll have to pitch to their editors like every other publication because easy street is over . ",
        "okay , maybe stepping up my game is a good thing . however , it makes me question just how democratic the decision-making is . what i love about medium is that the people decide what good content is . yes , there is a distinct audience here , but i enjoy the fact that a new writer can compete directly with ny times best-selling authors . even sixteen year old kids have found an encouraging writing community here -- and they 're our future . one of the things people love about medium is that people can vote with their hearts . ",
        "it is n't about a social shares counter or cheesy headlines to get a click . medium 's system of fairness is a triumph of the democratization of writing . at huffpo , it seems more like an oligarchy now . it 's all about the platformwhen huffpo writes `` one of the biggest challenges we all face , in an era where everyone has a platform , is figuring out whom to listen to '' they are right . there is too much information out there . but it makes me feel like editors should always be the tastemakers and they decide what 's newsworthy . ",
        "what about the vox populi ? what medium learned from digg and huffpo did n't is that the best indicator of relevant content is what people choose to read . as you know , on medium you get to play the editor 's game by pitching to numerous publications . or , you can simply post up your article on your own . regardless , good content survives and gets seen . this is a great form of validation and connection to readers you care about . i know medium 's business model is n't as lucrative as huffpo 's , but it delivers the news in the best way possible : by giving readers and writers control . ",
        "democratic platforms are the key to business success as sangeet paul choudary writes in his books platform scale and platform revolution . this was also echoed in my conversation with an investor from greylock partners . the digital world works like this : infrastructure > platform > applicationsthis is why facebook , airbnb , uber , and thousands of other global businesses thrive today . none these businesses produce content or resources , their users do . they create community-driven platforms that allow everyone a place at the table . this allows leaders to lead and talent from all walks of life to thrive . ",
        "when huffpo overshadowed every traditional media outlet in the world from recruiting the best reporters and bloggers for an online-only news source , this was a profound achievement and shift in the industry . but now they are taking an administrative step back . and because of that , publications like medium are primed to take their place . i have no idea where medium will be in ten years and how it will compare to huffpo . however , from where i 'm sitting now , i 'm all in on medium as the writer 's and reader 's choice . ",
        "for new writers , it 's the only platform that makes sense now . only read the best .   "
