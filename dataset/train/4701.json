        "hostess of 19 describes ` scary ' event where guest decades older asked her : are you a prostitute ? share on facebook share on twitter share via email share on linkedin share on pinterest share on google + share on whatsapp share on messenger at around 8 pm last thursday about 130 young women walked into the ballroom of the opulent dorchester hotel in park lane , london . to the tune of power by the british girl band little mix , each of these `` hostesses '' -- clad in a short , tight black skirt and high heels -- made their way to one of 24 tables , where about 360 men had squeezed into their tuxedos and were awaiting the arrival of dinner . ",
        "on the menu that night was scottish smoked salmon , 34-day-aged angus beef fillet and a variation on a black forest gâteau , all of which was followed by some groping , lewd comments and requests for the women to join diners in their hotel bedrooms . welcome to the presidents club charity dinner -- an event that has raised more than £ 20m during its 33-year history but has largely been a closely guarded affair . at least it was until this year 's event , where two of the hostesses happened to be undercover reporters from the financial times . ",
        "among the clutch of bankers , property tycoons , entrepreneurs and celebrities , the journalists reported being sexually harassed themselves and witnessing much , much more -- although the small number of attendees who are willing to talk publicly expressed their surprise at the reports . still , somebody did see much of this coming . the brochure for the dinner warned male guests against `` harassment and unwanted conduct '' , while upon arrival the hostesses were handed a five-page non-disclosure agreement to sign , although according to the ft reporters they were not given a chance to read its contents or take a copy with them after signing . ",
        "caroline dandridge , the founder of the artista agency that provided the hostesses for the evening , also gave a few clues during her pre-dinner pep talk about what her employees could expect . dandridge told her staff that the men might try to get the women `` pissed '' , and just before they were sent out into the ballroom they were told that if any of the guests became `` too annoying '' the hostesses should alert the boss . or , to put it in the words of one of the guests : `` down that glass , rip off your knickers and dance on that table . '' ",
        "the evening was hosted by the television personality and author david walliams for the third year running , with the auction hosted by jonny gould , the presenter of channel five 's baseball coverage and a near ubiquitous presence at london charity fundraising dinners . `` welcome to the most un-pc event of the year , '' gould bellowed . the lots included a night at the windmill strip club in soho , which is facing closure over `` serious breaches '' of its licensing conditions after concerns the dancers regularly broke the no-touching rules . there was also a course of plastic surgery , along with the tagline `` add spice to your wife . '' ",
        "one 19-year-old hostess recounted to the ft a conversation with a guest nearing his 70s , who asked her if she was a prostitute . she was not . `` i 've never done this before , and i 'm never doing it again , '' she said . `` it 's fucking scary . '' aside from the men , also on the hostesses ' backs that evening was the artista `` enforcement team '' , which consists of suited men and women circling the ballroom and cajoling less willing hostesses to interact with the diners . outside the women 's toilets a monitoring system was in place to ensure that the young women did n't spend too long away from the tables . ",
        "a security guard at the door was on hand , keeping time . it was claimed the women were paid £ 175 -- plus a taxi home -- for a six-hour shift , although that did not include any time spent at the event 's after-party . dandridge told the ft : `` this is a really important charity fundraising event that has been running for 33 years and raises huge amounts of money for disadvantaged and underprivileged children 's charities . there is a code of conduct that we follow . i am not aware of any reports of sexual harassment and with the calibre of guest , i would be astonished . '' ",
        "the dorchester told the ft that it had a zero-tolerance policy regarding harassment of guests or employees . `` we are unaware of any allegations and should we be contacted we will work with the relevant authorities as necessary , '' it said . before it announced this year 's event was to be the last , the presidents club said : `` the organisers are appalled by the allegations of bad behaviour at the event asserted by the financial times reporters . such behaviour is totally unacceptable . the allegations will be investigated fully and promptly and appropriate action taken .
