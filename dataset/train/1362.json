        "seas researchers have designed a micro-ring and micro-racetrack resonators made from lithium niobate , a material previously thought unworkable for high-quality , small scale optical devices credit : loncar lab/harvard seasif the epicenter of the electronics revolution is named after the material that made it possible -- silicon ? -- then the birthplace of the photonics revolution may well be named after lithium niobate . while lithium niobate valley does n't have the same ring as silicon valley , this material could be for optics what silicon was for electronics . lithium niobate is already one of the most widely used optical materials , well-known for its electro-optic properties , meaning it can efficiently convert electronic signals into optical signals . ",
        "lithium niobate modulators are the backbone of modern telecommunications , converting electronic data to optical information at the end of fiber optic cables . but is it notoriously difficult to fabricate high-quality devices on a small scale using lithium niobate , an obstacle that has so far ruled out practical integrated , on-chip applications . now , researchers at the harvard john a. paulson school of engineering and applied sciences have developed a technique to fabricate high-performance optical microstructures using lithium niobate , opening the door to ultra-efficient integrated photonic circuits , quantum photonics , microwave-to-optical conversion and more . ",
        "the research is published in optica . `` this research challenges the status quo , '' said marko loncar , the tiantsai lin professor of electrical engineering at seas and senior author of the paper . `` we demonstrated that you can fabricate high-quality lithium niobate devices -- with ultralow loss and high optical confinement -- using the conventional microfabrication processes . `` most conventional optical microstructures are made using processes of chemical or mechanical etching . but lithium niobate is chemically inert , meaning that chemical etching is off the table . `` using chemical etching on lithium niobate is like using water to remove nail polish , it 's just not going to work , '' said mian zhang , co-first author of the paper and postdoctoral fellow at seas . ",
        "`` in the past , mechanical etching has also been ruled out because there has been a preconception that lithium niobate is like a piece of rock that ca n't be sculpted smoothly . `` but the loncar lab -- which is known for their diamond work -- has experience with tough materials . drawing on that expertise with diamonds , the team used standard plasma etching to physically sculpt microresonators in thin lithium niobate films provided by the company nanoln . the researchers demonstrated that the nanowaveguides could propagate light across a meter-length path while losing only about half their optical power . ",
        "in comparison , light propagating in the previous lithium niobate devices would lose at least 99 percent of light over the same distance . `` the nanowaveguides we demonstrate here have a propagation loss of less than three db per meter , meaning that now we can do sophisticated manipulation of light over a one-meter path length , '' said cheng wang , co-first author of the paper and postdoctoral fellow at seas . `` we also show that you can tightly bend these waveguides , so that a meter-long waveguide can actually be packed inside a centimeter-size chip . '' ",
        "`` this is a significant breakthrough in integrated photonics and lithium niobate photonics , '' said qiang lin , associate professor of electrical and computer engineering and associate professor of optics at the university of rochester , who was not involved in the research . `` this opens the door towards a variety of intriguing functionalities , enabled by the unique optical and electrical properties of lithium niobate that do not exist in in other optical media . '' `` this research demonstrates that this relatively unexplored material is ready to address critical applications in optical links for data centers , '' said joseph kahn , professor of electrical engineering at stanford university , who was not involved in the research . ",
        "`` thin-film lithium niobate is uniquely well-suited for any functions requiring modulating light or shifting the frequency of light . ? over the next few years , tfln will play a key role in enabling tiny , inexpensive , low-power optical modules for data centers to achieve functionality similar to today 's telecommunication equipment , which is far larger , costlier , and more power-hungry . `` next , the researchers aim to build on these results and develop lithium niobate platform for a wide range of applications including optical communication , quantum computation and communication and microwave photonics .
