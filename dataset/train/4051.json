        "commodities30 minutes ago . saved . see saved items . this article has already been saved in your saved items . by liz hampton houston - u. s. oilfield service companies are gearing up for initial public offerings , according to regulatory filings and analysts , after several shelved equity sales last year during a weak period for oil prices . oil is trading near its highest level since early 2015 , fueling demand for service firms to bring new shale wells to production . energy executives surveyed last month said they would increase drilling sharply at prices above $ 60 a barrel . ",
        "crude recently traded at about $ 61.50 a barrel . investors ' appetite for the shares will be tested soon . liberty oilfield services , which provides hydraulic fracturing services to shale producers , last week filed to raise about $ 160 million by selling 10.7 million shares at about $ 15 a share . if its ipo performs well , it could open the gates for several other companies aiming to raise funds for new expansion or to buy rivals . since august , the van eck vectors oil services etf is up nearly 28 percent , behind the 32 percent gain in the spdr s&p oil and gas exploration and production etf . ",
        "denver , colorado-based liberty was one of four oilfield firms that shelved ipos last year after producers trimmed spending budgets as crude dipped to $ 45 a barrel . liberty did not respond to requests for comment . other service firms also have updated their filings , signaling they may try again . `` we could see a quick ramp up because there are so many in a good position to go quickly once market conditions improve , '' said a. j. ericksen , a partner with law firm baker botts who focuses on mergers and acquisitions and capital markets . ",
        "his firm represents the underwriters in liberty 's public offering . underpinning the improving market for fracking services , there are some 7,300 drilled-but-uncompleted wells across the united states as of november , the u. s. energy information administration recently reported . those are wells that have yet to be hydraulically fractured . bj services , fts international and nine energy service , all of which offer hydraulic fracturing of shale wells , last year filed registration statements with the u. s. securities and exchange commission but did not proceed . fracking involves pumping sand and liquids at high pressure into a well to release trapped oil and gas . ",
        "representatives from the three companies did not respond to requests for comment . in late october , fts amended its registration filing and said its average pricing was up by more than 50 percent since late 2016 . it also said it expects to reactivate six pressure-pumping fleets through mid-2018 , suggesting strong demand for hydraulic fracturing . nine energy service in late december also filed an amended registration form , a possible sign it is positioning itself to go public this year . bj services , which named a new chief financial officer in november , has not updated its filing since july . ",
        "`` everyone that filed in 2017 but took no additional action is probably a candidate in 2018 , '' said richard spears , vice president of oilfield service research firm spears & associates . he estimates as many as five oilfield service companies could go public in the first quarter of this year . pressure pumping firm keane group went public a year ago at $ 19 a share , just as energy prices were moving higher after opec agreed to curb production . after falling to $ 12.51 last may as crude prices slipped , its shares have recovered and currently trade around $ 18.52 . ",
        "`` we look at keane as the closest peer to liberty . so if keane is trading well , that should bode well for liberty , '' said kathleen smith , who manages exchange-traded funds for ipo specialist renaissance capital .   "
