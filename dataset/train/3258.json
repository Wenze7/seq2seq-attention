        "port city colombo , financed by china , promises to be a game-changer for sri lanka , and the government hopes its development will help them to become a trading hub between europe , africa , the middle east and asia . the port will also be a finance centre accessing the indian subcontinent 's rapidly developing markets , hopefully attracting overseas investors and increasing employment . colombo officials anticipate the port generating massive amounts of foreign investment in the next 25 years . sri lanka 's location once made it a centre for east-west commerce . those links are being revived , with beijing counting on sri lanka to be central in the `` belt and road initiative '' , the development of eurasian transport infrastructure and trading routes along the old silk roads . ",
        "but many sri lankans are wary . since 2009 , the chinese have financed and built ports , roads , railways and airports nationwide . some ventures have been controversial : mattala rajapaksa international airport has been dubbed the world 's emptiest . the projects left china owning us$ 8 billion in sri lankan debt , much of it collateralised against key assets . last december , sri lanka handed hambantota port to china . a joint venture between state-controlled china merchants port holdings and the sri lanka ports authority owns the leasehold for the port and 15,000 acres of adjacent land . ",
        "the deal , in which the chinese partner holds a 70 per cent stake , has been criticised for undermining sri lankan sovereignty . sri lankan president maithripala sirisena is trying to address the concerns this has sparked over sovereignty by expanding commercial ties with other countries . talks on free trade agreements with china and malaysia are under way , while singapore prime minister lee hsien loong is expected to conclude a trade deal in january . the economic and technology cooperation agreement , seeking to expand sri lanka 's trade agreement with india , could to be finalised by june . ",
        "while colombo hopes these agreements can stimulate investment and let its tea and textiles exports boom , some fear the country may lose out to foreign business . but , right now , the focus of anxiety is port city colombo . construction is set to generate tens of thousands of jobs , and the foreign finance it attracts is seen as crucial to reducing the country 's us$ 64.9 billion debt burden . yet critics argue the port may undermine sovereignty and do little to help local business prosper . the government knows this argument is not only central to the success of this development , but may determine the limits of future chinese investment .
