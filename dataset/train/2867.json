        "starting today , you 'll be able to get wendy 's delivered right to your door as the chain is now partnering exclusively with doordash . at launch , the delivery service is available in 48 markets nationwide . wendy 's and doordash piloted the program earlier this year in columbus , ohio and dallas , texas and the restaurant chain said that the baconator and frosty were popular items during the test . wendy 's is the latest fast-food chain to team up with doordash . other doordash partners have included taco bell , baskin-robbins and kfc while ubereats has mcdonald 's on its lineup . ",
        "while more and more restaurants are adding delivery to their offerings , others are experimenting with how that food is being delivered . in ann arbor , michigan , domino 's is piloting a program where its food is delivered by a self-driving car and elsewhere the pizza chain has served its pizza via drone and autonomous rovers . doordash has also been testing out robot delivery , so maybe that frosty will soon show up at your door on a little self-driving rover .
