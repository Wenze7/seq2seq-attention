        "u. s. president donald trump 's economics team landed in davos , switzerland , bringing with them their boss 's `` america first '' agenda . u. s. treasury secretary steven mnuchin broke with his predecessors by saying publicly that a `` weaker dollar is good '' for trade , sending the greenback to its lowest level in three years . meanwhile , commerce secretary wilbur ross unnerved investors by saying a `` trade war '' is underway and that the white house planned more measures to support its exporters . and it 's only wednesday . `` america first '' whether or not the white house choreographed the dollar 's slide , it may have just declared open season on the currency . ",
        "the greenback was caught in the rhetorical crosshairs after mnuchin endorsed its fall as a benefit to the american economy . the comments came days after trump slapped tariffs on solar panels and washing machines . `` this is about an ` america first ' agenda , '' mnuchin said . `` but ` america first ' does mean working with the rest of the world . it just means that president trump is looking out for american workers and american interests , no different than he expects other leaders will look out for their own . '' for its part , china is looking to further open its economy this year . ",
        "playing europe 's gamethe continent 's heavy hitters , german chancellor angela merkel and french president emmanuel macron , were the big tickets wednesday , and it 's safe to say that they differ with their colleagues from across the pond . merkel warned against the `` poison '' of populism that leads nations to look inward as she made the case for a common european approach to economic policy . macron , following her later in the day , is urging global elites to do more to narrow the inequalities that have resulted from global capitalism 's excesses . ",
        "italy 's prime minister paolo gentiloni , however , was less circumspect . he assailed trump 's economic policy as a threat to global growth , urging europe to `` play its own game '' and fill in gaps left by u. s. businesses . dimon is n't worried wall street executives are bracing for higher interest rates , but they 're betting that incoming federal reserve chairman jay powell and his global counterparts can tighten monetary policy without crashing markets . `` people are worried about the number of fed increases that might happen this year , '' james gorman , chief executive officer of morgan stanley , said in an interview . ",
        "`` i 'm not -- i think it 's healthy . '' jpmorgan chase & co. . ceo jamie dimon echoed his sentiments , saying a combination of strong growth and slightly higher inflation would leave central banks with no choice but to raise rates . dimon added that he 's `` really not worried '' about them hitting the brakes too hard . bond bear daliosignificantly more dour than dimon and gorman , though , was billionaire hedge fund manager ray dalio , founder of bridgewater associates lp . he told davos attendees that the bond market has slipped into a bear phase , and warned that a rise in yields could spark the biggest crisis for fixed-income investors in almost 40 years . ",
        "while economic growth is in its late stages , he added , it could nevertheless continue to improve for an additional two years . the current economic environment is good for stocks but bad for bond investors , dalio said , forecasting that the fed would tighten monetary policy faster than it has signaled . bankers praise trumptrump will try to sell attendees on his economic policies in person come friday , the final day of the world economic forum 's annual meeting . he can expect a pleasant welcome from american bankers , including goldman sachs group inc. . ",
        "ceo lloyd blankfein , who said his opinion of the trump administration is positive . `` i like a lot more stuff than i do n't like , '' blankfein said in an interview . `` i 've really liked what he 's done for the economy , and i think he 's gone out of his way to be very , very supportive of the system . '' dimon said he 's been focusing on policy issues rather than the rhetoric coming out of the white house . `` what i 'm bulled-up about is that policy makers are making good policy decisions in the u. s. about taxes , about proper regulatory reform , '' he said .
