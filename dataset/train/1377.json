        "the third installment of this segment ` manchester city : better than ... ? ' this time i focus on the newcastle side of 1995/96 . of course they did n't win anything , this comes on the back of david ginola who was talking on alan brazil 's show a few mornings ago . arguments have ranged from a ` what have they won ' to accusations that pep is a ` cheque book manager ' have been heard over the airwaves of talk shows and the like . yesterday i looked at the chelsea side of the 2004 through to the 2006 season . ",
        "i actually feel quite ridiculous doing this team , as they did n't end up winning anything . the comparison , of course , comes as newcastle raced to a multiple points lead at christmas . league : newcastle , united kingdom -- august 30 : newcastle united striker les ferdinand celebrates in the back of the net after heading the winning goal against middlesbrough in the premiership match at st james ' park on august 30 , 1995 in newcastle , england . the first part of the season for newcastle was fantastic . as january came around , kevin keegan 's newcastle side had only lost three games . ",
        "one of those , two days after christmas , was to the chasing side , manchester united . newcastle entered the new year with 45 points , seven points ahead of united . that total had been ten prior to the defeat at old trafford , and was again extended to 17 towards the end of january with only fifteen games remaining in the season . however , disaster would strike as united went on a barren spell , winning only twice between mid february and through to the beginning of april . those seven points from eight games saw the red devils gain of the toon army with opposition boss cranking up the mind games . ",
        "when kevin keegan secured the 1-0 victory at elland road the interview directly after the final whistle will go down in history . now three points behind united , with only two games left , keegan absolutely had a heads gone moment . if you get a chance , give it a look . needless to say , two draws from the final two games saw newcastle finish four points behind united . domestic cups : 29 oct 1995 : les ferdinand and david ginola of newcastle united celebrate ginola 's goal during an fa carling premiership match against tottenham hotspur at white hart lane in london . ",
        "the match ended in a 1-1 draw . mandatory credit : ben radford/allsportnot even close to an fa cup win , the newcastle side went out in the third round . after taking chelsea to a replay the toon army eventually went out on penalties . the league cup campaign was a little more successful , but ended around the same time as the fa cup one . beating liverpool and stoke , after taking a second game to defeat bristol city . newcastle eventually fell 2-0 away to arsenal on january 10th at the quarter final stage . that was three days after the first game against chelsea , and a week before the return game , and the end of domestic cup hopes . ",
        "squad : newcastle upon tyne , united kingdom -- may 10 : newcastle united pose in their new adidas home and away kits at st james ' park before the 1995/96 season , back row left to right , pavel srnicek , phillipe albert , chris holland , robert lee , barry venison , marc hottiger , ruel fox , scott sellars , richie appleby , keith gillespie , jimmy crawford , mike hooper front row , peter beardsley , steve howey , paul kitson , lee clark , john beresford , robbie elliott , steve watson , malcolm allen , alan neilson , paul bracewell , mike jeffrey and darren peacock before the big tv deals , and before the billions of city and chelsea , the league had big money owners .",
        "personally wealthy individuals , like jack walker of blackburn . walker had financed the delivery of the premier league only a few seasons before and now , under sir john hall , newcastle were trying to do similar . £ 16 million , unheard of back then , was spent on les ferdinand , david ginola , warren barton and shaka hislop in the summer . a further £ 11 million was spent in the new year bringing david batty and , my personal favorite of that side , faustino asprilla to st james park . none of that money equated to success , although this side , with the way they played certainly had similarities to pep 's current city side .
