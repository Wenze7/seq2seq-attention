        "minneapolis -- minnesota public radio has provided additional details of allegations of sexual harassment against humorist garrison keillor , saying his alleged conduct went well beyond his account in november of accidentally touching a woman 's bare back . mpr said in a statement tuesday that keillor was accused by a woman who worked on his `` a prairie home companion '' radio show of dozens of sexually inappropriate incidents over several years , including requests for sexual contact and explicit sexual communications and touching . mpr said the woman , whom it has not identified , detailed the allegations in a 12-page letter that included excerpts of emails and written messages . ",
        "mpr said as it attempted to investigate the case , keillor and his attorney refused to grant access to his computer , emails and text messages . keillor did not respond to an emailed request for comment from the associated press . he told the minneapolis star tribune listeners were angry over his firing because they `` smelled a rat '' and `` they know i 'm not abusive . '' he called the woman 's account `` a highly selective and imaginative piece of work '' drawn up by her attorney . mpr faced a backlash from outraged keillor fans after firing the best-selling humorist after four decades of his telling folksy stories about his fictional minnesota hometown of lake wobegon . ",
        "keillor accused the station of firing him without a full investigation . until mpr 's new statement tuesday , the only account of his actions was his . he told the star tribune on nov. . 29 that he had simply been trying to console a co-worker . `` i meant to pat her back after she told me about her unhappiness , and her shirt was open and my hand went up it about six inches . she recoiled . i apologized , '' keillor told the newspaper in an email . `` i sent her an email of apology later , and she replied that she had forgiven me and not to think about it . ",
        "`` in a note to members tuesday afternoon , mpr president jon mctaggart said otherwise . `` if the full 12-page letter or even a detailed summary of the alleged incidents were to be made public , we believe that would clarify why mpr ended its business relationship with garrison and correct the misunderstandings and misinformation about the decision , '' he added . the station also disputed that keillor was fired in a rush , laying out a timeline in which it launched an internal investigation after receiving a general allegation against keillor from a former employee -- not the alleged victim -- in late august . ",
        "mpr said that employee refused to identify the alleged victim or detail what happened to her , and mpr did n't get specifics of the allegations until it received letters from the former employee sept. . 29 and from the alleged victim oct. . 22 . mpr said it notified its board oct. . 26 and launched an independent investigation a few days later . mpr said keillor responded to the allegations with his attorney present . mpr said keillor and his attorney declined to give access to his computer , emails and text messages to allow a full investigation . ",
        "the station said it had avoided releasing more information about the allegations while it was in mediation with keillor `` and the other parties in this matter . '' `` unfortunately , the mediation sessions have not produced the final settlements we had hoped for , '' the station said . mpr has removed from its website archived `` a prairie home companion '' shows featuring keillor . the network also ended broadcasts of `` the writer 's almanac , '' keillor 's daily reading of literary events and a poem , and ended rebroadcasts of keillor-hosted `` prairie home '' shows . ",
        "keillor , 75 , retired in 2016 as host of `` prairie home , '' a saturday evening radio variety show he created in 1974 . the show , now titled `` live from here , '' continues with keillor 's hand-picked successor , mandolinist chris thile .   "
