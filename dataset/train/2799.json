        "new haven -- a big-picture vision for the long wharf area could be five or six `` districts '' expanding the current industrial , health care , food , entertainment and maritime features , all woven together by waterways and walkable streets . it is the first very preliminary sketch of a strategic plan for long wharf by perkins eastman , planners who have done this type of thing before in washington , d. c. , new york city , san francisco and internationally . the principals , eric fang and stan eckstut , addressed about 70 people at the betsy ross arts magnet school in the hill tuesday , drawing residents from that neighborhood and nearby wooster square , as well as many alders eager to hear their thoughts on improving these 400 acres important to the city 's economy and its history . ",
        "only 1.5 miles from end to end , fang spoke of four rather distinct sections that start with the area around jordan 's furniture , followed by assa abloy , the food terminal and ikea that could be home to complementary businesses with the fifth section in the area of the maritime center and sports haven . `` stan and i have n't seen anything quite like this . the opportunities are tremendous . we just have to figure out how to re-jigger them , '' fang said of the mix of transportation assets and businesses that have grown organically . ",
        "in terms of neighborhoods , long wharf came together only 60 years ago under mayor richard c. lee , much of it reclaimed wetlands that allowed the interstate highway to come in to what was envisioned as an industrial park . `` it 's a baby-boomer of a district , '' fang said of that demographic going through its own adjustments , as the long wharf area will be , although the importance of the long wharf area dates back centuries . the original long wharf led settlers to the nine squares , where the downtown was founded with the green as the center . ",
        "`` this district ... is foundational to the city itself , '' fang said . filling in what was part of the harbor is the genesis for much of the water problems , with mother nature trying to revert to its original state , fang said . this brought them to discuss the idea of waterways and landscaping that would surround and tie the districts together and deal with the stormwater . `` we have to deal with the stormwater ... it is a big deal , '' eckstut said of the idea of creating sustainable wetland gardens , `` an emerald necklace '' of waterways such as the city of boston has to deal with its runnoff in a natural , sustainable way . ",
        "`` it works very well , '' eckstut said . the city has been working on this already , particulary right along the harbor as it brings back some of the features that were lost or damaged in superstorm sandy and tropical storm irene . michael piscitelli , city deputy economic administrator , said new haven has already had to deal with severe storms that negatively affected the area . fang said it is about a five-minute walk , or a quarter-mile , the unit of time people typically walk comfortably in a neighborhood . so instead of one vast area , you can see different districts emerging , fang said of how they begin their planning , although what they wanted on tueday was feedback from the crowd as to what they felt was important . ",
        "`` we are not trying to re-invent the wheel . we are trying to learn from other places to see how it would apply , not to copy but to interpret and see how we might apply to some advantage , '' eckstut said . he said this is all to emphasize the right public infrastructure -- the streets and public spaces that create `` the ultimate maximum public benefits . '' eckstut said that is how the `` most valuable real estate is created , '' along these areas . eckstut emphasized that only a month into this project -- which will likely wrap up in june -- they have not had enough time to know what they are talking about yet which is where the public comes in . ",
        "reiterating what fang said , eckstut added : `` what makes a city is walking ... and the real value of new haven are all these walkable districts . . . that is what makes it so special . '' `` you have great bones to work with in this district , like all over new haven , '' eckstut said . feedback from the public included : an emphasis on the maritime history of the area , with recreational boating and other water features , such as a ferry service . an easier connection to wooster square was emphasized as was a bridge from the railyard to the water . ",
        "they were excited about adding restaurants and places of entertainment that are typical of bigger cities that are located on a harbor . better lighting was a focus of one group to make the area safer , while some thought there could be a sixth district closest to the hill . two veterans were concerned with the area where there are mouments to veterans . the city said it has brought in large rocks to help protect that section that was damaged in recent major storms . the next of several public hearings on the project will be in february .
