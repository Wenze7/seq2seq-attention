        "photo by jesse d. garrabrant/nbae via getty imagesthe philadelphia 76ers begin christmas day against the new york knicks at noon on the east coast . here are three matchups to keep an eye on during the game . the philadelphia 76ers are slumping entering their christmas day matchup against the new york knicks . they currently have a 14-18 record since losing five games in a row . the team has been without first overall pick markelle fultz since oct. . 23 . fultz appeared in four games before being sidelined with a mysterious shoulder injury . the sixers did n't struggle much without him , but the month of december has been quite a time for them . ",
        "the philadephia 76ers are 2-8 in the month of december , allowing 112.4 points per game through the same span . to make matters worse , big man joel embiid missed the past three contests with a sore back . he returned to the lineup in their game against the toronto raptors on saturday night , but philadelphia still fell 102-86 . the sixers have an opportunity to snap a five-game losing streak on monday afternoon , but they 'll need to be focused going in . while they rank sixth in the league as a team in points per game , they allow 109.4 points per game , ranking 25th in the nba . ",
        "here 's a look at some key matchups to focus as they face the 17-15 knicks . photo by jesse d. garrabrant/nbae via getty images3 . robert covington vs. courtney leethe 3-point shooting should be on full display when robert covington and courtney lee face off against each other . covington is averaging 15.1 points , 6.3 rebounds , 1.9 steals and 1.8 assists per game . he is shooting a career-high 38.9 percent from 3-point range this season , ranking fourth in the nba in 3-point field goals made . while his points per game are up in december , his 3-point shooting percentage is down a bit at 36.3 percent . ",
        "lee is averaging 13.1 points , 3.6 rebounds , 2.8 assists and 1.4 steals per game through 32 starts this season . he is having quite the renaissance season since returning from a season-ending injury suffered in the 2016-17 season . he is shooting 43.2 percent from the 3-point arc , his second-best 3-point field goal percentage in his ninth year in the league . the battle of the 3-point line will start for both sides with covington and lee . whoever can get off to a hot start is bound to lead their team to victory . covington was 5-of-12 from the 3-point arc in the sixers ' loss to the raptors on saturday night . ",
        "he went 2-for-13 from the arc against the sacramento kings on tuesday night , as philadelphia fell 101-95 . photo by jesse d. garrabrant/nbae via getty images2 . ben simmons vs. frank ntilikinathis is a bit of a tougher matchup to monitor considering knicks rookie frank ntilikina is n't in the starting lineup . still , ben simmons against ntilikina should be fun , especially if the game is close . simmons has been a stat-sheet stuffer during his rookie season , averaging 17.1 points , 8.8 rebounds , 7.7 assists and 2.0 steals per game through 31 games . ",
        "although simmons has put up impressive numbers , the results have been a bit underwhelming of late when you consider the team 's 14-17 record . his offense has been his strength as he 's put up an offensive rating of 104.6 . on the defensive end , he 's posted a rating of 102.8 . it 's something to keep an eye on although he still has a net rating of +1.8 . in wins , his defensive rating is 94.7 . in losses , it 's 109.0 . ntilikina , on the other hand , is averaging 5.9 points , 3.2 assists , 2.1 rebounds and 1.3 steals through 20.3 minutes per game . ",
        "he 's appeared in 29 games for the new york knicks this season . he 's seen an increase in minutes this month as the organization continues to bring him along with kristaps porzingis in the frontcourt . ntilikina is certain to see increased minutes on the big stage with ben simmons on the other bench . photo by jesse d. garrabrant/nbae via getty images1 . joel embiid vs. kristaps porzingisthe last time joel embiid and kristaps porzingis faced each other , things were different . embiid put up 21 points , 14 rebounds , an assist , a steal and a block in a close 98-97 victory back jan. . ",
        "11 of last year . porzingis put up seven points on 3-of-10 shooting along with two assists , two blocks and a steal . it 's easy to say embiid won the first matchup , but that was then and this is now . this season , porzingis is averaging 24.7 points , 6.7 rebounds , 2.0 blocks and 1.3 assists for the knicks . embiid is averaging 23.7 points , 10.9 rebounds , 3.5 assists and 2.0 blocks behind a career-high 14 double-doubles and counting . he 's currently nursing a sore back , but porzingis himself recently returned from injury as well . ",
        "porzingis went 0-for-11 in the knicks ' 102-93 victory over the boston celtics on thursday night . it was his first game back since sitting out for a week with a sore knee . he had 29 points , nine rebounds and two blocks in the next game , although they lost that one as well 107-104 to the detroit pistons . with both players banged up , but on losing streaks , one is bound to shine brighter than the other . the battle of two future superstar big men will be interesting to watch for the first game on christmas day , that 's for sure .
