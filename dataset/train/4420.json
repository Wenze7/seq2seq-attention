        "why bother with daily affirmations ? 21 days . a plethora of psychological studies acknowledges it takes this long to form new habits . habits boil down to neuroplasticity , as seen in this ted talk . the repetition of an action or thought process creates synapses in your mind . the famous study of london taxi drivers proves that the repeated practice can physically change our brain and how we think . while we can actively use this to change ourselves for the better , we more often create synapses we do n't want . that 's where daily affirmations come in . ",
        "negative self-talk is something we all do , but rarely are we in the moment enough to catch it . when we continually think ` i do n't belong here ' or ` i do n't deserve ... ' we are cultivating that way of thinking and strengthening it . we give it power . in a previous post , i talked about being kind to ourselves and not feeling ashamed of where we are . shame causes learning centers to shut down , closing us up to new experiences . instead of giving in to negative self-talk , i dare you to create daily affirmations . ",
        "positive phrases that grow and create pathways in your mind with each passing day . some examples of my own include : happiness grows from inside me and warms others like sunshine . i am a goddess , a warrior benevolent and strong , superior to any negative thoughts . everyone is going through the same struggles as me , nobody is judging as much as i think they are . my anger , jealousy , and hate melt away into compassion , understanding and love . i am exactly where i am meant to be right now , without shame . ",
        "i will embrace my mistakes and turn them into strengths . i will give myself kind attention today . i am an indestructible force of nature . i am in control of my life , my potential is infinite . my fears and anxieties are transient , they too will pass . i am a creator , artistic energy flows through me . calling myself a goddess may seem pretty far-fetched , but i do this every morning , looking in the mirror while putting on makeup or brushing my teeth . lately , i 've noticed fewer roadblocks in my confidence when i step into new ventures , challenges i would 've previously shied away from . ",
        "instead , there 's a calm -- an unshakeable , undeniable feeling that , yeah , i totally can do this . and if i fail , i could stand back up . the kind attention i showed myself through self-affirmations has quieted the chorus of self-doubt to a dull hum and replaced it with endless possibilities . we 'll talk about what to do with that limitless potential next week . your call to actionfor 21 days , i dare you to talk to yourself like you would your best friend . create your own self-affirmations , whether they 're about life , love , work , or happiness . ",
        "it may feel silly at first , but with each utterance , you 're changing your brain . let these phrases be your armor -- the synapses you create with each repetition can protect you from the next onslaught of negative self-talk .   "
