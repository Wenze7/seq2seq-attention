",
        "what if it 's not safe to cross our streets or drive over to the store ? is our home still just a heart or only four walls and a door ? or is it something greater , something less defined ? you have your four walls , and i have this mind . i have this voice , and i refuse to deny it . you can bring your hatred , and i will bring the peaceful riotof hearts called out to meet the hate with fiercest love and songto call you out of your four walls and say that you are wrong .
