        "mauricio pochettino has played down reports tottenham are interested in signing bordeaux 's in-demand malcom after seeing north london rivals arsenal distance themselves from a deal . the winger is a reported target for spurs , having hit seven goals in ligue 1 this season , with pochettino yet to make a signing in the january transfer window . but despite spurs struggling for creativity in christian eriksen 's absence during sunday 's 1-1 draw at southampton , the argentine coach has denied a move for the brazilian is imminent . `` that is a rumour and i do n't want to speak about it , '' pochettino told sky sports when asked about 20-year-old malcom . ",
        "`` i am happy with our squad . we are open to quality players , but it is difficult in this transfer window . '' harry kane 's 99th premier league goal cancelled out a davinson sanchez own-goal as spurs struggled for cohesion at a sodden st mary 's , losing ground in the race for champions league qualification . but after kane missed a last-minute opportunity to snatch all three points , pochettino said his side had done enough to win the game . `` i think it was an even game and a difficult game to play , '' pochettino added . ",
        "`` the pitch was in a difficult condition . it was tough . a battle . it was fair , the result . `` we struggled to play . it was in possession , we made mistakes which allowed them to play . to win the game we should do better and play better . it was n't great . `` we tried to be more aggressive in our offensive phase and to link better kane and alli behind . this allowed us to be more aggressive in transition and use our full-backs going forward . we had a massive chance with harry kane at the end to win the game . ",
        "`` we still have the possibility to fight . southampton are in a relegation battle so it is not easy , they fight to survive . every ball , they were aggressive . but it was our mistake to not win the game . '' southampton are in the relegation zone , without a win in their last 10 premier league matches , but mauricio pellegrino was buoyed by his team 's performance . `` i think we are on the right path , '' pellegrino told sky sports . `` in the last four games we responded really well . ",
        "obviously this is the attitude we need to show in the next game - it 's massive for us . `` we knew this . in the second half they played with a diamond , one between the line and two strikers , they were dangerous . but we had space in wide areas and we had a couple of chances . they are an amazing team with great players . most of the time we defended well . `` we have to be confident but we are not in the best moment so players might not want to take risks , this is part of football . ",
        "`` for me every single game is an opportunity to improve . we have improved a lot and we have to continue in this way . in three or four weeks time everything can change . we have to be optimistic but we will continue to improve . ''   "
