        "open days have long been the traditional way for undergraduates to decide where and what they want to study . now , more universities are offering open days to prospective postgrads , too . so , how do you get the best out of them ? a good open day will take into account the different needs of postgraduate students . `` the most crucial element , '' says james hadfield , postgraduate marketing officer at nottingham trent university , `` is detailed course content . prospective students will have a desire to understand how the course is going to enhance their existing knowledge and , therefore , their career . ",
        "`` details regarding scholarship schemes or alumni discount opportunities are also important , as the availability of funding streams can determine if study is a viable option . `` at warwick business school , postgraduate open days are `` more intimate , in comparison to the undergraduate events '' , says magda brown , assistant business development and recruitment manager . `` we offer a personalised approach and an opportunity to have a one-to-one conversation with members of staff . `` the last part of the day is an informal q&a session in small groups , so everyone gets a chance to have their questions answered . ",
        "`` some institutions now offer open days online . for example , the london institute of banking & finance hosts live webinars . `` prospective students can ask about the course , as well as watch a ` taster ' lecture , '' says associate dean hema tank . `` it makes sense to have the open day online , as that 's the environment in which the students are going to learn . `` as postgrad students are more likely to be working or have caring responsibilities , an open day is the perfect way to find out how the university may help . ",
        "student support should be the first point of call . `` ask about welfare provision , childcare and the process if ` x ' happens , '' says si√¢n duffin , student support team leader at arden university , `` especially when it may be an issue for you . ''   "
