        "exclusive : emails seen by the guardian reveal inexperienced undergraduates are being asked to help in a&e units and wards share on facebook share on twitter share via email share on linkedin share on pinterest share on google + share on whatsapp share on messenger medical students are being urged to help relieve the nhs winter crisis because hospitals are so short-staffed they are struggling to cope with the surge in patients , the guardian can reveal . despite their lack of experience , undergraduates are being asked to volunteer in a&e units and on wards reeling under the weight of extra demand caused by the cold weather , an outbreak of flu and people suffering serious breathing problems . ",
        "they have been told to expect to fit cannulas -- the tubes inserted so patients can receive medication -- and take blood , work usually done by nurses or qualified doctors . the british medical association said that asking students who had not qualified in medicine to assist with , in some cases , severely ill patients was `` a desperate measure '' that could put patients at risk and exploit undergraduates who agreed to help . the disclosure led to warnings that hospitals could face legal difficulties if students made mistakes and concern that their presence on wards could disguise the depth of nhs understaffing . ",
        "medical schools are asking fourth - and fifth-year students for urgent assistance at `` hard-pressed '' nearby hospitals and gp surgeries , according to emails obtained by the guardian . dr andrew hassell , the head of keele university 's medical school , wrote to students recently to enlist support in tackling the nhs 's `` national crisis '' . `` we 're sure you do n't need us to tell you about the extraordinary - situation the whole of the nhs is facing this winter , '' wrote hassell , who is also a senior figure at the nhs trust that runs hospitals in stoke and stafford . ",
        "why is the nhs winter crisis so bad in 2017-18 ? a combination of factors are at play . hospitals have fewer beds than last year , so they are less able to deal with the recent , ongoing surge in illness . last week , for example , the bed occupancy rate at 17 of england 's 153 acute hospital trusts was 98 % or more , with the fullest -- walsall healthcare trust -- 99.9 % occupied . nhs england admits that the service `` has been under sustained pressure high levels of respiratory illness , bed occupancy levels giving limited capacity to deal with demand surges , early indications of increasing flu prevalence and some reports suggesting a rise in the severity of illness among patients arriving at a&e s '' . ",
        "many nhs bosses and senior doctors say that the pressure the nhs is under now is the heaviest it has ever been . `` we are seeing conditions that people have not experienced in their working lives , '' says dr taj hassan , the president of the royal college of emergency medicine . the unprecedented nature of the measures that nhs bosses have told hospitals to take -- including cancelling tens of thousands of operations and outpatient appointments until at least the end of january -- underlines the seriousness of the situation facing nhs services , including ambulance crews and gp surgeries . ",
        "was this helpful ? thank you for your feedback . `` as the medical school for this area we think we should be doing whatever we can to support local services while maintaining student learning . we are sure you will want to be part of our collective effort at this time of national crisis , '' he said in the email , sent last week . he added that he had already contacted the medical director at his own trust and at the shrewsbury and telford hospital nhs trust `` to ask them to let us know if there 's anything we can do to help '' . ",
        "hassell told students : `` do volunteer to help in any way possible , providing it 's within your competence . this applies to students in hospitals and in gp '' . on 4 january , two days after the seriousness of the winter crisis led nhs bosses to cancel tens of thousands of operations , medical undergraduates at liverpool university received a similar email . it told them `` the nhs is currently facing unprecedented pressures , particularly in the emergency departments and acute wards '' , adding : `` during this difficult time it is likely placements may ask student doctors to assist in the acute areas where there is most pressure . '' ",
        "the bma said the use of students this way was extremely worrying . `` not only would this be exploitation of students who may be reluctant to say no , but it raises concerns over patient safety if those working on the frontline are asked to work beyond clinical competence '' , said harrison carter , the co-chair of its medical students committee . `` while the government insists the nhs was better prepared than ever before for winter , this shows hospitals resorting to desperate measures to cope with a system struggling with increased demand and lack of staff and resources . '' ",
        "dr nick scriven , the president of the society for acute medicine , said the deployment of medical students raised major concerns . `` these students would need close supervision from already pushed and stressed acute ward doctors so there might not be a massive benefit in savings . of course in the ` war zones ' some of our units are at present there could be no guarantee they get the supervision they require to practise safely , which is a safety concern , '' he said . `` i have other concerns . for example , who covers them if they make an error -- the nhs , their university or no one ? ",
        "what pressure is being applied by desperate trusts and how are universities protecting them ? how are they being introduced to patients ? '' he asked . `` it definitely hides issues with staffing gaps in wards . '' the nhs has come under the most intense pressure for years this winter , with many hospitals descending into chaos , and doctors describing them as like warzones , as they have struggled to care properly for the increased numbers of patients that the cold weather brings . last week , doctors running 68 a&e wards said patients were dying prematurely in corridors , as nhs figures showed the percentage of patients treated within four hours at hospital-based a&e units in england fell last month to its lowest-ever level . ",
        "what are your experiences of the nhs this winter ? we will be monitoring the situation in hospitals over the next few months and want to hear your experiences of the nhs this winter . we are keen to hear from healthcare professionals as well as patients about the situation . have operations been cancelled ? has pressure led to certain wards being closed ? how are staff coping ? help us document what is going on across the uk . more than 90,000 patients have been stuck in ambulances outside a&e units during the past six weeks in england , nhs bosses have cancelled tens of thousands of operations to free up beds and staff , while ambulances ' inability to reach patients quickly enough has been blamed for patients dying and suffering prolonged pain . ",
        "theresa may has been forced to apologise , but she has been criticised for downplaying the extent of the crisis . dr john oxtoby , medical director at the uhnm trust -- which is under some of the most intense pressure in the nhs -- said it would be glad to receive help from keele undergraduates . `` given the current severe and sustained pressures within our hospitals , we welcome the fact that the university has now written to all clinical students asking them to consider volunteering , '' he said . `` it is important to be clear that ... medical students will not be asked to do anything beyond their competence , '' oxtoby added . ",
        "does the uk have enough doctors and nurses ? the uk has fewer doctors and nurses than many other comparable countries both in europe and worldwide . according to the organisation for economic co-operation and development , britain comes 24th in a league table of 34 member countries in terms of the number of doctors they have relative to their populations . greece , austria and norway have the most ; the three countries with proportionately the fewest medics are turkey , chile and mexico . jeremy hunt , the health secretary , regularly points out that the nhs in england has more doctors and nurses than when the conservatives came to power in 2010 . ",
        "that is true , although there are now fewer district nurses , mental health nurses and other types of health professionals . nhs unions and health thinktanks point out that rises in nhs staff 's workloads have outstripped the increases in overall staff numbers . hospital bosses say that understaffing is now their number one problem , even ahead of lack of money and pressure to meet exacting nhs-wide performance targets . hunt has recently acknowledged that , and health education england , the nhs 's staffing and training agency , last month published a workforce strategy intended to tackle the problem . ",
        "a spokesperson for nhs england said : `` there have been no - instructions for medical students to act in any clinical professional roles and they do not work as doctors . senior medical students have always worked alongside doctors and in clinical teams as part of their apprenticeship experience in all parts of the nhs . '' the guardian can also reveal that specialist nurses are being diverted from looking after patients with dementia to help on general wards , in another sign of how workforce gaps are compounding the nhs 's efforts to give patients proper care this winter . ",
        "evidence collected by the royal college of nursing shows nurses skilled in caring for patients suffering acute pain or who have a major wound are also plugging gaps elsewhere . this article originally appeared on the guardian .   "
