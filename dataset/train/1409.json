        "by dillon thomaslakewood , colo. . -- several west metro fire department dive team members have been called heroes by locals , after they took time out of their sunday to rescue a deer . the deer fell through the ice at main reservoir in lakewood , during the state 's heaviest single-day snowstorm in more than one year . dominik von pichl , who lives nearby , was walking around the lake with his wife , and their dog , when the rescue took place . dominik von pichl `` someone shouted ` there 's a deer stuck in the frozen water , ' '' von pichl said . ",
        "that 's when he used his cellphone to record the rescue , as a dive team from west metro fire station 8 responded . `` was just so exhausted . it was kind of heartbreaking to look at it . you could tell it was so weak , '' von pichl said . joseph spencer , a firefighter , told cbs4 's dillon thomas he had to break a path through the ice , before he could reach the deer . `` the ice was super-soft . it did n't support any of my weight , '' spencer said . ",
        "joseph spencer spencer used a dog catching pole to hook the deer 's horns . `` was not at all aggressive . he was very much wanting to get out , '' spencer said . though he was seemingly out of energy at first , spencer said the deer had a new drive once he saw the path spencer created . `` the poor deer 's legs were so weak , though , '' von pichl said . `` he could hardly stand up . '' von pichl applauded the team for showing up to help wildlife . `` if the animal did n't get the help , he definitely would have passed in the water there , '' he said . ",
        "the deer was covered with blankets provided by residents , once it was brought to shore . animal control then placed the deer in their vehicle for a time to warm it up . crews rescue deer from frozen reservoir in lakewood . west metro said they used the rescue as a chance to execute an ice rescue , which they had recently been practicing . firefighters said the rescue would have been set aside , in the case of an emergency involving a human . spencer said the dive team also wanted to pull the deer from the iced-over lake , before residents , without training , attempted to do it themselves .
