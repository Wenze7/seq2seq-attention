        "howe : defoe can give us a liftafc bournemouth manager eddie howe praised striker jermain defoe after he scored his 200th and 201st league goals of his career on saturday against crystal palace . defoe made the move to the south coast over the summer on a free transfer from sunderland . but due to a few injuries he has failed thus far , to establish himself as a regular starter in afc bournemouth 's first choice xi . instead he has had to battle for his place alongside joshua king , callum wilson and benik afobe . his first goal since his move was the winner against brighton & hove albion back in september , which had nudged him to 199 league goals .

        "against crystal palace on saturday , defoe got himself past the 200 milestone with two excellent finishes , the second a potential goal of the season candidate . howe told afcb . co. uk ... they were two good finishes , the first one was not as easy as he made it seem . they were two totally different goals and i ` m really pleased . he had no right to score the second at the angle he was , but that just shows the unique talent of jermain . hopefully it ` s a start for him , he had a few niggles early on in the season so he was setback a little .
