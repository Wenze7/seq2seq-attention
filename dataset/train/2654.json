        "ri se-gwang winning gold for north korea in the vault at the 2016 olympics in rio de janeirofor all the buzz and political intrigue , north korea 's participation at next month 's winter olympics in pyeongchang will live up to the old saying : `` it 's the taking part that counts '' . their representation at the games is still to be confirmed , but may be limited to two figure skaters . perhaps surprisingly , there are sports north korea is pretty good at and in some cases even dominates . take the summer olympics . they have won far more medals than bigger countries like india and nigeria - 54 in total . ",
        "most of their olympic glory has come in weightlifting and their athletes hold three world and two olympic records . at the last summer games in rio de janeiro in 2016 , they won seven medals , including two golds , putting them about halfway up the table . ri kyong-hyang playing in white for north korea against south korea at the kim il-sung stadium in april 2017north korea 's women 's football team is ranked 11th in the world by fifa . and although they were surprisingly knocked out of qualifying for the 2019 world cup , they won the east asia football federation championship in december last year . ",
        "that success followed winning the under-20s world cup in 2016 . the team 's reputation had taken a hit in 2011 after five players tested positive for banned substances . while the men 's football team has only taken part in two world cups , and is ranked a lowly 126th , they are fondly remembered for a good performance at the 1966 finals in england , reaching the quarter finals . they put in another good display against brazil at the 2010 tournament , narrowly losing 2-1 , but they also slumped to a 7-0 defeat by portugal . ",
        "in their most recent fixture , north korea drew 1-1 with china under the stewardship of their norwegian manager jorn andersen . schoolchildren are encouraged to take part in sporting competitions like this tug of war in pyongyangnorth korea is expected to send a taekwondo demonstration team to the winter olympics and that is not a surprise because it 's a sport where they dominate . well , at least one branch of it . unfortunately it 's not the branch chosen by the olympics , or by south korea , but a version under rules governed by the international taekwon-do federation . ",
        "at a recent major international competition held in pyongyang , north korea won 22 gold medals and the next best performing country was russia , with seven . north korea have invested heavily in the sport and built two `` majestic '' taekwondo facilities , says long-time itf member and taekwondo historian george vitale . a north korean taekwondo demonstration team are said to be performing at next month 's winter olympicshow do they do it ? for taekwondo and other sports , the north korean government has a system for identifying sporting talent at an early age . time and money is spent on turning these youngsters into proper athletes and selected children attend special sports schools . ",
        "udo merkel , an expert on sport in north korea who has visited the facilities there , says despite the general levels of poverty , top-level athletes train in impressive , modern facilities . most ordinary north koreans take part in some sporting or physical activity , which is common in communist countries . competitions are organised through the military , state organisations or labour unions . in the 1980s , the central government launched public campaigns to train people in defence and combat sports like boxing , taekwondo and rifle marksmanship . the regime thrives , says michael madden , founder of the website nk leadership watch , when it keeps the population busy with organised activity .
