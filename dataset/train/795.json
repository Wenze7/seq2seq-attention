        "local hotshot to train with sky bluesstriker ben stephens of stratford town is to spend time training with coventry city according to his club . the forward has also caught the eye of ipswich town . stratford manager carl adams told his club 's official website that : ` whilst we wish to retain our talent at stratford we will not stand in the way when we receive the right opportunities for our players thus we are pleased that ben is being given these opportunities with the latest being at coventry . ` whatever the outcome , i feel city should always be looking locally for talent that could make it in the professional game and that any player catching the eye for the warwickshire clubs should be handed such an opportunity as a matter of course . ",
        "while stephens may be one for the longer-term , it is the january pursuit of an established forward that is occupying mark robins mind . the coventry telegraph suggests that craig davies of oldham athletic has been a target but that the 32-year-old does n't fancy the drop into league two .
