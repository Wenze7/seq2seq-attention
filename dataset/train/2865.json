        "the monster hunter series is poised to make its western pc debut with monster hunter : world next year , which is something steven and austin seem pretty pleased about . last week , we learned that capcom plans to add new beasts over time via free updates , and now it appears its core story campaign will last somewhere in the vicinity of 40-50 hours . speaking to german publication mein-mmo . de , monster hunter : world 's director yuya tokuda suggests 40-50 hours is about right for the game 's story mode , however this will ultimately depend on the individual player 's approach . ",
        "`` i guess it will take about 40 to 50 hours , depending on the type of player , to complete the story , '' says tokuda . `` but it would not be a monster hunter game if it had no content that you could enjoy in the back . players can continue to forge and upgrade their favorite weapons and armor after the story is over . `` as reported by sam horti yesterday , one such extracurricular activity that awaits players is feline companion customisation . that looks something like this : elsewhere , tokuda explains how the game 's design was influenced by real world locations , which members of his team visited in person . ",
        "`` a group of designers visited different areas in australia , including tasmania . that has had a great influence , '' tokuda explains . `` the background designers used the areas of australia as inspiration for the plants in the ancient forest and the ant hills in the wilderness wastes . `` the designer , who was responsible for adding plants and rocks to the maps ... said that it was a huge difference to see how the vegetation grows and interacts with the environment rather than just looking at it in photos . `` monster hunter : world is without a concrete launch date on pc , however is expected at some point in the first half of next year . ",
        "in the meantime , here 's six things monster hunter : world needs to be a success on pc , and , equally , what we want to see in monster hunter : world on pc when it eventually lands .   "
