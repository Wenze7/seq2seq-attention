        "no one would argue that it 's been a rough hurricane season this year , with the south enduring the full brunt of destruction from two catastrophic storms . just as texans were slowly starting to pick up the pieces left behind in the lone star state by hurricane harvey , hurricane irma 's forceful winds and rain pelted certain parts of florida . which explains why many of the southerners affected by these two storms have the same wish on their christmas list this year : to return to a sense of normalcy . well , one alabama woman is stepping into santa 's black leather boots to fulfill the holiday wishes of those who lost everything this year , particularly those in texas still reeling from harvey 's devastating blow . ",
        "courtney adams , of auburn , alabama , turned around what would have otherwise been a disastrous holiday season for almost 200 families . how 'd she do it ? facebook . how she continues to do it months later ? the willingness of donors and other caring citizens who were moved to help after those heartbreaking images of people wading through flood water flashed across their tv screens . adams , 33 , is originally from kingwood , texas , and was compelled to start a holiday adoption group on facebook called holidays for harvey . the group 's aim was to match families inthe houston area to donors and `` adoptees '' across the country . ",
        "`` i sat down and created a group on facebook and i just started sharing it , '' said the mother of three . `` people started joining and asking for help , and people started offering to help and give back . '' some of the many ways volunteers give back is by purchasing christmas trees , gifts , or gift cards for those families in need , in hopes that they can have something to look forward to unwrapping on christmas morning . this also takes the added pressure off of parents who are saving towards a new home or who have exhausted their funds in rebuilding . ",
        "according to yahoo , adams , along with two of her friends from auburn , have assisted 188 families in the houston area , including 620 kids and 1,045 family members . for her part , adams is just happy that a simple concept has helped hundreds of people get back on their feet . `` i wanted the families to know that we do love you guys , '' she said . `` we know you 're still out there and that the rebuilding process has n't even begun for some . they 're still trying to find normalcy and christmas was just my foot in the door to get that . '' ",
        "but it 's not necessarily about the gifts as much as it is the sense of community the group provides . and the one gift she 's happy this group can give is the one that ca n't be wrapped in shiny , festive paper yet it 's the most valuable : the gift of love and support . `` to see the families that are supported and to hear how something so simple can bring so much to them , it 's just a good reminder that less is more , '' explained adams . `` it 's all about the relationships we make as opposed to the stuff we think we need to make us happy .
