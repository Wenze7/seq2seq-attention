        "it 's shaping up to be another interesting christmas for the baldwin family . stephen baldwin is predicting that older brother alec baldwin -- impersonator and vocal critic of donald trump -- will be voting to reelect the president . stephen , an avid trump supporter , told the hollywood reporter he believes his brother will be voting for trump after the actor receives `` this new tax cut '' from the gop tax bill . `` i 'm calling it now : with the amount of money alec is going to make with this new tax cut , i bet he votes for trump for re-election . ",
        "just saying ! '' the 51-year-old actor said . but stephen , 51 , may just have to text alec , 59 , his predicition , because he also revealed he has n't spoken to his brother , infamous for his impersonation of the president on `` saturday night live , '' since the surprise 2016 results came in . `` i ca n't get into it . i have n't spoken to since the election . that 's the truth , '' stephen said when asked about his brother 's trump impression . `` that is by his choice . ",
        "we grew up in a dumb-jock , competitive , ` friday night lights ' kind of environment . '' stephen said he is `` absolutely '' still a supporter of trump because they are the `` same kind of guy . '' he added that he is n't worried about being a vocal supporter of the president when most people in hollywood criticize trump . `` i 'm a baldwin brother , and that sends fear into anyone 's heart , instantly , '' he said .
