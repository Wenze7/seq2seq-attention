        "latest weather statistics from echo expert phil morrishnovember was notable for two weather features in that it was both very dry and sunny . indeed it was the driest november in leicestershire since 2011 and the sunniest since 2013 . beginning with the rain , only 34 mm of rain was recorded in the entire month that is only half the usual total . it was also a very sunny month with 95 hours of sunshine being recorded which was 25 per cent higher than usual . november temperatures were very close to normal with afternoon temperatures being logged at 10c while night time temperatures were recorded at 4c . ",
        "there were three night time frosts . winds mainly came in from a mild south-westerly direction for the first 3 weeks then they veered to a north-westerly flow for the final week . they reached a peak of 43mphthe month began mild with the only really wet day occurring on the 3rd when 12 mm of rain fell . daytime temperatures for the first three weeks of the month remained mostly mild with the mildest day logged on the 22nd when 15c was recorded . that night also saw the warmest night of november with the temperatures just dropping to 12.8 . ",
        "the last week of the month did see a big change with northerly winds setting in on the 24th and these brought with them the first snow of the season with snow showers being recorded on the 25th and 30th but any accumulations were very small and soon melted away . the coldest night of the season was the 17th when -1.5 c was logged in mountsorrel . the computer models predicted the cold end to the month . may i wish you all a peaceful and happy christmas and a prosperous new year !
