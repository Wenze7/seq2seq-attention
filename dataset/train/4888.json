        "if you 've never heard of eve , i like to think of it as the oneplus of computers : by ditching middlemen , this 11-person startup found a way to build and sell premium computers at a significant discount . the difference is , the people in charge did n't draw up a list of specs and start churning out machines . instead , they left just about every important design and component decision to a coalition of over a thousand community members . when i first heard about the project earlier this year , i was skeptical -- how good can a crowd-sourced computer be when this many people are involved ? ",
        "well , it 's time for me to eat crow . though it 's not perfect , the eve v is a surprisingly worthy surface pro competitor , especially for a first-gen product . to really get a feel for what the eve v has to offer , we need to look at the available configurations . the most basic model costs $ 799 and pairs an intel core m3 chipset with a 128 gb ssd and 8 gb of ram . microsoft 's entry-level surface pro costs just as much and also has a core m3 cpu , but only ships with 4 gb of ram . ",
        "to further sweeten the deal , every eve v comes with an active pen and keyboard cover . in the case of the surface pro , extras like these add an extra $ 260 to the bottom line . the difference in value becomes more pronounced the more you spend . while the top-tier surface pro packs one of intel 's dual-core core i7-7660u chips , a fully tricked-out v uses a slightly slower core i7-7y75 . both machines come with 16 gb of ram and a 1 tb ssd , though , and while the v ca n't win in terms of sheer power , it 'll cost you a full $ 500 less than the highest-end surface pro . ",
        "for eve and its community , it 's all about getting more for less . the machine i 've been testing sits one notch below eve 's most premium offering , and the only difference is it ships with a 512 gb ssd . consider me impressed . the dark aluminum chassis has been a bit of a fingerprint magnet , but the build quality is reassuringly sturdy . the v 's body is a little heavier than you might expect since the community lobbied for a bigger battery , but it was never uncomfortable to lug around and slip into a backpack . ",
        "chris velazco/engadgeti also have the community to thank for the plethora of ports found : two full-size usb 3.0 connections , one usb 3.0 type c socket and a thunderbolt type c port , as well as a microsd slot for good measure . why the new surface pro still only has one usb port is beyond me , and i 'm glad eve took the path that it did -- it allowed me to hook up a mouse and full-size keyboard for office work and charge my android phone at the same time . the real star of the show is the display : a 12.3-inch igzo lcd screen with a resolution of 2,880 x 1,920 . ",
        "it 's one of the brightest i 've ever seen on a convertible machine , and even though a batch of defective screens caused a production delay , i think the longer wait time was worth it . text is crisp and colors pop compared to the surface pro . the bezels around the screen are a bit thicker than i 'd like , but considering the price , i do n't think they 're a big deal . chris velazco/engadgeti also appreciate the level of power packed into the v , even if it 's not quite as fast as some of its competitors . ",
        "my daily routine consists of a lot of writing , image editing , spotify sessions and youtube binges . those use cases do n't require the sort of horsepower that a u-series core i7 chip brings to the table and so i never felt like i was missing out . and , while the v is n't meant to be a full-on gaming machine , it manages to run titles like metal gear solid v and overwatch without too many hiccups . with the built-in 48wh battery , i 've been able to use the eve v for between 10 and 11 hours of work before needing a recharge . ",
        "your mileage will depend on your usage habits , but i appreciated being able to plop down and work nonstop before having to worry about plugging in . to be clear , that 's about an hour less runtime compared to the most recent surface pro . that said , the eve v 's battery life is still in line with other ultraportable machines we 've tested this year . if nothing else , it absolutely blows away my daily driver , and for that i 'm grateful . as you 'd expect from a small startup little experience building this kind of hardware , eve did n't get everything right . ",
        "the thing is , it 's sometimes difficult to figure out where the blame lies . consider the active pen included in the box -- it does n't support as many levels of pressure sensitivity as microsoft 's surface pen , and occasionally feels sluggish compared to the competition . it 's perfectly adequate for occasional note-taking , but i would n't trust it for much more beyond that . then again , this was a concession the eve community eventually decided on in order to keep costs down , and so i do n't imagine them complaining much about this . ",
        "there did n't seem to be as much conversation about the eve v 's speakers , and it shows : they get decently loud , but the audio is decidedly toothless . then there 's the keyboard , which i 'm generally fond of . after using a 2016 macbook pro , with its flat key switches , the eve keyboard 's key travel feels like a return to sanity . there are a few novel flourishes here , too , including a backspace key that says `` oops '' and the ability to toggle between seven different backlight colors for the keys . ",
        "the trackpad is a little small for my liking , but it gets the job done . the whole thing is coated in alcantara fabric , too , though it 's much plusher than the kind microsoft uses for its surface keyboards . it 's softer , which is nice , but the material also makes the keyboard more prone to catching crumbs , lint and dust . learn from my mistakes and do n't eat your lunch over it . chris velazco/engadgetultimately , it 's the keyboard 's most ambitious feature that disappoints the most . the keyboard itself is thicker than one of microsoft 's because there 's a battery and bluetooth module inside , allowing you to detach the keyboard from the v 's magnetic connector and peck out emails from a distance . ",
        "unfortunately , the setup process is more confusing than it should be , and i noticed some latency once i carried the keyboard more than a foot or so away from the machine . that is , when you can you get the connection to work at all . on a few occasions , i could n't get the keyboard to wake up after disconnecting it from the v , for reasons that remain unclear . in its current form the eve v might not be for you , and that 's understandable . the company behind it obviously did n't get everything right , and there are some features that i would 've preferred did n't make the cut because i did n't lobby for them in the design process . ",
        "and yet , after testing the v , i still find myself inexorably drawn to eve 's mission : the idea of a low-cost , premium machine designed by the masses for the masses . i do n't think the eve v 's missteps are due to bad community decisions -- they seem like the sort of shortcomings you 'd expect from a company that 's new to precision production . even now , eve 's devotees are trying to jointly design a desktop docking system to give the v extra ports and video outputs . at this point , my lingering concerns mostly lie with eve itself . ",
        "what remains to be seen is how well this young company will scale to meet the needs of its growing fan base . for now , though , eve has proven that design by community -- even really big ones -- can be fruitful when the people involved all care about building something special . here 's hoping eve and its fans can make the next one even better . this article originally appeared on engadget at .
