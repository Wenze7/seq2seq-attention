        "`` obamacare has been repealed in this bill , '' trump tells reporters on wednesday . president donald trump claimed victory for `` essentially '' repealing obamacare in the republican tax bill that cleared the house on wednesday . the bill eliminates a tax penalty for americans who do n't carry health insurance , a pillar of the affordable care act , while leaving the law 's other elements intact . insurers have warned that eliminating the requirement will cause them to raise premiums . healthy people will have less incentive to sign up for coverage , leaving insurers with a sicker pool of customers overall , the companies and many economists and health policy experts say . ",
        "`` the individual mandate is being repealed . that means obamacare is being repealed , '' trump told reporters at the white house on wednesday . `` we have essentially repealed obamacare . '' the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimated last month that repealing the individual mandate would lead to 13 million more uninsured in 2027 , and that premiums in the individual market would increase by about 10 percent . lifting the penalty saves the government $ 338 billion over the next decade , the cbo said , because some of those who go uninsured would have gotten subsidized coverage . ",
        "lawmakers used that savings to reduce taxes . removing the individual mandate does n't undo other essential elements of obamacare . the law still requires insurers to sell policies to sick people at the same prices as healthy people , and provides subsidies for low-income families to make health plans more affordable . trump also boasted that he successfully downplayed the provision to avoid media coverage of the change . `` we did n't want to bring it up . i told people specifically ` be quiet with the fake news media because i do n't want them talking too much about it , ' '' trump said . ",
        "`` but now that it 's approved i can say : the individual mandate on health care , where you had to pay not to have insurance -- think of that one , you pay not to have insurance -- the individual mandate has been repealed . '' trump said republicans will `` come up with something that will be much better '' to replace the mandate . republican legislation to replace much of the affordable care act failed earlier this year . the true importance of the mandate has been debated by economists and policymakers , and the cbo has said it is revising how it calculates the effect . ",
        "s&p global ratings suggested last month that rolling back the penalty would save less than expected , and increase the number of uninsured by only 3 million to 5 million . about 6.5 million people paid an average penalty of $ 470 for not having insurance in 2015 , according to irs data .
