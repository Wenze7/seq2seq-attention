        "china 's large-scale land reclamation around disputed reefs and shoals in the south china sea is `` moving ahead steadily '' , state media has reported , and is on track to use giant `` island-builders '' to transform even more of the region . beijing claims nearly all of the sea and has been turning reefs in the spratly and paracel chains into islands , installing military facilities and equipment in the area where it has conflicting claims with neighbors . `` the course of construction is moving ahead steadily and a series of striking results have been achieved , '' according to a report that appeared friday on haiwainet , a website under the communist party 's flagship newspaper the people 's daily . ",
        "the projects have `` completely changed the face of the south china sea 's islands and reefs '' , the report said . the aggressive campaign has been a source of contention with neighboring countries . china 's sweeping claims overlap with those of vietnam , the philippines , malaysia and brunei , as well as taiwan . during 2017 china built 290,000 square meters of facilities on south china sea reefs and islands , including underground storage , administrative buildings and large radar installations , the report said . `` to improve the livelihood and work conditions of people living on the islands , and strengthen the necessary military defenses of the south china sea within china 's sovereignty , china has rationally expanded the area of its islands and reefs , '' it said . ",
        "the sea is believed to hold vast oil and gas deposits and $ 5 trillion in annual trade passes through it . the report noted that with last month 's introduction of the new super-dredger tianjing , a `` magical island building machine '' , and other `` magical machines '' soon to come , `` the area of the south china sea 's islands and reefs will expand a step further '' . china is also building a floating nuclear power plant , the report said , to provide power for those living in the sansha city area . ",
        "sansha lies on woody island in the paracel chain -- which is also claimed by vietnam and taiwan -- and administers much of china 's claims in the south china sea . china established sansha in 2012 by unilaterally awarding it two million square kilometers of sea and declaring it the country 's largest city . earlier this month a us think-tank released new satellite images showing deployment of radar and other equipment on the disputed islands . the asia maritime transparency initiative said that over the course of 2017 , china had been advancing the next phase of development with construction of infrastructure to support air and naval bases , such as underground storage areas and large radar and sensor arrays . ",
        "`` we believe that some individuals are making a fuss about this . they 're trying to hype it up , '' said foreign ministry spokesman lu kang after the first report was published .   "
