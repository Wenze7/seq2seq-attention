        "the partnership will ensure that vulnerable refugees in greece benefit from legal assistance , strategic litigation , and advocacy to advance refugee rights . global jewish nonprofit organization hias and muslim humanitarian aid ngo the islamic relief usa announced on wednesday that they had formed a new partnership to expand legal services for the most vulnerable refugee populations in athens and lesbos . `` in 2015 , greece emerged as the most visible focal point of the largest global refugee crisis since world war ii , '' the groups said in a press release . more than a million refugees from syria , iraq and other countries in crisis passed through greece in 2015 and 2016 , with some 60,000 refugees having stayed there . ",
        "in 2017 , nearly 3,000 refugees arrived in greece each month , according to the groups . `` islamic relief usa is honored to be partnering with such an esteemed and effective organization like hias to protect refugees who are in great need of assistance , '' said irusa president anwar khan . `` our shared values have always been to help some of the most vulnerable populations around the world . with recent incidents of people not gaining access to essential services , and many them having their rights violated , we will work to put a stop to these disturbing trends and promote the legal rights of all refugees . ",
        "`` the partnership will ensure that vulnerable refugees in greece benefit from legal assistance , strategic litigation , and advocacy to advance refugee rights . the groups seek to help refugees navigate constantly changing asylum procedures , as well as limitations on movement and employment opportunities , lack of police protection , and inadequate medical and mental health services that are available to them . `` hias is incredibly appreciative of islamic relief usa 's partnership , '' said mark hetfield , president and ceo of hias . `` acting on the tenets of our faiths and historical experiences , hias and irusa are uniquely positioned to address together the mounting risks faced by refugees in greece , and potentially offer a valuable model for similar joint efforts . '' ",
        "hias first launched a program for refugees in lesbos in 2016 to offer direct , individual legal representation to refugees in greece . in 2017 , the team achieved a precedent-setting ruling recognizing the right of a syrian refugee and a syrian asylum seeker to legally marry . hias and irusa have been collaborating to advance refugee rights for several years . in june 2017 , irusa honored hias with its courage award . `` this powerful alliance between jews and muslims demonstrates our shared commitment to refugees , '' said hias board member sandra spinner . `` in this time of divisiveness , i am pleased that we have come together to address the critical needs of the refugees in greece .
