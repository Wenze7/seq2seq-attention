        "my january 31 , 2017 column in www . just-food . comby victor martino | 31 january 2017pepsico announced in december the launch of a quaker breakfast kit through chef ` dmeal kits have carved out a niche in the us but , victor martino , just-food ` snew stateside columnist , argues that is all they will hold in the country 's food market for the foreseeable future , for all the claims of the products having reinvented the dinner ritual and despite the interest from some major cpg brands . never underestimate the power of good public relations . ",
        "i do n't . case in point : the fledgling us meal-kit market . research firm packaged facts estimates the us meal-kit market 's value at about us$ 1.5 bn . while that 's enough annual revenue to not write-off the nascent meal-kit space - the first start-ups launched in 2012 - as a mere hobby , it is a fraction of total annual food sales in the us , which according to the usda economic research service was $ 5.2 trn in 2015 . packaged facts estimates the us meal-kit market will double to about $ 3bn annually in five years . ",
        "that will be positive news if it happens - but it is still hardly a significant enough share of the total us food market to make much of a significant difference . at $ 1.5 bn , the meal-kit market also does not warrant all the media attention it has been getting of late . but , never undervalue the effectiveness of good pr . the most recent and interesting development in the meal-kit space is the roll out of meal-kit products and services by big-name packaged foods brands like campbell soup co. . tyson foods , hershey , pepsico 's quaker and some others . ",
        "the big packaged foods brands are getting into the meal-kit space primarily to hedge their bets in the event the market takes off . the big cpg players , in my opinion , also are reacting to the oversize amount of media attention - most of it generated by well-paid pr firms in order to generate investment money and consumer demand for meal-kits the start-ups are getting . the primary benefit for big packaged foods brands entering the meal-kit market is as an adjunct to their overall brand marketing strategies . after all , potential meal-kit sales for a tyson foods , quaker or campbell soup in a $ 1.5 bn market are not going to amount to much in the grand scheme of things . ",
        "meanwhile , us start-up blue apron , which according to research firm 1010data generates more than three times the sales of its closest competitor in the meal-kit space , has just launched a 60-second commercial called , `` better food , from scratch . '' the spot positions its meal-kits not so much as a convenient alternative , the original positioning , but rather touts the fact blue apron has recently started working directly with farmers and small food producers to procure some of the ingredients for its meal kits . this repositioning suggests the convenience factor alone has not been enough for blue apron to build a profitable business on . ",
        "the meal-kit space will remain a small niche for the foreseeable future . it is nowhere near being the `` future of food '' as many pundits have suggested . in fact , starting this year , we should expect to see two key developments in the meal-kit startup space : outright failure among some of the smaller players , and consolidation ; bigger startups acquiring smaller ones . when it comes to the big brands , do not expect to see a whole lot of major activity from them in the meal-kit space this year . rather , expect to see more of a ` tinkering around the edges ' approach , which will primarily include launching a few new products and slightly expanding their respective programmes . ",
        "my suggestion is the major focus for big brands in the meal-kit space should be figuring out how to tie-in the meal-kit services with overall strategic brand marketing efforts . that 's where the best bang for the buck is right now . just-food columnist victor martino is a california-based strategic marketing and business development consultant , analyst , entrepreneur and writer , specialising in the food and grocery industry . victormartino415@gmail . com / www . twitter . com/nsfoodsmemo .
