        "news release/regulated information/inside informationstudy demonstrates test can add prognostic information on overall survivalearlier assessment of treatment response can help identify resistance soonerover 233,000 crpc patients under treatment globally each yearherstal , belgium and irvine , ca , january 18 , 2018 - mdxhealth sa , , an international healthcare company , developing and offering molecular diagnostic tests to personalize the diagnosis and treatment of urologic cancer , today announced promising research results with a new liquid biopsy test in development . data from this study , published in the prostate , january 12 , 2018 indicate that the test has the potential to help guide personalized treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer patients . ",
        "most patients with advanced prostate cancer will eventually develop crpc , which accounted for over 26,000 deaths in the us during 2016 alone . treatment options for crpc have improved , with a combination of chemotherapy , androgen receptor - targeted therapeutics , and radiopharmaceuticals now available , however mortality remains high . importantly , monitoring the patient 's response to treatment is usually evaluated 3-4 months after treatment is initiated , and remains largely dependent on psa measurements , bone scintigraphy and other imaging modalities . this delay in measuring therapeutic response could limit the opportunity to adjust the treatment regimen at an early stage , when there is the best chance for cure . ",
        "there are currently no biomarkers available to assess treatment response at an earlier stage . mdxhealth 's pcr-based , non-invasive blood test was developed to measure the hypermethylation levels of two biomarkers in plasma cell-free dna . the results of the forementioned prospective study , with 47 crpc patients and 30 controls , indicate that the baseline value of the biomarkers , prior to treatment , is prognostic for overall survival . in addition , the subsequent variations of biomarker levels during treatment could help identify non-responders , which may enable improved personalized treatment of crpc patients in the future . ",
        "prof. dr. jack schalken , principle investigator and research director , of radboud university medical center , department of urology , nijmegen , the netherlands , said : `` one of the major unmet needs in the treatment of patients with castrate resistant prostate cancer is to asses prognosis and response to systemic therapy . a quantitative test that can provide real-time insights into a patient 's therapeutic response , which may allow for early intervention with an alternative treatment regimen , could ultimately improve survival . `` dr. jan groen , ceo of mdxhealth , commented : `` given the severe mortality rate associated with crpc , understanding a patient 's prognosis and early response to the prescribed treatment regimen , is crititically important . ",
        "with an estimated 233,000 crpc patients undergoing treatment each year , the clinical need for a precision diagnostic test is quite significant . our test gives us the opportunity to engage with pharmaceutical companies to support their drug development programs and to monitor patients enrolled in their clinical trials . `` about mdxhealthmdxhealth is a multinational healthcare company , listed at the brussels , belgium stock exchange that provides actionable molecular diagnostic information to personalize the diagnosis and treatment of cancer . the company 's tests are based on proprietary genetic , epigenetic and other molecular technologies and assist physicians with the diagnosis of urologic cancers , prognosis of recurrence risk , and prediction of response to a specific therapy .

        "confirmmdx for prostate cancer helps urologists identify low-risk men who may forego an unnecessary repeat biopsy and high-risk men who may benefit from intervention . confirmmdx is the first epigenetic , and only tissue-based test in the 2016 nccn guidelines for early detection of prostate cancer and that addresses false negative biopsy concerns . confirmmdx has qualified for medicare reimbursement and covered by numerous private health insurance plans . selectmdx for prostate cancer is a proprietary urine-based , molecular diagnostic test that offers a non-invasive ` liquid biopsy ' method to assess a man 's risk for prostate cancer . ",
        "selectmdx helps identify men at increased risk of harboring aggressive , potentially lethal , prostate cancer who may benefit most from a prostate biopsy and earlier detection . the test helps to reduce the need for mri procedures and invasive prostate biopsies by up to 50 % , thereby reducing healthcare costs . the company 's european headquarters are in herstal , belgium , with laboratory operations in nijmegen , the netherlands , and us headquarters and laboratory operations based in irvine , california . for more information , visit mdxhealth . com and follow us on social media at : twitter .
