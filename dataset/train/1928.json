        "image : applewhen unexplained delays pushed apple 's smart speaker back from a 2017 debut , apple said it needed `` a little more time before it 's ready '' and promised an `` early 2018 '' release . now it seems apple is making good on its revised launch window , as the homepod will officially go on sale on february 9th . initially , the $ 350 smart speaker will be available in the us , uk , and australia , with pre-orders going up on friday , january 26th , before expanding to other countries later this spring , including germany and france . ",
        "when it was first unveiled last summer , the homepod 's main marketing advantage was its allegedly superior audio quality . the device features a large woofer and seven beam-forming tweeters arrayed 360 degrees around the homepod 's body . however , in the time since apple 's announcement , both amazon and google have released their own premium smart speakers with high quality audio , which puts apple in the awkward position of having to play catch-up . at launch , the homepod wo n't support multi-room audio , which could be a real bummer for people with dreams of using a homepod to control music throughout their home . ",
        "according to apple , that functionality will arrive sometime later this year as part of a free software update . that said , the homepod can perform most other traditional smart speaker duties , such as setting reminders , creating to-do lists , and controlling any home kit-compatible devices like smart lights or a thermostat .
