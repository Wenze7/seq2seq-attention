        "free agent right-hander jumbo diaz has signed a minor league contract with the marlins , per a report from sb nation 's chris cotillo . diaz elected free agency from the astros last november and had yet to find a landing place for the 2018 season . the club has not officially confirmed the signing . diaz , 33 , was claimed off waivers by the rays last march . he went 1-4 in 31 relief appearances and turned in a career-worst 5.70 era , 4.5 bb/9 and 8.4 so/9 in 30 innings . in july , the righty signed a minor league deal with the astros and found considerably more success with the club 's triple-a affiliate , producing a 2.92 era , 3.6 bb/9 and 8.0 so/9 in 12 1/3 innings . ",
        "the deal presumably comes with an invitation to major league spring training , where diaz will compete for a bullpen spot among the likes of fellow right-handers kyle barraclough , junichi tazawa , drew steckenrider , nick wittgren and brian ellington . according to mlb . com 's joe frisaro , the marlins are considering an eight-man bullpen again in 2018 as they look to bolster a questionable rotation . they ranked 23rd among all major league bullpens in 2017 with a collective 4.40 era and 2.0 fwar .
