        "the absence of cattle categories because of the mycoplasma bovis outbreak did little to dampen enthusiasm for saturday 's winton a&p show . winton a&p association president dawn kennedy said although the event was well supported , the crowds did seem to be slightly down on last year . `` the weather certainly played along as it was fabulous , but there were many competing events in the region , and people can only be in one place at a time , '' she said . regular visitors to the show would have noticed the absence of the usually popular cattle division . ",
        "kennedy said with the m bovis outbreak , it was just common sense to put the interests of the farmers and cattle first and cancel the cattle divisions of the show to prevent the disease from spreading . southland , winton and otago taieri a&p associations reacted to the outbreak by cancelling the cattle categories at their 2018 shows . the disease has been found on a southland farming operation owned by southern centre dairies ltd. . `` we did miss the cattle though , it felt a bit empty without them , '' kennedy said . the remaining categories were well supported though , with the equestrian events doing especially well . ",
        "`` the equestrians sections were all really well supported , and the jumping went on to 5.30 pm and with very good entries in that section we had a great day , '' kennedy said . the supreme animal prize was awarded to a southdown ram belonging to the robertson family , with kennedy saying the prize was well deserved as it was a very good exhibit . blair robertson said that the ram also took the top prize at the gore a&p show last year . `` we do n't really do a lot of showing but he is just a very good commercial ram . ",
        "he is very easy going and in good condition all year round , '' he said . the ram bred well in his first year , serving 200 ewes , with the family keeping three of his sons . robertson said they usually show at gore , but decided to bring some stock down to winton this year to support the show , and ended up walking away with the grand prize . the younger generation also had a great time at the show , with a range of activities to keep them entertained . `` the kids had a great time , and the petting zoo was a real hit - they had a great time with the piglets , puppies , cats and kittens , '' kennedy said . ",
        "one of the show 's signature events , the big dig , was also very popular , with children digging through piles of sawdust looking for tokens that could be redeemed for prizes . `` the big dig was a huge hit , the kid who won the top prize , a bike , was delighted , '' kennedy said .   "
