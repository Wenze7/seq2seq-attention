        "arsenal are set to miss out on the services of nacho monreal for the upcoming match with crystal palace , but this may be the hidden blessing we need . arsenal 's defensive woes are not hard to spot . whether it 's the back three or the back four , no combination has been consistent enough to invest confidence in . and , with only three true centerbacks to choose from the options are limited . and pretty damn old . but now , with monreal out , we may have an opportunity to address a problem we may not even have known we had -- that of playing monreal at centerback . ",
        "related story : 5 things learned against liverpooli was proven completely wrong by the spaniard , who has been one of our more consistent players thus far into the season . that said , though , there are two problems that consistently plague this defense . one is a lack of size and strength , neither of which monreal boasts in abundance . the other is a bit of over-aggressiveness that can leave the defense exposed to runs in behind . just like liverpool . monreal is a guilty part there as well . i 'm not saying that monreal is the source of our problems .

        "far from it . i 'm just saying that the old adage of `` if it is n't broke , do n't fix it , '' is n't always true . it 's more accurate to say `` if there is room for improvement , improve . `` more from pain in the arsenal arsenal : nacho monreal injury offers opportunity to revert to tradition3h ago arsenal : alexandre lacazette needs to establish his quality6h ago arsenal vs crystal palace : putting right the wrongs8h ago arsenal : Â£ 40 million nothing more than expected for alexis sanchez insurance10h ago arsenal : olivier giroud injury should , but wo n't , merit a reaction12h ago and arsenal can certainly improve in the defense , even if that improvement is replacing the one `` central '' defender that has been consistent . ",
        "since he has been so consistent , there has been no real chance to see what life would be like without him . but we 've been trying to many other combinations of defenders and nothing has worked that maybe it 's time to try something more extreme . and since arsene wenger is not one to take out an established veteran for no reason , this could be that nudge towards a potential fix to a broken defense . what form could that solution take ? well , that 's a great question . if we stick with the back four , then the options are limited . ",
        "laurent koscielny and shkodran mustafi are going to be the new partnership . it 's when you introduce the back three again that you get to explore some seriously exciting options . calum chambers . rob holding . two guys that have the world to prove and a career to build for . those are the kinds of guys that can revitalize a tired , old defense . but then again , we still have per mertesacker , so why am i hoping for exotic defensive solutions ? arsenal are set to miss out on the services of nacho monreal for the upcoming match with crystal palace , but this may be the hidden blessing we need .
