        "if you 're a regular sailor jerry drinker , there 's a good chance you 've been accidentally throwing out a collectible sticker every time you finish a bottle of the rum . the key is taking off the label . behind the traditional label of every bottle , the brand has placed a clear collectible sticker featuring the art of famous tattoo artist normal collins aka `` sailor jerry . '' roughly five or six different designs are in rotation at any given time , and they change things up fairly regularly , which makes the stickers pretty collectible . ",
        "you can see what sticker design is included in your bottle by looking through the back of the bottle before you buy it . the sticker looks like it 's just art printed on the back of the traditional label , but it 's actually a double-sided sticker . once you peel the label off , you can remove the tattoo art from the front label just like any other sticker . the background is clear so the tattoo itself will be the only thing that shows up wherever you decide to stick it .
