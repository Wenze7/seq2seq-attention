        "the lakers want to play fast and they want to run , so they were delighted by the way they played against the atlanta hawks for most of the first half sunday . at halftime of the lakers ' 132-113 win , l. a. had 28 fast-break points and the hawks had none . they finished the game with a 42-15 margin . `` our point guard , '' brandon ingram said when asked what allowed the success in transition . `` and then i think a lot of the other guys just pushed the pace . i think tonight we saw that we could run , we ran every chance we got . ",
        "i think the big guys did a good job of rebounding the basketball and outleting it to the point guard , and we just started our running game . '' in the six games the lakers played without point guard lonzo ball , their pace suffered more than anything else . it 's a major tenet of how lakers coach luke walton wants the team to play , and ball 's presence is a crucial part of it . when ball returned friday from the left-shoulder sprain , their pace began to show signs of improvement . against the hawks , they really reaped the benefits . ",
        "`` i think watching it you could see that we 're having a lot of fun when we play like that , '' ball said . `` it fits my game perfectly . i 've been playing like that my whole life so tonight was definitely a good one . '' second-unit dutymidway through the first quarter , ball asked for a break . it was only his second game since his return from his injury , so walton took him out for a breather . it fit with walton 's plan for ball that night anyway . he wanted to see ball have some time with the lakers ' second unit , which now includes ball 's fellow rookie and best friend on the team , kyle kuzma . ",
        "`` the two of them play really well together , '' walton said . `` he actually came up to me halfway through the first and asked for a sub . ... in the third it was the same thing . he looked tired he did n't ask for one but i called him over asked him how he felt he kind of gave me the head nod . '' ball said the breather helped . `` after that i was pretty cool , '' ball said . overcoming distractionsdistractions are a way of life for the lakers , so sunday 's brand of distraction did n't produce much of a new message from the lakers ' coaching staff to their players . ",
        "`` the message is : yes , we play in l. a. ; yes , we are one of the greatest sports organizations in the world ; yes , we have a very big fan base ; and yes , there 's a lot of distractions outside the game of basketball when you play in the city when you play with the history they have , '' walton said . `` ... we need to focus our energy and our minds on what we 're doing . that 's the message we send every day . `` do n't worry about what people on twitter are saying . ",
        "do n't worry about what this media outlet is saying , or that one or your agent . the people that matter to what we 're trying to do are all in our room . we have to be able to trust each other . we have each other 's backs and we work together . ''   "
