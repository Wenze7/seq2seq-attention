        "secret speedsters apparently also get served super-quick justice , as evidenced by the flash 's midseason premiere . rushed to trial with cecile defending him , barry was frankly steamrolled by prosecutor anton slater , all based on the evidence and opportunity we presumed going in . restraining order . harassment . knife . dna . motive ? pfft . even worse , we never saw cecile stage any kind of defense -- probably because no one thinks we want a superhero court trial longer than an episode , but come on . marlize testified that clifford went to the loft unaccompanied , so was his wheelchair found at the scene ? ",
        "no questioning of the timeline , seeing as devoe obviously died before barry could have discovered the body ? and again -- motive ? things got so bad , so quickly , that cecile urged barry to take the stand and reveal himself as the flash , but he refused . that is when iris -- after privately confronting marlize about the devoes ' deplorable duplicity -- decided to do whatever she was able to , on behalf of her own husband , and waltzed into the courtroom to out barry . barry , though , using some speedster trick that even he did n't comprehend , stopped iris mid-sentence and explained to her why his secret ca n't get out . ",
        "because the flash 's identity puts targets on loved ones , and they would all be on the run from then on , yada yada . iris saw his point and instead merely attested to the judge that her husband is ... innocent . which is nice . even ralph 's sneaked photos of marlize kissing `` dominic lanse '' hit a dead end , when devoe 's wife explained that she had her husband 's blessing to satisfy her unmet `` needs '' with this strapping young man they met at an als gala . which is also nice . ",
        "forty-two minute story , short : barry was found guilty of murder in the first , and at the end of a spiel by the judge that was pretty laughable in the way it painted the csi as `` inhumane , '' was sentenced to life without parole . but hey , he got put in his dad 's old cell . which is nice . before his sentencing , barry stole a moment with `` dominic '' / devoe , who assured his rival that `` all avenues '' would have led to his triumph . as for his grand plan , devoe found it `` humorous '' that barry thinks he could even comprehend it . ",
        "still , barry said that he will find a way out of his predicament , and when he does , he is coming after devoe , no matter whose meat suit he is wearing . what did you think of the flash 's murder trial ?   "
