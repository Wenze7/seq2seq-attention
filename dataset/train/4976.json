        "a very belated happy new year to you from the team at wynad clothing ! myself and hannah have spent the last 3 weeks at home in the uk visiting friends and family over christmas and new year . needless to say we 've stuffed ourselves with cheese , pies , all the gravy , and mulled ourselves healthily in the odd glass of wine or 10 . if you 're like us you 're probably reminiscing on all the different things that happened in 2017 and gazing apprehensively into the open void that is 2018 . as a cathartic exercise we thought we 'd share with you some of our highlights from last year along with some of the things we 've got planned for the year ahead . ",
        "what happened ? early on in 2017 we received the unbelievable news that a new charitable initiative from reward gateway called rg foundation would be supporting us with a grant to help us grow the business . at the time this news was welcomed with wide , disbelieving arms and it truly has allowed our business to continue operating . without rg foundation i 'm not sure if we 'd be here today . this grant allowed me and hannah to travel back to india and begin working on a new collection which will be released in the uk for the summer 2018 . ",
        "being based in wayanad again we decided to take much more time over developing our new designs , understanding our audience , thinking more about who we want to be as a business and ultimately what we wanted to communicate through our clothes . after some deep soul searching and a brief name change we started to assemble a wider team . our first contact was our designer . the amazingly talented arpitha rai . meeting up with arpitha in bangalore was a real highlight and that first 4 hour conversation soon evolved into a collection of 15 individual designs , a colour palette and collection of abstract patterns . ",
        "as our designs developed we scoured the internet for the right suppliers who could help us bring them to life . we shortlisted a load of different businesses we arranged meetings across india to meet with them face to face and see if they were right for us . without a doubt the highlight of the year was meeting so many new people and learning about some of the brilliant work that 's already happening in the fair trade/ethical fashion space . businesses like freeset global in kolkata who provide freedom opportunities to women previously trapped in the sex trade , jacobs well in bangalore who provide work and development opportunities to people from low socio-economic , inner city backgrounds and rcm organic who operate a fair trade accredited organic cotton mill and support a growing network of organic cotton farmers across the country . ",
        "the trip allowed us to learn more about every step in our supply chain and understand more about the value in working with the right businesses . our 6 month stint in india ended sharing cake and tea with the talented team at the jacobs well workshop in bangalore . our sample collection finished and packed for shipping to the uk ready for the next chapter to begin . oh and as a side note ... in august we adopted a kitten . her name 's dosa and she is the best ! what 's going to happen ? in short , we 've got plenty planned for 2018 . ",
        "to start with ; in january we have a photoshoot scheduled in sunny manchester . working with j'adore modelling agency , hannah has put together a small team who we feel will really be able to represent our brand well and make our clothes sing . i only hope the drizzle keeps away . once our photoshoot is complete we 'll be organising a crowdfunding campaign to begin at the start of march to help us get the wynad clothing brand out into the digital space and of course help us raise some more funds for future collections . you can be the first to find out about when our campaign goes live and get an early bird 20 % discount on our collection by subscribing to our mailing list here . ",
        "once the crowdfunding campaign is complete it 's time for us to launch our new online store and summer collection . we 're planning something a little special to coincide with fashion revolution week in april but that 's top secret for now . throughout the summer we 'll be working hard to get our brand out there and our clothes in front of as many people as possible . a mixture of working with the right people online , crowbarring our way into retail spaces and setting up our own pop-up stalls seem to be the favoured strategies at the moment . ",
        "then of course we 'll be working on new designs to expand our existing collection and the whole beautiful circle will be complete . seems so easy when you write it all down . glenn elliott , founder of reward gateway and rg foundation . absolute dude ! our abstract patterns in developmentone of the team at freeset global holding up one of our tshirt designsa well earned tea and cake break with the ladies of jacobs well in bangalore .
