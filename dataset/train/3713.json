        "do n't steal , do n't cheat , do unto others as you would have them do unto you ! do n't steal , be originalstealing has become all the rage . to my horror , i even saw an article that promoted stealing in this very publication -- and promptly blocked the person who wrote it . stealing and copying take many shapes but are never good , no matter how trendy they might be . what you see above , in the main picture of this post , is the ad i created when i launched my book on self-publishing . ",
        "and next to it is the ad that was published a couple days later right next to mine . now take a closer look at the two and tell me how would that make you feel if it happened to you . as you can see in the rankings below , my book did well . it had enough pre-orders to get all the way to the top in its category . as soon as that happened , however , here came the above mentioned ad -- starting with the exact same sentence , staring at me as a mocking copy of mine . ",
        "i see this as a direct result of the ` stealing ' craze -- steal and copy from those who seem to be doing well . that 's the kind of advice i see all over the place and it 's making me sick . could you please just stop doing that , for crying out loud ! why would you think that using the same ad copy would help any of us sell more books ? ! if anything it hurts both of our sales and makes us both look like idiots . tell me how is that creative , how is copying the work of others or what they do creative and leads to a better world ? ",
        "it does n't , it leads to a crappy world full of leeches that always take the easy road and can not come up with anything at least somewhat original . yet they call themselves ` creatives . ' it would be laughable if it were n't so annoying . so i changed the ad and will probably have to keep changing it lest this person decides to copy that too . and i set the price to the lowest possible , partly as a seasonal gesture and partly in response to what 's been done . ebook is now available for $ 0.99 and paperback for $ 5.99 because i 'd rather give my book away for the lowest possible price and earn pennies than willingly participate in that kind of competition . ",
        "the book was written to help fellow writers , so there , you can get it for a very small sum indeed so that i can help you even more . but do n't steal from me , have that much moral fiber to not do it . which brings me to the next issue . please do not print books instead of buying a paperbackthe paperback edition of my book is extremely affordable , it really is . and if you buy it , you get the ebook edition on amazon for free . by buying my work , you are not only giving me a symbolic sum in return but are also showing respect and appreciation for the benefits you are getting from using it . ",
        "it took me a whole lot of time and effort to learn what i have learned , so that i could write and publish it in the form of an easy to follow and well-organized manual that will save you a ton of frustration and hair-pulling moments i had to go through when i first self-published . would it be too much to ask to please buy this and not just take and print it out on your printer ? if you still do n't understand why would this matter when i earn peanuts with self-publishing anyway , here are a couple of additional reasons you might have failed to consider : with every purchase the book 's rank increases and thus makes it more visible to others who might also need and benefit from it . ",
        "if you bought it on amazon and then decide to leave a review , the ` verified purchase ' sign will show next to your review making it look more trustworthy and reliable . every purchase helps me get closer to just maybe earning enough to at least cover the cost of promotion -- so far i 'm in the red . last but not least , as human beings , we all have the need to receive some symbolic reward in return for our work . writer eat writer worldif you fail to do that , to show respect for the work of your fellow writers and steal from them in one form or another , you are damaging the writing community . ",
        "such deeds undermine the trust between fellow writers and with that their cooperation . they decrease the motivation of those who would otherwise be willing to help even more and make your life easier by publishing new books and posts you could then use on your journey . so please , show some respect . thank you ! here is the link to the book if you plan to self-publish and decide to buy it . my donors and patrons get my ebooks for free . if you prefer paperback , here 's the link to that too . available now at your favorite digital store !
