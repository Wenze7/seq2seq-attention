        "among the strategies used to internationalise a country , bringing the education system to european standards certainly is a profitable one on the short-term . twenty-five years ago , a bunch of students from lebanon arrived in a fresh out-of-soviet union lithuania , in the first attempt to build a medical school ready to welcome international students . at first , the minimum requirements to join the school were reasonably low , but to hit the european standards things changed year by year , until nowadays in which potential students have to pass a considered strict selection to meet those standards . ",
        "in 2016 lsmu , the lithuanian university of health sciences , celebrated the twenty-fifth year of its institution . an honourable guest was the israeli ambassador in lithuania , representing a country who provides a high percentage of the total amount of six hundred international students . the presence of this organisation on the territory brought , in almost three decades , a peculiar migration from middle-eastern countries towards the town of kaunas , second city in lietuva by population , which is considered more conservative compared to the already strongly globalised vilnius . the consequences on the local economy are huge , and started a process of gentrification in the city center . ",
        "the process itself is a proof of how naturally the scenario is mimicking the reality of other student cities in the twenty-first century , but it generates devastating news for the long-time inhabitants . the older generation , mostly russian speakers in terms of second language , have difficulties to adapt to the quickly changing landscape . if we focus on the area of the main squares and avenues , it 's clear that a bubble of coffee-houses and lounge bars , employing english speaking guys in their early-twenties , makes the audience feel like being in the center of europe . ",
        "but if we go outside of that bubble , we can see many problems emerging , starting from the language divide that makes hard even the most simple retail selling interaction with a local . and when it comes to real estate , the game gets even harder . the process of gentrification in modern western cities it 's the fastest way to change the face of a neighbourhood , with people relocating to cheapest areas , but still , we 're talking of a process which has it 's beginning and it 's end in the same reference system . ",
        "when we 're analysing an entire nation with a minimum wage around three hundred euros per month , a crucial point is the split between householders exploiting the situation and families struggling to keep up with price increase . other than this , the average prices for other services is still pretty low , if we exclude from the analysis the indoors heating . every factor hardly presents itself as a consistent problem from the migrating mass though , which makes the city every year more crowded . usually , between lithuania and the birth countries of the new incoming students , there 's still a deep difference in terms of average family income . ",
        "the financial inequality promotes a capital migration which would be positive if equally distributed . again , only the richest citizens and the higher educated few are getting this foreign money , cause the cash injection goes straight to private businesses and foundations , instead of social security networks to straighten up the welfare . another fundamental aspect is the integration . literally hundreds of young men and women from different countries are mixing together in the province of a baltic state supposedly distant from their hometowns . probably the education in their countries would be more expensive , even if here they 're paying thousands of euros each year for subscriptions and student fees . ",
        "just sitting in a cafeteria in the old town , you can hear around your head chats in several different languages , rumouring that international courses are easier than lithuanian ones , or that the administration is trying harder to level up the ranking of the atheneum . the newcomers experience difficulties in getting along with the locals , known for their characteristic post-soviet attitude , maybe fed by intolerance for the culture clash . one bright side of the medal resides in the fact that cultural mixing among people from war zones or former regimes is promoted by a lot of initiatives supported by universities . ",
        "all this massive mash-up let us spot a future distant from both an harmonious melting pot of youngsters poured in malls filled with brands , and a hundred percent homogeneous conservative society unsuitable for progress . the next goal for people in charge , according to what is presented to an external viewer now , will be mainly good advertising for the country aimed to welcome investors and ventures from abroad , more than trying to underlie the independence and the identity of a country letting every layer of the population partake to the change .
