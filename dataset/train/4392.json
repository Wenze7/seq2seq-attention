        "lufc christiansen - cup defeat is extra motivationleeds united head coach says the clash at ipswich town today is extra motivation after crashing out of the fa cup last weekend . leeds were knocked out of the fa cup at league two side newport county and leeds now have just the league to concentrate on for the remainder of the season as they look to finish in the top six in the championship . christiansen knows it will be a tough game at portman road today but he is looking to see a reaction from his side following the disappointment of last weekend . ",
        "`` we know how ipswich will play , it is always important to win a game , especially after going out of the fa cup how we did , '' christiansen told the leeds official website . `` it is extra motivation for the players to come out and show their worth in this game . ` we are expecting a tough match , like the game we had at home , but we have to go there with our ideas and try to take a good result . ` leeds , who have picked up just one point from their last two games , slipped out of the play-off places on friday night after sheffield united drew 0-0 with sheffield wednesday to climb above leeds in the table .
