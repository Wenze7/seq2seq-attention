        "from the family gatherings in the kitchen to the kooky nicknames and drama queen reactions to just about everything , `` moonstruck '' hits the italian-american personality out of the park . on the 30th anniversary of the film that brought cher , olympia dukakis and screenwriter john patrick shanley academy awards and producer/director norman jewison nominations , i -- a full-blooded italian from both sides of the family -- take a look at the italian-inspired details that make it a classic . dean martin `` moonstruck '' opens with the quintessential italian song sung by the quintessential italian crooner . ",
        "any song that pays tribute to pasta fazool and falling in love , and has the lyrics `` tippy-tippy-tay '' is ok by me . romance never diesa single red rose melts loretta 's pragmatic shroud , cosmos ' old-as-moses papa finds wonder in `` la bella luna , '' and rita and raymond get a little frisky late into the night . ai n't love grand ? everyone has a nicknamesuffice it to say , i can pretty much guarantee that the restaurant maitre d was n't born with the name `` bobo . '' but it 's typical for italian families to have nicknames for their kin . ",
        "in my family , we have miggy , measles , puco , dillinger , ferly , dee dee and patty , whose real name was mary . and the list goes on . superstitiousloretta was reluctant to lost her heart to someone because she thought she had back luck ; johnny feared his mother would die if he got married ; and let 's not forget that old woman at the airport who `` put a curse on that plane to explode . '' then again , there 's a darn good chance that an italian on that plane was saying a rosary to prevent that from happening . ",
        "overly dramaticfrom ronnie screaming , `` bring me the big knife , i 'm gon na cut my throat ! '' to cosmo saying he ca n't sleep anymore because `` it 's too much like death , '' to the vikki carr classic italian song `` it must be him '' in which she sings , `` oh dear god , it must be him or i shall die '' when the phone rings . time to switch to decaf . serious talks happen in the kitchenyou have problem ? let 's sit down and talk ... in the kitchen . ",
        "it 's the hub for all conversations in an italian family . maybe because it 's neutral territory , it 's usually brightly lit and filled with good memories and smells , or maybe it 's because it 's just closer to the food , which all italians love . whatever the case , all problems that enter the kitchen seem to disappear before exiting it . sort of the way diet aspirations do . sugar cube in the champagnewhy make an already sweet potent potable even sweeter ? it 's an old italian wives tale that the devil never wants to see you happy , and since champagne `` makes you happy , '' dropping a sugar cube in keeps the devil away . ",
        "seriously , i 'm not making that up . talking with handstie our hands to our sides and all you 'd hear us say is `` uh ... um ... er ... huh . '' if the hands are n't moving , neither are the vocal cords . a little cynicalwhen rose asks loretta if she loves johnny and loretta says no , the wise mama says , `` good . when you love them they drive you crazy because they know they can . '' italians may be romantic , but they 're also rather suspicious of anything that seems too good to be true . ",
        "you do n't want to make them madfor the most part , italian-americans are lovable and would give you the shirt off their back . on the other hand , they 've got memories like elephants and you do not want to mess with them . case in point : when rose 's father-in-law feeds his dogs table scraps , she tells him , `` old man , you give those dogs another piece of my food and i 'm gon na kick you 'til you 're dead ! '' message received . they tell it like it isthere 's no careful hedging around words ; if it 's in an italian 's head , it comes out of their mouth . ",
        "after johnny answered the question that had been plaguing her and said that men want more than one woman because they fear death , rose told her husband , `` no matter what you do , you 're gon na die , just like everybody else . '' cosmo was perplexed , but it was a laugh-out-loud moment . egg in a holeaka `` egg in the basket , '' `` egg with a hat , '' `` one-eyed jack , '' `` toad in the hole '' and `` uova fritte nel pane , '' this dish of a slice of bread with an egg in its cut-out center and topped with roasted peppers is a breakfast favorite in italian homes .

        "why ? heck if i know . but it sure was in my house growing up . operaif you were raised in an italian-america house , chances are you were exposed to your share of opera . for many of those that were , it is an artform that reaches into your soul and tugs at your heart . for others , it 's just music that 's impossible to sing along to . the pinchif you 've never gotten an italian pinch , consider yourself lucky because it leaves a nasty mark . it is the grabbing of a small amount of skin and simultaneously pulling and twisting .
