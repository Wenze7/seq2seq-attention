        "aaron rodgers and the green bay packers found out a lot about themselves during the 2017 nfl season . unfortunately , the things that they found out were not good things . first and foremost , the packers found out that they are nothing without their franchise quarterback under center . after starting the season off 4-1 , the packers missed the playoffs with brett hundley leading the way . it was a sobering season for the packers , to say the least , and they have made major changes since the season ended . green bay moved on from defensive coordinator dom capers and brought in a new offensive coordinator as well . ",
        "joe philbin is back and mike pettine will be trying to get the packers ' defense back on track . ted thompson also stepped aside from his general managing duties , while brian gutekunst was hired to replace him . looking ahead at the upcoming offseason , the packers ' approach is expected to be much different than it has been in years past . according to a report from packers news , gutekunst is expected to be much more aggressive in free agency than thompson was . green bay also holds the no . 14 overall pick in the 2018 nfl draft , which is higher than they usually pick . ",
        "all of that being said , what bold predictions can be made for the packers this offseason ? green bay will sign jimmy graham . let 's start it off with a bang . green bay has a need at the tight end position and jimmy graham seems like a perfect fit . giving rodgers a target like graham would round out the packers ' offense perfectly and they will spend some money to make it happen . a veteran cornerback will be signed . perhaps the biggest need on the defensive side of the football is at the cornerback position . ",
        "green bay has been known to try to fill their needs through the draft , but gutekunst will look to free agency . trumaine johnson is the best corner on the market , but even if they do n't sign him , green bay will be looking to bring a veteran corner in . a trade will be made during the draft . green bay has a lot to work with this offseason , including the no . 14 overall pick in the nfl draft . they will be looking to make a move , whether that be moving up or down to acquire more picks . ",
        "gutekunst has a great opportunity to trade down to gather more picks in the first three rounds and for the future . aaron rodgers will sign a massive extension .   "
