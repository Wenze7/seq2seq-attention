        "john sorensen-jolink did n't start as a furniture designer . in fact , being one `` freaked him out '' for a time . but today , he lives in a brooklyn home that is filled with many pieces he created -- and , in fact , it acts as something of a design laboratory . sorensen-jolink started his career as a modern dancer . `` for 10 years i was a professional dancer and i traveled all over the world , '' he says . `` at a certain point , i started craving a sense of home and a more tangible creative practice -- something less ethereal that does n't disappear after an evening performance . '' ",
        "he took a woodworking class while still dancing regularly , and a new career was born . when the class was over , he apprenticed with the teacher and began creating his own line . today , through his company coil + drift , he produces furniture , lighting , and some accessories . the link between them is a three dimensional quality and a sense of movement . `` two years into it , i started freaking out about not being a trained designer , '' he says . `` then i realized that , by being a dancer , i had been training . ",
        "intuitively , i had a sense of movement , form , and an understanding of space that i brought to my pieces . '' he brought that sense to his apartment in brooklyn 's fort greene neighborhood . he and his husband stumbled across the place on their way to view another apartment and , once they saw it , there was no question they 'd found their new home . `` it 's a unit on the ground level of the owners ' townhouse , '' sorensen-jolink . `` it 's an old building , and they did a great job of preserving the original details . '' ",
        "those details include a glowing hardwood floor , a large fireplace with rustic details , and windows endowed with scrolling ironwork and shutters that fold into the walls like pocket doors . with his furniture business well underway , sorensen-jolink began using the place as space to experiment with and try out new pieces . `` i 'm always using it as a laboratory , and it continually shifts as i bring new pieces in and out , '' he says . `` i 'll often bring a piece home and live with it before adding it to the collection . '' ",
        "in the living room alone , there 's his soren chair , a dusk coffee table and side table , a june mirror and a wall-mounted hover shelving unit . that 's not to say everything here is made by sorensen-jolink . `` we have a number of vintage items , '' he says . `` if we need something i do n't make , i 'm looking for something that has a lot of style and is very well made . in many cases , that 's a piece of vintage furniture . '' case in point : the antique candlestick by the fireplace and the metal-and-leather chair designed by anton lorenz for thonet . ",
        "the kitchen , which is open to the living room , came with simple , white cabinetry . sorensen-jolink gave it a midcentury modern look that jives with his creations by adding a vintage mcm table and marcel breuer chairs . an international flair comes from the numerous statues that decorate the space . `` we have put a ban on new statues entering the house , but it 's a rule we constantly break , '' says sorensen-jolink . `` my husband came into the relationship with a number of folkloric masks and statues from all over the world . ",
        "and , in a few cases when we 've traveled together , we found ourselves buying a new suitcase to transport new discoveries . '' the bedroom is furnished in a similar handmade-meets-vintage mix . the classic heywood wakefield dresser , eames chair , and flea-market find reading lamps live beside another coil + drift shelving unit and wooden chair . brand new pieces , such as a gray-velvet sofa from article in the living room and a new helix mattress in the bedroom round out the mix . but this designer is n't limited by the built realm , for a complete experience he delves into the worlds of nature and scent . ",
        "first , the natural element : `` i just do n't feel that any home is complete without plants . it gives every interior a sense of life , '' sorensen-jolink says . `` maybe it 's because i was raised in the lush , green environment of portland , oregon . '' in his home , plants populate the areas near the windows . next , the more intangible element of scent : `` scent is so under-appreciated when it comes to creating a feeling . when i was traveling a lot , i would always carry a small candle with me . ",
        "unpacking it and lighting it gave the hotel rooms i stayed in a sense of home , '' he says . `` now , i make a candle that has a light scent of fig and sandalwood . because i burn it often , it 's a scent i associate with home . '' it was the need for a sense of home that launched sorensen-jolink 's furniture design career , and it is a need that has been fulfilled by this apartment . `` i 've been able to express my design sense here , '' he says . ",
        "`` it feels comfortable and comforting to me . ''   "
