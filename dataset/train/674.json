        "here 's how you can give even more traction to your top tweets . by dante licona -- who social media manageras fellow social media managers experience every day , sometimes we know when a tweet will perform well . and many times we just get a bit lucky . quite often we scratch our heads to find out why some messages that had everything needed to succeed simply under performed . last month , we tweeted one of who 's top tweets of 2017 , achieving some 8.7 k retweets . that message alone was seen some 6.3 million times ! ",
        "that 's quite a lot considering that a who tweet is seen on average 100k times . in short : this particular message seriously exceeded our expectations ! 👇🏽 that this message was effective , was not entirely a coincidence . in fact , it is the result of adjusting , adapting and combining tactics . here 's a play-by-play , detailed analysis of the evolution of a tweet -- and how we got there . first stagethe first stage goes back to world immunization week 2015 . while drafting the message , i crafted a list breaking the lines . ",
        "back then , it performed well in terms of retweets , but this was just the beginning . as you might remember , back in 2015 , images used 23 characters out of the classic 140 limit . that 's why the number of diseases mentioned in the tweet had to be selective . second stagethe following year , during world immunization week 2016 , i decided to elaborate a bit more on the number of vaccine preventable diseases featured in the message , sacrificing the hashtag and the image . it was a risky text-only move , but it paid off -- even without a visual ! ",
        "third stageknowing this message was a proven success , during world immunization week in april 2017 , i simply replicated the exact same message we used the previous year , with nice results . fourth stagea couple of months later in july , i realized we were missing out -- that tweet could be improved . twitter had stopped counting images as part of the character limit . why did n't i include a visual ? my mistake -- a missed opportunity , for sure . so i tried again ... with mixed results . yes , the message got a good number of retweets , but less than the text-only tweet from april 2017 . ",
        "fifth and last stage of evolutionafter detecting a good timing opportunity , i decided to use the full power of our tweet . let me explain . if you follow who on twitter , you might have noticed that we tweet in threads . that 's our way of telling stories . in-house , we call this style the `` flagship tweet '' strategy . in a nutshell , this style empowers your key message , and every time a new tweet is added to a thread , some twitter users see again the first message in the series . ",
        "this is essential for us , since we want to cover all time-zones worldwide with our key message . for the success of this particular tweet , this was a critical factor . here it is again 👇🏽 recommendations for maximizing your top tweetsfrom this experience , i came up with a short list that might be useful for optimizing your best content . check your archive . some of your top tweets from the past can perform even better in today 's environment . twitter evolves and is a very different place from what it used to be even a couple of months ago . ",
        "check your analytics dashboard . you can make the most out of it ! dare to tweet threads . as i briefly explained before , tweeting threads is totally worth it . you can boost your impressions immediately by 3x if you master the technique . there are a couple of fine details needed for creating a pleasant user experience , but the results are worth the effort . the only downside ? you ca n't schedule them . for us is not a problem , because who never schedules tweets . 280 characters . i hear you . it can get really annoying . ",
        "but if you are going to use them , make them count . the hashtag . #vaccineswork is quite popular with vaccination champions , and clear enough for anyone to understand it . get the timing right . yes -- we wanted to tweet it as soon as # 280characters was trending . but our patience paid off when conversations around immunisation were happening . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- questions ? feedback ? i would love to hear from you .
