        "catalonia 's parliament meets for the first time on wednesday since it was dissolved following a failed attempt to break from spain -- but without sacked regional leader carles puigdemont who is in self-imposed exile in belgium . separatist parties won regional elections on december 21 called by prime minister mariano rajoy to try and put a stop to a crisis that shook the wealthy region of 7.5 million people , the rest of spain and europe . with an absolute majority of 70 of the 135 deputies in the assembly , the pro-independence parties should in theory have the necessary votes to nominate a separatist president . ",
        "their favoured candidate is puigdemont , sacked by rajoy along with his cabinet on october 27 after the regional parliament declared unilateral independence . late on tuesday , the two largest pro-independence parties said they had agreed to nominate him as their candidate . the separatist erc party and puigdemont 's together for catalonia grouping reached a deal to support him `` as candidate to be president of the catalonia region '' , a joint statement said . the new parliament is to meet at 11:00 am and the separatists are expected to begin the complex process to allow puigdemont 's investiture by the end of the month . ",
        "but their majority remains theoretical , with three of the 70 deputies being held in prison as they are probed for rebellion , sedition and misuse of public funds for their role in the failed independence bid . five others are abroad , including puidgemont who risks arrest on the same charges if he comes back to spain . - sworn in via videolink ? - to be elected president , he should in theory be present at the parliamentary session where the vote to name a new leader takes place , but he wants to appear by videolink or write a speech and have it read by someone else . ",
        "the catalan parliament 's rules stipulate that the candidate for the regional presidency must `` present his or her government programme to parliament . `` it does not detail whether this must be done in person , but several legal experts , the opposition and the central government insist it can not be done remotely . rajoy 's government has warned madrid will maintain direct control over catalonia if puigdemont attempts to govern from belgium . madrid 's direct rule has proven very unpopular in a region that had enjoyed considerable autonomy before its leaders attempted to break away from spain . ",
        "in response , rajoy seized control , sacked catalonia 's government , dissolved its parliament and called snap elections in december .   "
