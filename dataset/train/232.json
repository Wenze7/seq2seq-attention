        "salem , ore. . -- reindeer are supposed to pull santa claus ' sleigh , but in oregon recently , a red-suited man on a sled wound up pushing a deer . the reverse-reality christmas-season tale played out when a deer wandered onto a frozen golf course pond in sunriver , oregon , on friday and then lost its footing . try as it might , it could n't get all its legs underneath him . it skidded and slithered , and its legs buckled . along came firefighter jeff `` jj '' johnston , astride a new ice-rescue sled that was as bright red as the suit he wore , and as the nose on rudolph the reindeer , which guided santa 's sleigh one foggy christmas eve . ",
        "benjamin o'keefe , a captain in the fire department of the resort and residential community , had his camera rolling . his video has become a sensation , garnering millions of views and picked up by broadcasters in the united states and overseas . the young deer 's hind legs began pumping , but it could n't get up on its front legs . it was on an icy treadmill , going nowhere . johnston got close , spoke calming words to the deer and -- slipping a bit himself as a tried to gain traction -- gently pushed it with the front of the sled to the edge of the pond . ",
        "even then , the deer needed some coaxing . it seemed to have enjoyed the slippery ride . johnston tapped it on the head with the back of his gloved hand , then scratched the top of its head and ears , like you 'd pet a dog . the deer tried to get onto the sled before it turned around . pushed once more to the snowy ground , it gained solid footing and , with a wave from johnston , scampered off , presumably to join its mates in some deer games . `` jj was talking to it the whole time , '' said tammie waters , office manager for the sunriver fire department . ",
        "`` the deer played along pretty good . `` it was the inaugural rescue mission for the sled , which was purchased with a grant from firehouse subs , a sandwich restaurant chain , she said . she hopes it never happens , but when someone falls through the ice or is stuck on thin ice , the sled will be put to use . `` it was a great way to get training , and rescue a deer , '' waters said .
