",
        "the train conductor , who has an 11-week-old daughter called autumn , said : `` other women idolise brad pitt and harry styles , but my hero 's martin lewis of the money saving expert website . `` claire 's weekly groceries bill has been slashed by as much as 94 per cent since she started her extreme couponing hobby when she paid £ 45 for a £ 50 asda voucher from a money-saving website . pashe said : `` that was an initial saving of £ 5 . then i went to asda looking for receipts with discounts attached - a trick called ` wombling ' . ",
        "i only ever look in the car park - not in the store . '' `` i found receipts with £ 5.04 , 78p and £ 7.58 attached , so , altogether , i saved £ 13.40 on my next shop . '' with her bill down from the usual £ 50 to £ 31.60 , claire then went online , discovering discounts worth £ 10 , which further reduced her shopping bill to £ 21 . `` on top of this , i wrote to companies expressing my love for the product , '' she continued . `` from this , i received more than £ 13 in coupons to use in store . ",
        "as these are manufacturing coupons they can be used against other offers in store and on cashback sites . `` i also had coupons that i had found using money saving expert , worth more £ 5 . so , in the end , my asda shopping valued at £ 50.92 came to less than £ 3.20 . '' claire , who started extreme couponing -- as it is called - a year-and-a-half ago , has also turned scouring bargain websites into a fine art . peter kay cancels first tour in eight years - scrapping all 100 dates due to ` unforeseen family circumstances ` at first , she spent hours trawling through them every day -- eager to find the best deals . ",
        "now , she is so adept , she can whiz through them in 20 minutes . `` it 's brilliant , '' she said . `` i 've managed to get some great deals , like a doll really cheap , and apple sauce cheaply . `` as time has gone on , i 've learnt to find exactly what i am looking for . `` you develop a talent for it . you know what 's good and what 's bad ; what deals are worth pursuing . '' claire has even recruited her 36-year-old husband -- who asked not to be named -- to help . ",
        "`` initially he was n't keen , '' she laughed . `` but now he loves it as much as me ... well , maybe not quite as much as me . `` and he likes saving money . '' gettyshe also looks to family to help her save . `` i do food swaps with family and friends , '' she said . `` for example , i might have jars and jars of pasta sauce , which i am not keen on . i might have got them on special offer . `` but i 'm lacking apple sauce . ",
        "`` so , i 'll swap with my auntie rather than just chucking them out . '' in addition to this , claire loves visiting bargain websites . `` there are sites where you fill out surveys and get money back , '' she explained . additionally , she makes sure she always goes to supermarkets in the evenings , heading straight for the reduced items . `` i love a yellow ticket -- reduced price -- item , '' she said . `` you can save lots of money , especially if you freeze food . '' claire also recommends websites , such as checkout smart and shopmium where deals are highlighted and you can earn cashback through purchases . ",
        "slimming world reveals some popular ` free ' foods which now have to be counted as syns `` this is where promoters credit you for buying products , '' she said . `` my trick is buying them on deals and , therefore , earning more for them than i 've paid . '' and claire 's supreme nose for a bargain is not restricted to food . `` i 've picked up brilliant christmas presents for autumn , '' she grinned . `` argos is a real favourite of mine . i purchase cheaper gift vouchers and wait until the offer , ` spend £ 50 get £ 5 gift card is on . ' ",
        "`` then i search a site called price runner to make sure my items are the cheapest in argos and use my nectar card points , earnt from sainsbury 's , to pay the balance . `` i 've got autumn some excellent fisher price toys really cheap . '' as claire was born at the end of november , she also finds restaurants offering birthday deals -- and tries to arrange all her christmas events then . `` it makes things really cheap , '' she grinned . `` it 's great . `` our family festivities will be really frugal , but they 'll look incredibly lavish .
