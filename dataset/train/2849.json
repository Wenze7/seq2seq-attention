        "russian president vladimir putin has taken a dip in icy lake waters to celebrate epiphany , a major holiday in orthodox christianity marking the baptism of jesus . russian television stations have shown the 65-year-old leader approaching a hole cut in the ice on lake seliger in northwestern russia and then dunking himself in and crossing himself . mr putin 's spokesman , dmitry peskov , said the president had performed similar ablutions on the epiphany previously but that friday marked the first time he had done so publicly . in orthodox tradition , water blessed by a priest during epiphany week is considered holy and pure , and believers attribute healing powers to it . ",
        "authorities set up bathing sites for believers all over russia , including some areas in siberia where temperatures fell below -30 c . the strongman grew up under communist rule where open shows of religion were frowned upon . as president , he has become a frequent attender of russian orthodox ceremonies , and has given the church a major voice in society . mr putin is seeking re-election in russia 's march presidential election . over the years he has burnished a tough-guy image by releasing images of himself riding horses , fishing , practising judo and swimming in lakes .
