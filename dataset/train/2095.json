        "401 plans can be the best possible way to save for retirement . you wo n't beat the free money that many employers provide through matching contributions , and being able to see your savings grow on a tax-deferred basis can save you thousands at tax time over the years . yet many 401s have lousy options when it comes to investing your money . this article wo n't name names as far as the absolute worst investment options for 401s , but it will give you the information you need to assess your 401 plan and figure out which of its available investment choices are n't worth investing in . ",
        "in particular , the following three groups of funds should be the last you turn to with your hard-earned retirement savings . 1 . high-fee funds . there 's nothing worse for a 401 saver than a fund that charges excessive fees . it might not seem like that big a deal , but for someone who puts aside $ 3,000 of their own money each year in a 401 and has that $ 3,000 matched by an employer , the difference between a 0.1 % annual expense ratio on a fund and a 1.1 % fee works out to more than $ 210,000 in extra savings from the cheaper option , assuming the same average annual 8 % return before imposing fees . ",
        "it 's tempting to think that the higher-fee fund will generate better returns over time . but consider this : in the preceding example , the more costly fund would have to generate 9 % gross returns just to break even compared to what the cheaper fund made in an 8 % return environment . some funds can overcome that handicap , but most wo n't -- and they 'll reap the rewards of the money you lose . 2 . money market funds . the primary purpose of saving for retirement is to let your money grow to the greatest extent possible . ",
        "yet many people end up with extensive amounts of money in money market funds , earning next to no return . in some cases , this is because employers default to funneling contributions to a money market fund unless you select otherwise . yet some investors are just nervous about the ups and downs of the stock market and do n't want to see their retirement accounts go down in value . a mix of stocks , bonds , and other investments is prudent , and as you approach retirement , you 'll want to be more conservative with your 401 portfolio . ",
        "but using the cash option as anything other than a temporary placeholder is usually a poor use of your retirement funds . even conservative investors can typically find options that provide more income with similar stability , such as stable value funds . 3 . `` funds '' in an annuity wrapper . finally , some 401 plans offer extensive investment choices through insurance company annuity contracts . these investment options typically come with a host of additional fees , thereby often making them even more expensive than the funds at the upper end of the mutual fund cost spectrum . ",
        "annuities can come with attractive add-ons that can provide useful benefits , such as guaranteed death benefits , minimum income payouts , or a guaranteed total amount of withdrawals . each add-on typically comes with an extra fee , however , that allows the insurance company selling the annuity to apply the appropriate hedging transaction and retain something extra for its profit . in limited cases , annuities in a 401 can be valuable . for the typical 401 investor with decades of future earnings to consider , paying extra for these guarantees often ends up being wasted money that means less in savings for retirement . ",
        "be smart with your savings . using a 401 plan account to save for retirement is smart , but picking the wrong fund options is n't . by being aware of these poor choices for 401 saving , you can turn your attention to your plan 's better alternatives .   "
