        "just when you think crypto could n't attract more attention , a new project called cryptokitties is kicking things up a notch . it 's part collectible , part game , and all too cuddly . anyone who knows me knows i 'm hopelessly in love with cats . and that i 'm obsessed with emerging technology products and experiences . and i even have a little history tinkering with virtual companions . so it 's little surprise that i basically melted into a puddle when i learned about cryptokitties . hot takesi love a lot of things about this project . ",
        "it 's compelling in both concept and execution . it also represents something bigger : finally , a `` dapp '' with potential for broad consumer appeal , and an archetype for a new category . the interwebs is overflowing with hot takes on cryptokitties , so rather than rehash them i 'll share a few that cover the basics better than i could : a different approachthe thing about cryptokitties that seems to get less attention , but is even more exciting to me than the project or category itself , is the market validation of a completely different approach to crypto ventures . ",
        "the team is deeply multi-disciplinary with expertise in product , design , brand , content , and crypto/blockchain engineering . this is in stark contrast to so many blockchain projects which almost seem to pride themselves on exclusivity of domain expertise and disciplinary range . the cryptokitties team dna is a happy by-product of being born out of an agency but there 's no reason teams like this could n't form in other contexts be they larger corporates or new startups . their process also turns the current ico nonsense on its head , joining a short list of projects with the same mindset . ",
        "they started from a point of playful inspiration and then focused on product and users , rather than a whitepaper and token sale . as they navigate product-market fit , it 's safe to say this process served them well . product ought to follow purpose . a utility token sale , if even relevant , ought to follow product . and these tokens ought to primarily flow to users and partners who participate in a well-designed economy , rather than just speculate on it . almost by definition this approach will pay off even if the crypto tide goes out and icos lose favor . ",
        "benny giang shares more about the cryptokitties backstory and approach here , and it 's well worth a read . i 've long ranted to friends and colleagues that the most exciting crypto projects will come from exactly these kinds of teams , cultures , and processes . whether or not cryptokitties crushes it , the machinery behind the project is the real story . fun-tier technologiesthe last thing i 'll say goes even broader than cryptokitties or crypto itself : thank goodness people are finally having fun with frontier technologies . a curious thing has happened over the last several years . ",
        "in the lull between the last technology wave and the next , silicon valley has become enamored with moonshots , disrupting industrials , and saving the world -- perhaps inspired by missionaries like elon musk who have shown no cause is out of reach . so now , as frontier technologies become ripe , founders and investors are quick to employ them in service of humanity 's most fundamental problems : hunger , disease and aging , climate , and so on . this is , well , some serious shit . and immeasurably important work . but to stop our work there would be a loss . ",
        "there is so much more to being human . fun , play , wonder , imagination , creativity , learning , knowledge . frontier technologies will be every bit as transformative for these needs , and i could n't be more excited about founders and projects focused on them . after all , once we solve all of humanity 's problems , what are we going to do ?
