        "one of contemporary music 's most influential guitarists gets his due in emma franz 's doc . jazz guitarist bill frisell is a player distinctive enough to make fans even among music lovers who think they could happily die without ever hearing another guitar solo . from all indications , he 's also that very rare genius who 's a lovely guy -- a soft-spoken , readily smiling man who is endearing company for the nearly two hours of emma franz 's bill frisell : a portrait . less a biography than a hangout film interspersed with well recorded in-studio performance footage , the doc will play well in one-off bookings to those of us who 've kept frisell in demand both on stages and on record . ",
        "fans hoping to learn about frisell 's life outside music should look elsewhere . we learn nothing about his childhood here that is n't directly related to music , and his relocations are similarly framed as driven by musical impulse . we learn that he has a daughter , and briefly meet wife carole d'inverno , a painter . other than that , we get to know frisell by watching him fiddle with guitars and through the eyes of peers . bonnie raitt says `` he 's universally loved , '' and hal willner , the eclectic music producer , backs her up , suggesting that frisell may be the only person around about whom not one person would have something bad to say . ",
        "sitting in his house and surrounded by so many instruments he 's embarrassed to show them all , frisell radiates aw-shucks charm . he gingerly pulls out guitars that artist friends have made for him , explaining that he 's reluctant to play them for fear of scratching them up . he plucks them and wavers , thinking they sound too good to leave in the closet , but of course that has more to do with the player . peers like wilco guitarist nels cline try to sum up the essence of frisell 's gift -- its distinctive `` trebly tone '' and `` natural chorusing '' have influenced countless string-benders -- but their words are n't necessary once we hear the man in action . ",
        "to that end , franz offers enough live footage to sate most fans , returning often to two disparate settings : a trio session between frisell , drummer kenny wollesen , and bassist tony scherr ; and a rehearsal where composer/arranger michael gibbs is coaxing frisell-like atmospheres out of the bbc symphony orchestra . franz collects clips of many other lineups , naturally , and touches on the most important stages of his musical biography . she spends enjoyable time with the late drummer paul motian , whose decades-running trio with frisell and joe lovano remains a fan favorite ; we visit the home of cartoonist jim woodring , whose hallucinatory art has been an unlikely inspiration for frisell . ",
        "guitarists who share frisell 's stature , like jim hall and john abercrombie give some of the most persuasive testimonials about his gifts . franz briefly evokes the downtown nyc scene that helped cement frisell 's reputation for being versatile while remaining immediately identifiable . but the film is more fond of the expansive , americana-steeped music he makes today than it is of the aggressive noise of naked city . getting older , frisell reports , has made him more comfortable with `` admitting '' the music that moves him , even if others might find it corny . ",
        "on records so numerous that even he ca n't keep track of them , frisell finds ways to turn even the most overfamiliar melody into an unexpected pleasure . production company : emma franz filmsdirector-screenwriter-producer-editor : emma franzvenue : laemmle noho 7114 minutes .   "
