        "tottenham hotspur manager mauricio pochettino has claimed that his side are ready to push on in the premier league after welcoming back key players from injury . the lilywhites have stuttered somewhat across their opening 16 top-flight fixtures , winning just half of their games to find themselves down in seventh place . erik lamela recently made a return following more than a year on the sidelines to bolster tottenham 's squad , though , while victor wanyama is also closing in on first-team action . pochettino , whose side boast the best festive fixture record of any prem team over the last two years , is feeling far more optimistic ahead of brighton & hove albion 's visit on wednesday evening . ",
        "`` for different reasons , like injuries , we 've missed this feeling of competition in the squad , '' he told reporters . `` if we can recover everyone -- now lamela is nearly 100 % or victor wanyama - it 's very good news for the team . the second half of the season , with all the squad fit and all together , we will be more competitive . `` we are going to have the premier league , fa cup and champions league and we need to be competitive and strong . it will be key for us to work with the new players , to introduce things we need to improve the team . ",
        "`` it 's important for the new players to be more comfortable here , to know everything , to adapt their quality to the team . the first six months can be difficult because we do n't have much time to work . sometimes we work only through video because we ca n't do anything on the pitch . `` spurs will be without toby alderweireld until at least february , however , as the centre-back has suffered an injury setback .
