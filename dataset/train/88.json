        "aaron sorkin has been writing for tv and movies for a long , long time . it is only now that he makes the move from page to camera in his first directorial effort , molly 's game . jessica chastain stars as molly bloom , a woman who ends up running one of the highest stake poker games in the world . this is a true story like much of sorkin 's film work , and yet does n't feel like many true-to-life stories . jessica chastain truly owns the screen , one can be transfixed by her every word and action in this role . ",
        "she is utterly brilliant . having been a must-watch talent for some time taking supporting roles in the martian and interstellar while also taking starring roles in smaller pictures like mama , it is great to see her get the exposure she deserves in a big drama , an aaron sorkin drama no less . she holds her own and commands the screen with ease . she is a woman of power , and yet plays it with a delicate balance of vulnerability . it 's almost as if there is something underneath it all driving her forward . without giving anything away , it can be seen as a clich√© as to what it actually is , but in fact it is masterfully done .

",
        "the poker games themselves are easy to follow , which for someone who does n't know anything about the game is a welcome relief . the narration helps with this , but overall the usage of chastain narrating over certain scenes comes across a bit forced . i would assume a more experienced director would find an easier way , or be more conservative with the narration as a technique . but this is merely a minor quibble . for a first time director , aaron sorkin does n't break the book or do anything miraculous . but this is a solid film . ",
        "he knows when to hold back , when to cut to important moments , and more importantly he knows how to shoot his autuer-like dialogue . this is a promising debut from a writer that has been a hollywood mainstay for over 20 years . next : interview : bruno verdoni jumps from tv to the big screen with molly 's gamepoker is a game of skill over chance . this is an idea that sorkin plays with over the course of the film . but this is more the story of molly , and her hold against powerful men . ",
        "sorkin seems to be examining whether this was a matter of skill on her part , or if this was just chance that happened to put her in this situation . maybe it 's both . in anycase this is a must watch , for jessica chastain 's performance as molly bloom and for the skill of aaron sorkin 's screenwriting . molly 's game is in cinemas now . aaron sorkin has been writing for tv and movies for a long , long time . it is only now that he makes the move from page to camera in his first directorial effort , molly 's game .
