        "coloniethe morning commute to school for hunter pemrick starts off innocently enough in the form of a pre-dawn wake-up and catching a ride typically before sunrise . the unusual part of pemrick 's daily trek is the distance as the schuylerville resident meets up with a car pool of classmates and hockey teammates at a local convenience store for the 40-mile trip down the northway to christian brothers academy . `` i wake up at 5:45 every day and get my uniform on , '' pemrick said . `` we carpool at 6:30 off exit 14 . i 'm with dale hammond , my brother , miles desmarais , and team manager britt carmer . ",
        "we have a good group . `` since schuylerville high school does not have a hockey team , pemrick had few options when he decided he wanted to play the sport at the high school level . once he visited cba , the choice was an easy one . `` i wanted to play hockey , '' pemrick said . `` i looked at cba and after i shadowed here , i knew i had to go here . i could n't pass that up . either there , or prep school away from home . `` once he donned the brothers ' sweater , the impact was immediate . ",
        "eighteen goals and 33 points as a freshman were followed by a sophomore campaign with 17 goals and 25 points as cba earned a trip to the section ii semifinals . this year , the breakout has continued as the 6-foot , 170-pound pemrick leads the league with 18 goals and is tied for the league lead in assists with 14 in 11 games as cba is in second place behind bethlehem in the division i standings . `` when hunter came to cba and started playing with us as a freshman , you could see the potential , '' cba coach and athletic director blaine drescher said . ",
        "`` clearly , he was scoring goals as a freshman and sophomore , but what i think has helped him , hunter is a very hard worker and is constantly in the weight room trying to get bigger and stronger . `` pemrick , an assistant captain , has recorded a trio of hat tricks this season and his unselfish play helps set up teammates when opponents shadow him in the offensive zone . `` his shot is harder than it has ever been and he has that goal-scoring ability that you ca n't teach , '' drescher said . ",
        "`` every game , he is a threat to put the puck in the net and that requires a lot of attention from opposing coaches and that is how he can make his teammates playing around him better . `` drescher says pemrick 's commitment to his team and the game itself is noticed by teammates . `` hunter is viewed by his teammates as a dedicated hockey player but somebody that is a quality person as well , '' drescher said . `` he is respected by all of the kids , not only on his team but the whole cba community . ",
        "he does not need three or four goals a game , as long as he is finding ways to make the team better . hunter is one of those kids that , at the end of the day , he wants to win a section ii title . `` the process can be arduous and takes commitment on many levels , including the car pool drivers , who are treated to a morning coffee by the passengers . `` oh , yeah , every morning , '' pemrick said . `` my dad drives a lot , every parent takes turns .
