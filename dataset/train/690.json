        "new york -- after sza created the drums-drenched , reggae-tinged song `` consideration , '' she thought she had finally found the sound of her debut album . but there was one problem : rihanna heard the song and wanted it . `` and i 'm just like , ` it has a video . i shot a video already to it . it 's coming out on wednesday . that was going to be the first song to prep the album , ' '' sza recalled in a recent interview . rihanna kept sza as a featured artist on the track , which opens her critically acclaimed `` anti '' album , released last year . ",
        "and while sza said recording with the pop star `` was a learning experience , it was just dope '' -- as for her own project ? she felt lost . she cried like a baby . she was devastated . she had never given away something she cared so much about . `` i was crying , ` i 'll never make anything better , ' '' said sza , now 28 . `` and kendrick was like , ` well , this is what separates great people . because great people make better things than that . ' ",
        "`` sza proved herself to be great -- and also proved her earlier prediction wrong . the songs that make up `` ctrl , '' her major-label debut released in june nominated for five grammy awards , have resonated with fans around the world , making sza both a critical darling and a commercial success . the album is at the forefront of the alternative r&b movement , with sza earning praise for her vocal delivery and direct lyrics that both female and male fans vibe to . `` my favorite game to play at her shows is finding the tough guy , the straight dude who does n't want to show no emotion , and as soon as his song comes on , he loses his mind , '' said terrence `` punch '' henderson , the co-president of independent record label top dawg entertainment , home to sza and lamar . ",
        "`` she 's the voice of this generation right now , '' he added . `` the words she 's saying is honest and raw she 's speaking for these girls and also these guys . `` on some of her songs , sza fires off her lyrics more like a rapper than a singer -- switching topics quickly as she talks about having sex , failed relationships , persevering in life and if being herself is enough . `` i 'm so ashamed of myself think i need therapy , '' she even sings on `` normal girl . ",
        "`` the hit `` the weekend '' is about sharing a boyfriend and sza wonders if her body type is enough for her lover on `` garden . '' she asks for `` another valium '' on `` love galore , '' where she also sings , `` why you bother me when you know you got a woman ? '' smoking weed is peppered throughout the album -- and on this particular day , a week after grammy nominations , joy was in the air , along with the smell of marijuana . `` ctrl , '' which has achieved gold status , has launched two platinum singles with `` love galore '' and `` the weekend . '' ",
        "the project was named the no . 1 album of the year by several critics , including time , vice , new york daily news and the associated press ; it was ranked no . 2 by the new york times , npr , pitchfork and billboard . the success makes sza the belle of the grammys -- she 's the most nominated female act . `` you know what 's crazy ? i feel like you 're never as good as people say you are . and you 're never as bad as people say you are . so , it 's like , you just got ta take it like with a grain of salt . ",
        "like , it 's an experience . a responsibility more so . i think it 's like a knock on the head . like , you have a responsibility , you have a purpose , so it 's like , uh , get to work and focus , '' she said . sza 's nominations include best new artist and best urban contemporary album for `` ctrl . '' three of her songs also earned nominations -- the travis scott-assisted `` love galore '' ; the fan-favorite `` the weekend '' ; and album opener `` supermodel '' . but music did n't almost happen for sza , born solana rowe in st. louis but raised in new jersey . ",
        "`` i had no idea . i just really wanted to be a scientist or just , like , do something like a gymnast . ... then i wanted to be in fashion marketing . i really wanted an office , badly . needed an office . needed a corner . needed , like , the wood grain . needed the good view . needed the long lunch . like , i needed all that , '' she said . `` i just wanted to wear power suits . and like , you know , hair slick , skin immaculate . ",
        "like , you know , you always crave what 's the hardest for you to attain . '' `` so the music thing i just stumbled on , that was not my plan at all , '' she added . `` i fought this hard . like , i fought this whole process so hard . i 'm even fighting it now . ... but it 's getting easier ... i 'm accepting . i 'm accepting where i am . and this is true direction . `` punch first met the big-haired sza in 2011 at a lamar show in new york . ",
        "sza was helping sell merchandise but they did n't have his size . when she arrived in the lobby of punch 's hotel to bring him clothes , he overheard the music blasting out of headphones of sza 's friend . it was sza 's song . `` sza got all embarrassed . she was n't going to say anything about singing , '' said punch , who co-wrote four songs on `` ctrl '' and is nominated alongside the singer for best r&b song . `` i heard her voice and her voice was so distinctive , and then i heard what she was actually saying . ",
        "i 'm like , ` yo , she is like a lyricist . ' `` that song was one of the first sza recorded . they kept in touch , she let him listen to more songs and he would give her advice . after two years , she asked punch to manage her . `` we really talked about it seriously and here we are , '' he said . sza , who recently won two soul train awards and is nominated for four naacp image awards , is now looking ahead to the grammys . she plans on bringing her grandmother to the event , to be held in new york city on january 28 . ",
        "`` she 's getting her outfit ready , '' sza said of her grandmother , who lives in st. louis and is heard giving feisty advice and words of encouragement to sza , along with the singer 's mother , throughout the `` ctrl '' album . `` she 's 90 , and this is the one time that the grammys is near my hometown , '' she said . `` i 'm thankful .
