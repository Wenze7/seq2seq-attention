        "her most loyal fan base : her family when they see you getting pummeled in the face , especially being the baby in the family ; my dad seeing his little girl beaned in the face , it 's not something that any parent wants to see for their kid . once they realized i could make a career out of it , was passionate about it and was actually good , they were like : ` we 'll support you . ' the feminine side to martial arts i get my nails done every two weeks like clockwork . ",

",
        "i eat salads , lean meats , vegetables . my cheat is a spoonful of peanut butter in the middle of the night . from martial arts to the microphone i 'm extremely blessed because it 's something i 've always wanted to do . i have the gift of gab and i could talk to a rock if given the chance . i love to talk about mixed martial arts ... especially now that i 'm pregnant and not going to be able to fight for a while . baby on board i give birth on jan 12 and i 'm thrilled . ",
        "i 've always known that i was meant to be a mother . now i 'm gon na be fighting for my little baby .   "
