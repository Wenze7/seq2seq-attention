        "manchester city continue their march to what appears to be the first league title in the pep guardiola era with what promises to be one of the toughest matches of the season : a trip to anfield . the blues are unbeaten and it might be time to seriously think that they might go the whole season without a loss , and avoiding defeat away to liverpool will prove they can definitely be the blue invincibles . beating liverpool will be no easy feat , however : the reds have been sensational this season , and they 've scored a lot of goals . ",
        "they also have a very good defense at home , conceding just four times all season . virgil van dijk will probably make his league debut for the reds , and this will be the first game after philippe coutinho was officially sold to barcelona . it 'll be interesting to see if van dijk 's presence has a bigger effect than coutinho 's absence . possible lineups . liverpool : mignolet ; gomez , matip , van dijk , robertson ; lallana , can , wijnaldum ; salah , firmino , mané . man city : ederson ; walker , stones , otamendi , delph ; de bruyne , fernandinho , d. silva ; sterling , agüero , sané . ",
        "prediction . this will be full of goals and excitement , but i do n't think city will win it : 2-2 draw .   "
