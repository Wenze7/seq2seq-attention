        "so one of my guy friends told me he likes someone from our maths class and one day later , he does n't like her anymore . i would n't say that he was lying about his feelings becuz he told this to his other friends . this is when before he told me he does n't like the girl anymore . i was surprised becuz it was not obvious . when they used to sit next to each other , he told the teacher that he wanted to sit somewhere else and the teacher let him sit one seat away from me . ",
        "when a guy likes you , he wants to sit next to you not far from you , right ? and when the girl talked to him , he completely ignored her . he would look serious not delight . he also did n't make an effort to talk to her . ok , maybe he was just shy but i do n't get it becuz he did n't want to sit next to her . i know this question is not about me . but i find my guy friend odd üòê .
