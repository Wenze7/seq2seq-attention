        "the opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not represent the views of china daily and china daily website . pakistan-us relations have changed with the interests of the two countries over the past six decades , and the united states of america remains one of the first countries to have established diplomatic ties with pakistan . during the cold war era , pakistan was a big us supporter and protected their interests in the region . pakistan was also a close ally to the us after the september 11 attacks in 2001 . though pakistan-us relations have always been in the limelight , they have never been totally smooth , facing ups and downs . ",
        "pakistan extends cordial hands of friendship to the us whenever it needs our support , but the usa always steps back when it no longer needs pakistani assistance on an issue , and our relations suffer . pakistan is a country which faced tough , strict sanctions from the us in our history . both countries have always cooperated with each other on common goals and interests , though the us failed to value pakistan 's interests and keptdemanding beyond all limits . `` do more '' has become a common request by us leadership in recent years , without understanding pakistan 's capacity or resources . ",
        "during the last few years , the us has started blaming and threatening pakistan , but i believe this is based on misunderstandings only . of course there exist some concerns on both sides , some of them may be genuine and some based on misunderstandings . let 's discuss them one by one . the first allegation is that pakistan could not eradicate the taliban from its territory . i think on the contrary it is the us who could not eliminate the taliban from afghanistan , despite being a superpower , with a massive army stationed in afghanistan , the latest innovative weapons and political support from the international community . ",
        "on the other hand , pakistan is a much weaker state than the us , with a poor economy and undeveloped in weapons and technology . how can pakistan eliminate the taliban completelywhen the us failed , too ? pakistan can not be blamed for us failures in afghanistan . the second allegation : pakistan is providing safe space or safe haven to the taliban within its borders so they can continue operations . the us has fought for the last 16 years in afghanistan with its well-trained and well-equipped army , but could not occupy or control afghanistan completely . ",
        "to date , about 45 percent of afghanistan is contested or controlled by the taliban . americans can not walk freely and fearlessly in the streets of kabul . they are not safe except inside military camps . under these circumstances , why would the taliban need to seek refuge inside pakistan , if they can freely operate from inside afghanistan ? especially , when the pakistan army has launched a massive operation in border areas along with afghanistan and cleaned up the region , to make it free of the taliban . another allegation is that pakistan is providing space to china . ",
        "as a matter of fact , the us and western europe were leading the cold war against the soviet union untilthe late 1980s and the ussr 's collapse . with the us as the sole superpower in a unipolar world , they have launched direct attacks on the muslim world and caused massive destruction in many muslim countries including iraq , libya , syria , yemen and afghanistan . the us has gained maximum economic benefits through its wars and conducted live tests and trials of new weapons , technologies and war strategies . but now the us is facing challenges -- starting in syria , where russia has halted the us-led strategy to remove bashar al-assad , syria 's president . ",
        "the us also faced a defeat in a recent un general assembly meeting on the issue of jerusalem as israel 's capital by receiving only 9 votes in favor against 128 votes noand 35 absentions . not even the us 's close allies voted in its favor . honestly speaking , the us has been exposed to the world . its role has been to wage war , killing innocent people , seizing resources of other countries , sabotage and spreading hate over the last several decades . on the other hand , china is rising as the hope for the oppressed world . ",
        "it has launched a mega initiative , the belt and road initiative , worth $ 900 billion in investment . it will improve connectivity within regions and promote economic activities , plus it will create job opportunities , eliminate poverty and promote cooperation and security . simply put , it is a message of `` peace , harmony and development '' . the us predicts china will grow economically , politically and militarily in the near future . they are scared of china 's rapid development , and feelinsecure that china may become their competitor the world stage in the very near future . ",
        "they are trying to curtail china by being close allies with countries around china like india , japan , vietnam , myanmar and the philippines . the us might also be expecting pakistan to curtail china , which is out of the question . pakistan enjoys a long history of friendship with china , and pakistan-china relations are a cornerstone of pakistan 's foreign policy . our friendship is time-tested , everlasting and present in all dimensions . our relations are based on mutual respect , non-interference , mutual interest and in accordance to best international practices . pakistan fully supportsthe belt and road initiative and is one of its biggest beneficiaries . ",
        "pakistan and china are closely working on the china-pakistan economic corridor , to make it a role model for the rest of the world . pakistan can not compromise on pakistan-china relations . the way forward . pakistan is a peace-loving country and our role in un peacekeeping forces is admirable . our sacrifices during the war on terror go beyond any other country . no other country has suffered more than pakistan , and we understand the value of peace very well . we promote peace , stability and prosperity all around the globe . our role in this region is vital , and pakistan 's geo-strategic importance is well known to the us . ",
        "think tanks and military leadership also understand pakistan 's importance and vital role . pakistan wants good relations with all countries and would like to extend all possible support and cooperation to achievethe common goal of `` peace , stability and prosperity '' throughout the whole world . we desire to work closely with all countries , including the usa . it is suggested that pakistan and usa address each other 's concerns sincerely and extend full cooperation for our mutual goals . professor zamir awan is a sinologist for the chinese studies center of excellenceat the national university of sciences and technologyin pakistan , and a fellow with ccg .
