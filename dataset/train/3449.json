",
        "but , how ? if snoke was as powerful , why did luke and leia let him anywhere near ben ? with the significant number of flashbacks in the last jedi , it 's presumed that we will get more in the next film , connecting the dots as to how snoke came into contact with the skywalkers in the first place , along with corrupting ben solo . those same instances might shed light as to who snoke was . that could further explain how he got close to ben solo . also what enticed ben solo to be seduced by the dark side ?
