        "a bit more than a year has passed since i graduated at dtu . that was not just the end of a 2 years long msc period , but also the end of my studies . at least for a while . now , i am living in london and i felt the urgent need to wrap up a bit a few things that i learned in denmark and will accompany my life . so here are my 5 hints , that i experienced while i lived in one of the most beautiful nordic countries . 1 . ask questionsmost of my friends would probably agree with me , that it was a very important lesson to learn , that we need to ask questions . ",
        "in the university it was highly emphasized , that before a lecture every students need to do their own preparation and ask questions on the lesson . it was a great and a bit different approach than i got used to before denmark . because , in this way the teacher deepened and corrected my knowledge and understanding , rather than just giving his lecture and his own answers to me . therefore , every professors , experts were always very helpful and approachable , if you willing to do your own research first and ask questions from them . ",
        "hence i learned , when i tackle with a challenge i need to sit down do my research about it , gain understanding and not to be afraid of asking questions , which can point me towards the solution . many times i saw that common misunderstandings were remained hidden , because nobody would like to raise questions . it is still better to ask sometimes profane questions , than miss the important and profound ones . so take your time , do your research and ask questions ! 2 . teamwork , teamwork , teamwork . . in denmark it is obligatory to work in teams on various projects , hence you learn from each other along the way and get a solution , which is accepted by everybody in the group . ",
        "sounds like a cliche then to emphasize how important it is to learn how to work and be effective in a team . i have played in a volleyball team on a semi-professional level for several years , worked in non-profit organisations , hence i thought it wo n't be a major challenge for me . i was wrong . because to solve engineering and management problems in a way that the work is distributed between 2 to 6 people with different nationalities , point of views is tough . and still at the end of the day a coherent solution had to be handed-in . ",
        "apart from being sensitive for the team dynamics , calm and polite i learned a very important thing . namely , how to communicate in a very direct and clear way . the danes usually say what they want from you . also they do n't hesitate to ask challenging questions and they do n't hide their point under the dress of a polite `` that 's what i expect you , but i do n't say it directly '' . last , but not least another take away for every team meeting . it is always a more efficient meeting if a lot of coffee is involved and if there is a promise of cake at the end . ",
        "definitely a lesson worth to remember . 3 . build and maintain a diverse communityduring my time in denmark i was on countless social events , workshops organised by talent groups , professional organisations , companies and the university . as a part of the nova group i could work on industrial challenges together with students and professionals with very different specializations . i was wondering at that time , why any company would like a mixture of students with engineering , financial or pharmaceutical background on a workshop , which is about the marketing strategy of a new product . ",
        "it was proved to be a good strategy . because , during the workshop i saw that all of us had the barrier of our own knowledge -- we tried to solve the problem based on what we knew or what was our experience , without success . but as soon as we started to see the challenge through each other 's point of view a new and better solution was created by the group . however , it is well known that a more diverse group can reach better solutions , but that was the first time when i could experience it on my own skin . ",
        "when , i had the chance to ask personally his royal highness prince joachim about the trend that more and more international students are coming to denmark . his answer summarized the main point of all of these meetings and events that i attended . he underlined that to build a successful team , business , even a society a diverse community is crucial . networking , knowledge sharing and the maintenance of these communities are the key elements to create bridges across individuals ' knowledge , opinions or different industries . this mind-set is very much in the danish society . ",
        "i saw it in my boss , in my fellow students and since then in myself as well . 4 . keep and protect your work-life balancework-life balance is something , which is very important and so easy to ignore , when there are tight deadlines , tense situation in your professional or personal life . when i worked in denmark i experienced many times , that people work hard and diligently , but just in the frame of the dedicated working hours . most of my colleagues finished at 5 pm sharply , sometimes even if they were in a middle of a sentence of a report . ",
        "this was the time when i learned that if you work late hours and send an email always after working hours it does n't mean necessarily that you are a hard worker , but rather that you ca n't manage your time efficiently . this was a quite shocking moment , when i realized the ugly truth behind this attitude . the conscious awareness to protect your work-life balance is key to keep yourself happy and productive . thus , i always try to follow the danish style -- being disciplined and relax enough to recharge for the next challenge . ",
        "5 . do n't care much about the weatheri have to admit , this hint is a bit abstract . because under the term `` weather '' i mean every little thing that can go wrong , when you have plans . the weather in denmark is typically a factor , which can go wrong . it changes all the time , pretty windy and rainy in general and you never know which combination of the two will come . of course , there are nice days , but i learned quickly that i should n't trust too much in sunny days . ",
        "i also saw so many times the danes cycle in the rain , having barbeque in the garden , even if the circumstances are not the best . it 's mainly because they are prepared for that , but also because they do n't care much about the little things , which can go wrong . less headache , less stress . they are quite chill and they are not obsessed if the plans need to be altered . there is a norwegian phrase , but it is also famous in denmark : there is no such thing as bad weather , only bad clothing . ",
        "so sometimes , you just need to change the clothes , and keep going , rather than being at home and wait until the end of the rain . this way of thinking taught me that no matter of the circumstances keep up your plans and motivation . these are just some of the lessons that i took with me from denmark and i hope there is a lot more to come along the way . hopefully , some of these hints above will make sense and help for you as well . balint penzes .
