        "we 've all heard the term `` kodak moment . '' it 's a popularized phrase to describe a picture-perfect moment -- one that should be forever captured on kodak film . get the timeless reading ebook in pdf . like kleenex tissue , kodak was once so large and popular , the company worked its way into basic lexicon . kodak was founded in 1880 by a man named george eastman . he started producing dry plates in rochester , new york . eventually the company adopted the razor and blades strategy of selling inexpensive cameras and making big margins on the consumables -- paper , film and chemicals . ",
        "it 's hard to believe now , but kodak was the innovator of its day . by 1976 , the company accounted for 90 % of film and 85 % of camera sales in america . it was known as `` the great yellow father . '' until the 1990 's , it was considered one of the five most valuable brands in the world . and kodak was actually the first company to introduce the digital camera , back in 1975 . a 24-year old employee named steve sasson was tasked exploring practical uses for kodak 's newly-invented charged coupled device -- a sensor that took an incoming , two-dimensional light pattern and converted it into an electrical sensor . ",
        "though the job sounds high-tech , especially for 1970 's standards , it was n't a glamorous gig . sasson 's invention took 50 milliseconds to capture an image and 23 seconds to record it to a tape . he would take the cassette tape out and hand it to his assistant , who would put it in the playback unit ... 30 seconds later , you got a 100 pixel by 100 pixel black and white image . sasson promised kodak 's executives the processing time would decrease as technology improved . but kodak killed the product , fearing it would cannibalize its film business . ",
        "not to mention , the company did n't believe anyone would ever want a digital camera ... `` they were convinced that no one would ever want to look at their pictures on a television set , '' sasson told the new york times . `` print had been with us for over 100 years , no one was complaining about prints , they were very inexpensive , and so why would anyone want to look at their picture on a television set ? '' we know how the story played out ... digital photography killed the film business . ",
        "kodak entered the digital camera business , but those became a low-margin commodity . kodak went from peak revenues of $ 16 billion in 1996 to bankrupt in january 2012 . the company emerged from bankruptcy in 2013 as eastman kodak -- a company focusing on business technology and printing solutions . and yesterday , eastman kodak returned as a wall street darling . shares of the 130-year old company soared 120 % after it announced it 's adopting blockchain technology and creating its own digital currency -- the kodakcoin . it 's up another 75 % as i write this . ",
        "the platform , called kodakone , says it 's a `` new economy '' for photographers to license their work and get paid . kodak is n't the only publicly traded company to mention blockchain or crypto and see its shares soar ... last month , long island iced tea corp. . -- a beverage company -- changed its name to long blockchain corp. . and saw its shares nearly triple in a day . the company was facing a potential nasdaq delisting unless its market value rose above $ 35 million for 10 business days in a row . ",
        "then , last week the company said it was buying 1,000 bitcoin mining machines and offering as many as 1.6 million shares to raise capital ... while continuing to make its juices , lemonades and teas . yesterday long blockchain corp. . announced it was halting its plans to raise capital , though it will still evaluate `` multiple specific opportunities '' in blockchain . also last week , the securities and exchange commission halted trading in hong-kong based ubi blockchain internet ... the company 's stock price soared from $ 9 on december 11 to $ 87 on december 18 -- even though it has no revenue and provided a disconnected phone number in its regulatory filings . ",
        "even the sec is getting in on the joke ... the fort worth , texas branch of the sec recently tweeted `` we 're contemplating adding ` blockchain ' to our name so we 'll increase our followers by 70,000 percent . '' this type of market behavior is pure madness ... struggling lemonade companies are getting into cryptocurrencies . and the market is rewarding them . same with ubi blockchain internet , which appears to be an outright fraud . comparisons to the tech bubble abound -- when companies with zero tech focus would add `` dot com '' to their name and see their shares soar . ",
        "i 've been writing this year about avoiding major mistakes that can cripple your wealth . and once , again , i 'd urge caution in the crypto space . i 'm not saying you should n't buy any . nor should you necessarily sell if you 're sitting on big gains . but now probably is n't the time to go all in . money today is acting completely irrationally in regards to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies . kodak , a textbook case study in how to fail with technology , is launching its own blockchain and coin . ",
        "lemonade companies are mining crypto . paris hilton and jamie foxx are promoting initial coin offerings . it 's a circus . and most of these hair-brained schemes will fail . remember , any successful investment has to be based on something real -- property , cashflow , an underlying technology . investments based on nothing but hype are huge mistakes . and that 's what we 're seeing in the crypto space . luckily , they 're easy to avoid . if you are interested in speculating in cryptocurrencies , i encourage you to download our free crypto currency report - a different perspective on crypto . ",
        "more and more people want to dive into crypto currencies and everyone 's focus is on bitcoin 's price . but , the price is not what matters ... i see so many people make the same wrong assumptions and mistakes that could be fatal to their capital . that 's why my team and i have written this special report where i share a different perspective on cryptocurrencies .
