        "parts of the world have made huge progress towards stamping out debilitating tropical diseases such as river blindness and elephantiasis , and success is `` within our grasp '' , british physicist stephen hawking said . `` the last mile on the journey to elimination is always the most difficult , '' hawking said in a speech on tuesday , citing polio and guinea-worm as success stories of diseases on the brink of disappearing . hawking , who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease aged 21 , and communicates via a cheek muscle linked to a sensor and computerised voice system , also honoured his late father 's medical work in africa , china and the united states . ",
        "frank hawking pioneered a treatment for lymphatic filariasis , commonly known as elephantiasis , which causes enlarged body parts . `` he worked in sometimes very difficult conditions , but he never gave up and he believed fully in the role of science to build a better world , '' said his son . `` he believed in humanity and our ability to find solutions to problems . `` the event in cambridge marked the one billionth treatment of neglected tropical diseases by international charity sightsavers , dispensed in the nigerian village of kudaru . hawking called it `` a monumental milestone '' . ",
        "ntds are a group of painful infections affecting one in five people globally , according to sightsavers which trains thousands of community volunteers to dispense medication and gather data . the diseases are most prevalent in areas of extreme poverty , and often trap individuals in a cycle of social exclusion . they are also found in parts of north america and europe , not just in developing countries , said anthony solomon , medical officer for ntds at the world health organization . `` having them also increases the likelihood that people will stay poor and become poorer , because it affects people 's income-generating ability , '' he said on the sidelines of the event . ",
        "despite this , solomon told the thomson reuters foundation there is now enormous momentum to `` consign these diseases to the history books '' . philip downs , technical director of ntds at sightsavers , said funding and political will had galvanised around the diseases , leading to major wins . ghana , for example , is on course to become the first sub-saharan african country to eliminate trachoma , a leading cause of blindness . sightsavers plans to sustain progress by working with government water and sanitation departments , and strengthening national health systems to build resilience . `` we do n't want the diseases to come back , '' said downs . ",
        "britain has pledged Â£ 360 million pounds towards ntd programmes between 2017 and 2022 . michael bates , minister of state at the uk department for international development , told the thomson reuters foundation british taxpayers had funded about a quarter of the 1 billion treatments . hawking said his work to answer pressing scientific questions had led him towards black holes and the big bang theory . `` your challenges are huge and more practical than mine , but your search for solutions to your big questions is no less important , '' he told the event .
