        "why is this important ? in a typical sql rdbms , all keys -- whether candidate , primary , or foreign -- are scoped to a specific rdbms instance . once you enter the realm of distributed databases , these identifiers suffer from diminishing utility as you move from a monolithic to a heterogeneous rdbms setup . what is a super key ? a super key is an identifier that unambiguously names its referent -- the entity it identifies -- regardless of the context in which it is encountered . when looked up , a super key always resolves to a description of its referent , without any operating system , rdbms instance , platform , or other dependency . ",
        "on an http-based network , whether public or private , hyperlinks can serve as such super keys , and provide a powerful mechanism for enhancing reports and dashboards produced by business intelligence , analytics , and other oriented productivity tools associated with data science and/or informatics . this powerful capability is a consequence of http fragment identifier which enables an http uri identify anything rather than being restricted to documents as in the case of of http urls . super keys and business intelligence & analyticsreports and dashboards are fundamentally insight-oriented projections of data in context . using hyperlinks -- super keys -- as entity names enables every reader to perform additional ad-hoc exploration without the need to create yet another report , or have to write custom code . ",
        "openlink virtuoso adds these identification and exploration capabilities to existing business intelligence or analytics tools , as long as the support open standards such as http , odbc , jdbc , ado . net , or ole db . the rest of this post demonstrates the use of virtuoso to inject super keys into airtable reports . enhancing airtable , with super keys from virtuosoprerequisites : a free or premium airtable accountaccess to a public or private sparql endpointcreating a csv document with virtuoso for airtable publicwe will use a virtuoso-generated csv document for this exercise as neither odbc nor jdbc connections are currently not supported by airtable , which is typical of a cloud hosted application . ",
        "navigate to dbpedia 's public sparql endpoint and enter : prefix dct : < select ? actor as ? actorid ? school as ? schoolid ? name as ? actorlabel ? schoollabel as ? school where order by asc limit 100select html in the results format dropdown menu , and click run query . upon resolution , an html table will be populated with the sparql query 's results . click on an actor id uri to confirm that the uris resolve . query editor : results : on al pacino 's uri will open a page from dbpedia that describes the famous actor using a collection of attribute and value pairings , as depicted below . ",
        "return to the query editor by going back one page in your browser and the change the results format to csv ; and then click run query . a csv document populated with results from the sparql query will be saved to your designated downloads folder , or even displayed -lrb- subject to your browsers document-type handling capabilities . airtable data usageopen airtable and click new table - > import from spreadsheet . paste your csv data , or choose a csv from your local machine or airtable-supported hosts . note , virtuoso also enables you leverage webdav as a protocol for mounting other external sources of your desired csv document . ",
        "click on the newly generated icon for your spreadsheet . becuase actorid is considered the primary field that uniquely identifies records in this document , we will need to move its values to a new column in order for the http uris to resolve . right-click on the actorid column name and select duplicate field . keep duplicate cells selected and click duplicate fields . once the duplication process is completed , copy the entire actorlabel column to your clipboard . go to the actorid column and click paste , to insert contents of your clipboard . all of the cells in the column will be replaced , including the column name .

        "double click on the actorid column , select url from the drop down menu and click savedouble clicking on a cell within the actorid column will open a new browser tab containing the content of the uri described . repeat these steps for the schoolid columns . double click on any newly generated http uri to confirm that it resolves to a dbpedia page . final product : csv document in a local folder mounted via webdav scoped to a virtuoso instanceairtable query result that include dbpedia super keysconclusionthis post demonstrates how virtuoso enhances an existing productivity tool by injecting super keys into sparql query results -- saved to a csv document . ",
        "this feature evolves airtable into a productivity tool for non-programmers that provides a semantic web of linked data exploration launch-point as an added enhancement to its built data visualization functionality . finally , this exercise demonstrates how an existing end-user productivity tool harnesses the power of a semantic web of linked data without the need for expensive and failure-prone `` rip and replace '' misadventures .
