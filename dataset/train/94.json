        "even as the tech industry is indulging in its mutual love fest in las vegas this week , the long-term consequences of decisions its leaders made years ago is being felt well beyond the glitz of sin city . while attendees are marveling over product demos like sniffy , the heritor of smell-o-vision , viktor , the smart-pillow for seniors , and picobrew , the intelligent distillery as well as a raft of more-standard product announcements from tech giants like dell , hp , lenovo , panasonic , samsung , and others , elsewhere across the nation the more ominous side of tech is on display . ",
        "even as intel ceo brian krzanich was giving his keynote speech in vegas monday night , his minions were struggling to deal with the fallout of an architectural decision the company made more than a decade ago . krzanich told his audience that intel would issue a fix forthwith , but it ca n't retroactively alter silicon chips forged in its multibillion dollar factories , and any software fix will affect performance to some degree . intel has done a lot of twisting and turning in the past week as the implications of this complex flaw became clearer . but wall street is having none of it , and the stock has been hammered . ",
        "although krzanich 's made a large sale of his intel stock after he knew of the flaw but before the public did , he seems to be narrowly covered by a selling program that moves a fixed percentage of his holdings on a schedule . the fact that this particular sale was larger than previous exits was a function of the size of the grant rather than the percentage , which remained unchanged . narrowly covered , yes , but the optics are terrible . the crux of the design decision that led to this debacle was to promote performance over security , essentially allowing data to remain in a memory location so it could be reused without having to reload it . ",
        "at the time , the choice made sense . but in today 's world of cloud-based multi-tenant virtual machines , it can leave customers ' data open to a side-channel attack . the fix will protect the data , but will also negate some of the performance improvements that were the reason for the design in the first place . amd has been making hay while this unexpected sun shines . but i would n't get too happy over that . amd primarily benefits from having in effect zero position in the cloud server business . no flaws because ... no machines ! ",
        "it 's not like amd 's parts do n't also do speculative and out-of-order execution . the market also reflected this dawning understanding as it initially took amd stock up on the news and back down again upon further reflection . and further afield , we have the remarkable situation in which many tech industry leaders , having made their billions from feeding us addictive technologies , designed explicitly to keep us engaged with pavlovian certainty , are now repudiating their own technologies -- but not , we note , offering to give back any of the spoils . three executives from apple , which has not had a presence at ces since the 1990s , facebook , which is mostly in hotel back rooms , and twitter , which is in great use at the show but not actually present as a company , all stood up and told the new york times that their technologies seem to be having a negative impact on society . ",
        "tony fadell , one of the iphone 's creators , called it `` addictive '' and talked about `` unintended consequences . '' sean parker , early financial backer of facebook , spoke of the social network 's potential interference with productivity and wondered , `` god only knows what it 's doing to our children 's brains . '' evan williams , co-founder of twitter called the internet `` broken . '' it 's all very well to observe these things from the comfort of their soaring decks overlooking the pacific , but we down here are living the nightmare . ",
        "i 've often wondered why twitter does n't just shut donald trump off to show him who 's boss . these guys realize that something is not right , but they wo n't make a move toward fixing it if the fix will disturb their cash flow . the thing they do n't realize is that this too may pass . remember the well ? it was the first real social network . and all those discs that used to come in the mail from america online ? today , aol is a pale shadow of its former self . ",
        "myspace ? same thing . social networks tend to get polluted over time as the bad drives out the good . many of my friends are abandoning facebook because they see nothing but vitriol and trollery when they open the page . i realized recently that i had not even looked at my twitter direct messages in the past year . apple wants to increase parental controls on iphones , but all that does is change the pitch of the battle between kids and parents . now , the kids will whine and stamp their little feet until the parents lift the controls . ",
        "the kids know what a smartphone can do , and their friends all have one . maybe the market will self-correct . we can only hope . meanwhile , the industry celebrates itself , as it does every year , in the desert of the southwest .   "
