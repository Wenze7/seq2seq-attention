        "smart lock company otto is suspending operations after a failed acquisition agreement . in a blog post late last year , ceo and founder sam jadallah says the company made an acquisition deal that limited its ability to fundraise , but the buyer pulled out at the last minute , leaving otto with no remaining cash . the first locks were supposed to ship within the next few weeks , but `` otto will not ship next month and it may never ship , '' says jadallah . the company will `` evaluate options '' for moving forward in the coming weeks . ",
        "the otto lock was pitched as a tiny and stylish , but very expensive , smart lock . it sold for $ 699 , and was intended for wealthy homeowners . despite this limited niche , jadallah told techcrunch that otto did n't anticipate problems with the price , and neither did its potential buyer . `` this is n't the story of an ambitious product that did n't have a market , '' he said , asserting that the would-be buyer believed it could sell for even more in certain markets . the buyers , who jadallah would n't name , apparently never gave a reason for abandoning the deal . ",
        "since otto had n't shipped its locks , consumers at least wo n't be dealing with the fallout of a security company suspending operations . but for anyone who was a fan of the otto lock 's sleek design , it 's bound to be a disappointment -- especially because there 's no clear reason for the company 's woes .
