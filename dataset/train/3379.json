        "this week the second session of the 87th iowa general assembly convened and is scheduled to last 100 days . however , the republicans , which are the majority party in both chambers , made it clear that they are aiming to adjourn in 90 days or sooner . this goal will expedite the budget process but is extremely hard to achieve given the number of issues and the complexity of those issues before them this year . the focus of this week was two-fold : 1 . joint sessions of the general assembly were convened to hear the condition of the state delivered by governor reynolds , the condition of the judiciary delivered by chief justice cady , and the condition of the national guard delivered by general orr . ",
        "the condition of the state address outlined the governor 's priorities for this session , which include water quality , expansion of rural broadband , tax reform , medicaid and mental health coverage , the opioid epidemic , and education with a focus on stem and future ready iowa . 2 . organizational meetings for policy and appropriations committees in which the committee leadership had the opportunity to explain their goals and timelines for the session . from a policy perspective , the first item the general assembly will focus on will be a de-appropriations bill designed to cut spending in the current year to account for lower than expected tax revenues . ",
        "this must be done before they can begin discussing putting together the 2019 budget and also major policy initiatives that will have a general fund impact .   "
