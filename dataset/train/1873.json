        "it would seem as of late that client work gets a bad rap , at least in my small circle of designer and developer friends . from my circles , i get the feeling that everyone is ditching client work in favor of working with in-house product teams . despite the amazing stories of culture , success , and creative freedom i hear from peers in this space , i still think client work is fun . whether it was working with start-ups to deploy their alpha version or local small businesses set up their very first website . i 've enjoyed the ride so far . ",
        "while many of my designer and developer friends push me to focus on digital products instead of project work , i ca n't seem to shake the desire of helping people improve their businesses through design . design is a businessmy favorite part about client work is the daily reminder that without a doubt , design is a business . there is n't room for frivolous pixels when you are focused on `` creating value '' -- improving businesses in a few key areas such as time saving or money generating . contrary to what many think , designers do n't exist to `` make things pretty '' but rather to meet clients ' actual business goals . ",
        "it 's this responsibility that makes the big successes of client work worth the time , effort , arguments , revisions , setbacks , and all the other potential negative by-products . as designers we have a unique ability to very quickly make a difference that can be measured , something not many other professions can do . helping people succeed and meet their goals is extremely satisfying . finding solutions to problemswhen you or the company you work is hired for a job , you 're being hired to solve a problem . there is a sense of pride in knowing that a client has entrusted you to provide a solution . ",
        "without your expertise , they have -- in a small or large way -- reached their peak until you can provide a solution . design is as much about removing roadblocks for clients as much as it is about layout , color and typography . in a day and age where individuals are looking for fulfilling careers more than they are for well-paid ones , design provides an opportunity to provide a purpose for your work . many businesses rely on the design , development , user experience , customer experience , and other disciplines just as much as they rely on something like their accounting . ",
        "in a world where artificial intelligence and robots are replacing jobs across america , client work offers a creative outlet that ca n't always be automated . there is a sense of feel or emotion to our design solutions and it 's something that wo n't be replaced by a bot anytime soon . personal growthif you 're anything like me , you get bored doing the same function day in and day out . when you work with clients , getting complacent truly is n't an option . i have found that some of the greatest personal growth in my life has come from wrestling with deadlines , restrictions , and personalities in the work place -- especially when working together in teams and managing other 's opinions , work habits , and schedules . ",
        "while these are things that many other professions have , there is a unique synergy required for creative teams . if any member of the team becomes slow or emotionally distant it can be felt immediately and ultimately affects the solution provided to our clients . beyond learning how to deal with others , client work often requires you to do things you 've never done before . a unique sense of personal responsibility and accountability to your paying customer and team members exists . people are relying on you and if you ca n't do your part there is always a ripple effect . ",
        "you will be put into situations that are n't always comfortable , you will be asked to do things you 're not confident in , and you will be asked to justify your decisions -- these are things that will make you grow . it 's still funwhile i ca n't say that it will be fun forever , i ca n't imagine the joy i get from doing a job well done to disperse anytime soon . being responsible for the growth of other 's makes this the best profession in the world . as fellow designers and peers continue to push you and others into in-house design teams , do n't ever feel like client work is less in any way . ",
        "client work can still provide the purpose we all wanted when we decided to become designers . what has your experience been working with clients ? do you love it or hate it ? i 'd love to know ðŸ¤” .   "
