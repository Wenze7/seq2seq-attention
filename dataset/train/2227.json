        "karahan discusses turkey 's economy , fiscal and monetary policy . turkey 's economy is `` back on its feet '' and no longer needs the stimulus program introduced after last year 's failed coup , a senior adviser to president recep tayyip erdogan said after the latest data showed unexpectedly strong growth . measures including backing loans through a credit guarantee fund were needed to spur the output in 2017 , but now `` fiscal policy and monetary policy should go hand in hand to reduce inflationary pressures , '' hatice karahan told bloomberg tv in london on monday . ",
        "the attempted coup in july 2016 pushed the economy into a quarterly contraction . the comments come after data showed gross domestic product surged 11.1 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier , comfortably beating the median estimate of economists in a bloomberg survey . seasonally adjusted output rose 1.2 percent from the previous quarter , below the median 1.8 percent estimate of four economists . consumer inflation accelerated in november to the highest level since 2003 . `` confidence is returning and it will support growth , '' karahan said , adding that the economy was now less vulnerable to overheating . ",
        "`` investments are coming back . '' karahan also reiterated that turkey 's central bank is independent , and that its tight policy stance is important . erdogan 's often repeated and unconventional opinion that lower rates could reduce inflation had led to concerns of political interference in the regulator 's decisions . karahan has previously pointed to an increase in borrowing costs of about 400 basis points this year as evidence of the regulator 's independence . -- with assistance by constantine courcoulas .
