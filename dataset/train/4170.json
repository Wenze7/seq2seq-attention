        "being santa is a serious business . it requires hard work . and conscientious study . `` it 's a cardinal sin to forget the words to jingle bells , '' says holly valent . `` and the names of your reindeers -- dasher , dancer , prancer , vixen , comet , cupid , donner and blitzen . '' with husband tom , holly valent is the co-dean of the charles w. howard santa school in midland , mich. . founded in 1937 , it is the oldest continuously run santa school in the world . the school is named after an actor and teacher who worked as a santa for macy 's in new york . ",
        "howard died in 1966 , but the valents uphold his legacy , preserving the tradition of father christmas and the santa ethic . growing up in salamanca , n. y. , tom and holly knew each other as children but never talked until college . tom decided he wanted to be a santa when they were expecting their first child . he remembers loving the santa that visited his farm in new york state . he enrolled at the charles w. howard school , becoming dean in 1987 . holly brought their five children to the classes . they never knew . ",
        "`` my job was to keep the kids away from the windows when he drove away as santa for the night shift at the midland santa house , which he helped build . '' no matter their sex , santas must be the embodiments of peace on earth and good will to all men . they must remain jovial at all times . says tom valent , `` being santa is a way of life . it 's a state of mind . not an act ... we are trying to produce ambassadors of love and happiness . '' gender relations , santa style . ",
        "there are now several santa schools preserving and upholding the st. nicholas tradition and providing the skill set necessary to bring joy memorably into children 's lives . syllabuses include make up , ho ! - ho ! - ho ! projection and beard hygiene . the midland school , beside the country courthouse , is the only one offering mrs. claus classes . holly valent teaches `` claus and effect , '' and the season 's gender relations . `` our mrs. claus classes have evolved into a pretty popular module over the past four years . more and more women want to be mother christmas . '' ",
        "and their roles are changing , `` whereas in the past there were usually one or at the very most two women enrolling in our annual santa classes and workshops , they were usually training to be elves or passive helpers to their husbands , partners or male friends and santa wannabees , '' observes holly . tom notes an important historical precedent : `` at the time of st. nicholas in the fourth century , bishops could get married . so there is a possibility of there always being a mrs. claus from the very beginning of the background story . '' ",
        "and that relationship is an important part of the santa claus experience . `` one of the most important roles is showing a respectful and loving relationship between santa and his wife . we are aware that some children never see that at home and father christmas ' loving relationship with mother christmas has a powerful influence on children , '' says holly . esthetician and skincare specialist cindy lofton from los angeles is a graduate of the class of ' 17 . `` it was a totally transformative , immersive and educational experience . '' kindergarten teacher camille parker from austin agrees , `` i have a new skill set . '' ",
        "the three-day , 140-hour santa and mrs. claus program costs $ 990 per couple . this includes three to four dinners , some santa supplies , school manual , bus tour , train ride on a `` polar express '' and lots of cookies and treats . three hundred attended this year 's course . seventy have already enrolled for next year . says cwh graduate mother christmas carol baker , a former librarian from newton falls , ohio : `` i ca n't describe how much the school meant to me . it gave me the opportunity to spend time with those who share the spirit and loving heart of christmas and to learn how to share that spirit with others . '' ",
        "for graduates ready to bring their training to the world , holly notes that `` commercial outfits run anywhere between $ 100 - $ 800 for dresses . most of our mrs. c 's prefer a wig to better disguise themselves ... many mrs. enjoy a velvet or wool cape trimmed in white fur . leggings and gloves are a must , especially in the northern areas . '' students are taught that the red and white costume was only popularized by coca-cola in 1931 . santa enters through the heart . the valents also lecture on modern reindeer lore , hospital visit techniques , hearty carol singing and storytelling , as well as elf relations . ",
        "`` we teach methodology . we talk about how to cope with various situations . you ca n't afford to lose your temper . you have to keep smiling . when you need to go to the restroom you excuse yourself and say you have to feed the reindeers , '' says tom . adds holly , `` santa is one of the most famous people in the world . a major household name . mr. and mrs. santa are very busy people . as a team they are a powerful force and he should be used to spread positive selfless values . ",
        "like the royal couples they share engagements and responsibilities . '' say tom , `` there 's always something new to learn about santa . it 's certainly not child 's play . it is an art form that requires years of training . not just anyone can be father and mother christmas . '' these santa instructors are at their most passionnate when describing santa as a force for good . `` the big , big thing is to keep it as magical as you can . every time a child meets santa is a very special moment . ",
        "you can see it in their eyes . he is a miracle-worker . they believe he is someone very special capable of very special things . '' tom valent also has a message for the santa cynics of the world . `` santa does n't tell lies . he tells stories ... on their graduation we remind of the words of our founder : ` he errs who thinks santa enters down the chimney . he enters through the heart .
