        "hala ghonaimreporter/editor hala ghonaim is a london , ont . - based radio and digital reporter . you can reach her at hala . ghonaim@cbc . ca . @hala_ghonaim the london police services board is taking a big step toward transparency by shifting its board meetings from its headquarters to city hall starting in the new year . `` i think it 's very historic , '' said new board appointee coun . mo salih , who pushed for the change that would also consider implementing a rotational schedule for the monthly meetings . should london police board meetings move to city hall in the name of transparency ? ",
        "this means that beyond city hall , the meetings could also be held at other community venues , including the library and even back at the police headquarters . `` this removes some of those traditional barriers and some of those fears that people have had , '' said salih -- who used the example of people who may have had negative experiences with police related to sexual assault policy handing and arbitrary street carding . `` this is a way of us moving forward by ensuring that we are working in a place where people feel like they can come and have a conversation and not feel intimidated and not feel all these barriers . '' ",
        "the seven-member board approved the motion on tuesday afternoon in a tight 4 -3 vote -- which was preceded by plenty of discussion about logistical concerns . tight vote the idea to shift police board meetings was first introduced at city hall last month -- when council extended an invitation to all city boards and commissions to hold meetings at city hall . several board members raised questions regarding relocation inconveniences and whether or not moving away from the headquarters means giving up on the opportunity of making it more accessible . `` in order to make our building more accessible to the community and less intimidating in the community , we need to do more to make people feel more welcome , '' said board member michael deeb . ",
        "`` let 's not give up on using our headquarters here . it 's an institution in the city and it 's for the public . '' those opposing the motion , including michael deeb , coun . stephen turner and board chair jeanette eberhard , were vocal of their support of transparency . `` there 's a challenged relationship between police and some members of the community . i do n't think this kind of move goes to help fix that . i think it goes to exacerbate that , '' said turner . `` it says that the complete headquarters itself is a place that 's not welcoming and it 's not a place where people should feel comfortable in engaging with policy makers and leadership and its members . '' ",
        "however , new board appointee vanessa ambtman-smith , who identifies as indigenous , said the move is a big step forward . indigenous woman newest member named to oversee police `` it starts to address some of the power and privilege dynamics that may be enforced in a place like . we are looking at trying to minimize that power in ways that invites people , '' she said . ambtman-smith voted to approve the chance , along with mayor matt brown , susan toth , and salih . steps forward board officials have also taken extra steps to ensure transparency by choosing to stream the public meetings online . ",
        "for the first time , the meeting on tuesday was streamed live and the full meeting agenda was made available to the public . the next police board meeting will be held at city hall on jan. . 18 -- that 's when coun . jesse helmer will fill turner 's seat .   "
