        "writing it down is the key to achieving success . i started creating to do lists on a regular basis about a year ago and have seen my productivity increase ten-fold . prior to creating to do lists , my mind was scattered throughout the day bouncing from one thing to another . on top of that there were long periods of doing nothing because i had no clear list of what i needed to do next . daily to do lists should be your first item of business in the morning . take ten minutes at the beginning of each day or the night before , which ever works better , and lay out everything you need to do that day . ",
        "include such things as workout , read on x topic , send reports to x , respond to x amount of emails , etc. . example to do list : - workout-pay credit card bill-call phone company-reply to 15 emails-check overnight news-read more on cryptocurrenciesas you accomplish each task on your to do list cross it out . while it seems like a little thing it can make a huge difference . crossing out a completed task gives you a sense of accomplishment and creates a positive feedback loop for your brain triggering a sort of dopamine release . each item crossed out is another dopamine hit that creates a sense of good feeling . ",
        "once you have established this you will work even harder to accomplish all your tasks each day , helping you become more effective . on top of creating a positive feedback loop , to do lists help declutter your brain . thinking of everything you have to do that day or the night before can be overwhelming . also , it is likely impossible to remember every little thing you need to do . writing it all down can give you a sense of control . you know what needs to be done and will tackle each task one by one . ",
        "moreover , you are less likely to forget things if they are written down . you can add to your to do list throughout the day as things you need to do come to mind . weekly to do lists are the next step to layer on top of your daily to do lists . while this may seem excessive it is definitely helpful . create a weekly to do list with some bigger objectives you want to accomplish for the week such as workout 3 times , eat out only twice , send out 10 resumes , etc. . ",
        "at the end of each week cross out the weekly actions you completed . writing out weekly to do lists help you plan out your week on a higher level and can assist with your daily to do list creation as well . 1 year + to do lists are key to achieving your longer-term goals . while weekly and daily to do lists help you on a micro scale , 1,5,10-year lists can help on a macro level . your longer term lists are basically your goals written down . why do this for such long term time frames ? ",
        "because writing it down has been proven to increase your likelihood of achieving those goals . as many people have referenced there was a 1979 harvard mba study that asked the graduating class if they had written their goals down and had a plan to achieve those goals . only 3 % did . 10 years later the 3 % who wrote their goals down and had a plan were making 10x as much as the other 97 % . it is clear writing your goals down will help you have a higher chance of achieving those goals . to do lists on a daily/weekly/yearly basis are the building blocks of your goals . ",
        "if you have a plan to reach your goals , to do lists are there to help make sure you are sticking to that plan every day . do n't just take my word for it ... there are tons of successful people out there that strongly believe in the power of writing things down . take joe rogan , he says write down what you want to fix about your life then figure out the actions you need to take to make that happen . you want to lose 50 pounds , eat healthier and workout regularly . create a to do lists where this is incorporated every day , stick to the list and eventually the results will show . ",
        "ray lewis is also a big believer in writing things down . a goal remains a goal until you write it down . then it becomes a vision . -- ray lewisbrian tracy , a motivational speaker and self-development author also has emphasized the importance of writing things down and creating lists . he says writing down a list clarifies your thinking and forces you to think at a higher level . he also highlights working from a list you created will increase your productivity by 25 % the first day . here 's a video with clips from joe rogan , ray lewis and brian tracy on the importance of writing things down : now go write your way to success and check off each step along the way !
