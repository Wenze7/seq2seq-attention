        "the summer storm has forced the closure of taranaki 's lee breakwater boat ramp and pontoon and also damaged the carpark as it swept across the region on friday . port taranaki acting chief executive mark webb said storm surges during high tide early this afternoon caused damage to the public carpark , the pontoon and the approaches to the boat ramp . `` the combination of very high tides and very large seas has resulted in a lot of energy hitting the breakwater and the carpark , '' he said . `` rocks have been thrown on to the carpark and there are a number of potholes in the area . '' ",
        "the carpark also flooded , and boulders have been placed near the boat ramp to restrict access . read more * live : storm turns fatal , amid evacuations , road closures and widespread flooding * pants down at bryan adams gig * storm a ` morale boost ' for farmers `` the boat ramp and pontoon have been closed until an engineering assessment can be carried out and repair work completed . '' some work to repair the damage in the public carpark was being carried out on friday afternoon but further work was expected to be required after the next high tide at 1.33 am saturday , webb said . ",
        "`` we are expecting similar swells at high tide overnight and we will close the gates during that time . '' the port operational area was not damaged during the storm surges but no shipping activities were expected until monday . while the region escaped the worst of the weather that caused widespread chaos around the north of the island and on the east coast , the deluge caused river levels to rise and brought down slips at mt messenger and tongaporutu . the heavy swells also caused more erosion at east beach waitara which caused some residents concerns fearing they might be flooded .

        "a lightning strike is believed to have knocked out the electricity supply to waverley in the early hours of friday morning but power was restored by midday . and a man in his 80s was knocked over near the wind wand on new plymouth 's coastal walkway while he filmed the big swells . in the 24 hours until midday on friday , dawson falls received 166 mm of rain , 32 mm fell at new plymouth airport , inglewood had 53.5 mm , stratford received 41.5 mm and hawera 23.6 mm . a further 70 mm to 100 mm was forecast to fall on mt taranaki until 9 pm on friday . ",
        "metservice meteorologist claire flynn said the worst of the bad weather should have passed by friday night . `` on saturday things should be clearing up as the day goes on and the winds should be easing as well , '' flynn said . `` there will be a few showers around tomorrow morning but by the end of the morning they should be isolated . '' she said the sun should be out on sunday . `` it 's looking like another mostly fine day . you might just get some cloud around first thing in the morning but then that should clear up and it should be sunny for the rest of the day . '' ",
        "at 7 pm on friday contractors were still working to clear slips on mt messenger , where a tunnel was flooded and traffic was down to one lane . closer to home , belt road seaside holiday park owner anna crawford said nobody had packed up and left because of the storm . `` we have still got a few in tents , some people are still braving the weather , '' crawford said . `` everyone is still really positive and happy . '' she said there were more holiday makers expected to arrive during the weekend . florian kimmerle , 22 , of germany , arrived in new plymouth on thursday hoping to go tramping on mt taranaki but the weather spoilt his plans and his sleep . ",
        "`` we did n't get to see that much , we 've just been chilling in the car , '' he said . `` it was a little bit scary and super windy . when i woke up my tent was a little bit wet inside but i 'm still alive . '' oops #waves went next level #morebestsummerever @morefmradio great #summer lol #rain #wind #storm #beach #sea #ocean #screaming #women #funnyvideo #video #movie #taranaki #camping @taranakidailynews @flippin_turtle a post shared by andrea on kimmerle said he hoped the rain stopped during his four day stay so he could get up the mountain . ",
        "french tourists , guilia gattigo and camille lehmann , both 23 , were n't letting the wet weather dampen their spirits and hopes to go hiking . `` we are waiting for the good weather to do that , '' gattigo said . `` it 's our fist time so it 's ok . '' the girls were sleeping in the back of their van . new plymouth 's thorpe family , dad antony , evan , 14 , daina , 10 and robyn , 12 , were making the most it by playing in the spray created as big waves crashed over the breakwater at port taranaki . ",
        "`` you have got to have some fun , '' robyn said . the wild weather also rocked the urenui beach camp , north of new plymouth , which had been basking in warm sunshine just 48 hours earlier . owner teresa hayston said staff had n't given campers any warnings . `` we 're just keeping an eye on everything at the moment . `` high tide has just gone and we got through that without issue . '' hayston said she had n't seen too many people leave because of the weather . `` taranaki campers are pretty hardy . '' ",
        "esther olsson , east beach waitara , watched as the big swells washed away the bank in front of her home . `` we are worried , it 's a spring tide , '' olsson said . `` we 're worried about flooding , we have had this before . '' olsson said there needed to be some protection installed to prevent further erosion . `` we want boulders down here , right along the whole beach . '' new plymouth man peter sheaf got more than he bargained for when he was recording the waves lashing the coastal walkway about midday . ",
        "`` the next moment i was swept off my feet and into the bushes , '' sheaf said . `` it took me about two minutes to recover and climb out . '' sheaf said he had never seen the waves so high . `` that 's all the excitement i need for this afternoon . ''   "
