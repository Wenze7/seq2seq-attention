        "live edmonton more streams the season of gift-giving produces twice as much waste for edmonton 's waste management centre during the two weeks after christmas than the rest of january and february combined , according to the city . some of the waste comes from gift packaging , cardboard boxes and other materials that clog up the city 's recycling bins . `` its really important to understand what goes where , '' edmonton public education specialist neil burkard told cbc news wednesday . the city has developed a waste management app which tells edmontonians where to put those christmas odds and ends . ",
        "for example , typical holiday decorations like christmas lights do n't belong in regular recycling bins . christmas lights should be taken to one of edmonton 's eco stations for household hazardous waste , electronics and yard waste . to avoid more waste next year , burkard suggests people reconsider what they give to friends and family . instead of using plastic wrapping paper , he recommends reusing paper wrapping or gift boxes and bags made of fabric . food waste ` number one ' during holidays the largest contributor to waste during the holiday season , burkard said , comes from those holiday leftovers sitting in your fridge . ",
        "`` food waste is still the number one thing we see going into the recycling when it obviously does n't belong there , '' burkard said . a 2017 report commissioned by alberta agriculture and forestry notes that canadians dispose of $ 31 billion worth of food annually , or roughly two per cent of the country 's total gdp . the same study found that albertans have the `` dubious reputation '' of wasting the most food per person in canada . the most recent numbers show that edmontonians produced 334 kilograms of waste in 2015 , down from 340 kilograms in 2014 .
