        "many times i 've seen event organisers , publishers , employers and various initiative leaders being genuinely surprised that the diversity outcome of their efforts was less than ideal . `` but our call for proposals was open '' or `` anyone can participate ! '' they tend to say . unfortunately , these excuses are not good enough and let me tell you why . we ca n't expect underrepresented individuals to show up when their daily lives are filled with harassment , fear and unequal treatment . it 's an unfair assumption to make . we do n't want to partake in events , communities or be employed by organisations furthering exclusion and toxic culture and the only way to tell the difference is though visible commitment , actions , programs or proactive outreach . ",
        "and even then , there are no guarantees . simply opening up an opportunity to broader public does n't constitute an inclusion strategy . we have to be much more deliberate and proactive to create a welcoming space . how to practice proactivitynaturally , there are no universal , catch-all solutions to multiple scenarios , but there are a few strategies that can be applied especially in the tech event and publishing space . outreachthere are multiple lists of underrepresented groups willing to speak at conferences or contribute articles . while listicles are n't a solution , they provide an endless resource for outreach . ",
        "seek individuals out , especially those , who are n't typically featured . if you 're following an anonymous submission process , invite them to take part in call for proposals , articles or participation . ensure you provide clear guidelines for applications , deadlines , what you 're offering and explain your commitment to inclusion . during that process , for many , it seems natural to ask members of underrepresented groups for help or recommendations -- resist that urge . you 're putting extra pressure and requesting free labour from people who already have more than enough on their plates . ",
        "moreover , often those people do the same research you 'd perform to find out who to recommend . do your homework . there 's no excuse for failing to explore diversity in the interconnected world of the web . we have more possibilities to reach people than ever before . governancerecently , i wrote how lack of a code of conduct is better than the presence of a failing one . again , expecting underrepresented groups to participate in spaces without governance or lack of enforceable conduct is n't realistic . one of my basic expectations is a sense of safety , predictable process and accountability from the stewards of the community . ",
        "read about code of conducts . implement and enforce one in your community . communicate it visibly and often . going beyond genderoften , diversity efforts are focused solely on gender . while it 's reasonable to start somewhere , diversity and inclusion are nowhere near one dimensional . there are other underrepresented groups including , but not limited to lgbtqi + community , african-american , latina or latino and people with disabilities . the list becomes long even without mentioning the concept of intersectionality and how different types of oppression interconnect and affect people in various ways . we need to be inclusive of all of these groups . ",
        "accessibilityputting accessibility on the forefront is necessary . we need to be ready to offer support to those in difficult situations , less flexible working arrangements , primary caregivers and people with varying degrees of disability . especially in the event space , outlining what to expect becomes crucial to welcoming anyone with hearing , sight impairments or mobility issues . accessibility statements cater to a much broader audience , setting the tone for the level of support and comfort to anticipate . transparency and intentional communication benefits all , but especially the underrepresented groups . these are only a few , reasonably basic strategies to start with on your quest for proactive inclusion .
