        "line matching is uniform around the league as coaches look to give their players an edge . the nashville predators were on the short end thursday . line matching has been around forever and is used for many reasons . sometimes it 's to match an offensive line against a defensive liability , sometimes it 's to match an airtight defensive pair against sidney crosby . it happens for many reasons , and the nashville predators use it more than any team in the nhl . the main reason that the predators are so deadly at home is their matching , as p. k. subban shuts down an opponent 's star player so that roman josi can cut through second and third liners like swiss cheese . ",
        "josi is n't exactly getting easy starts , as mattias ekholm has bolstered his defensive game , but he 's still eating easier minutes than subban . the same goes for the turris line . jofa used to receive some favorable zone starts against less than impressive competition because laviolette wanted to squeeze every ounce of offense out of them . the harder minutes then fell onto the fisher line . now it 's a different story , johansen and co are playing against top competition at home so that turris can capitalize on poor match-ups . not many teams have the defense to match the predators ' top six , which allows the predators to dictate the pace of the game . ",
        "but it 's not the same on the road , where other teams get to pick and choose their matchups . some lines , on offense and defense , got picked on and the numbers show it . so let 's dive in and see who was getting picked on . for an explanation of the stats i 'll use , reference this article . the turris linelast night was a bit weird , as the turris line only saw about 9 minutes at five on five , even though twelve minutes in total were spent on the power play or penalty kill . ",
        "those 9 minutes were not pretty , as the line put up a 36.84 % corsi and a 46.15 % fenwick . last night was rough as the nashville predators did n't start many shifts in the offensive zone , and so the turris line was n't sheltered . they started in the offensive zone 33 % of the time . what 's worse is that four of those six zone starts were against the mcdavid line . mcjesus , as subban called him , was impressively neutralized though . the turris line owned an 80 % corsi and 100 % fenwick against the mcdavid line and fared equally well against oscar klefbom and matt benning . ",
        "oddly enough , it was the second and third line that had their way with turris . the nugent-hopkins line was kept to 50 % corsi , while the draisaitl line owned a 75 % corsi . it should be mentioned that the turris line gave up no high danger chances . the usual defensive liabilities were airtight against the second best player in the world . the johansen lineif you 'll remember , the jofa line was kept apart in favor of bonino-johansen-arvidsson . that line was below average with a corsi of 46.43 % and a fenwick of 36.84 % . ",
        "this line got absolutely no protection from laviolette as they started in the offensive zone 26 % of the time . they saw the defensive zone 11 times last night alone , more than johansen probably saw it all of last year . they did combine for one high danger chance but they gave up three on their own net . the joba line saw mcdaddy for 6 minutes and 45 seconds on thursday . what 's wore is that mcdavid started in the offensive zone 66 % of the time . they were being trusted to handle the toughest match-up in the nhl in the worst situation possible . ",
        "what 's most impressive is they kept him off the scoresheet . boja actually started in the offensive zone less than 50 % of the time against every player they saw . that is , except the fourth line . but that was only for about two minutes and one zone start . clearly , head coach todd mclellan liked what he saw against the jab line , because draisaitl and mcdavid saw them for about 10 minutes last night . nevertheless , juuse saros stood tall and helped bail out jab , although they were n't hot garbage . ",
        "the jarnkrok linei 'd call them the positive possession line , but that 's too on the nose . they owned a 54.85 % corsi and a 58.82 % fenwick with four high danger chances and three against . four high danger chances in 11 minutes at five on five is fantastic . but a line with jarnkrok and forsberg should n't be giving up three . what may explain that number is that they started in the offensive zone 28 % of the time . this line saw more favorable matchups than the rest of the team though , as they only met mcdavid for 4 minutes . ",
        "in those four minutes though , mcdavid crushed them . he left them with a 27.27 % corsi and a 14.29 % fenwick . they gave up all three of their high danger chances to mcdavid but did manage one of their own . the jarnkrok line then ran over the draisaitl and fourth line . they owned a 66 % corsi and 85.71 % fenwick against the draisaitl group . they completely erased the group as jarnkrok kept them to zero high danger chances and one shot in about four minutes . defenseroman josi and mattias ekholm saw about 9 minutes of mcdavid last night , and it went poorly . ",
        "the pairing was hemmed in their own zone , although they got no help from laviolette as they started in the defensive zone twice against him . they ended a night with a 35 % corsi and an 18.18 % fenwick against mcdavid . in the end , the defense made mcdavid pay as they scored a goal on him , despite the fact mcdavid put up all of his danger chances against them . mattias ekholm was brilliant all night , and he had to be . he did everything humanly possible to slow down mcdavid , sometimes resorting to some less than legal tactics . ",
        "but in the end , ekholm and josi kept mcdavid off the scoresheet , which is an achievement in its own right . here 's where zone matching comes in though , mcdavid only saw p. k. subban for about four minutes last night . this was clearly a matchup that todd mclellan wanted to avoid . subban was the only player to manage a 50 % fenwick with mcdavid in significant minutes . he was only kept to five zone starts against mcdavid but did his best to keep him invisible . subban only surrendered one shot and two scoring chances , with none being high danger . ",
        "i have absolute faith that a pairing of ekholm and subban could do this over a full game , as well as a seven-game series . it 's been done before , actually by oilers ' teammate darnell nurse back in the ohl . the third pairing was a mess , no matter who it was against . the oilers showed mercy by not continuously matching them up against mcdavid , but draisaitl and nugent-hopkins did their own damage . yannick weber and anthony bitetto owned a 40.63 % corsi and a 45 % fenwick in about 11 minutes . ",
        "not terrible numbers , but they were sheltered more than any line on the ice as they started in the offensive zone 70 % of the time . the nashville predators were robbing josi and subban of decent starts to minimize how much defense the third pair would have to play . in the endi do n't think anyone can argue that the nashville predators deserved to win that game . the only thing to take solace in was the power play remaining hot , although they 're riding a high pdo wave , as well as juuse saros dominating . ",
        "a similar performance will not result in a win against most other teams . let 's hope it was the travel and the back to back that kept the nashville predators on their heels . a chance at redemption comes tomorrow against a red-hot flames team . more from predlines nashville predators : how on earth did nashville win that game ? 19h ago nashville predators : five thoughts for friday , december 15th23h ago nashville predators : somebody go give anders nilsson a hug1 d ago nashville predators : canadian road trip continues in edmonton1 d ago nashville predators : why the predators will not win the stanley cup1 d ago line matching is uniform around the league as coaches look to give their players an edge .
