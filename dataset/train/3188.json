        "our autism journeythe words are coming more and more every day . owen woke about four , came to my room , stood by my bed , and said , `` i want milk pwease '' . i said , it 's nighttime and he crawled in bed and then over me . i was kinda shocked by all of this . and why i still get shocked about things amazes me , as well . he , we fell in and out of sleep until after six . that statement was made again , `` i want milk pwease '' . ",
        "his language is coming , the words are forming , but there are still letters he is having trouble with , but for his age and delay , i am beyond thankful for where we are today . this is where the brain and language fascinates me . in one sentence he says , `` milk '' with the l sound and the word `` pwease '' with more of a w sound . so many of his words are like this , with other letters too . i know it has to do with placement of the letters and how he hears things , and his development as well , but it still all fascinates me . ",
        "i remember sitting on the floor with owen , his speech teacher was here . we were trying to get him to ask for food . at the time he loved nuts . for her he would try almost anything , on his terms and on his time . he had to say `` nut '' before we gave it to him . oh , how i wanted him to do it . i sat there silently praying , while i had my own internal struggle to sit there not handing him a nut . i 'm a comforter , i did n't want him mad , or upset , or sad ; and most of all i did n't want him to go hungry . ",
        "okay , so this is where the momma brain has to take a back seat and encourage my child to speak , to react . honestly , this takes a lot of retraining for your brain . your child screams and the first reaction is make it stop , or at least that was mine . for owen , he needed those rules enforced . he still does and is doing amazing with them . at first i was giving in too easily . because he knew if he screamed i would hop up and get his milk . back then it was a lot harder on us . ",
        "he really was saying very few words and never much got a response of any kind when i would ask him questions . he would also retreat into himself . he would go from at least looking at me to turning his head and his eyes would travel to the corners of the room , but not looking at anything . i still see this happening when he is not able to process something or about to go into meltdown mode . i 'm learning to be calmer , finding the patience that i remind him about so many times . ",
        "he ran to me with his game and said , `` no wives '' . i thought , oh how , i love my little boy , the little boy that is teaching me about life and love . find your patience and make today matter . smiles to all and donut daze !   "
