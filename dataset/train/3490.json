        "sai dasarimr . wilsonenglish i16 november 2017when should you compromise ? jim began his freshman year recently . he is an avid user of social media and is a perfect all a 's student . one terrible afternoon he came upon a dilemma : should he spend time on his massive workload or should he start texting his friends who do n't have as much work and are practically begging him to join in the conversation ? he pondered over the heart-wrenching problem as several people awaited his opinion . all teens come to a decision , like jim , at which compromise is the only possible route of success . ",
        "everyone can figure out when to compromise by themselves . it is subject to several factors , all of which are weighted differently depending on the situation . so rather than `` when should you compromise ? '' , the more accurate question to ask is , `` do teens compromise too much ? '' and for that question , teens do in fact compromise too much , and this conjecture is based upon the following two contentions on the following three contentions . firstly , teens nowadays are n't sleeping well . according to nationwidechildrens , the average amount of sleep is seven hours , even though the suggested amount is 9.25 hours . ",
        "this is far less than what children should be getting . this negatively impacts teenagers in several different ways , most importantly of which is how it affects their studying . studies by the national sleep foundation show that students who sleep less do worse in studying than students who sleep the recommended amount . studies by the sleep doctor show that as little as 15 % get enough sleep each night . they think it 's fine and that they are getting more time by cheating the system of sleep . little do they know they are really by depriving themselves of this fundamental state , and they are compromising on thinking , behavior , emotions , sociality , and academics . ",
        "some might argue that seven hours is n't any less than how much adults nowadays sleep so it ca n't be that damaging because they will sleep the same amount in the future . although that is true , essential functions and growth take place during the teenage phase and this can negatively affect the teenagers future which is a compromise not worth taking . all of these outputs from loss of sleep come out negatively . it is clear that the reason children sleep less is partially due to homework . secondly , teens compromise too much on their homework . ",
        "a metlife study found that half of the students from grades 7 -- 12 spend less than an hour of homework each night . even at grade 7 , the national education association recommends 70 minutes for seventh graders and 10 more minutes per grade . this clearly shows that half of these students are n't working hard or giving any effort towards the homework . it is clear that most of these youth candidates are actually not trying as hard as they should be on their homework . people who oppose this argument might say that teenagers are teenagers and therefore in that way they should be open to opportunities and they should learn more about themselves during this phase rather than working more on homework . ",
        "it is very true that teenagers should do more than just do work , but it is important to recognize that this is an extremely competitive world . the last few generations got by by just going through high school for a decent job , but now a high school diploma means about nothing and the more competitive job market is searching for people who are better and harder workers in general . therefore , in that way they are looking for those who work hard and will do as much as they can to succeed . homework plays a large role in determining this . ",
        "homework can gauge success by showing who can work hard as well as that it affects the grade which play an crucial role in how colleges and jobs pick their next candidate . a lot of the time teens are n't spending enough time on homework is because electronic social media devices are far more interesting than algebra , as well as other distractions such as hunger or thirst . lastly , social media often causes the compromise to live , physical world communication . according to the huffington post , 72 % of people in the us use social media , and this is concerning considering that people are n't able to be physically interactive in society as much anymore . ",
        "a survey done by sciencedaily found that 76 % of teens use instagram , 75 % are on snapchat , and 66 % use facebook and the list continues . teenagers nowadays use a lot of online social platforming and compromise on those real person conversations to keep their streaks on snapchat alive or send pictures on instagram of their daily activities for the excitement that someone may like it . some might argue that not using social media would be compromising on communication . this is true and social media is good in moderation , but excessive usage is more hurtful than helpful . ",
        "excessive usage is hurtful in several ways , but for the purpose of this argument the main reason is that it 's just a waste of time and a loss of real connection . deeper more meaningful connections with people are formed when in person , not through texting . overall , person to person conversations are more important than the ones with phones in between . although it does n't seem so much at first glance , teenagers really do need to stop compromising on a variety of different experiences . it is fine that they do so a little but just like all else too much of something could have a negative influence . ",
        "as a people in general we should make sure that we should pay attention to the real , important things and we should keep distractions away . that way , we can get the important things done , and we can prioritize for the benefit of ourselves and those around us . when jim was confronted by this scenario , he realized the important matters at and sacrificed what was nonessential rather than what was vital . he cut down on his social media for the day but saved his sleep , grades/homework , and learns that one day of not texting would n't hurt his friends .
