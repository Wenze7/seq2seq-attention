        "busy , productive and successful are not the same thing . busy people may look productive and therefore successful , but in reality they 're often so busy juggling all their commitments to keep anything from falling through the cracks , they miss the important opportunities that could actually increase their success . it feels good to be needed . being `` in demand '' can stroke the ego . it feels good to be able to help , but when we fall into the trap of thinking we need to be involved in or responsible for everything , we are n't doing ourselves -- or anyone else -- any favors . ",
        "i enjoy having opportunities to serve and to be involved in my communities , but i have learned that involvement comes at a price . providing my business services for free can hurt my business . when i fail to value my time and talents , others fail to value them as well and come to expect free all the time . if i am working for free or volunteering for too many causes i am giving away opportunities where i can earn money to meet the needs of my family . and when i say yes to too many opportunities to provide personal service to others , i am giving away the time i need to meet the needs of my family . ",
        "when you say yes to every request that comes along , whether it is business or personal , you will eventually have no time left for the things that are necessary or important to you . you allow someone else to choose your priorities . you also torpedo your business and personal success with all those other activities that take time away from what 's really important . i am not saying you should n't serve or help -- that 's not what this blog post is about . it 's about learning to distinguish between good , better and best , and learning when to decline good and better so you can focus on `` best .
