        "screenwriter jack thorne has revealed his intention to pen a drama about the grenfell tower disaster . jack , who penned 2016 's ` national treasure ' and the upcoming drama ` kiri ' , has said he hopes to make a show about the tragedy on channel 4 , telling the daily star : `` i think we 're all responsible and we 've got to work out a way to come to terms with it . '' he explained : `` grenfell is something we should be working out how to dramatise . `` i still ca n't believe it happened in our country . ",
        "i ca n't believe we inflicted that on people in a country that is supposed to have money . and i ca n't believe that they were screaming out for help and no one listened . '' in june last year , the grenfell tower blaze led to 71 deaths , with jack 's recent comments echoing what many figures in the public eye have been saying about the disaster since it happened . stars like adele and lily allen have both been vocal in raising awareness in the aftermath of the disaster , with the ` someone like you ' singer delivering a speech about the `` neglect '' that those whose lives have been permanently changed by the incident were facing . ",
        "similarly , stormzy used his performance at glastonbury festival as a platform to speak about grenfell , calling for the government to be `` held accountable '' . he told fans during his set : `` we are urging the authorities to tell the truth , first and foremost , to do something , first and foremost , and we are urging the government to be held accountable .
