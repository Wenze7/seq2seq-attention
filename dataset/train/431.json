        "finding a balance between work and career is a major challenge for anyone who has a child of any age and a job of any type . those challenges only multiply when you decide to venture out into creating your own startup . suddenly , work is n't just an obligation -- it 's your entire life . and while you 'd love to take the day off and spend time with your kids , you know that doing so will only make it harder for you to achieve your goals . there 's only one thing that 's guaranteed when you try to juggle family with a startup : no matter what you do , you 'll be convinced that you 're doing a horrible job . ",
        "in reality , though , you 're probably not doing as bad a job as you think . the very fact that you 're interested in finding a balance shows that your heart is in the right place . and these tips may help you to get the most out of life . know what you want : it seems like a simple concept , but it 's one we often forget when we 're mired in our work . what do you want your startup to be ? how big do you want your business to get ? what you do you want your family life to be like ? ",
        "if you can answer these questions and visualize your ideal future , you 'll have an idea of what to strive for . just as importantly , you 'll know when to pull back if you notice work taking on too much importance in your life . talk to your kids : no child is ever going to understand the dynamics of the working world . but you can at least do your part to make sure they understand that you 're trying to create something special and the circumstances that arise as a result of your decision to go the startup route . ",
        "this will help them to take pride in what you do and it 'll also help you to manage those situations when work has to come first . bring your kids to work : while explaining your situation will help you get a little peace of mind , showing them what you do every day will take you even further . your kids will feel like a part of the business and when they see exactly what your job entails , they 'll be even more understanding if you have to work late or miss a game . set hours : it 's not uncommon for startups to dominate the lives of those who pursue them . ",
        "every second you 're not working , in theory , is an opportunity you 're missing out on . but without boundaries , you can drive yourself crazy in that line of thinking . and while it might not be possible to have a schedule that 's entirely set in stone , you can at least set guidelines that will help to keep you sane -- and can keep your family time intact . create family rituals : you might not be able to make it home in time for dinner every night and you probably ca n't get to every baseball practice . ",
        "that 's fine . what you can do , though , is create smaller family events that everyone looks forward to . it can be something as simple as a movie night on saturdays or a trip to the family 's favorite restaurant . those smaller family times are the ones that reinforce your bonds with your kids and keep you close with each other . even if work is overwhelming at times , at least you 'll have something you can look forward to . take advantage of your irregular schedule : startup life is n't a typical 9-to-5 . ",
        "sometimes that 's bad but other times it can actually work to your advantage . having a little flexibility in your schedule means you can attend in-school events that many parents ca n't . those school assemblies and special person days the average parent ca n't get out of work for ? you 'll be there . know when to quit for the day : when the kids go to bed , that 's your time . but it 's not your time to obsess over work . it 's time for you to focus on yourself , your hobbies and your health -- especially your mental health . ",
        "having that break enables you to get your mind off of work and any anxieties you may have about getting your startup where you want it to be . do n't forget about romance : your kids might be your top priority , but it 's important to remember your partner . regular date nights will keep that spark alive and give you the opportunity to truly talk to your partner about life , about each other and about your business . as is the case with your kids , keeping him or her in the loop will help them to feel like they 're a part of things . ",
        "and that support will carry you through the tough times . give yourself some credit : the balance you 're striving to find is n't easy to locate . many people struggle with this issue , but that 's far better than those who are too to willing to let work dominate their lives , letting their families suffer on the side . it 's crucial that you do n't beat yourself when you feel like you 're struggling . you ca n't function at a high level if you feel like you have the weight of the world on your shoulders . ",
        "it never hurts to take a minute to realize you 're doing everything you can and that you 're doing a great job . balancing family life with work is always a work in progress . you may never feel like you have the work-life balance you want . but if you make it a priority , you 'll find that you 'll usually be closer than you think .
