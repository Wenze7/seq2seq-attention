",
        "he calls ivanka trump `` dumb as a brick '' and describes the meeting between donald trump jr and a russian lawyer as `` treasonous '' and `` unpatriotic '' . when asked about the likely outcome of the russia investigation , bannon said : `` they 're going to crack don junior like an egg on national tv .

        "`` steve bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency , '' trump said . `` when he was fired , he not only lost his job , he lost his mind . '' according to the new york times , `` mr. trump went through at least three drafts of a statement with his communications director , hope hicks , and other aides before sending out a final version unlike any issued by a president against a top adviser in modern times . '' wolff 's book also suggests that trump did not expect to beat hillary clinton , and that he was alarmed when he drew ahead of her . ",
        "`` a befuddled trump morphing into a disbelieving trump and then into a horrified trump , '' is how bannon describes him . wolff writes : `` shortly after 8 pm on election night , when the unexpected trend -- trump might actually win -- seemed confirmed , don jr. . told a friend that his father , or djt , as he calls him , looked as if he had seen a ghost . melania was in tears -- and not of joy . '' white house press secretary sarah saunders said the book is `` filled with false and misleading accounts '' and is `` trashy tabloid fiction '' . "
