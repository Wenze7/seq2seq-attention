        "after having landed the lucrative role of being the official global brand ambassador for revlon , a city located in northern israel has now announced that it will be naming a brand new cinema after the wonder woman actress . gal gadot has recently become a household name in hollywood mostly thanks to her break out role as a dc comics superhero in batman v superman : dawn of justice and the highly successful standalone film wonder woman . amidst the various boycott of foreign films and the uneasy tension in the middle east , the town of upper nazareth in northern israel announced on tuesday that it 's officially naming its brand new cinema after the israeli-born actress . ",
        "the cinema , which will be named `` gal cinema , '' is located in the city of nazareth illit . the cinema is scheduled to open this week with the eran riklis-directed movie shelter being the first film to be screened . in a statement to afp , a municipal spokeswoman explained that it was their honor to name the cinema after gal gadot seeing as that the actress has brought nothing but honor to their country . the decision was also meant to impart an inspiring message to the youth in israel , a message that showcases gadot as a shining `` example of success '' and that dreams can come true . ",
        "the 32-year-old actress started her path towards stardom at an early age . gadot won the miss israeli beauty pageant when she was just 18-years-old in 2004 . israel practices the mandatory conscription of women into the israel defense forces , which resulted in gadot serving two years in the military as a combat instructor . gadot then broke into the hollywood scene with a supporting role in the 2009 film fast & furious . this was then followed by smaller roles in various films including date night and knight and day . the actress reportedly considered quitting her acting career at one point before she was offered the lead role in wonder woman . ",
        "just last week , beauty products and cosmetics giant revlon announced that it has chosen gadot to become the face of its upcoming beauty campaign . landing the prestigious role of being the spokesperson of a major brand is quite a big step for the actress as it will essentially cement her status as one of hollywood 's elite . the contract will also likely give her a substantially fatter paycheck in future projects moving forward . the actress reportedly only received a measly $ 300,000 salary for wonder woman because of her entry-level status . gadot 's role with revlon has also recently sparked a controversy following the rejection of the cosmetic company 's changemaker award by the muslim author and activist amani al-khatahtbeh . ",
        "in a recent post on instagram , amani explained that she can not accept the award while gadot is the brand 's ambassador due to her vocal support of the israeli defense forces ' actions in palestine . amidst revlon controversy gal gadot has israeli cinema named after her is an article from : the inquisitr .
