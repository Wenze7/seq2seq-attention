        "lg introduced its commercial robots last year and it has now unveiled three new work robots at the consumer electronics show 2018 . these new concepts have been developed for commercial use at hotels , airports , and supermarkets . positioned under lg 's cloi robot brand , the cloi porter , shopping cart , and serving robot follow in the footsteps of the cloi airport guide and airport cleaning robot introduced last year . those robots are already deployed in a trial at south korea 's incheon international airport . the cloi serving robot is capable of delivering food and beverage to hotel guests and visitors to airport lounges quickly and efficiently . ",
        "the robot features a built-in sliding tray to transport the items . once delivery has been confirmed by the customer , the serving robot will make its way back to the kitchen independently . the porter robot has been designed to help reduce inconvenience for travelers by cutting down on long wait times and reducing slow service . it can also help in express check-in and check-out service at hotels by taking care of payment matters and delivering luggage to a waiting vehicle . lg 's cloi shopping cart robot has a barcode reader that customers can use to scan items and view product prices as they 're placed inside the robot 's bin . ",
        "the robot 's face will also show all items on a shopping list and the companion app will guide the customer through the store via the most efficient route . these concepts may be deployed in trials later this year .   "
