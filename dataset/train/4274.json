        "blue bottle jelly fish are giving north auckland swimmers a nasty surprise , and leaving even nastier marks to remember the experience . also known as the portuguese man o ' war or the `` floating terror '' , the jellyfish have been spotted at orewa , red beach and stanmore bay on the hibiscus coast . a woman swimming near the stanmore bay beach pontoon on wednesday was left with stings and welts all over her hands after tentacles wrapped around them . `` i immediately felt a burning sensation on my hands and saw the tentacles . they were hard to remove and i had to rub them off with sand while they were still stinging , '' the swimmer , who did n't want to be named said . ",
        "she was keen to get the message out for people to be aware and provided stuff . co. nz photos of the damage to her hands . `` i would n't wish it upon anyone - especially little ones , '' she said . lemon juice and warm water was used to initially treat the wounds and then the woman headed to the doctor for antihistamines . the blue bottle is not a true jellyfish so its sting treatment differs from that of other jellyfish . vinegar should not be applied to the stings , as this will make blue bottle stings more painful , according to the auckland regional public health service . ",
        "the service recommends washing the effected area with saltwater , remove any tentacles or stings attached to the skin -- without touching them with bare hands as the can continue to sting and then place the affected area in warm water . if the reaction is severe or symptoms worsen , antihistamines and steroid creams may help . if a person develops reduced consciousness or difficulty breathing call 111 . after witnessing photos of the stanmore bay swimmer 's injuries and hearing further reports of blue bottle jellyfish , auckland council has added an alert to warn swimmers of potential jellyfish dangers at hibiscus coast beaches on its safeswim website .
