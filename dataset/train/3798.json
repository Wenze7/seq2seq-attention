        "chancellor merkel has called for the deployment of anti-terror troops in africa 's troubled sahel region . european and african leaders met for talks outside paris to discuss plans to battle the growing jihadi threat . german chancellor angela merkel told the summit of leaders on wednesday that making a counter-terrorism force operational on the ground in the sahel was a matter of `` urgency . '' `` islamic terrorism is spreading . we can not wait . we need to start leading the fight as soon as possible , '' merkel said . `` this is an urgent task . ",
