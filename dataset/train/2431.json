        "acting ice director thomas homan on thursday reiterated his position that sanctuary city leaders should be held accountable if they violate federal laws on illegal immigration . `` what i said i meant , '' homan said on fox news ' `` fox & friends '' about his interview last week with neil cavuto , during which he said mayors , city managers et al should be charged for harboring illegals . `` what i said was sanctuary cities is a public safety threat . it 's an officer safety threat , '' homan said thursday . homan said he has asked attorney general jeff sessions and the department of justice to look at sanctuary cities and answer one question . ",
        "`` i want you to tell me in your opinion , at the department of justice , are they violating federal law ? '' homan said . homan cited one smuggling statute that references `` knowingly shielding and harboring illegal aliens from enforcement . '' `` if denied access to a jail , we know there is an illegal alien in that jail that 's been arrested for a crime , if we are denied information , if we are denied access , is that a violation of federal statute ? and if it is , let 's hold somebody accountable , '' homan said on fox . ",
        "even if that person is a city leader . `` whoever knowingly and intentionally violates a federal law should be held accountable , '' homan said . `` i 'm providing data and information on sanctuary cities and what access i do or -- more importantly -- what access i do n't have . they 'll make that determination and we 'll take action based on their findings , '' homan said .
