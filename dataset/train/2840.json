        "htc is gearing up to announce a new smartphone . the company has published a press invite on its weibo account for an event taking place on january 15 in china , where it 's expected to take the wraps off the u11 eyes . this has n't officially been confirmed yet , but it 's a safe bet given the fact that htc emphasized the word eye in its weibo post . although the company has n't shared any details about the device , we already know a lot about it . according to evan blass , it could sport a 6-inch full hd + display , which means it should have an aspect ratio of 18:9 . ",
        "the device is said to be powered by the snapdragon 652 chipset , have 4 gb of ram , and pack a 3,930 mah battery . other specs include 64 gb of expandable storage , an ip67 rating for protection against water , and edge sense that lets you open an app of choice by squeezing the device . the u11 eyes may launch with nougat on board , but will likely get upgraded to oreo somewhere down the line . rumors have it that htc could also reveal another , more powerful variant of the u11 eyes at the event . ",
        "it might come with the snapdragon 660 chipset under the hood , with some claiming it could also sport 6 gb of ram and 128 gb of storage . thanks to evan blass , we also have a good idea of what the htc u11 eyes could look like . he posted alleged images of the device on twitter , which leave little to the imagination -- check them out below . based on the images , the u11 eyes could look a lot like the u11 plus , which is a good thing in my opinion . it has a clean front without branding and a minimalistic glass back that 's eye-catching thanks to its reflective nature . ",
        "the images also reveal that the device may have a dual-camera setup on the front , which makes sense given its name . read next : htc 's 2017 revenues were its lowest in 13 yearsthe snapdragon 652-powered u11 eyes is expected to retail for cny 2,599 , while the beefed-up variant with the snapdragon 660 chipset will set you back cny 3,599 . they are said to go on sale in hong kong on january 17 , followed by a release in china and taiwan soon after . no word on when -- or if -- we 'll see the htc eyes in western markets .
