        "migrant arrivals by sea to spain tripled in 2017 on the previous year , fuelled by a surge in the numbers of algerians and moroccans , while over 200 died trying to make the crossing . migrant arrivals by sea to spain tripled in 2017 on the previous year , fuelled by a surge in the numbers of algerians and moroccans , while over 200 died trying to make the crossing . `` at the end of the year , the tally is devastating , '' the spanish commission for refugees , which defends the right to asylum , said in a statement . ",
        "almost 21,500 people arrived by sea on spain 's southern shores -- popular with northern european tourists -- between january 1 and december 20 , up from 6,046 during the same period last year , according to the international organization for migration . the number of deaths is also up . so far this year 223 people have died or disappeared while trying to reach spain by boat , 95 more than in 2016 . most sea arrivals are reported along the strait of gibraltar which is the narrowest passage of the mediterranean sea separating spain from morocco . smugglers transport migrants to spain on rickety wooden boats , inflatable dinghies , and even jet-skis , charging hundreds of euros for the trip . ",
        "in august footage of sub-saharan african migrants arriving by dinghy on a packed beach in cadiz in the southern region of andalusia in august during the peak summer holiday season went viral on social media , drawing attention to the rise in migrant numbers . `` we are suffering migratory pressure in the entire mediterranean area , '' interior minister juan ignacio zoido said thursday in a radio interview . - ` focused on repression ' - while migrant arrivals rose in spain , they fell in italy and greece , the primary entry point for migrants in europe . ",
        "nearly 119,000 migrants have arrived so far this year in italy , which has put in place more aggressive measures to stem arrivals on its shores , including sending italian military ships to assist the libyan coast guard with patrols and interception . roughly 28,000 migrants arrived in greece , where a 2015 european union deal with turkey has helped stem the flow of people making the narrow but precarious sea crossing from turkish shores to outlying greek islands . both countries each received over 170,000 migrants by sea in 2016 . migrants deaths in attempted crossings of the mediterranean are down overall even as they rose in spain . ",
        "so far this year 3,116 migrants have died or disappeared while trying to cross the mediterranean into europe , down from 4,967 last year , according to the iom . the bulk of the migrants who have arrived in spain in recent years have been from sub-saharan africa but this year has seen a rise from people from morocco and algeria , organisations that work with migrants said . the increase in arrivals from algeria is due to `` the economic situation in the country , which has deteriorated in the last three years '' following a drop in the price of oil , a key export , carlos arce of the human rights association of andalusia told afp . ",
        "social unrest in northern morocco 's rif region is behind the rise in arrivals from that country , he added . moroccan security have been `` more focused on repression than in controlling the flow of migrants '' , arce said . - surfboards and jet-skis - migrant arrivals from morocco to spain have risen since june , the united nations refugee agency said in a report last month . `` moroccans use all sorts of methods to reach spain such as jet-skis , surfboards , inflatable dinghies and wooden boats which sometimes transport over 60 people , '' it said . ",
        "spanish authorities have struggled to cope with the surge in migrant arrivals . the government came under fire from human rights organisations in november after it housed some 500 migrants who arrived in southern spain , mainly from algeria , at an unopened prison due to a lack of space at immigration detention centres . during the last two week `` hundreds of people have been sent back to algeria '' from the prison , including several minors , according to the director of migrant rights group malaga acoge , alejandro cortina . rights groups have called for migrants to be allowed to wait for the outcome of their asylum bid under more lax conditions , by reporting regularly to police or a court . ",
        "but zoido has argued that there is a risk that the migrants would disappear , causing a `` pull effect '' that would lead smugglers to bring more migrants to the country .   "
