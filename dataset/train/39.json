        "credit : nasa/jpl-caltech/ucla / mps/dlr/idawhat is a tholus ? a tholus is a type of small mountain . these images show such a feature on dwarf planet ceres called kwanzaa tholus . kwanzaa , meaning `` first fruits '' in swahili , is an african-american festival based on ancient african harvest celebrations , and takes place each year from december 26 to january 1 . kwanzaa tholus measures about 22 by 12 miles and is elevated about 2 miles above its surroundings . because the mountain does not rise sharply above the ground , it is difficult to see in the mosaic on the left , although a small crescent-shaped shadow stands out . ",
        "the image on the right , which is an elevation map of the area , shows where kwanzaa tholus is more prominently . the rounded shape of kwanzaa tholus is typical of tholi in general , but is different than other examples found on ceres and mars . this region is particularly rich in this type of feature : the current ceres map shows six named tholi and montes in the region and several others including ahuna mons farther south . scientists say kwanzaa tholus may have once been as prominent as ahuna mons , the tallest and most noticeable mountain on ceres . ",
        "ahuna mons is likely a cryovolcano , formed by the gradual accumulation of thick , slowly flowing icy materials . because ice is not strong enough to preserve an elevated structure for extended periods , cryovolcanoes on ceres are expected to gradually collapse over tens of millions of years . this means kwanzaa tholus and other tholi in that area could be degraded mountains , which also formed from cryovolcanic activity . provided by nasathis story is republished courtesy and copyrighted by phys . org , a popular site that covers news about science research . read the original article .
