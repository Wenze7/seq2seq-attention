        "christian bale admits that he still has n't seen ben affleck 's batman movies yet , but he 's interested in checking them out soon . warner bros. ' justice league marked the third dceu appearance for ben affleck as batman , following his debut in batman v superman : dawn of justice and a brief cameo in suicide squad . when batman v superman was first announced , many had hoped that christian bale would return as the dark knight , but that never happened , and since saying goodbye to the batman character , christian bale revealed in a recent interview that he has n't yet seen his successor 's work . ",
        "here 's what the actor had to say in a recent interview . `` i have not . yes i 'm interested , my son seemed like he was really interested , but then i realized he just wanted to see the trailer and that was it . i tend to go see films that want to see . i have to confess i 'm not a huge superhero film fan . people seem surprised at that , i do n't know why . i 've not seen any of the avengers films or any of those films at all . ",
        "i hear they 're very good , but i 'm quite happy just hearing they 're very good . `` this comes just a few weeks after christian bale reflected on batman in another interview , stating that he had mixed emotions about playing batman , but admitted that it opened quite a few doors for him in his career . the actor revealed that it was quite the arduous struggle getting movies made before his first turn as batman in 2005 's batman begins , stating that both american psycho and rescue dawn each took several years to get off the ground , because studios were n't interested in casting him as the lead , but that all changed when he was cast in batman begins , which kicked off a massively successful trilogy that included 2008 's the dark knight and 2012 's the dark knight rises . ",
        "what 's interesting is the studio may be looking for ben affleck 's replacement already , with rumors swirling that the actor is backing out of the batman , which he was once set to star in and direct , from a script he co-wrote with geoff johns . now matt reeves has been brought in to direct , with the filmmaker confirming that he has essentially tossed the script that ben affleck and geoff johns had worked on in the trash . there have been other rumors that ben affleck is leaving the franchise altogether , with jon hamm eying to replace ben affleck as batman , although nothing has been set in stone . ",
        "it 's been more than five years since christian bale 's batman last graced the silver screen in the dark knight rises , but the entire trilogy is still quite beloved by legions of fans . the trilogy was a massive hit , with all three movies earning a combined $ 1.1 billion domestic and $ 2.4 billion worldwide . you can head on over to happy sad confused podcast to listen to the entire interview with christian bale , who is promoting his new movie hostiles , which is currently playing in limited release .
