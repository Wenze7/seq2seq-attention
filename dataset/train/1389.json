        "president trump on wednesday smacked down hard at his former top strategist steve bannon , writing in a statement : `` when he was fired , he not only lost his job , he lost his mind . '' the fiery comments came in light of excerpts from a new book by michael wolff -- titled in fire and fury : inside the trump white house -- in which bannon took shots at trump 's white house and children . `` steve pretends to be at war with the media , which he calls the opposition party , yet he spent his time at the white house leaking false information to the media to make himself seem far more important than he was , '' trump said on wednesday . ",
        "`` steve bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency . '' he also took a jab at bannon 's support for the accused pedophile roy moore , the losing candidate in alabama 's special senate race : `` steve had very little to do with our historic victory , which was delivered by the forgotten men and women of this country . yet steve had everything to do with the loss of a senate seat in alabama held for more than thirty years by republicans . steve does n't represent my base -- he 's only in it for himself .
