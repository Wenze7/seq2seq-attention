        "if you 're a couch potato worried about your heart , you can take charge and reverse damage that 's already occurred if you begin in time , says a new study by cardiologists at ut southwestern and texas health resources . to gain the most benefit , you should begin exercising before the age of 65 , since the heart still retains the ability to remodel itself , say researchers , and you need to exercise four to five times a week . according to previous studies , two to three times a week is n't enough . `` based on a series of studies performed by our team over the past five years , this ` dose ' of exercise has become my prescription for life , '' said senior author dr. benjamin levine , director of the institute and professor of internal medicine at ut southwestern . ",
        "`` i think people should be able to do this as part of their personal hygiene -- just like brushing your teeth and taking a shower . '' in general , the recommended exercise consists of 30-minute sessions , plus warmup and cool-down . one weekly session included a high-intensity workout , such as aerobic interval sessions -- the so-called 4x4 session where a person exercises at a high rate for four minutes , with three minutes of recovery , repeated four times . one session lasted an hour and was of moderate activity , which could be a fun activity such as playing tennis , biking , walking , or dancing . ",
        "one or two other weekly sessions consisted of moderate activity in which the participant would be a little short of breath but still be able to carry on a conversation . another session or two concentrated on strength training using weights or exercise machines . study participants were divided into two groups . one group received two years of supervised exercise training , while the control group participated in yoga and balance training . at the end of the study , those who had exercised showed an 18 percent improvement in their maximum oxygen intake during exercise . they also improved more than 25 percent in elasticity of the left ventricular muscle of the heart , the chamber that pumps oxygen-rich blood back out to the body . ",
        "`` when the muscle stiffens , you get high pressure and the heart chamber does n't fill as well with blood . in its most severe form , blood can back up into the lungs . that 's when heart failure develops , '' said dr. levine , . the study appears in circulation , a journal of the american heart association . combining yoga with aerobic exercise can also benefit hearts . patients with heart disease who participate in yoga as well as aerobic exercise doubled reductions in blood pressure , body mass index , and cholesterol levels when compared to patients who practiced only yoga or aerobic exercise , says a recent report sponsored by the american college of cardiology . ",
        "heart patients were divided into three groups -- those who did aerobic exercise , those who practiced indian yoga , and a group that participated in both yoga and aerobic exercise . at the end of six months , all three groups showed improvement in blood pressure , bmi , cholesterol , and triglycerides , but those who did both showed two times greater reductions . `` combined indian yoga and aerobic exercise reduces mental , physical and vascular stress , and can lead to decreased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity , '' said researcher sonal tanwar . `` heart disease patients could benefit from learning indian yoga and making it a routine part of daily life .
