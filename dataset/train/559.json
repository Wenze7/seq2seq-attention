        "arizona basketball games were going to grow up a bit , and fans were going to be able to purchase alcohol at mckale as early as this season . but not now , or at least not yet . well , someone was going to complain . arizona athletic director dave heeke is trying hard to get fans what they are screaming for , a liquor license . but first , the school had to apply to the arizona state liquor board which they did . according to joe ferguson of the arizona daily star , a protest filed with the arizona state liquor board by one james bly , a local tucson resident of tucson who is also a retired from being an administrative law judge who `` presided over thousands of driver 's license cases with the motor vehicle division that involved duis . ",
        "`` bly 's concern : `` i am concerned that selling liquor at athletic events at the university of arizona will result in more crowd violence , the sale of liquor to minors , and the possibility of lawsuits against the university if a fan at a game is impaired and is in an automobile accident after the game and injures someone , '' he wrote . -- according to fergusonnow i totally understand bly 's concern , as a parent the last thing i would want is anyone getting hurt or injured or hurting or injuring anyone , believe me . ",
        "but today 's generation of young people is way different from the last . they either designate a driver , or they share an uber , or they walk from one side of campus to another . the millennials are very aware of drinking and driving and plan ahead . when i grew up , there was not much education on drinking and driving . a lot of people drove drunk . there was no uber or lyft and in those days no one would take a taxi . at the uofa in about 2009-ish , before uber , taxi cab drivers who worked on campus would pass out their business cards so that the students could call them when they needed a ride home . ",
        "these days , students of age and underage use their phone to call a lyft or uber driver to pick them up . they know when the driver is coming to get them , they know when the driver will arrive and what the car looks like , how much it will cost and if they want to share a ride . it 's so much more sophisticated . friends can even schedule ubers for friends from anywhere in the country . the thing that gets me the most ? university ave is full of bars and liquor . a lot of alumni and students want to drink , so instead of buying a ticket and going to the game , they go to a bar on university and feed the coffers of the businesses drinking and watching the game on tv . ",
        "the school gets no ticket revenue and no sales from alcohol . if an under-age student wants to drink , they will find a way to drink , even if they are still in high school . there will be plenty 21-and-over of their friends willing to help . the under-age kids pregame in cars , it 's called a ` car barring . ' and the rest get all liquored up at their friend 's houses in legitimate pre-game activities before they come to a sporting event . this happens all over the country . bly has a great point about people suing the school . ",
        "but people who sue schools will sue the schools even if they did n't buy alcohol at mckale . i think we need to address under-age drinking as a whole as a society , but not having alcohol at mckale will not stop any drinking . maybe he is just trying to start the conversation and that is admirable . a good solution may be to limit how many beers or glasses of wine people can buy ; i honestly do n't know how you could do that . maybe an app where you have to use your finger to prove it 's you ? ",
        "also , possibly do n't serve high content alcohol , or stop selling in the second half of the game . in some ways , it may be easier to control or limit drinking while in the arena because there are no controls outside the arena . fans drink a ton outside mckale center , a lot more than they would inside the arena . for example , listen to this news report from phoenix about fans up in tempe , fans drinking in bars : arizona 's baseball field , hi corbett , already sells alcohol , and we have n't heard of any issues stemming from drinking at baseball games . ",
        "please let us know if you know differently . i 'm thinking new revenue from alcohol sales could help arizona athletics which is trying to figure out how to pay off their old football coach and hire a new high-profile coach . a new indoor practice field is in the pipeline as well . lagging ticket sales are not helping pad the bank account to pay for these things or better wi-fi either . must more on arizona basketball from zz . . in a perfect world , the complaint would be valid as it is well intended and meaningful , which it is . ",
        "but the real world is not perfect , and the reality is that everyone who wants to drink is drinking and will drink with or without a liquor license . more from zona zealots big loss for arizona football as desert swarm great troy dickey passes1 d ago arizona tight end trevor wood announces transfer1 d ago arizona basketball : commit brandon williams scores season-high 37 points2d ago twitter tries former arizona football coach rich rodriguez after sudden termination2d ago arizona basketball could benefit from a challenge system in ncaa cbb2d ago arizona basketball games were going to grow up a bit , and fans were going to be able to purchase alcohol at mckale as early as this season .
