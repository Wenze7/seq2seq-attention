        "baltimore murders soared in 2017 , with 342 reported homicides taking place this year -- a new record per capita record , the baltimore sun reported . that works out to nearly one murder every day . this means that the homicide rate for this year averages at around 55.8 killings per 100,000 people and , according to wtop , marks an eight percent increase over last year 's 318 murders . the previous record was set in 2015 , when the city suffered 344 homicides ; however , at the time there were thousands more residents in the city . ",
        "`` no one is proud of this violence , '' said baltimore police spokesman t. j. smith earlier in the year , per wtop . `` it should n't be tolerated . we should be doing what we can to make sure there is not another person who is associated with that number . '' amid these soaring statistics mayor catherine pugh announced plans to hold a candlelight vigil on thursday evening while police commissioner kevin davis vowed to implement new crime fighting initiatives . the rising crime rate in baltimore has gained widespread attention over the months . forbes magazine listed baltimore as one of the top 10 most dangerous u. s. cities . ",
        "in november a group of residents held a `` ceasefire '' in an attempt to highlight the violent crime wave . according to the guardian , the participants joined hands , sang , prayed and marched through the streets while putting forth a simple plea : `` nobody kill anybody . '' two homicides taking place on tuesday night further drove home the point that baltimore is in the grip of a serious crime epidemic . in the first incident , an 18-year-old died in the langston hughes neighborhood of northwest baltimore after sustaining gunshot wounds to his body , the baltimore sun said . ",
        "that same night police were called to a scene in the waverly neighborhood of north baltimore where they found a man with multiple gunshot wounds inside a crashed vehicle . he was pronounced dead at a hospital .   "
