        "if weight loss is on your list of new year 's resolutions , you 'll soon be putting together a healthy meal plan , and no doubt there will be a few smoothies thrown in there . smoothies are a great option for a healthy breakfast or snack because they are easy and quick and you can pack a lot of nutrition into just one glass . smoothies can quickly turn into dessert , though , if you are n't careful about what you throw into your blender . we spoke with holistic nutrition consultant julia visser to find out which foods to keep out of your smoothie if you 're trying to keep it weight-loss friendly . ",
        "chocolate chipswe 'd all love for our smoothies to taste just like a chocolate milkshake , but if you go this route , the calories and sugar can add up fast . one-quarter cup of semisweet chocolate chips will add 280 calories and 32 grams of sugar to your smoothie ! you can slash major calories and all of the sugar by subbing cacao nibs or unsweetened cocoa powder instead . if you ca n't resist that chocolate milkshake , try this vegan chocolate milkshake smoothie instead . honeyjust because winnie the pooh can survive off honey does n't mean that you can . ",
        "lots of smoothie recipes include honey , but they are n't necessary . just a few tablespoons of honey can add almost 200 calories to your smoothie . fruit is plenty sweet on its own , so there 's really no reason to add extra sweeteners on top of it . visser also suggests using spices like cinnamon and vanilla to `` give a smoothie plenty of sweetness without the added sugar . '' this almond strawberry-banana yogurt smoothie is sweet as can be , with no added sugar in sight . too much nut butterwe are big fans of peanut butter , but you 've got to keep the spoonfuls in check if weight loss is your goal . ",
        "visser says , `` nut butters are great for satiety , which can actually help with weight loss . '' a tablespoon of peanut butter carries about 100 calories , and that is just for the no-sugar-added varieties . we wo n't deny you if banana and peanut butter is your thing , but it 's best to measure out the nut butter until you 've done it enough times to easily eyeball it . fruit-flavored yogurtyogurt gives smoothies their , well , smooth texture , and avoiding the fruit-flavored varieties is `` key to avoiding too much sugar , '' according to visser . ",
        "an eight-ounce container of plain , nonfat chobani yogurt has only four grams of sugar , but if you opt for the banana fruit on the bottom instead , you 'll be getting 14 grams . that may not seem like a big difference , but it adds up . if you want to get that sweet fruit flavor , stick with real fruit so you can get some fiber . here are a few yogurt-powered smoothies to get you started . so , what 's your favorite healthy smoothie ingredient ?
