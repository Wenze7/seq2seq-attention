        "actress laurie metcalf broke her career-long rule not to watch her own movies until five years after their release for her new drama lady bird . the roseanne star , who has featured in films like the toy story franchise , scream 2 , and georgia rule , appears alongside saoirse ronan in greta gerwig 's directorial debut , about a high school senior eager to leave her california home and escape her overbearing mother , played by metcalf . she has always found it uncomfortable to sit down and view her own projects until she 's been able to fully detach from the role , but the 62-year-old decided she could n't wait that long for the critically-acclaimed lady bird . ",
        "`` i broke my five-year rule where i wo n't look at myself on film with lady bird , '' she shared during a recent screen actors guild event . `` it 's the amount of time i could watch something and not beat myself up about it ! i wanted to be able to watch it fresh and say , ` i 'm not even quite sure why this ends ! ' '' metcalf saw the picture in full for the first time at the 2017 telluride film festival in colorado , and it was a nerve-wracking experience . ",
        "`` we shot lady bird a year ago and i knew we would be having conversations about it , so i thought i 'm gon na have to see it so i would know what the whole movie was about ! there were two thirds of the movie i never saw as i was always in the house fighting with the daughter , '' she explained . `` so i broke my rule and that was jarring to sit through the movie with an audience who was also seeing it for the first time in telluride . `` it was very hard for me to watch myself , but , i thought it was a fantastic ensemble . ",
        "it 's strong . '' metcalf 's performance has already earned her high praise in end-of-year critics ' awards , as well as best supporting actress nominations for the 2018 golden globes and screen actors guild awards . she is expected to earn her first oscar nod when the shortlist is announced in the new year .
