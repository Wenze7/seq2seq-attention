        "however , that version failed the testing procedure . according to the leaked screenshots , the s9 's front panel would look similar to the galaxy s8 . the top and bottom bezels would remain the same , meaning users will have a hard time distinguishing the s9 and s8 based on the front design . thankfully , the new phone would carry a few changes on the rear panel such as a changed location of the fingerprint reader . the s9 's fingerprint scanner would sit below the camera module to make it easier for users to access the fingerprint sensor .
