        "san francisco -- the winter spare the air season 's first three alerts were announced for friday through sunday , bay area air quality management district officials said . the alert means residents are prohibited by law from burning wood , manufactured fire logs or other solid fuel either indoors or outdoors through midnight sunday . air district officials said air quality is expected to be unhealthy because of weather conditions , which are expected to trap pollution close to the ground . the pollution is especially harmful to children , the elderly , and people with respiratory conditions . ",
        "exposure to wood smoke , like cigarette smoke , has been linked to a higher risk of heart attacks , according to the air district . during the alert , residents and visitors are prohibited from using fireplaces , woodstoves , pellet stoves , outdoor fire pits and any other wood-burning devices . exemptions exist for people whose only source of heat is a woodstove or fireplace , but people must use a u. s. environmental protection agency-certified or pellet-fueled device that is registered with the air district . no longer does an open-hearth fireplace qualify for an exemption . ",
        "violators have an option of taking a wood smoke awareness class or pay a $ 100 ticket the first time they violate the rule . a second violation results in a $ 500 fine and fines are higher for subsequent violations . air district officials said bay area residents and visitors must check to see whether a spare the air alert has been issued during the winter spare the air season , which runs from nov. . 1 through feb. . 28 . several ways are available to check including text alerts , websites , a toll-free phone number and phone alerts .
