        "the nissan leaf is the top-selling electric vehicle in the world . sure , tesla and chevy get all the hype with the bolt and model 3 , but with more than 290,000 cars sold , nissan 's little electric car is the one people are buying . after seven years without a design refresh , the automaker dropped a new and improved model to continue to dominate the ev world . although , that task will be a lot tougher thanks to increased competition . the new leaf starts at $ 30,000 and has a 150-mile range . that 's really what everyone wants to know , so let 's get it out of the way . ",
        "besides traveling farther on the road , the car is an all-around improvement over the outgoing version . it has a stiffer chassis , better steering , a way better design and nissan 's first foray into semi-autonomous driver . when it comes range , the leaf sits between the likes of honda 's clarity ev and the hyundai ioniq ev , which hover around the 100-mile mark , and the 200-mile-plus chevy bolt and tesla model 3 . that said , at 150 miles , its range is better than most in the increasingly crowded ev market . the closest real competitor is the volkswagen e-golf , with a 125-mile range and roughly the same starting price . ",
        "but the leaf has a secret weapon : nissan 's aforementioned semi-autonomous propilot assist system . while nissan is a bit late to the semi-autonomous game , propilot is a solid system on par with nearly every other automaker 's combination of lane-keep assistance and adaptive cruise control . while it performed marvelously on the highway , it also did a bang-up job on napa 's backroads , something none of these systems is really made for but is a good indication of how well they read lane markings . the vehicle stayed within its lane at or slightly above the speed limit and even around corners sharper than those found on the average highway . ",
        "unfortunately , we never encountered stop-and-go traffic , but the adaptive cruise control was able to track the vehicle ahead of it at a line for a stop sign . propilot is an impressive start for the company . but while the car is great at keeping itself between lanes , the technology upgrades seemed to stop once the company got to the seven-inch capacitive touch center display . the automaker 's infotainment system , nissan connect , is n't that great to begin with and the leaf is saddled with a low-resolution display that makes it difficult to read media information and the feed from the back-up camera look like it 's covered in vaseline . ",
        "yes , it works , but it 's not pretty to look at . fortunately , it supports carplay and android auto as standard . thankfully , driving the car is a sharper experience . the leaf kicks out 147 horsepower with 236 pounds of torque , which delivers quick bursts of speed off the line and while driving . but it 's not sustainable , after few seconds you 're reminded you 're in an economy ev . considering that most buyers will be using it in urban areas where swift , small bursts of acceleration are all they really need , it 's not so much a ding as a reality check . ",
        "on the efficiency end , during our drive with the leaf , the 150-mile stated range seems pretty much on par with our experience . i drove the leaf 118 miles through winding mountain roads on a single charge . i spent most of our drive in `` normal '' mode . i also tested the vehicle 's `` eco '' mode and the e-pedal one-pedal driving system . i returned the car with a 9 percent charge or about 14 miles left on the battery . the test was held on and around the rural mountain roads near the town of calistoga , north of san francisco . ",
        "in my daily commuting life , driving through san francisco , i 'd more than likely use the e-pedal system extensively . it brings the car to a gentle stop when you lift your foot off the accelerator . after a few tries i was able to get the car to stop right at the stop sign without using the vehicle 's brake . that was more of a personal win than anything else . nissan says that e-pedal will keep the car stationary on up to a 30 percent grade . i never encountered that steep of a road to test it on , but it was solid on the few hills i did encounter . ",
        "it 'll be interesting to see how it handles the streets of san francisco . while the drivetrain is a solid performer and the handling of the vehicle improved , i 'm not a fan of the sitting position and leg room . i 'm 6-foot-3 , and i felt like i was way too close to the dash and the seat was higher than my liking . if you 're taller than me , the leaf probably is n't for you . anyone shorter than me , should probably be fine . sure , the old leaf was the number-one-selling ev in the world , but things have changed in the past seven years and nissan needed to step up its game -- and with the new leaf , it did . ",
        "this is largely thanks to the new and impressive propilot assist system option . i 'm a fan . still , the center console display is a huge disappointment . but you can mostly solve that by just plugging in your phone , which is something you probably planned on doing anyway because , after all , you 're reading this on a tech site . correction : an earlier version of this article stated the leaf had 140kwh battery . while impressive , the actual battery size 40kwh . this article originally appeared on engadget at .
