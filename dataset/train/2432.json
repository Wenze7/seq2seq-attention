        "after weeks of persistent heating outages at public housing developments during a bone-chilling stretch of winter , mayor de blasio is finally committing $ 13 million toward improving the city 's response to the crisis . the funding will go toward hiring 57 repair staff to respond to outages , renting 3 mobile boilers to restore lost heat more quickly , and sealing 9,600 windows at nycha senior housing , officials said . by next winter , the city also committed to replacing 8 troubled boiler plants , installing 7 gas-fired boilers and buying 5 mobile boilers for emergencies . ",
        "`` this new investment will help us continue to respond to outages immediately , replace boilers in hardest hit buildings and keep tenants warm , '' said de blasio . nycha records show that on thursday alone , two developments in the bronx lost heat , while three developments in the bronx and manhattan lost heat and hot water . additionally , the smith houses in lower manhattan were still without heat after a development-wide outage on wednesday , and one nearby building at the la guardia houses was still lacking heat and hot water since an outage on monday , online records show .
