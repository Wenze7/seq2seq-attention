        "senate majority leader trent lott -- stepping down amid foot-in-mouth imbroglio . december 20 , 2002 -- another day , another scandal on capitol hill . this time the recipient was senator trent lott who , despite his adamance about staying on , announced he would be stepping down as senate majority leader . the fracas began with lott , celebrating the 100th birthday of colleague strom thurmond who was an unapologetic segregationist and candidate for president in 1948 . at issue were three sentences in mr. lott 's tribute to mr. thurmond , a south carolina republican who ran for president in 1948 on a dixiecrat platform opposing '' social intermingling of the races . '' ",
        "with mr. thurmond by his side , mr. lott , republican of mississippi , said : '' i want to say this about my state : when strom thurmond ran for president , we voted for him . we 're proud of it . and if the rest of the country had followed our lead , we would n't have had all these problems over all these years , either . '' the comments brought complaints from both sides of the political aisle and political spectrum with across-the-board calls for his resignation . in the end , lott announced his resignation earlier this day , and the scramble was on to find a replacement . ",
        "and there was other news this day -- president bush okayed a major buildup of u. s. troop strength in the persian gulf region . a white house official said the official troop strength of 50,000 would be doubled , however the administration said no decision on whether or not the u. s. would go to war with iraq would be made anytime soon . earlier in the day , president bush said iraq 's weapons declaration to the un proved saddam hussein was not serious about disarmament was a disappointment , adding it was a bad day for those who longed for peace . ",
