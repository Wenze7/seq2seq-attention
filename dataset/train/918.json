        "jupiter , fla. . -- dec. . 11 , 2017 -- during infection or tumor growth , a type of specialized white blood cells called cd8 + t cells rapidly multiply within the spleen and lymph nodes and acquire the ability to kill diseased cells . some of these killer t cells then migrate where required to vanquish the germs or cancers . but how do killer t cells `` learn '' to leave their home base and amass within specific tissues like the skin , gut , and lung , or solid tumors ? finding the factors that cause t cells to function beyond the lymphoid system and in sites of infection or cancer has proven a tough challenge , but it 's essential for developing cancer-fighting immunotherapy strategies . ",
        "writing in the journal nature , researchers from the scripps research institute and the university of california , san diego report the discovery that a protein called `` runx3 '' programs killer t cells to establish residence in tumors and infection sites . `` runx3 works on chromosomes inside killer t cells to program genes in way that enables the t cells to accumulate in a solid tumor , '' said matthew pipkin , ph. d. , associate professor in the department of immunology and microbiology on the florida campus of the scripps research institute . the paper , `` runx3 programs cd8 + t cell residency in non-lymphoid tissues and tumors , '' appears in nature 's dec. . ",
        "14 issue . there are two main strategies in cancer immunotherapy that employ killer t cells , pipkin said . checkpoint inhibitor blockade unleashes killer t cells , prompting them to accumulate in tumors more aggressively . adoptive cell transfer , meanwhile , involves re-infusing a patient 's own immune cells after they have been engineered in the lab to recognize and destroy the patient 's specific cancer . the adoptive cell transfer strategy has worked stunningly well in some blood cancers associated with the lymphoid system , so far . but there appears to be less efficient activity of t cells in solid tumors , pipkin said . ",
        "`` the gene programs and signals for how the t cells take up residence in tissues outside of the general circulation was not really well understood , '' pipkin said . to discover factors that control t cell residency beyond the lymphoid system , pipkin 's team worked collaboratively with the laboratory of uc san diego 's ananda goldrath , who compared the gene expression of cd8 + t cells found in non-lymphoid tissue to those found in the general circulation . from a list of potential factors , they employed an rna interference screening strategy which can test the actual function of thousands of factors simultaneously . ",
        "pipkin 's lab had developed the screening strategy in collaboration with shane crotty at the la jolla institute for allergy and immunology . `` we found a distinct pattern , '' pipkin said . `` the screens showed that runx3 is one at the top of a list of regulators essential for t cells to reside in nonlymphoid tissues . '' moreover , runx3 was able to engage a specific gene program that is found in natural tissue-resident and tumor infiltrating cd8 + t cells , he said . the group further assessed whether runx3 had a role in directing white blood cells that attack solid tumors in mouse melanoma models . ",
        "they found that adoptive cell transfer of cancer-specific killer t cells that overexpressed runx3 delayed tumor growth and prolonged survival , while mouse models treated with those lacking runx3 fared much worse than normal . `` if we enhance runx3 activity in the cells , the tumors are significantly smaller and there is greater survival compared to the control group , '' pipkin said . knowing that modulating runx3 activity in t cells influences their ability to reside in solid tumors opens new opportunities for improving cancer immunotherapy , pipkin said . `` the upshot is we could probably use runx3 to reprogram adoptively transferred cells to help drive them to amass in solid tumors , '' he said . ",
        "he added that a collaboration of specialists energized the research . `` it was a fantastic collaboration , it all came together very quickly , '' pipkin said . in addition to pipkin , adam getzler and dapeng wang of tsri , lead author justin milner , and goldrath of ucsd , the co-authors of `` runx3 programs cd8 + t cell residency in non-lymphoid tissues and tumors , '' include clara toma , bingfei yu , kai zhang , kyla omilusik , anthony phan , toan nguyen , wei wang and shane crotty . the research was supported by frenchman 's creek women for cancer research and ucsd molecular biology cancer fellowship , the national institutes of health u19ai109976 and r01ai095634 , california institute for regenerative medicine rb5-07012 , the kimmelman family foundation and the san diego center for precision immunotherapy .

        "about the scripps research institute . the scripps research institute is one of the world 's largest independent , not-for-profit organizations focusing on research in the biomedical sciences . tsri is internationally recognized for its contributions to science and health , including its role in laying the foundation for new treatments for cancer , rheumatoid arthritis , hemophilia , and other diseases . an institution that evolved from the scripps metabolic clinic founded by philanthropist ellen browning scripps in 1924 , the institute now employs more than 2,500 people on its campuses in la jolla , ca , and jupiter , fl , where its renowned scientists -- including two nobel laureates and 20 members of the national academies of science , engineering or medicine -- work toward their next discoveries . ",
        "the institute 's graduate program , which awards phd degrees in biology and chemistry , ranks among the top ten of its kind in the nation . in october 2016 , tsri announced a strategic affiliation with the california institute for biomedical research , representing a renewed commitment to the discovery and development of new medicines to address unmet medical needs . for more information , see .
