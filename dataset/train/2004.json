        "gianluigi buffon says he will never really retire from playing and will be available for juventus or italy even when he is 80 . the legendary goalkeeper is expected to hang up his gloves at the end of the season after 22 years at the highest level with parma and juve . buffon has previously stated he is `` 99.9 per cent '' certain he will retire but continues to leave the door open . gianluigi donnarumma may be buffon 's heir-apparent for italy but who replaces him for the long term at juve remains unclear , and the 39-year-old says he will always be ready to turn out for the bianconeri - no matter what age he is . ",
        "`` i just do n't know how to answer these questions , '' he told der spiegel . `` will i stop ? will i not stop ? `` i feel like a soldier in the service of my club and my country . the big picture was always more important to me than my own . that 's how i see my work . `` i am very likely to stop , but i am still available for juventus and the national team . `` even at 80 , if suddenly no goalkeeper would be there , they should call me - i would train briefly and then jump in . ",
        "`` one regret buffon has is not finishing his career with a sixth trip to a world cup , italy having been beaten by sweden in the qualifying play-offs last month . it will be the first edition of the tournament the azzurri have missed since 1958 and buffon is ashamed to have been part of a squad that failed . `` i will regret italy missing the world cup for the rest of my life , '' he added . `` we took away that joy for children , that rapid heartbeat you get from watching your country play in an event like that .
