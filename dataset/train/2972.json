        "oakland , calif. . -- after missing the last 11 games for the golden state warriors with a right ankle sprain , stephen curry returned to action in emphatic fashion . on saturday the two-time mvp exploded for 38 points and shot 13-for-17 from the floor and nailed a season-high 10 3s out of 13 in 26 minutes to guide the warriors to a 141-128 win over the memphis grizzlies . it 's his ninth 30-point games of the season and his 10 treys are the highest total for any player this season . it has been nearly a month since he last played in an nba game , but he appeared to have n't missed a beat . ",
        "even though curry was on a minute restriction that would n't exceed 30 minutes , it did n't restrict his offensive prowess . he did whatever he wanted . whether it was driving to the hole , popping in transition or moving around screens , the grizzlies simply did n't have an answer for him and it started early on . curry , played the first eight minutes of the game , producing seven points on two layups and a triple from the top of the key . in the opening quarter , 14 of the team 's 37 assists occurred and it was one assist off the franchise record for assists in a quarter . ",

",
        "most of the fans in attendance at oracle arena jumped out of their seats . that was the zest the warriors ' offense has been missing for most of the month of december . after the first two quarters , curry recorded 21 points on 7-of-9 from the field and 5-of-7 from downtown in 14 minutes . in the third quarter , curry even dove for the ball , saving it before going out of bounds and landed near camera personnel . the fans held their breath , but collectively exhaled once he hopped up to get back on offense . ",
        "when he exited the game with two minutes remaining in the third , he was greeted to a standing ovation . with the warriors up 14 with 4:53 left in the contest , curry re-entered the game and embarrassed marc gasol . moments in , gasol switch onto him and curry crossed him up twice , leaving gasol staggering back and curry swished his 10th triple . it was just his night . after that , he was subbed out for good . the 141 points scored is more than the warriors scored in any of the 11 games played without curry and the 18 3-pointers are the most since , as well .

",
        "right after the play , green was seen raising his right hand in disdain in the direction of referee nick buchert and the official quickly tossed him . green walked off the court without further issues . it 's now green 's 10th technical of the season and his second ejection . rookie jordan bell started in place of green in the second half and finished with 11 points . golden state does n't play again until wednesday in dallas .
