        "january 13 , 2018by ashish kumar senus deputy secretary of energy , dan brouillette , on january 13 lashed out at what he described as the `` war on coal '' in the united states which , he said , had thwarted the construction of clean power plants , discouraged investments in new mining operations , and , as a result , put the nation at risk . noting that coal and nuclear account for more than half of the total grid energy in the united states , brouillette said : `` when a crisis strikes our grid these two fuels are some of the most reliable that we have . ",
        "they are available 24x7 to keep the lights on and disaster away . '' `` so , clearly , fewer coal and nuclear plants mean that the lights will go out and stay out when we face our next emergency . from the functioning of our hospitals to the maintenance of our military assets , the results could be catastrophic , '' he warned . brouillette spoke on the second and final day of the atlantic council 's global energy forum in abu dhabi . he was introduced by retired gen. james l. jones , jr. , interim chairman of the atlantic council . ",
        "brouillette said that the `` regulatory war '' on coal and nuclear fuels `` has been long and tough and it has distorted the marketplace for both coal and nuclear in the united states . '' past us leaders and policymakers , he said , had imposed price controls on oil and gas that led to production declines and artificial shortages . furthermore , he said , `` in the name of protecting the environment , they played energy favorites -- subsidizing some sources while burying coal and nuclear under an avalanche of regulation . '' `` they chose to regulate rather than innovate their way out of america 's energy dilemmas , '' he said . ",
        "us president donald j. trump 's determination to include coal and nuclear in his `` all-of-the-above strategy '' will help reduce the risk posed by past policies , he added . trump , brouillette pointed out , has signed off on the construction of several new energy pipelines , halted `` draconian '' oil and gas regulations , signed legislation repealing the rule that hindered coal development , and is working to reinvigorate the nuclear energy sector . early in january , the republican-controlled federal energy regulatory commission dealt a setback to trump 's plans to boost the coal industry when it rejected the administration 's goal of bolstering coal-fired and nuclear power plants . ",
        "ferc also noted in its decision that despite claims by the trump administration to the contrary , there is no evidence that any past or planned shutdowns of coal-fired power plants posed a threat to the nation 's electric grid . while brouillette did not address ferc 's decision in his remarks on january 13 , in a panel discussion at the global energy forum on january 12 he said he did not view the decision as a setback . as a matter of fact , he said , ferc had pledged to conduct its own review of grid resiliency . ",
        "brouillette , meanwhile , cited a report produced last year by the department of energy on america 's grid and its power supplies that he said found `` coal and nuclear power plants were being retired at a disturbing rate . '' the us energy revolutionthe united states has become a leading global energy exporter as a result of an energy revolution in the country . this has turned the domestic energy paradigm on its head and caused ripple effects in international oil and gas markets as well as in the security paradigms of this century , said jones . ",
        "brouillette recalled the unites states ' remarkable journey to becoming a global energy player and said it was now on its way to achieving what trump describes as energy dominance . `` why is america suddenly emerging as an energy player beyond its borders ? the reason is this : after a long drawn out battle between innovation and regulation in my country , innovation is finally winning , '' he said . innovation has spurred a technology revolution which has led to an `` astonishing renaissance '' in american energy , he added . brouillette rejected the notion that a nation can only benefit at another nation 's expense . ",
        "`` so , when you do business with america on energy know that we will use our energy resources to advance our shared aspirations and goals , '' he told the audience that included global energy policymakers . the most important lesson to be learned from the united states ' experience is : `` for any nation that seeks to produce energy cleaner , more abundantly , more affordably , more efficiently , and in more diverse forms , it must allow innovation to work its magic , '' he said . there is one critical piece of the energy puzzle necessary for any nation to achieve energy security , he added . ",
        "`` that final piece is reliability .
