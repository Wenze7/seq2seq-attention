        "drivers are being warned of the dangers posed by drink-driving during the christmas season . over one-in-five admit to driving the morning after a night out while unsure if their blood alcohol level had returned to within the legally permissible limit . a survey by aa car insurance finds that over one in 10 people have been in a car where they knew or suspected that the driver was over the legal blood alcohol limit within the past 24 months . the survey of over 6,000 motorists found that 8.12 % of those surveyed said they had driven the morning after the night before on up to five occasions , despite being unsure of whether or not they were over the limit . ",
        "conor faughnan is the director of consumer affairs with the aa . `` over the christmas season we all deserve and most certainly will be enjoying the time off with friends and family but , where alcohol is concerned , the laws do not change just because it 's the holiday season . `` if you have been drinking it 's of vital importance that you do n't get behind the wheel of a car until it is safe for you to do so . `` while the majority of us would never think of drinking and driving on the same night , we often forget that alcohol can continue to impact on your concentration , reaction times and driving ability into the following day , depending on how much you have consumed . ",
        "`` the survey also found that over one-fifth of those surveyed admitted they had been a passenger in a car where the driver was severely hungover within the past two years . mr faughnan says : `` even if you are only a passenger in a car you have a responsibility to ensure the driver behaves legally . `` for your own safety you should n't get into a car where the driver 's ability may be compromised but for the sake of all road users you should do what you can to ensure they do n't drive any further .
