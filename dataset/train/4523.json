        "gather around kids . today i 'm going to tell you a story about my interview at my previous and the only office i 've ever worked at . so , i 'd had a horrible year , what with dropping out of engineering and then literally doing nothing for the next 6 months . my mother 's constant nagging had become just another background noise by the 3rd month . i was still trying to figure out what i wanted to do , but i knew that i had an inclination towards writing and i wanted to do something related to that . ",
        "i was already writing blogs by that time . one day , i was hanging out at my friend 's place and we were talking about advertising and all of its prospects . long story short , he hooked me up with a job interview at a place called the minimalist . i went down there for the interview with that friend because he knew where the place was , and also i needed some `` moral support '' . i 'd been prepped by him for the interview . i started out first with my copy test . having no idea of how copy tests work , i got told that i can use my phone if i want . ",
        "that came as a shock , because you do n't usually hear people say that you can use your phone during a test . turns out , you can during a copy test . the copy test took a while . after being done with that , got told to wait for a while for my interview . i honestly was quite nervous but i was trying to act cool . finally got called in for the interview . i got more nervous when i found out that the creative director of the office was sitting in front of me . ",
        "anyway , he started asking the regular questions `` where are you from ? '' , `` what have you done ? '' `` why copywriting ? '' , etc. . this interview lasted for 2 minutes . only 2 minutes . i got told that they 'll let me know whether i 'm selected or not . i came out feeling quite proud of myself , mostly because i did n't babble . on our way back , i told my friend that the interview lasted only 2 minutes . he was shocked . `` i did n't screw it up did i ? '' ",
        "was the first thing i thought when i saw his face . having never given an interview , my naive self thought interviews are supposed to be this short . i got a call next day asking when i can start . on my last day of my internship i got told by the creative director that mine was the shortest interview that he 'd ever taken in his lifetime . we had a really good laugh about it that day . a 2 minute tragedy that turned out to be a blessing for me . i really am glad that i got picked in spite of that 2 minute blunder . ",
        "the lesson i learned from this story is that nothing gets done in two minutes , not even maggi .   "
