        "if you 're like me and would rather wipe down your cast iron than clean a sheet pan , then this recipe is for you . not only is this dish packed with tasty winter vegetables and chicken , but the whole thing easily cooks while you 're wrangling kids , or while you 're zoning out on your social media feed . when it comes to roasted vegetables , i have a personal tendency to crowd the pan . the good news is that in this recipe , that 's exactly what you 're supposed to do . after a quick sear on some chicken , everything is tossed with a finger-licking good sauce made of honey , mustard , garlic , and butter along with some seasonings to top it all off . ",
        "once your vegetables are prepped and the chicken is seared , everything is tossed in the same pan your chicken was seared in and popped in the oven until they 've reached roasty-toasty awesomeness ! you add some chopped walnuts and cranberries in at the end to add crunch and sweetness . there 's little cleanup or fuss , and a whole lot of flavor . if you 're a sunday night meal prepper , this recipe is a great candidate . if you prep all the ingredients in advance then you can simply pop things in a pan when you return home from work at the end of a long day !
