        "in basketball , when a player hits a few shots in a row , he is said to have a `` hot hand . '' in finance , we call it `` momentum '' . momentum is basically the tendency of winning stocks to keep winning and losing stocks to keep losing . it is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend , it is more likely to continue in that direction instead of moving against the drift . at the core , momentum investing works on the principle of `` buy high , sell higher . '' ",
        "thus , this strategy calls for hitching a ride on an already fast-moving train , without fretting about valuations or growth prospects . but why does momentum strategy work ? there is a simple reason behind this . it works because we are humans ! there 's a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason for the momentum strategy to work . for instance , we all know of investors who are afraid to book losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long , hoping that they will spring back to their original prices . ",
        "on the other hand , many investors sell their winners way too early . furthermore , investors initially tend to under-react to news , events or data releases . however , once things gain clarity , they tend to go with the flow and overreact , causing dramatic price reactions . these behavioral problems extend trends , and thus open up huge opportunities for momentum players . so basically , it 's a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future . momentum investing is based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs , i. e. before prices become rational again . ",
        "also , unlike other investment styles , momentum premium has stood the test of time , remaining remarkably robust and persistent ever since it was identified by financial academics in the 1990s . this is especially important as academics are of the opinion that once research on factor premiums becomes known to public , the investment world catches on and the premium gradually erodes . obviously , this strategy is quite tricky to implement , as detecting these trends is no child 's play . momentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over long periods of time and across markets . ",
