        "silverdale -- you have n't seen much of `` pump boys and dinettes '' around these parts . the good-natured musical revue , in which the urchins of a backroads gas station and the adjacent diner trade song-and-dance sequences , has seen the light of day in kitsap only twice in the new millenium , in 2011 at western washington center for the arts and as part of the jewel box theatre 's 2003-04 season . dale borer had seen the jb 's production -- his eldest son , matt , was in it . and borer knew it was just the ticket for cstock to take to the kitsap golf and country club for a long weekend of dinner theater . ",
        "`` it 's perfect , '' said borer , who 's directing both `` pump boys '' and the upcoming `` high school musical 2 '' for cstock . `` you do n't have to do a lot , set-wise , and you do n't need a lot of space . `` when they asked us to do a show there , we figured this was the best choice , '' borer said of the show , which was created by jim wann and mark hardwick and written by the six members of its original cast , who premiered it off-broadway in 1981 and took it on to the great white way the next year . ",
        "cstock has been involved `` helping out '' at previous kg&cc events , but `` pump boys '' is the first actual production the silverdale company will mount there . in the interim between the demolition of their longtime stage , the silverdale community center , and the arrival of a new home , they 've been performing at central kitsap middle school and previous dinner-theater shows at the silverdale beach hotel . both matt borer and dave dumpert are veterans of the jewel box 's go at `` pump boys '' more than a decade ago . dumpert was back at the poulsbo venue for its recent production of another twangy musical revue , `` ring of fire : the music of johnny cash . ",
        "`` the cast is completed by cstock regulars ty brillhart , charles platten and amanda pugh , plus briana lobbett . besides all the singing and clowning , the cast will provide their own musical accompaniment , backed by drummer colby ostheimer . lobbett , a singer-songwriter who 's been a frequent performer of late at both wwca and gig harbor 's paradise theatre , was a key addition , borer said . `` she 's a phenomenal singer , '' he said , `` but we needed somebody who could also play guitar , and she brings that , too . ",
        "`` the cast has n't been rehearsing at kg&cc , but borer said that 's no problem . he 's recreated the venue 's small stage , plus some platforms he built for added space , in a portable at the middle school . preview ` pump boys and dinettes ' who : central stage theatre of county kitsap what : musical by jim wann , mark hardwick , john foley , debra monk , cass morgan and john schimmelwhere : kitsap golf and country club , 3885 nw golf club hill road , bremertonwhen : 6 p. m. dinner shows jan. .
