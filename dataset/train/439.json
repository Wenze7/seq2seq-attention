        "alexa app for android gets voice controlon friday , we first reported that amazon had added the ability for users to give voice commands to alexa via the alexa app on android phones . while the alexa app has been around since the devices were first released , it 's previously been used for setting up alexa , not talking to her . see alsoafter a month of alexa in every room : the good , the bad , and the creepybig brother may not be watching us , but alexa is certainly listening in . david gewirtz reports on the slightly creepy feeling he 's been getting , along with the benefits of a ubiquitous voice assistant . ",
        "read moreios users , on the other hand , were seemingly left behind . techcrunch reported that a similar update for the iphone app is on the way , but appears to be delayed due to apple 's app store vetting process . across the world , iphone users howled in frustration . how could it be that android could get a feature first ? how could it be that , suddenly , they were the second class citizens ? when , they cried , would they get their alexa voice command capabilities ? if , in fact , techcrunch is correct and the modded alexa app is in app store review , the answer is that ios users will probably get these capabilities within the next few days . ",
        "but if that 's not good enough , you can control alexa right now , via voice , on ios . here 's howmost people do n't realize it , but alexa voice control has been available to ios users for some time now . what 's weird is that the capability is n't in the alexa app , but instead in the amazon shopping app . if you launch your amazon shopping app on your iphone , you 'll notice the little alexa icon on the right side of the screen . the alexa button has been hidden in plain sight . ",
        "the first time you press it , you 'll have to accept amazon 's slightly creepy `` alexa helps you shop '' warning that `` amazon processes and retains audio , interactions , and other data in the cloud . '' but hey , i have six alexas in my house . what 's one more listening in , right ? click continue and you now have alexa support . big bezos is watching you . you have to hit the little button and then use the alexa wake word to give commands . alexa , sell me something . ",
        "once you do , you 'll have complete alexa access . what 's incredibly cool is that you can do this over lte and not just wi-fi . that means you can issue smart home commands while out and about . i tested it by telling alexa to turn on and off lights and it worked perfectly . see , ios users do n't have to feel left behind , even if just for a few days . alexa 's here for you , even now . you can follow my day-to-day project updates on social media . be sure to follow me on twitter at @davidgewirtz , on facebook at facebook .
