        "alexandra guzeva many innovative futuristic designs were in fact created by soviet engineers . unfortunately , however , only some were ever mass-produced . in 1962 , the soviet union made the pivotal decision to improve the lives of its people , and issued a decree `` on improving the quality of goods in the fields of mechanical engineering and light industry by implementing design methods . '' that 's the correct translation , but it 's probably not very clear what it means , right ? we 'll tell you -- it meant the birth of postwar soviet industrial design ! ",
        "this call for looks similar to a mac , does n't it ? this is the soviet computer station , sphinx , designed in 1986 . `` the sphinx had futuristic square drives , a remote control and small monitors that could be detached , '' said moscow design museum director , alexandra sankova . `` what we have today - the no , it 's not a space shuttle from soviet movies . this is a miracle of soviet engineering , the industrial-grade truck , belaz-540 , designed by valentin kobylinsky in 1965 . this project was recognized as too innovative and the truck eventually looked different . ",
        "but what a beauty ! mummies in egypt are certainly turning over in their sarcophagi with envy over this `` perspective taxi '' . and we understand why ! just like the project mentioned above , this one came out of the all-union research institute of technical aesthetics -lrb- the state was the manufacturer of everything , even dishes . `` we had a planned economy , regulated by the state , '' sankova said . `` there were just three types of cars , three types of milk cartons and six kinds of telephone sets . '' this is an illustration from the magazine , new goods , published in 1962 ; it was a rudimentary form of soviet advertising . ",
        "fashion was last on the list of soviet female workers ' list of concerns . so , the state decided to help them and started to manufacture new clothes . many women had the same dresses , what soviet songs do you know ? have you heard of edita piekha ? or maybe you 'd like to listen to one of brezhnev 's speeches in your free time ? enjoy it with a saigak tape recorder ! this is a portable 1987 version . sergei soloviev / mia `` rossiya segodnya '' the soviet state paid much attention to children 's toys . ",
        "apart from the famous joseph budenovich / mia `` rossiya segodnya '' the kazakh soviet republic was progressive in the country 's light industries . here 's a 1971 photo taken at a children 's toy factory . this doll can be found literally in every family with little girls . years ago this doll , without arms or legs lying in a rubbish heap , was a symbol of a bygone childhood . some soviet items were recognizable around the globe , such as the mascot of the 1980 moscow summer games . people who remember that year still can recall the anthem , `` goodbye , our soft misha . '' ",
        "also , this rocking horse was enormously popular in russia . furniture ! that is one of the most prevalent symbols of the soviet era that still can be found today in many apartments . young people call it `` babushka 's furniture '' because it 's often that when you visit a friend you see exactly the same wall rack or kitchen set as your parents had in the soviet union . today , antique dealers like to collect soviet-era furniture , restore it and turn it into stylish interior items . the exhibition of soviet industrial design is on display at the moscow 's fashion & design center of the all-russian decorative art museum until jan. .
