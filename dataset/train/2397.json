        "an aging american nuclear arsenal and the advances being made by china and russia is a potentially lethal combination in the united states ' ability to remain an effective global nuclear deterrent , a former pentagon official wrote in a paper for the center for security policy . `` our nuclear weapons production complex is broken , '' wrote dr. mark schneider in a scathing takedown of former president barack obama . `` after two decades of neglect , the u. s. nuclear deterrent has become seriously eroded , '' schneider wrote . `` america 's nuclear forces are very old and will get significantly older before they are replaced . '' ",
        "on the flip side , schneider warned that russia and china are in the midst of a massive modernization of their nuclear capabilities . `` russia and china are now deploying new nuclear icmbs , new nuclear air-launched cruise missiles , new nuclear submarines-launched ballistic missiles and new ballistic missile submarines , '' schneider wrote . `` both are developing still newer nuclear icbms , slbms , ballistic missile submarines and bombers , including stealth bombers , '' schneider wrote . `` russia and china are developing and deploying new and improved nuclear weapons , apparently with the assistance of very low-yield nuclear testing . '' ",
        "meanwhile , the u. s. ca n't even produce tritium -- `` a vital nuclear ingredient '' -- and also lacks the production abilities to make nuclear fuel , called pit , which has a lifespan of 45-60 years , schneider writes . schneider says the average age of america 's nukes is 35 years old . `` this means that in as little as 10 years we could see a collapse of the u. s. nuclear deterrent . these critical problems must be corrected promptly , '' schneider writes . `` if russia is not in compliance with the new start treaty in february 2018 , u. s. icbms and slbms should be reloaded back to clinton administration levels , '' schneider wrote . ",
        "`` this very low cost solution would considerably enhance our deterrent until modernization programs bear fruit 10-15 years from now and would reduce the near term need for missile defense countermeasures , '' schneider wrote .   "
