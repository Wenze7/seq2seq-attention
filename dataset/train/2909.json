        "the only thing harder than making a pilot just might be making a second season . pilots have the unenviable task of trying to live up to expectations for network and studio executives , just looking for reasons to say no . second seasons have the unenviable task of trying to live up to expectations for fans , just looking for reasons to tune out . it 's only gotten more complicated in peak tv : viewers have gotten ever more fickle , with itchy trigger fingers just waiting to change the channel . and with good reason : the mass migration of talent -- both behind and in front of the camera -- to television has led to a boom in creativity . ",
        "each new effort is more surprising and enterprising than the last . but when it comes to awards , which efforts should be recognized : the fresh new groundbreaking voices , or the returning favorites , which continue to deliver on the promise of their initial efforts ? i 'm not arguing for stale ballots which cling to shows long past their prime . but this season especially , we 've seen something of a television miracle : the end of the dreaded `` sophomore slump . '' top contenders for the awards circuit include a lineup of dramas and comedies that burn even brighter in their second seasons . ",
        "` this is us ' season 2 winter finale : sterling k. brown on ` lighter ' randall , saying goodbye to deja , cliffhanger with kevin . consider fx 's `` better things . '' the debut of pamela adlon 's comedy about the struggles of a working single mom deservedly won raves -- and even earned her an emmy nomination for best actress . but in its second season , she fully embraced a perspective rarely seen on television : raw honesty about motherhood . adlon 's sam does n't always do the `` right '' thing -- she 's sarcastic , self-destructive , and shockingly blunt -- but in doing so , she has shattered the sitcom stereotype . ",
        "and then there 's hbo 's `` insecure . '' in season two , creator issa rae resisted the happy endings -- because , really , do they ever happen in real life ? -- to explore her alter ego 's ever increasing complications with romance and work . some may complain that nbc 's `` this is us '' is maudlin , but it has more than lived up to the promise of its first season . this time out , the creators have managed to strike the balance of fueling those compelling mysteries while still plumbing the emotional depths of the characters we 've grown to love , with the trilogy of episodes dedicated to the big three -- sibling kate , randall , and kevin -- serving as prime example . ",
        "the first season of netflix 's `` the crown '' introduced us to a young woman thrust unwillingly onto the international stage . in season two , we learn more about her as a wife and mother -- but also those who surrounded , supported and challenged her , from her willful sister princess margaret to her faithless husband prince philip . nbc 's `` the good place '' pulled off the ultimate high-wire act with its first season finale -- with a narrative twist few saw coming . and yet it 's attempting even more impossible aerobatics this time , with ever more outrageous stunts all in the name of truly hilarious mockery of morality . ",
        "netflix 's `` master of none '' took even more creative risks in its second season -- filming in black-and-white , for example , or without sound . or an entire episode where aziz ansari 's dev barely appears . these bold experiments not only succeed brilliantly -- they resonate long past the credits . perhaps no series had a higher bar than `` stranger things , '' which burst onto the screen relatively unknown . it might have turned into a ` 80s tribute series , but instead found resonance as it delved even deeper into the characters ' search for belonging . ",
        "of course , this year offers plenty of worthy freshman contenders -- from netflix 's delightful `` glow '' to david simon 's compelling `` the deuce . '' and given the awkwardness of the tv awards season calendar , some first-season shows that have already won kudos from the tv academy will be vying for golden globes and sag awards for the first time . hulu 's `` the handmaid 's tale '' is a sure thing , of course -- and rumor has it its second season does n't disappoint . there are still more sophomores to come : season two of donald glover 's `` atlanta '' as well as hbo 's `` westworld , '' which will also face the pressure of living up to their breakout freshman success . ",
        "but this season , let 's take a moment to applaud the enduring show -- the show that fully embraces its vision to fuel continuing storylines , themes and characters . no pressure .   "
