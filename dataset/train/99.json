        "amazon is taking over . they started with books and they continued with everyday household items . now they are selling digital content and home services . because amazon is a big competitor it has forced other major businesses to step it up . and they have . so , how can your small business compete with big businesses online ? you just have to be better . but you have to be better strategically . here 's how ... do what the big guys ca n't do . here 's 5 things the big guys ca n't do : 1 . ",
        "they ca n't be a leader in one particular category or industry . let 's say that you have a sporting goods store . and , let 's say that your particular specialty is fishing . you are known around town as the go-to place for everything related to fishing gear . amazon , of course , sells sporting goods ... and they sell fishing equipment . fishing is not their core business . they can not personally recommend the best fishing equipment . they can not offer guidance on how to fish , where the best fishing spots are , or what kind of fishing pole would best suit their customer 's skill level . ",
        "the big guys can not talk on the phone or chat in person with a customer who 's interested in knowing the difference between a spinning reel and a bait-casting reel . their customer support staff does n't know a thing about fishing . those big guys simply ca n't be trusted as a fishing expert . however , if this is your industry then you can be trusted as a fishing expert . 2 . they ca n't provide value other than on price . most of the value the big guys offer comes in the form of lower prices . ",
        "in all likelihood , you ca n't compete on lowest price . so , how do you compete ? make people feel good about buying from you . people purchase based on emotion . make people feel good about their decision to buy from you than from online . demonstrate to your customers why they should buy from you over those other guys . there 's three things customers want : a -rrb- customers want a quality product . demonstrate why yours is the superior product -- even at a higher price . b -rrb- customers want great service . ",
        "show how you will be there for them when they have questions . c -rrb- customers want assurance . they want to know that the product they 're buying is right for them . show them that you care about them . this is all value . you are providing value in ways other than being the cheapest . 3 . they ca n't provide great customer service . let 's face it , the big guys can not provide great customer service . they run a high volume , low margin business . and this low margin comes at a price . ",
        "top notch customer service is not included . however , this is one area where you can stand out . people buy from those they know , like , and trust . so , how do you be known for great customer service ? by demonstrating great customer service -- before , during , and after the sale . once your customers have experienced you they will now know you , like you , and trust you . 4 . they ca n't be anything other than a faceless corporation . we know two things : a -rrb- people buy from people they know , like , and trust . ",
        "andb -rrb- they make purchases based on emotion . one way to compete with the big guys is to make it personal by putting a face on your business . then , all of a sudden , your business becomes real -- with a real person running it who has a real life and family . to the average customer , amazon and walmart are faceless corporations . you are not . take advantage of that . tell your customers your story -- how you got into the business , why you care so deeply about serving your customers , and why you love your product or service . ",
        "you will become real and personal . people will start to feel like they know you , like you , and can trust you . this is something the big guys ca n't do . 5 . they ca n't create a special experience . to be fair , some of the big guys ' experiences are actually quite nice . finding the product on their site , checking out , and having it delivered quickly to your door is actually a pretty good experience . that 's how they got so so big in the first place . however , knowing this -- how can you make your experience special ? ",
        "not just different . not just unique . not just better . special . at the end of the day , you want to be known for something special -- what is it ? you have to give your customers a reason to choose you over your competition . make that reason special and your customers will love you . adam lean is the founder of the cfo project . we fix and grow small businesses . we provide you with a cfo who will guide you through a complete system designed to fix and grow your business . find out more at thecfoproject .
