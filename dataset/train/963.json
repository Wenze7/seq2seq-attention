        "los angeles -- the vegas golden knights roll into staples center to face the los angeles kings on thursday night on a historic streak that has elevated them to the top of the pacific division . the golden knights ' 4-1 victory over the anaheim ducks on wednesday night was their fifth consecutive victory and extended their point streak to 10 games , the longest run for any nhl expansion team . with two players , james neal and william karlsson , among the nhl 's top 10 goal-scorers and playing with speed and determination , vegas has crafted one of the best sports stories of 2017 . ",
        "the victory over anaheim elevated vegas to the top spot in the western conference , a position that no one thought achievable when the season commenced in october . under the guidance of coach gerard gallant , who was unceremoniously fired last season by the florida panthers , the golden knights have developed into a legitimate playoff contender . although his team has emerged as the model for how to launch a sports expansion franchise , gallant remains humble while his players continue to improve and grow in confidence . while their play was far from perfect in the wednesday victory , gallant keeps feeding them positive reinforcement . ",
        "`` we try and battle and work hard every night , and tonight we found a way , '' gallant said . `` we did n't start the game off great . i thought the first eight minutes we were sloppy , but after that i thought we played a great game and a great road game . we found a way to get two big points . `` shea theodore , who returned to score a key goal against anaheim , his former team , concurred with gallant . despite surrendering an early goal to the ducks , the golden knights raised their level of play to capture the victory . ",
        "allowing the first goal to the opposition has not been a problem , as vegas has posted a respectable 9-8-2 record when allowing the opening goal . `` we do a really good job of coming back in and regrouping , '' theodore said . `` we know what our strengths are . that break in between periods , we come in and we talk about it a little bit and focus up , and i feel like that is definitely a good thing about our team . `` los angeles is looking to bounce back from a 2-0 loss at san jose on saturday , the first time the kings were shut out this season . ",
        "despite possessing one of the league 's best records , the kings were inconsistent in the two weeks leading up to the league 's holiday break , posting a 2-3-1 record and averaging two goals per game in those contests . in an attempt to kick-start the offense , coach john stevens shook up his line combinations at practice wednesday , specifically at the left wing position . tanner pearson moved up the depth chart to play alongside anze kopitar and dustin brown . marian gaborik was paired with adrian kempe and tyler toffoli , while alex iafallo vacated his customary spot alongside kopitar and brown and was grouped with nick shore and trevor lewis . ",
        "the kings are looking to avenge a loss in the inaugural meeting between the teams , a 4-2 setback in las vegas on nov. . 19 . goaltender jonathan quick was driven from the net at 11:22 of the first period after surrendering three goals on nine shots as the kings were decisively outshot 40-29 . stevens is one of few observers who expected the golden knights to thrive in their inaugural season . `` i 'm not surprised , '' stevens said after practice on wednesday . `` they have got a really experienced management team , they are really well coached and they have depth . ",
        "`` los angeles needs improvement in one facet of its special teams play to break out of its recent mediocre stretch . the kings are tied with the sharks for the best penalty-kill percentage but have languished with the extra man , converting only 15.4 percent of their opportunities , which ranks 28th . in 11 games this month , the kings have converted only 2 of 24 power-play opportunities .
