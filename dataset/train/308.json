        "slovenia is taking steps to replace the executives of luka koper d. d. , a profitable port operator whose shares are outperforming the benchmark , deepening the controversy over the government 's handling of state-owned businesses . shareholders led by the government are voting thursday on a proposal to oust dragomir matic as president of the management board , based on the state asset manager 's allegations of irregularities under his leadership , which he rejects . if rubber stamped by a supervisory board meeting on friday , matic is set to lose his job despite a sharp increase in earnings since the start of what was meant to be a five-year term at the helm in 2014 . ",
        "slovenia has had a fraught relationship with state companies , including lengthy delays on a pledge to the european commission to sell nova ljubljanska banka d. d. after a bailout . with elections just months away , the government has been accused of inconsistency in its approach to corporate governance . `` the logical question arises why this scrutiny is against luka koper management and not against some other companies , also partially state owned , where results are clearly lagging , '' saso stanovnik , an economist at alta invest in ljubljana said in an email . `` profitability is clearly not the criteria . '' ",
        "controlling risksthe port operator 's shares have risen 20 percent this year compared with the 11 percent rise the slovenian benchmark index of 11 most traded stocks . even though the company is performing quite well , the management has n't been able to remove irregularities and has n't controlled risks indicated in a pricewaterhousecoopers report , the slovenian sovereign holding said in response to emailed questions . the management is n't enjoying its trust anymore , the agency said . matic said the government 's planned move was unacceptable . business partners are finding it `` hard to comprehend all these back-door dealings and political games , '' matic said last week in an interview at the company 's headquarters overlooking the port . ",
        "kristjan verbic , president of the pan-slovenian shareholders association , which says it represents a fifth of luka koper 's approximately 10,000 individual shareholders based on data from earlier this year , also said the move was connected to upcoming elections . `` they are working on destabilizing the company while we all know stability is paramount to business , '' verbic said over the phone from koper where he attended a meeting of port workers to discuss the issue . radivoj pregelj , a portfolio manager at zavarovalnica triglav 's asset management arm which holds luka koper stock , said high economic growth in the countries that receive the cargo leaving the port would support the company 's performance even after a change in management . ",
        "dredging carried out in 2014 that enabled bigger ships to enter was also helping , he said . `` luka koper is really doing very well , '' pregelj said .   "
