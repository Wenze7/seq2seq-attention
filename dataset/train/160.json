        "chelsea have ruled out selling ruben loftus-cheek and plan to play him in midfield alongside new signing ross barkley in the future , reports the london evening standard . antonio conte 's side signed barkley from everton in a Â£ 15m deal at the end of last week but his arrival raised serious doubts about loftus-cheek 's long-term future at the club . the 21-year-old joined palace on a season-long loan deal at the start of the season and has established himself as a key player for the eagles in their bid to beat the drop . loftus-cheek has dropped even further down the pecking order at stamford bridge following barkley 's arrival but chiefs at chelsea have no interest in selling the england international . ",
        "palace manager roy hodgson has already said he would like to take advantage of the situation by signing loftus-cheek on a permanent basis , but the best he can hope for now is to bring the young midfielder back to selhurst park on loan next season . loftus-cheek has started 15 league games for palace this season but has been forced to play in wide areas for the bulk of that time . however , only wilfried zaha completes more dribbles per game than loftus-cheek of all palace players in the league this term .
