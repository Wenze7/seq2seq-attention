        "is alexa 's imminent arrival on windows 10 pcs a bad thing for cortana 's future ? one of the bombshells from ces 2018 was that some windows pc makers like asus , hp , and acer announced a partnership with amazon to integrate alexa with their new products . that 's not instead of cortana , of course , which is built into windows 10 , but it does put arguably the most well known and supported virtual assistant where it has never been before . so does this mean cortana should be looking over her shoulder , looking for the proverbial axe ? ",
        "that 's what we 're talking about in the windows central forums . rumorednow01-10-2018 08:27 pm `` i guess cortana will be getting the axe soon ... i do n't have any ios/apple so no siri for me , please and thank you . i wo n't google now . i put as few of my eggs into google 's basket as i can . i use cortana all the time on pc and handset . if microsoft is going to let it die off and i have to move to something else i guess it would be alexa . ",
        "however , i. . . reply there 's no denying that alexa is a much more established player in the space . not only is it supported by amazon 's own hardware , but recent times have seen it expand far beyond that , and now we 're going to be seeing it pop up in cars and wearables as well as on pcs , phones and tablets . anyone who 's anyone in the smart home market supports alexa , and it 's available in a number of locations around the globe . more : microsoft needs to prove it 's serious about cortana before it 's too latecompare that to cortana , which until recently was limited to microsoft 's own software platforms before expanding with the invoke , and now it seems a smart thermostat . ",
        "cortana skills are lesser in quantity than alexa , but most importantly , officially all this extra functionality is limited to the united states . there 's no doubt this latest development is both a good and bad news scenario for microsoft fans . it 's fantastic news that amazon is bringing alexa finally to windows 10 , but it does leave concerns over the future for cortana . but what do you make of it all ? drop by the forums thread below and let us know . goodbye cortana , hello alexa on windows 10 pc from acer , asus , and hp .
