        "david moyes has bemoaned an `` error-strewn '' west ham performance as his side fell to a deflating defeat at the hands of newcastle . rafa benitez 's side turned up in east london without a win , and just one point , from their last nine premier league games , presenting the hammers with the golden chance to climb the table . however , despite taking the lead early , a string of amateur errors , and a penalty miss meant moyes ' side went into christmas just one point above the relegation zone . the former everton boss admitted they had earmarked this game as one to drag them from the bottom of the table , but now has to look back on a concerning , messy performance . ",
        "west ham 2 newcastle 3 : hammers stunned in london stadium thriller `` it was a totally error-strewn game , '' moyes said . `` i think they would probably say the same about the first goal but we should have capitalised . `` i think the first goal today was always going to be important and when we got it early , it would work in our favour . `` but disappointingly , it did n't . we made big mistakes for the first goal , there is an offside in the second goal , i think the linesman should give but overall , we ca n't blame anybody but ourselves . ",
        "we did n't perform well enough , we made mistakes throughout the game . '' given their standing in the table , and the number of points separating those around them , a missed penalty could cost the east londoners dearly this season . having missed one in their defeat to everton , moyes has called on his forwards to become more reliable from the spot . `` it was such a big moment in the game for us , the penalty was such a big moment in as much as we could have got back to 2-2 , not performing brilliantly well but we were in the ascendancy that was for sure . ",
        "`` andre was there to take it , people miss penalties , but i 've just said we 've now missed one at everton and we 've now missed one here . `` i think in our position it 's hard enough to get the opportunity or get given the chances , we ca n't be missing them so we need to get a little bit more reliable with penalty kicks . ''   "
