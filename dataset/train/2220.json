        "north florida and georgia are already feeling the impact of winter storm grayson , and the extreme winter weather is only supposed to intensify over the next few days . predictions about the `` bomb cyclone '' show the storm 's path stretching all the way up the east coast , and parts of new england could be hit with more than a foot of snow , depending on the air pressure over the atlantic ocean . meteorologists expect winter storm grayson to move north pretty quickly , reaching maine by sunrise thursday morning . rapid drops in air pressure are expected to transform the otherwise ordinary winter storm into what 's considered a bomb cyclone as it moves up the coast . ",
        "low pressure in the western atlantic ocean is expected to ramp up and head northeast wednesday evening , but the storm is likely to become a bomb cyclone no matter where the low air pressure ends up materializing . how that air pressure builds will determine how much snow the east coast gets wednesday night and thursday . `` a track of the offshore low closer to the east coast would increase the odds of moderate to heavy snow along with strong winds , '' the weather channel explains . `` a track farther offshore would bring lighter amounts of snow to the east coast and gusty winds .

",
        "`` because meteorologists forecast low air pressure to crop up somewhere , the storm will continue to progress and bring at least some snow to the northeast u. s . the washington post breaks down how much snow each area can expect : `` from norfolk to the maryland and delaware beaches , at least 5 to 8 inches of snow is predicted , with as much as a foot possible between wednesday evening and thursday afternoon ... farther inland in the mid-atlantic , near interstate 95 , up to an inch or so called fall in washington and baltimore , but more in their eastern and southeastern suburbs , where several inches are predicted .
