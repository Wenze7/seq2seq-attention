        "charity blames overspill of terrorism from syria and iraq after 128 christians were killed last yearharriet sherwood religion correspondentchristians in egypt are facing unprecedented levels of persecution , with attacks on churches and the kidnap of girls by islamist extremists intent on forcing them to marry muslims , a report says . in the past year , egypt has moved up an annual league table of persecution of christians compiled by the charity open doors . according to its world watch list , north korea is still the most dangerous country in the world in which to be a christian , and nepal has had the biggest increase in persecution . ",
        "but egypt , home to the largest christian community in the middle east , is of particular worry . officially about 10 % of the 95 million population are christian , although many believe the figure is significantly higher . the overwhelming majority are orthodox , with up to 1 million evangelical christians and 250,000 catholics . orthodox christians celebrated christmas on sunday amid tight security , days after at least 11 were killed in attacks . the president , abdel fatah al-sisi , attended midnight mass at a new cathedral 30 miles east of the capital as tens of thousands of armed soldiers patrolled streets around churches all over egypt . ",
        "according to open doors , 128 christians were killed in egypt for their faith and more than 200 were driven out of their homes in 2017 . it attributed the rise in persecution to `` the overspill of islamic terrorists driven out of iraq and syria '' . last easter , two church bombings killed 49 people , and another 29 were killed when extremists attacked people travelling to a monastery in may . more than 15 girls in minya governorate were kidnapped in 2017 to be forced to marry muslims and convert to islam , open doors said . ",
        "`` michael jones '' , a cairo-based businessman and evangelical christian , told the guardian there was a gulf between statements from the national leadership regarding the christian community and actions at a local level . `` you hear the president speaking about christians with a lot of respect and sympathy . just a few days ago , he made a beautiful , emotional speech when inaugurating our new cathedral . it looked like an amazing affirmation that the state is supporting the church and the christian community , and doing everything it can to guarantee our welfare , '' said jones , who asked for his real name not to be used . ",
        "`` then you have have the local authorities in villages and towns -- police , judges , business owners -- and it 's evident that many of them are infected with a rejection of christianity . you see this in daily practices -- not usually violence , but discrimination . '' jones said christians were overlooked for jobs or promotion , university students were given bad grades or failed , schoolchildren were made to sit at the back of the class , shop owners were boycotted and hospital patients were not given proper treatment . `` there is only a minority of violent extremists , but the culture in egypt cherishes the perception that christians are infidels , '' he said . ",
        "the response of the christian community was one of endurance , prayer and forgiveness , he said . `` by forgiving our attackers , we 're not saying they should not be punished but retaliation and revenge is not our response . we do n't want to be part of a cycle of violence . '' jones , who is to address mps and peers in parliament next week , said many christians had left egypt because of discrimination and persecution . `` i have thought about leaving many times , but i believe god will take care of me . ",
        "i do n't want my life defined by fear , '' he said . lisa pearce of open doors said : `` christians in egypt face a barrage of discrimination and intimidation yet they refuse to give up their faith . it is hard for us ... to imagine being defined by our religion every single day in every sphere of life . `` in egypt , as in many other middle eastern countries , your religion is stated on your identity card . this makes discrimination and persecution easy -- you are overlooked for jobs , planning permits are hard to obtain and you are a target when you go to church . '' ",
        "as well as highlighting persecution of christians in egypt , open doors said south-east asia was the next emerging hotspot , fuelled by islamist extremism in malaysia , indonesia , the philippines and the maldives .   "
