        "paris - a strike by french prison guards entered its second week on monday , with union officials vowing to continue the movement after holding talks with the government over demands for better security and pay after a series of attacks on staff by inmates . the protests , which have disrupted prisons across the country , began after a convicted al-qaeda extremist attacked guards in a high-security facility with a razor blade , injuring three of them . on monday , around 150 guards continued to block access to the fleury-merogis prison south of paris -- europe 's biggest -- with tyres and pallets . ",
        "last week , police clashed with the guards , using tear gas and baton charges to clear a path through the barricades . between 120 and 130 of the 188 prisons nationwide had been affected by the strike actions on monday , with access completely blocked at some of them , said ufap-unsa , the largest union among prison guards . justice minister nicole belloubet said after a meeting with union leaders that talks would continue tuesday on creating more guard jobs , security fears and pay . the government had already said saturday that 1,100 new jobs would be created over the next four years , and that it would create a special regime that allows for a `` total lockdown '' on the most dangerous detainees , measures dismissed by the guards as insufficient . ",
        "`` it 's already a considerable effort , '' belloubet said monday , adding that she was `` not sure of being able to do much more '' . - radicalisation risks - `` suspending the movement is out of the question , '' said jean-francois forget of ufap-unsa . french prison guards have long complained of low pay , insufficient staffing and overcrowding . and lately the country 's prisons have developed a reputation for being hotbeds of radical islam that have turned out some of the jihadists behind a series of bloody attacks in the past three years . ",
        "guards complain that the conditions in which violent and radicalised inmates are held are too lenient . last week , three inmates at a prison on the island of corsica , one of whom was under surveillance for islamic radicalisation , attacked two guards with a knife , wounding one of them seriously . in the northern calais region , a male and a female guard were treated in hospital for injuries on sunday after being attacked by a prisoner with an iron table leg . - mattresses on floors - the average occupancy rate in french prisons is 118 percent , but at some prisons such as fresnes near paris it has risen to around 200 percent , forcing some prisoners to bed down on mattresses on the floor . ",
        "adding to the guards ' concerns is the radicalisation of inmates who come under the sway of islamic extremists . of the roughly 70,000 prisoners held in french jails in december , 504 were convicted or awaiting trial on terrorism charges and some 1,200 others were under surveillance for radicalisation . the tipping point for many guards came when german convict christian ganczarski , a former top al-qaeda militant , attacked three officers with scissors and a razor blade . president emmanuel macron has called the overcrowding in prisons `` disgraceful '' . he has vowed to create places for an additional 15,000 inmates and switch to a `` massive '' use of alternatives to incarceration , such as community service or freeing prisoners fitted with an electronic bracelet .
