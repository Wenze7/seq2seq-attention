        "clinicians can now take wound depth measurements at the point of care using a regular smartphone camera thnaks to new technology . the technology comes from swift medical . swift medical specializes in wound care management technology . this month the company has launches a new platform called swift autodepth technology . the technology enables clinicians to take wound depth measurements at the point of care using a regular smartphone camera instead of expensive medical devices . taking such measurements is of clinical importance , since wounds heal from the inside out , and wound depth measurement is an important indicator in determining if a wound is healing properly . ",
        "to discover more about swift autodepth 's contact-free and painless method for clinicians to automatically document wound depth , digital journal caught up with swift medical ceo , carlo perez . digital journal : how is the medical technology landscape changing ? carlo perez : most noticeably , mobile smartphone technology continues to help digitize and transform medicine . for instance , swift skin and wound allows doctors and nurses to make immediate , more informed decisions , reduce errors , and eliminate paperwork . but equally powerful forces like telemedicine , ai , big data and the continued digitization of information indicate far more change to come . ",
        "dj : what would you say to medics who are less convinced about new technologies ? perez : obviously , those who choose careers in healthcare are eager for their patients to have the best outcomes possible and appreciate technology that help do that . if they are skeptical about new technologies it is likely because they 've been forced to adopt technologies that were difficult to learn , awkward to use or unreliable . so for us , that means we 've only got one chance to win them over . i think it also explains our success . ",
        "for clinicians , using our smartphone app really is as easy as taking a picture . dj : what services and products does swift medical technology provide ? perez : our flagship product is swift skin and wound . it includes a smartphone app that is used by clinicians to capture wound care information as easily as taking a picture . it provides immediate wound analysis using our proprietary machine vision algorithms . beyond the app , our web-based dashboard allows for real-time collaboration and reporting . to users it seems simple but behind swift is the world 's most advanced point-of-care wound care visualization , measurement and analysis technology . ",
        "this , as well as our end-to-end integration with their systems is the reason industry giants like point click care and healogics choose to work with us . dj : with your recent partnership with healogics photo measurement , how will this assist medics ? perez : presently clinicians at healogics use traditional ruler-based methods to measure wound length , width and surface area . healogics photo measurement now enables physicians to provide the consistent , accurate wound size and data collection vital to the practice of quality wound care today . our solution also leverages data from healogics electronic medical record , i-heal 2.0 Â® , to allow for richer , real-time collaboration and more meaningful wound care reporting . ",
        "most importantly , healogics patients can take comfort in knowing that they are receiving state-of - the - art wound care . dj : in which format are the images captured ? perez : images are captured at the highest resolution of the device on which the app is installed . dj : how was the system tested to assess its reliability ? perez : there are too many methods , spanning months of engineering and medical assessments to mention . in terms of accuracy and reliability of measurement , we test with novice users who have no wound care training . ",
        "they measure the length , width and area of plastic model wounds using the swift app . high accuracies and high inter-rater reliabilities were obtained using the swift wound app . using the traditional ruler method also yielded reliable wound measurements , albeit lower than that of the swift wound app . dj : are there any data security concerns ? perez : security is of tantamount concern . our solution is engineered to protect patient data and conform to , or exceed , client and federal patient data requirements . dj : what other projects are you working on ? ",
        "perez : we 're really excited about a new feature called swift autodepth . it is a first in smartphone apps , allowing doctors and nurses to move their smartphone over the wound and measure wound depth with just a phone . for patients that means the wound no longer has to be measured with a cotton swab and ruler . they have less discomfort while their doctors get more consistent , reliable results .
