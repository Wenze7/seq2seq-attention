        "on wednesday in the washington post , vice president mike pence contrasted his boss 's response to protests in iran to president obama 's response in 2009 . obama , he said , had `` stayed silent '' and `` declined to stand with a proud people who sought to escape from under the heavy weight of a dictatorship . '' but `` under president trump , '' pence crowed , `` the united states is standing with them . `` this is a lie . obama did not `` stay silent . '' he declared himself `` appalled and outraged by the threats , beatings and imprisonments '' of iranian protesters . ",
        "his administration also leaned on twitter to ensure that iranians could continue using it to organize their demonstrations . obama did , however , temper his public comments , so as `` to avoid the united states being the issue inside of iran . '' given its history , obama argued , if the u. s. were `` seen as meddling , '' it could harm the protesters ' cause . trump , by contrast , as is his nature , has put himself center stage . three times since the beginning of the year , he 's tweeted his condemnation of the government in tehran and his support for the people demonstrating against it . ",
        "and overwhelmingly , conservatives -- even those who dislike trump -- have declared his approach superior . which is odd . because it is conservatives , of all people , who should recognize its risks . they should recognize its risks for two reasons . first , because american conservatives have spent the last half-century warning that virtuous rhetoric , and even virtuous intentions , do not necessarily produce virtuous results . think about the right 's critique of government intervention to alleviate poverty . it 's built on the contention that while liberals may denounce poverty more passionately than do conservatives , their policies , even when well-intentioned , actually hurt the poor . ",
        "why ? because human behavior is too complex for government planners to understand , so when they try to make people zig , people often zag instead . irving kristol , among the most influential conservative intellectuals of the 20th century , declared in 1972 that , `` i have observed over the years that the unanticipated consequences of social action are always more important , and usually less agreeable , than the intended consequences . `` kristol 's journal , the public interest , focused mostly on domestic policy . but later in that decade , jeane kirkpatrick employed the same logic to critique jimmy carter 's foreign policy . ",
        "carter , she acknowledged in her famous essay `` dictatorships and double standards , '' was genuinely `` repelled by frankly non-democratic rulers . '' but in his efforts to engineer a democratic transfer of power in nicaragua and iran , he ended up ushering in more brutal dictatorships instead . `` history , '' she lectured , `` is a better guide than good intentions . `` none of this means trump 's high-profile approach to the iranian protests is necessarily wrong . conservatives do n't believe that government actions always backfire . but it is odd to hear a conservative like pence speak as if government intentions inherently bring about their desired result , that because trump is embracing the protesters more loudly than obama did , he 's necessarily doing a better job of advancing their cause . ",
        "it 's particularly odd because american policy toward iran is exactly the kind of situation most likely to produce unintended consequences . if translating intentions into results is difficult domestically , it 's even harder overseas , especially in a country like iran -- from which the united states has been largely isolated since 1979 -- and whose domestic political dynamics american officials only dimly understand . in fact , american policy in the middle east since september 11 has been a festival of unintended consequences -- measured mostly in innocent lives lost . in addition , america 's war in afghanistan , which was expected to highlight american power , has helped china deepen its economic influence in central asia . ",
        "america 's war in iraq , which was expected to vanquish terrorism and weaken iran , helped create isis and extend tehran 's power . the `` war on terror , '' which was designed to prevent terrorism from the world 's ungoverned spaces , has instead ended up creating more : from iraq to libya to mali . one reason for these unintended consequences is nationalism . people in afghanistan , iraq and libya have not behaved as the united states hoped they would , in part , because many afghans , iraqis , and libyans -- despite loathing their anti-american leaders -- also deeply distrusted the united states . ",
        "that 's likely also the case in iran . pence may believe , as he claimed in his op-ed , that the united states `` has long stood with those who yearn for freedom . '' but most iranians do n't . in 1953 , after all , the united states helped overthrow a democratically elected iranian leader and then spent the next several decades propping up iran 's repressive shah . the u. s. supported saddam hussein in a war in which he gassed iranians . and it has still never apologized for accidentally downing an iranian passenger jet in 1988 , and killing 274 people . ",
        "the united states is also largely responsible for the economic sanctions that have impoverished ordinary iranians , and which , according to polls , they bitterly resent . trump has added to this ugly record by banning iranians from entering the united states and repeatedly denigrating muslims and islam . it 's hardly surprising , therefore , that according to a 2016 survey by the university of maryland 's center for international and security studies , 87 percent of iranians held a negative view of the united states government . and that by a margin of three to one , according to a zogby research services poll taken last summer , iranians think trump has made u. s.-iranian relations worse . ",
        "given these conditions , it 's quite plausible to fear -- as obama did -- that heavy-handed american intervention could provoke a nationalist backlash that helps iran 's regime perpetuate its repressive ways . conservatives should understand this because they , more than liberals , grasp nationalism 's appeal . to the extent trumpism means anything , it means the celebration and exploitation of american nationalism against a series of adversaries -- immigrants , trade deals , the un , disloyal minorities , globalist elites -- who supposedly threaten the sovereignty and integrity of the united states . trump celebrates that kind of nationalism in europe too . ",
        "thus , his supporters , of all people , should understand that iranians value their sovereignty too , and are unlikely to welcome american interference , no matter how badly they want their regime overthrown . why ca n't pence understand that ? i suspect a lot of it has to do with ronald reagan . reagan , according to conservative legend , denounced the ussr -- calling it an evil empire and demanding that it tear down the berlin wall -- and thus helped inspire the revolts that brought down the soviet empire . pence wants to do something similar in iran . ",
        "but it 's a poor analogy . eastern european countries like poland were suffering under soviet domination , and had little history of being dominated by the united states . thus , reagan was able to help stoke a polish nationalism that expressed itself largely against moscow . iranians , by contrast , are rising up against homegrown dictators who use the specter of american domination to justify their hold on power . iranians are thus less like poles in the 1980s than nicaraguans in the 1980s , who distrusted reagan 's denunciations of their repressive sandinista government because of their long , ugly experience with american power . ",
        "it 's ironic that pence , in his oped , called iranians `` proud . '' it 's precisely because they are proud -- because , like americans , they desire both individual freedom and national self-determination -- that they can reject ayatollah khamenei while also rejecting donald trump .   "
