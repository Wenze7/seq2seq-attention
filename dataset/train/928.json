        "my girlfriend recently got a job at a government law office and quickly made friends with a male co worker . i asked about him and she said `` i can see myself being friends with him . he 's the only co worker i can hang out with because we have quite a bit in common . '' one day after work , they both walk to target to buy some things . they exchange numbers in case one of them gets lost finding the other in the store . i told her she should n't have given her number like that and she apologized and deleted it . ",
        "he texts her during the day to grab lunch but she turns him down and does n't follow up knowing it bothers me until i meet the guy . today , i found out he texted her to hang out but she replied she was busy . i later went back on her phone and noticed the text message was deleted . why did she need to delete the message ? if it does n't mean anything should n't she have just left it there ? any insight/advice on how to get passed this would be great . thanks .
