        "the theory of change it 's a tool that ables us to organise concepts and helps us see the big picture . we can identify the changes we need to make and what steps are involved for those to happen after measuring all risks and sharing our assumptions . i 'm creating a strategy plan for my new project , a new social network . that being said , this will be fantastic in terms of revealing if i 'm taking the right steps to meet my goals , which activities and results i can get myself alone and the ones i ca n't or even how to measure the impact as a whole company . ",
        "in order to have decent results from this method , i 'll need to know what main problem my product or service will solve and what audience is the most appropriate . once i have this data , it will help me be more efficient and proactive . it 's fundamental to do some research and find what target audience is most affected and what partnerships or organisations will work in the future to make this whole project attainable . where to start ? what are the next steps ? we need these answers to know how to proceed and keep oriented . ",
        "it takes time and persistence to be business oriented and have a detailed strategy . overall , these will guide me to all possible outcomes , and they 'll make the difference when trying to get costumers attention . the business vision needs to be concise and approachable . how can a costumer benefit from my services ? what is the long term change you see as your goal ? by the time you 're completing what 's required , you may find any inconsistencies . improve them and be as much detailed as possible .
