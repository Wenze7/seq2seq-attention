        "this semester in first year seminar has been surprisingly productive for me . even though i initially walked into the class as a stressed , procrastinating student with no idea what they were doing , i 've managed to grow into a stressed student with a plan and a solid study schedule . through trial and error , i 've managed to figure out methods to use while studying that will help me work in a more efficient manner . in the beginning , i only knew how to cram at the last minute and hope i could remember the vital information so that i could pass my exams . ",
        "now , i know how to study over an extended length of time so that i can actually process the information and make it easier to recall when the time comes . hopefully , if i 'm able to stay consistent , i 'll see an improvement in my exam scores and have a better understanding of the material i 'm learning each semester . when it comes to stress , i still struggle to manage it . when i started fys , it was something i let consume me until i could n't function properly . now , stress is something i am constantly battling , but it 's no longer crippling . ",
        "while it is something i can face without shutting down , i still think i could improve my stress management skills . in class , i 've learned a few ways to manage , and sometimes even prevent , stress . while i 've yet to try these techniques , i plan to put them into action very soon in preparation for both finals and the future . a few google searches about how to manage stress probably would n't hurt either . by experimenting with these methods , i hope to better understand what causes me to be stressed the most , and then i can attempt to manage stress in an effective way so that it does n't get out of hand . ",
        "in time , i believe these skills will aid me well as i take on the college experience .   "
