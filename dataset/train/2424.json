        "michael gove is facing demands from labour to explain whether the government has abandoned a conservative general election manifesto pledge to give mps a free vote on whether to overturn the foxhunting ban . it follows reports that theresa may will announce in early 2018 plans to permanently drop the commitment to a house of commons vote , in a move that would risk infuriating rural tories . senior labour figures have become increasingly aware of the government 's vulnerability on animal welfare issues . sue hayman , the shadow environment secretary , said gove needed to make a statement clarifying the government 's plans . ",
        "hayman said : `` while hunts around the country continue to defy the ban , the vast majority of the public do not want a return of this cruel and barbaric activity . the tories need to put the debate to rest and pledge that they will never again try to bring back foxhunting . `` if the tories ' claims about animal welfare were true , they would have ruled out the return of foxhunting months ago , rethought their poorly regulated badger cull , and not tried to water down existing eu standards on animal welfare . `` a downing street source declined to say that initial reports in the sunday times were wrong but instead said it was `` pure speculation '' and reiterated the government 's position . ",
        "`` there is no vote that could change the current policy on foxhunting scheduled in this session of parliament , which ends in 2019 , '' the source said . gove has prioritised animal welfare issues since being appointed environment secretary after the june election . this weekend , he announced plans to end puppy smuggling . in a draft bill , animal sentience is enshrined in uk law and five-year jail sentences for animal cruelty are introduced . it follows a widely distributed fake news story which claimed that the tories did not believe that animals were sentient beings . ",
        "may surprised many when she announced plans during the election campaign to allow mps to have a free vote on foxhunting . during a factory visit to leeds during the election campaign , she said : `` as it happens , personally i have always been in favour of foxhunting , and we maintain our commitment - we have had a commitment previously as a conservative party - to allow a free vote . `` it was banned by tony blair 's government in 2004 but has been at the forefront of campaigns by conservative-leaning pressure groups including the countryside alliance . ",
        "jeremy corbyn , the labour leader , repeatedly criticised the prime minister for saying she was in favour of foxhunting during the election campaign . the conservatives pledged in their manifesto to hold a free vote on a bill in government , in time to allow parliament to decide the future of the hunting act 2004 . the policy 's omission from the queen 's speech , which outlined the legislative programme for the parliamentary session of 2017 until 2019 , was the first indicator that the plan had been put on the back burner . the law , introduced by labour in 2004 , bans the use of dogs to hunt foxes and other wild mammals in england and wales .
