        "there 's one spot on the houston astros roster that could be a real weakness heading into the 2018 season , and that would be the back end of their bullpen . to be more specific : the closer role . in an effort to address that issue , the astros could be a potential landing spot for free agent closer greg holland , according to jon heyman of fan rag sports . the astros could also have interest in free agent reliever addison reed , who has closing experience , but with their current ninth-inning man , ken giles , having his struggles during the postseason , the defending champs could jump out on the market and grab the top closer available in holland . ",
        "holland , 32 , had a nice 2017 season in his lone year with the colorado rockies , posting a 3.61 era and 41 saves over 61 appearances . the astros could put their focus on the rotation , especially with dallas keuchel being a free agent after 2018 and justin verlander entering free agency after the 2019 season , but their need at the moment is in the bullpen .
