        "jakarta - england 's justin rose fired a 10-under-par round thursday to take a two-shot lead after the first day of the indonesian masters in jakarta . rose , who is ranked sixth in the world , notched up a bogey-free scorecard and bagged 10 birdies to take pole position in the asian tour 's season-ending event . thailand 's gunn charoenkul was two shots back on 64 , one ahead of fellow thai phachara khongwatmai -- who eagled the 18th -- and south korea 's giwhan kim . rose has enjoyed a stellar end to the year , with back-to-back wins in china and turkey in the past two months , and carried the same form into day one at the royale jakarta golf club . ",
        "the 2016 olympics gold medallist parred the first before rattling off three birdies in a row . his round of 62 could have been a course record if not for the preferred lie ruling which was in force . `` that is a dream start to be honest with you , '' rose said . `` i felt comfortable from the outset . i did all the right things today i suppose , i put the ball in play from the tee . `` playing alongside rose , newly crowned asian tour champion gavin green shot an underwhelming 70 to finish two under . ",
        "the 23-year-old malaysian , who holds an unassailable lead coming into the indonesian masters , will be officially crowned on the final day of the event . veteran american brandt snedeker scored an on-par 72 , while defending champion poom saksansin , from thailand , was one under for a share of 59th . indonesian rinaldi adiyandono was the best placed of the 26 locals in the field after a round of 68 .
