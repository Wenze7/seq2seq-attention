        "woodbridge -- east haven junior mckenzie helms has only been a part of the east haven girls basketball program a few short weeks and she can already see the difference . with all the hype of being one of the top teams in the area , helms and her east haven teammates are fully aware what that notoriety will bring . such was the case friday evening when the yellowjackets traveled to woodbridge to face another up and coming team in amity . showing a ton of resiliency in the fourth quarter and overtime , the yellowjackets won their fourth straight game to start the season with a 61-60 southern connecticut conference interdivision victory at paul mengold gymnasium at amity high . ",
        "`` it is tough when you are one of the top teams because everyone is out to beat you , '' helms said after scoring 23 points . `` they come at you harder . but , we know what we have to do . we pushed hard at the end . '' east haven coach anthony russell may not have been pleased with his team in the first half , but the second half was a different story . despite letting a nine point lead with under one minute left in the third quarter disappear when amity evened the game at 49 on jenna van hise 's basket at the buzzer in the fourth quarter , the yellowjackets were perfect at the line in overtime , hitting all eight free throws , to protect the lead . ",
        "`` this was a game where we had to work at it , '' russell said . `` one possession could have determined the game . being eight-for-eight in overtime really helps . i thought we had some good possessions and did not turn the ball over . we were a little sloppy defensively . '' while amity was making its second half comeback , east haven also had to deal with the fact two of its top players , kylie schlottman and isabella ragaini were in foul trouble . ragaini eventually fouled out of the contest with 1:57 left in overtime and the yellowjackets up a pair . ",
        "amity scored the next four points on a pair of free throws by leia foyer and amanda granados for a 55-53 advantage , before east haven 's alexis pendziwater tied the game at 55 with 1:28 remaining in the extra session . following an amity miss , schlottman hit a pair of free throws to give east haven the lead for good at 57-55 . another amity miss was rebounded by pendziwater , setting up two more free throws by helms for a four point lead with 42 seconds to go . `` the roles are reversed for us , '' russell said . ",
        "`` we went from one of the middle teams where we were trying to beat the top teams to teams are coming after us with nothing to lose . we have to be prepared for that . '' a 3-pointer by granados with 29 seconds left had the spartans within 59-58 , but helms drained two more from the free throw line to seal the game with 19 seconds to go . `` we knew coming in , we had to play an outstanding game , '' amity coach michelle shoop said . `` east haven has two fantastic players and they have a great supporting cast . ",
        "we knew we would all need to come together . we had a game plan that we really executed well . we fought hard , but came up a little short . last year , we were very young and had little varsity experience . this year , we have that varsity experience and it showed . we fought , but came up short . '' behind five points from jillian martin , and four apiece from tara laugeni and van hise , amity led 15-10 after one quarter . the lead was 28-27 at the half , before east haven used a 13-5 run to take a 40-33 lead with 1:14 left in the third quarter . ",
        "laugeni led three amity players in double figures with 16 points . granados added 15 points , and van hise had 13 . laugeni also added 13 rebounds , while van hise had 10 boards for the spartans . schlottman finished with 20 points and ragaini added 16 in the win for east haven .   ",
