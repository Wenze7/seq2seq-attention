        "it seems that lg could have a couple of new devices in the works that might be unveiled in the near future . according to evan blass , it appears that lg has filed for trademarks for a couple of devices . one of which is a smartwatch called `` icon '' , and the other isa smartphone called `` iconic '' . there have been reports to suggest that lg could be rebranding its g-series flagship handsets , and so it has been speculated that the `` icon '' moniker could be an indication of that happening . at this point in time it is unclear as to what kind of specs/features we can expect from the phone or smartphone , so we 'll have to wait and see . ",
        "it is possible that we might not even find out about it at mwc 2018 which takes place in february . according to a recent report , it was revealed that lg 's flagship smartphone could be launched in march instead , but since nothing is official yet it 's probably best to take it with a grain of salt . in the meantime lg has confirmed that they will no longer be releasing flagship smartphones on an annual basis , and will only launch new handsets `` when it is needed '' . it will be a pity as lg does make some pretty decent handsets .
