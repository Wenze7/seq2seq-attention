        "adam carterreporter , cbc hamilton adam carter is a newfoundlander who now calls hamilton , ont . home . he enjoys a good story and playing loud music in dank bars . you can follow him on twitter @adamcartercbc or drop him an email at adam . carter@cbc . ca . tammy burgess 's daughter brookelynne died alone , helpless , with a needle stuck in her arm . she wants to make sure that does n't happen to anyone else . burgess appeared before city councillors monday to plead for them to endorse a supervised injection site in hamilton -- a place drug users could more safely inject substances like opioids and crystal meth . ",
        "crystal meth use exploding in hamilton city report recommends a supervised injection site in hamilton she got her wish . the board of health voted to endorse a report that recommends the city should have at least one supervised injection site . `` i stand here today not to ask , but to demand as a grieving mother , that you get these safe injection sites into hamilton before more people lose their loved ones and addicts have a safe place to use , '' burgess said . `` i know my daughter would have been alive today if there was a safe injection site she could have gone to . ",
        "i know that with all my heart . '' ` it really is a no brainer . not only are we saving lives , we 're saving money . ' burgess 's daughter died nine months ago of an overdose at age 24 . she described brookelynne 's struggle for councillors , even recounting the heartbreaking instances in which she found her daughter in medical distress during previous overdoses . burgess once found her daughter turning blue , with her eyes rolling back in her head . she ended up doing chest compressions on her own flesh and blood . ",
        "her daughter endured multiple overdoses , and developed a skin condition from reusing her own needles . brookelynne would fight with her , telling her mother she hated her guts . `` that was not my brookelynne talking . it was the fentanyl , which was taking her life , '' she said . `` i know my brookelynne would have went to an sis the day she lost her life , because she was alone , and knew she would have been saved . she knew it would destroy her family if she died . '' 43 opioid overdose deaths in 2016 alone a new city study says hamilton would benefit from `` one or more '' supervised injection sites , where people could inject drugs without fear of legal consequences , and under the care of medical professionals . ",
        "now that the board of health has voted to endorse that idea , it will go before city council as a whole . should council okay it as well , that endorsement can be used by a healthcare provider in its application to health canada , seeking approval for a site . councillors heard from public health staffers today that in general , the cash for setting up supervised injection sites across canada has been coming from provincial governments , though municipalities may end up incurring some operating costs down the line . the data also outlines the stark realities that people with addictions are living with in hamilton today . ",
        "in 2016 , 43 people died in hamilton due to accidental opioid poisoning , which is above the provincial average . that number has more than quadrupled since 2002 . the report says a safer site should be in the lower city , located in the area flanked by queen street , barton street , ferguson avenue and main street . the study also says additional sites should eventually be considered , with an eye to the east end and the mountain . councillors speak out in favour ward 2 coun . jason farr was adamant that his ward would benefit from a supervised injection site , even if some residents will undoubtedly cry `` not in my backyard . '' ",
        "`` this is the ward where discarded needles can be found right now , steps from city hall ... this is an issue for a lot of residents in ward 2 , '' he said . `` it 's is already in our backyard . worse , we 're seeing those with this disease dying . '' other councillors spoke out in favour as well . `` in a perfect world , we 'd love to see no one use illicit intravenous drugs . the reality is , they do , '' ward 4 coun . sam merulla said , adding that there are social and long term fiscal benefits to these sites , which research has shown would ease the strain on paramedic and hospital services . ",
        "`` it really is a no-brainer . not only are we saving lives , we 're saving money , '' merulla said . ward 8 coun . terry whitehead was on board as well . `` if it ends up salvaging one life ... then i think it 's worth the investment , '' he said . councillors stood and applauded as they voted in favour to endorse the injection sites , and were joined by many spectators who were sitting in the public gallery . one of those was burgess , clapping her hands while tears flowed freely down her face . ",
        "`` it is going to save lives , '' she insisted .   "
