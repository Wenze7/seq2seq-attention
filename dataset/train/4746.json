        "contractors may benefit in making a small equity investment in the projects they construct . the financial benefit can arise from the investment itself and from improved understanding and communication with the owner during construction itself . in the past , it was not unusual for construction companies to make small equity investments in the projects they worked on . for example , a construction company building a power plant would take a 5 % equity interest in the project . by taking a financial stake in the project , contractors planned to protect their business interest in the project . ",
        "that was the theory , anyway . many of these investments did not provide the good returns ; often-times the return was negative . while the construction company 's management was great at operating the construction business , it was not so great when it came to the financing business . so the idea went out of fashion . but maybe it is time to revisit the idea . in general , epcs that successfully realized investment returns typically invest through an independent financing arm . samsung c & t and aecom have successfully invested through an affiliated financing arm . ",
        "this structure appears to be working well , likely due to the independence and specialization of the financing division . the construction division 's desire to get hired for the project does not overpower the financing arm 's clinical financial analysis of whether or not the project will be profitable , and therefore , worth the investment . there are also other benefits to an equity investment . in a project , the epc often is in the dark as to how the project owner views the on-going work , or how the owner views the change or enlargement of the work scope , and the corresponding increase in the construction cost . ",
        "on the other hand , the epc views the change to the project as an opportunity to increase profit . there are times when the project owner and the epc see eye-to-eye on the necessary change order and reach an agreement on the scope and price . but more often than not , this is not the case , especially when the project is delayed . in such circumstances , the owner may resort to calling the performance bond and demand that the epc continue with the work and resolve the dispute after the project is completed . in a project where the epc 's investment arm has made an investment , the outcome may differ , especially if the investment allows the epc to have a board seat or access to project management . ",
        "the epc will certainly have better insight into the owner 's thought process in a way that a contractor would not because of the ability to observe the decision making process of the owner , or at least be made privy to information that is driving the owner 's decisions . under such circumstances , the epc will better understand the concerns of the owner before it morphs into a lawsuit . but disputes nevertheless happen and an owner will call the performance bond . the performance bond typically ranges from 5 % to 10 % of the value of the construction work , often wiping out the profit margin of the epc if such bonds are called . ",
        "when that happens , it often takes years to resolve the dispute and to recover the bond amount forfeited , if any . rather than posting a large bond , it may be better for an epc to make an equity investment in the project and reduce the amount of the bond . at the beginning of the project , the owner may appreciate the investment ; and that at the end of the project construction , the epc may find it reassuring . indeed , the epc 's equity investment would give confidence to the owners and lenders to the project , and even function as a development funding for developers . ",
        "during and at the end of the construction work , if any disagreement is not resolved , the epc may find the equity investment to be more valuable than the prospect of losing the bond . there may be a conflict of interest and disadvantages to an epc becoming an investor . but the benefits to the epc that makes an equity investment in a project is obvious . it may be time to revisit the financing model again .
