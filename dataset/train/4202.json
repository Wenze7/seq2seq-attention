        "the president of venezuela 's national constituent assembly has taken the first step toward expelling a top canadian diplomat . venezuela responds to trump 's ` belligerent threats ' with military exercises ` people live day to day ' : why venezuela is in crisis delcy rodriguez declared chargé d'affaires craig kowalik persona non grata on saturday , a move which does away with his diplomatic credentials . chargé d'affaires is a diplomat who heads an embassy in the absence of the ambassador . at the same time , rodriguez announced ambassador ruy pereira of brazil would also be considered persona non grata . ",
        "the associated press reported that rodriguez accused both kowalik and pereira of meddling in the country 's politics . the associated press also reported that rodriguez said kowalik has a history of tweeting `` rude and vulgar '' comments about venezuela , but it was unclear what tweets she was referring to . a twitter account that appears to be kowalik 's personal account contains no tweets . in canada , global affairs spokesperson natasha nystrom said the move to delegitimize kowalik will not change canada 's focus . `` our resolve remains unchanged . we will continue to work to address this situation and help the venezuelan people , '' she said . ",
        "`` we will continue to work with our partners in the region to apply pressure on the anti-democratic maduro regime and restore the rights of the venezuelan people . '' canada sanctioned rodriguez canada has been critical of president nicolas maduro 's ruling party for consolidating power and isolating the country 's opposition parties . as well , canada has protested the constituent national assembly , saying it was undemocratically elected last july . venezuela -- an oil-rich country that was led by outspoken socialist hugo chavez from 1999 to 2013 -- has suffered an economic meltdown since his death . ",
        "the dramatic drop in global oil prices since late 2014 and the devaluation of the country 's currency have fuelled triple-digit inflation that has resulted in shortages of food , medicine and other basic necessities . in september , canada 's minister of foreign affairs chrystia freeland announced that canada had imposed sanctions against 40 key figures in the venezuelan regime . the list includes both maduro and rodriguez . and in october , freeland noted that canada has a role to play in promoting democractic institutions in venezuela . `` we are seeing real preventable suffering of the people of venezuela , '' freeland said . ",
        "`` and i think ... there are mounting signs of a regional refugee crisis as well . colombia and brazil are facing a lot of pressure . so i think it is an area where canada needs to be very engaged . '' she went on to appeal to european countries to join canada in putting pressure on venezuela . u. s. president donald trump 's administration has been especially critical of maduro , and , like canada , imposed sanctions on him and others earlier this year . `` we urge maduro 's regime to respect human rights , '' the u. s. embassy tweeted on saturday , calling for the freedom of 268 people activists consider political prisoners .
