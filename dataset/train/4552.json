        "in my second life , i had been a lagos boy . a lagos boy in love . i had fallen for a girl as pretty as she could be . her eyes were as peaceful as my mother 's smile , her voice as soothing as the hymns of old , she was an exquisite work of art . her beauty was perfect for me . but sadly , i could n't say the same of her mind . a striking opposite of her angelic looks . she was fooled by ignorance and the wrong things , my soul kept saying she was poison . ",
        "but i showed no concern for these things , her beauty was enough for me . lost in love and her outstanding beautyi could n't picture a life where she 's not with me . `` i will live and die with you , my dear `` i promised on a happy evening . if only i knew how much of a fool i was , for my wild girl had wild-ed awayand after a month of profound painshe got diagnosed of cancer , the lung kind . on a certain rainy evening , unaware of what our stars had planned for me . ",
        "we sat drowning in sadness and two cups of tea . i was angry at the world my beauty would be taken from me . `` love , you have no idea how sad i am , i have pictured immortal love . an eternity with you . why must death be as cruel as the sound of his name . `` but with an angelic smile and a gentle tea gulp , staring directly at my already empty cup . my love gave the most terrifying response . `` immortal love we will have , my dear . for tonight , siting still . ",
        "we will leave the earth . i remember the wish you had made to me . and as my last gift to you , i have drugged our tea . the evil of illness wo n't dictate our time . so smile , my love . let us die in style . `` two hours later the rain came to a stopand so did our poor hearts . four lives later , with no memory of my past lives . i have fallen in love againwith a girl as pretty as she could be . her eyes are as peaceful as my mother 's smileher voice as soothing as the hymns of old . ",
        "her beauty is perfect for me . i have n't had the chance to know her mindbut who cares , love as they say is blind . `` i 'll live and die with you . '' i 'll say tonight . `` your beauty is enough for me '' - akuma james ðŸ‘£ .   "
