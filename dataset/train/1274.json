        "us defense secretary james mattis Â© jonathan ernst / reutersus defense secretary jim mattis is visiting the naval base at guantanamo bay detention camp to greet troops stationed there . it is the first visit by a pentagon head to the notorious prison site since 2002 . `` secretary mattis is currently visiting with troops at guantanamo bay for the holidays to thank them for their service , '' pentagon spokesman major ben sakrisson said . mattis arrived at the naval base wednesday . he will not tour the detention facilities or discuss policy with troops . guantanamo bay became notorious in the post 9/11 era for abuse of prisoners and torture -- a practice that has not ended despite a 2009 executive order by president barack obama to stop the practice . ",
        "un rapporteur nils melzer said earlier this month that torture reportedly continues at us sites , including guantanamo . nearly 800 prisoners have been detained in guantanamo since it was opened in 2002 . some have been tortured in the detention camp , using what 's called `` enhanced interrogation techniques '' on the prison population , the overwhelming majority of whom were never charged . such `` techniques '' included waterboarding , with numerous detainees subjected to prolonged sessions of this potentially deadly torture , as well as being stripped naked and being confined in dark cells for lengthy periods of time . ",
        "nine prisoners have died in guantanamo . seven are believed to have committed suicide , and only nine have ever been convicted of a crime . some 41 prisoners remain in detention in guantanamo , with ten of them charged by a military commision . five have been cleared for release , but the trump administration has not yet signed off on that . prior to his inauguration in january , trump tweeted that prisoners in guantanamo should not be released . the visit is the first by a pentagon head in 16 years , when donald rumsfeld came to guantanamo weeks after the first arrival of prisoners from afghanistan . ",
        "obama pledged to shut down the facility but never fulfilled his vow because of strong opposition from congress and the pentagon , trump has not officially revoked his predecessor 's orders to close the detention center down , though the obama administration released 200 detainees over the years . a november 2016 study from the afghan analysts network , found that us authorities committed `` gross miscarriages of justice '' against the victims , many of whom were detained on scant evidence . it found that in regard to the eight longest-serving inmates , the military were unable to `` substantiate its accusations . '' ",
        "in july , us attorney general jeff sessions and his deputy rod rosenstein visited the detention camp to get `` up-to-date understanding of current operations . '' sessions has called guantanamo a `` very fine place for holding these kind of dangerous criminals . ''   "
