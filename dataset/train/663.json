        "the challenges and failures of dizziness treatmentthe problem with the treatment of dizziness is that the same standard protocols are usually used for every dizzy patient despite the complexity of the various causes . many patients with chronic vertigo find themselves bouncing back and forth between their primary care , neurologist , ent , physical therapist , and other providers with no sustainable outcomes . common medications used to treat dizziness include anti-depressants and anti-nausea medication . the problem here is that although the patient may not be nauseated , their brain is still not perceiving their environment correctly . ",
        "other times the standard treatment is a positional maneuver like epley 's maneuver . this may work effectively if the patient 's dizziness is due to a positional error in the inner ear , however many times this is the only form of treatment done to every patient , despite where the dizziness is coming from . error in the eara problem in the inner ear is suspected when a patient reports that they feel dizzy or off balance when changing positions such as bending over or getting out of bed . this usually manifest as feeling like your spinning or that the room you 're in is spinning around you . ",
        "in these situations , a diagnostic test called dix-hallpike can be done to see if there is nystagmus present . nystagmus is a condition of involuntary eye movements , and is a likely indicator of vertigo or bppv if present during that test . it is interesting to note that although this type of dizziness is coming from the inner ear , it still has an effect on the eyes . a sign that our anatomy is interconnected through our nervous systems . in this instance a positional maneuver like epley 's has been shown to be extremely effective . ",
        "eye do n't see the problem herewhen the eyes are n't moving and reacting the way they are meant to , this can trigger dizziness . imagine driving down a busy road . your eyes should be focused on the horizon and what 's in front of you despite remaining alert of your surroundings and the oncoming traffic . the traffic and environment passing by you as you drive should not affect your focus . now imagine catching a baseball . what happens if your eyes focus in on something beyond the ball like another player moving around in the same field of vision ? ",
        "not a pretty sight . the eyes should be able to focus and adjust according to the level of importance in the brain , dependent on survival . this means fixating on a target , pursuing a moving object and changing focus from target to target rapidly , despite any changes happening in your body position or the environment . when this does n't happen , the eyes feed the brain faulty information and can cause dizziness . this can be exposed by a precise neurological exam of the cranial nerves that control the function and movement of the eyes . ",
        "it can be further challenged by examination of the eyes during different head positions and movements . when errors or weaknesses are found , eye movement exercise therapy can be done to stimulate better gaze stability and adequate eye movements needed while a change of body position or movement in the environment is occurring . this type of treatment has not only been shown to be successful for those with chronic vertigo , but also safer and more cost effective than other forms of treatment like medication . correct the neckfinally , the wrong information coming from the neck can stimulate a feeling of dizziness . ",
        "when the neck is shifted off from the center of gravity , it creates stress in the postural muscles and joints that communicate with the brain stem . the area of the brain stem called the vestibular nuclei is responsible for providing the spinal cord information to maintain posture in response to its environment . acquired and degenerative conditions of the upper neck and spine alter the way the proprioceptive rich tissues in that area communicate with that part of the brain . structural shifts in the neck like a head tilt also affect the way your eyes perceive the environment . ",
        "this forces your eyes away from their focus on the horizon and they compensate by rolling or pitching up and down . in a brief situation your eyes can adapt to the change of position and come back to neutral but in a chronic situation this creates a 3-way sensory mismatch between the neck , the eyes , and the brain . now you have your neck telling your eyes your tipping over which is then relayed to your brain as a loss of balance . talk about a domino effect ! a `` pain in the neck '' has been shown to cause dizziness and can be explored through an extensive structural examination . ",
        "it may also be evidence through a history of chronic neck pain accompanying dizziness . an analysis of the position and alignment of the structures in the upper spine as well as a postural analysis can tell us that a primary condition in the neck is causing secondary conditions like dizziness . a chiropractor who focuses specifically on the structural correction of the upper spine can be sought out for precise and gentle corrections to bring the head and neck back onto the center of gravity and allow the nervous system to coordinate properly again . sensory integrative approachthe moral of the story is that dizziness is a complex symptom , and one treatment wo n't solve all types of dizziness . ",
        "dizziness should be approached by listening to the patient , taking a thorough history , a complete neurological and structural exam , and then , creating strategies that target the specific cause to patient 's dizziness . this leads to a more accurate diagnosis and treatment for patients who feel they have exhausted all means in their battle with dizziness .
