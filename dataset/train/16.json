        "college station -- uninvited advice for any texas a&m fans expecting immediate returns on a new $ 75 million coach : do n't peek at recruiting rankings between now and national signing day . since firing kevin sumlin in late november and hiring jimbo fisher from florida state in early december , a&m has plummeted in the 247sports composite rankings , from 11th to its current slot of 29 . there seems to be two primary reasons : the coaching change itself combined and the new early signing period . `` with only 10 players having signed in december , a&m is one of the few power five schools in the country not to have most of its class already inked , '' said brian perroni , a houston-based national recruiting analyst for 247sports . ",
        "`` with a staff that had n't been in place long , it was n't surprising that not many of the aggie ` commits ' signed , as they wanted to see what happened with the rest of the coaching staff , as well as form relationships with the new coaches . '' the aggies only have 14 signees or commitments , tied for second-lowest among any program in the top 30 rankings . as perroni mentioned 10 of those players signed early , with four still having non-binding verbal pledges to a&m . a&m has lost commitments from four-star defensive lineman bobby brown , who flipped to alabama , and four-star linebacker dashaun white , who changed his pledge to oklahoma . ",
        "four-star safety leon o'neal jr. , of cyss springs , also decommitted . perroni pointed out that a&m is considered the leader for o'neal and four-star receiver jaylen waddle of episcopal high . the aggies are in the top three for five-star cornerback isaac taylor-stuart and the top two for four-star defensive end jeremiah martin , both of whom are from california . `` the aggies need to close on those and find some linebackers , because the loss of white left the team without a commitment at that position in this class , '' perroni said . fisher , who won a national title at florida state in 2013 , has argued that the early signing period should be just prior to camp opening in august , and not in early december . ",
        "and then if a coaching change is made at a school , early signees have the option of backing out of the agreement . despite the current issues , perroni expects a&m to finish in the top 15 or 20 of the rankings , based on the closing abilities of high-revving recruiters like tim brewster , dameyune craig and bradley dale peveto . the self-described `` hunters '' also are keeping in mind next year , considering the new a&m staff got in late on the current class . also , with so many returning lettermen -- last season about two-thirds of the traveling squad were underclassmen -- there are n't as many openings . ",
        "`` the class of 2019 will be a lot more telling on how jimbo fisher & co. . will do on the recruiting trail , '' perroni said . fisher has referred to recruiting as the `` lifeline of your organization , '' and that was reflected in his eight seasons at fsu . according to 247sports the seminoles ranked fourth nationally in 2014 , third in 2015 , third in 2016 and sixth in 2017 . the aggies during the same span ranked fifth , 11th , 18th and 13th . right now , a&m 's no . 29 ranking is behind noteworthy foes texas , alabama , auburn , lsu , tcu , baylor and mississippi state , among others in the sec and in the region . ",
        "that should be a little different in early february -- or at least it had better be for expectant aggies -- and especially different a year from now . brent zwerneman is a houston chronicle staff writer . read more of his stories here . | brent . zwerneman@chron . com | @brentzwerneman .
