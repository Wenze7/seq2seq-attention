        "if you need a new show to watch on netflix this week , check out drug lords , available to stream now . netflix 's new docuseries drug lords seems to have largely slipped under the radar . it 's hard to find much substantial information on the series outside of netflix 's own homepage promotions . still , do n't let this one slip by . this series documents cartel history and is perfect for anyone with a penchant for other netflix original crime series like narcos , ozark , or even mindhunter . while these latter shows describe crime horrors through a fictionalized lens , drug lords does a better job at bringing historical details to life . ",
        "while we still may feel removed from the actual dangers of the cartel , this series tries its best to make the worldwide problem feel more realistic , closer to home . corruption runs deep , and we 're finally starting to recognize its creep into our own lives through the miracle of television . drug lords is largely successful at this attempt thanks to its format . the series employs a combination of reenactments , narrative voiceover to describe the history , and -- most importantly -- witness accounts . these tidbits are from real people , people we can relate to and from which we can begin to better understand the personal affect these crimes had on the world . ",
        "through watching drug lords , it becomes harder to separate yourselves from the harsh realities of the drug community . some of these eyewitness accounts are practically unbelievable , including one from one of pablo escobar 's most trusted hitmen . these interviews attempt to describe men of cruelty on a level which is hard to comprehend , kingpins who subscribe with extreme loyalty to their own special brand of justice . they paint these criminals like villains from a movie , who thrive on pain and torture . many of the details are simply unbelievable . it 's one thing to watch a show like narcos and see the drama brought to life by the talent of actors , and another to hear intimate details straight from the horse 's mouth .
