        "yuri gripas / reuterssure , trump 's tweet in which he taunted north korean leader kim jong un to use his `` nuclear button '' was n't exactly a great start to 2018 . and there were a lot of terrible , damaging actions that the trump administration took over the holidays , under the radar of the media and the american people -- from overturning fracking regulations to firing all members of the presidential aids commission -- many of whom were n't notified until the new year . but that said , there are things to celebrate in these first days of 2018 , and they reveal the fears of the gop and the white house , and , more importantly , the continued , if slow , loss of their grip on power . ",
        "there 's the most obvious : democrat doug jones was sworn in this week as alabama senator , causing the republicans to lose a precious seat in the senate and dropping their majority to 51 . then there 's utah gop senator orin hatch , a major trump ally who pushed through the gop tax scam , who announced this week he 'll retire by year 's end , a blow to trump and another sign of gop legislators seeing the handwriting on the wall . and there 's also democrat tina smith , added to the ranks of women in the senate and sworn in this week on the power of the #metoo movement , replacing minnesota 's retiring democratic senator al franken , who slammed trump in his last speech on the senate floor . ",
        "less focused on in much of media , however , was the white house clearly seeing the end of the line on trump 's attempt to ban transgender people from the military , which will be viewed as cowardice by religious right supporters who praised trump 's despicable and discriminatory action . these supporters will no doubt express their anger to the white house in coming days for caving in to pressure . in a surprise over the holidays and in what transgender advocates called a `` huge win , '' the justice department decided to allow enlistments to go forward for january 1 as scheduled , and transgender people indeed began enlisting . ",
        "per the washington blade : with multiple court rulings ensuring the pentagon must admit qualified openly transgender people into the u. s. military starting monday , the u. s. justice department is giving up on litigation fighting those decisions in federal appeals courts and wo n't seek a stay from the u. s. supreme court . by accepting new trans recruits , the white house has all but signed the death certificate on any ban as legal challenges proceed , possibly knowing that a study it commissioned will find what every other study has found : that trans people are no threat to the military and serve dutifully and honorably . ",
        "similarly , trump 's dubious voter fraud commission , created solely for the purpose of attempting to prove trump 's lie that he really won the popular vote but for millions of supposedly fraudulent votes , has collapsed -- dissolved by the administration itself yesterday under the weight of legal opposition and withering media criticism . this is an enormous win considering the commission would have been used to allow further voter suppression and validate voter id laws . with states refusing to cooperate , as well as with legal challenges -- including from one of its own members -- the fraudulent fraud panel could not go on . ",
        "and all the energy pushing the states , the legal challenges and awakening the american people came from the resistance . and , in a spectacle of unprecedented proportions , trump yesterday said in a statement that his former senior white house advisor and chief strategist steve bannon has `` lost his mind . '' the infuriated president was responding to bannon having been quoted in a new book calling the infamous trump tower 2016 meeting between trump campaign officials and russian operatives `` treasonous , '' in addition to many other harsh things bannon is quoted as claiming about the dysfunctional , dangerous trump white house . ",
        "as bannon did n't deny the statements all day -- and as his breitbart news promoted the story -- the trump base , including the alt-right , splintered into factions , taking sides . the comments on breitbart look like a war zone , and this is only going to get much bigger . white house press spokesperson sarah huckabee sanders called the comments `` outrageous '' and laughably tried to distance bannon from trump , saying he `` did n't have a lot of influence . '' by nightfall , trump , who had n't outright denied any of the comments specifically while excoriating bannon as `` only in it for himself , '' did what he always does as a desperate last resort : his lawyers sent bannon a cease and desist letter regarding the `` disparaging '' remarks . ",
        "all of this benefits the resistance enormously . the gop 's influence is challenged not only in the senate and the white house , but even among trump â€³ s already dwindled base , now splitting apart . only 10 months away from the 2018 mid-term elections , progressives have come together , surging in off-year and special elections , marching and continuing to protest , and putting up record numbers of women running for office . we 're of course still dealing with an onslaught of attacks and challenges , including the new assault by the justice department on legalized marijuana this week , and the fate of the dreamers in coming days as congress comes up against the spending bill deadline and a possible government shutdown . ",
        "but all things considered , it 's not a bad start to the new year . also on huffposteditor-at-large , huffpostsuggest a correctionmore : donald trumpu . s. newsrepublican politicshate speechlgbtq sexuality .   "
