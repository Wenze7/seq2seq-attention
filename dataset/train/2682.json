        "it 's been a stellar year for pc games , but which ones made the techradar pc game of the year cut ? with every year it seems we 've finally arrived in the best 12 months for gaming ever , only for the next one to roll around with yet another slew of contenders ready to take that title . so here we are again , at the end of 2017 , with a quite staggering calendar of gaming behind us on pc . whether you 're a rpg diehard , a shooter purist , an indie devotee or a collector of curios , 2017 has served up dish after tasty dish of must-have interactive experiences . ",
        "and it 's been tough to whittle all these gems down to a powerful ten , so sit back and prepare to been amazed all over again . do you really think we could put together a top ten pc game of the year list and not include bluehole inc 's battle royale masterstroke ? no other game has come close to catching the hype train that is pubg , brushing aside claims of blatant infringement and laughing in the face of similar br-esque titles that have followed in its wake . it also put the painfully buggy h1z1 mercifully to the sword . ",
        "the game 's success has helped put top twitch streamers on the map and seemingly burned the words ` winner , winner , chicken dinner ' into the subconsciousness of every gamer on the planet . while the issue surrounding bungie 's control of xp has taken off at least some of destiny 2 's sheen , there 's no denying the shooter sequel improves on the first game in almost every way . a substantial story campaign addressed plot concerns , improved matchmaking made teaming up far easier and a move towards a more overwatch-style setup in the crucible all proved bungie was listening to its fans . ",
        "with some exciting new dlc already incoming , and plans to support the title with new updates and events , destiny 2 looks likely to remain in goty lists long after 2017 has drawn to a close . originally revealed in 2014 , it took many a delay to get cuphead out into the wilds , but the way proved more than worth it with one of the most challenging run and gun platformers we 've ever played . even its gorgeous art style - which nails the aesthetic of the 1930s golden era of animation - continues to wow critics and players alike . ",
        "sure , it 's a tough little cookie that rewards the bold and mercilessly punishes those that make the slightest mistake , but every level and each boss offers such a font of unique personality that you 'll instantly jump back in for another run . mental health and suicide have always proved difficult subjects to cover , especially in a medium like videogames where interaction and involvement are key , but somehow what remains of edith finch tackles both with an unrivalled grace and poignancy . from the same studio that produced the unfinished swan , wroef follows the story of a family whose members have all died an untimely death . ",
        "while it falls into the ` walking simulator ' subgenre , it 's a game of many facets that 's absolutely worth experiencing blind . it 'll surprise you , make you shed a tear and almost certainly remain with you long after its story comes to a close . the creative assembly had quite the challenge on its hand when it set about following up 2016 's total war : warhammer and yet a year later the british studio did just that - and then some . okay , it 's still not called total warhammer , but it innovates and improves on practically every element from the first game . ",
        "it 's real-time strategy is much improved with four distinct armies to choose from , a genuinely engrossing story and a streamlined approach to battle management that made its turn-based and real-time dna sing mid-skirmish . with plenty more updates and expansions to come , rts games do n't come much better . yes , the reanimated corpse that is resident evil 7 really did shuffle into our lives and onto our pcs in 2017 - but only just , with its release date back in january . and what a return it 's been . wisely acknowledging the renaissance for horror games and pioneering work of amnesia , outlast and the like , capcom took its premier series first-person and created one of the most terrifying games in years . ",
        "with legendary jump scares , pt-esque freakout moments and the usual creature features you 'd expect from a resi game it all coalesces to create an interactive horror that drips with menace both in vr and on traditional screens . much like predecessor , divinity : original sin ii does something very special . it harks back to the days when isometric rpgs such as baldur 's gate infused the genre with both personality and deep mechanics , while taking the genre forward and cementing itself as one of the new cornerstones in pc gaming . while the ability to build a party of full-playable companions is hardly anything new , it 's the charisma of the world you 're exploring and ability to unlock new story threads and quests at any moment , weaving your very own fantastical tale that grows in depth without becoming convoluted . ",
        "it looks incredible , has a standout soundtrack and offers all the hallmarks of truly great rpg . long gestating as prey 2 , the game that eventually reemerged had very little in common with the original prey from 2006 . instead , its ` alien catastrophe aboard a space station ' storyline headed in a direction more akin to the open-ended , choice-driven creativity of the bioshock series . part system shock , part dead space , prey may look like a first-person shooter but it holds far more depth than simply firing off some guns . myriad powers can turn your character into a hybrid god , but each one comes at a cost that will make the game that bit more difficult . ",
        "there are secrets to uncover , puzzles to solve and a wave of monstrous aliens trying to kill you . no one quite expected the wolfstein : the new order to be the brutal , bombastic hit it turned out to be , but that placed a tidal of wave of expectation on its inevitable sequel . that second outing , wolfenstein ii : the new colossus , does something remarkable - it manages to not only better its predecessor in both level design and the agency of its violence , but how it builds a story with moments that will shock and surprise you with equal measure . ",
        "its gunplay mechanics might not be perfect , and its difficulty curve might still be steeper than a cliff face , but the new colossus offers a new landmark in single-player driven shooters . there 's nothing quite like nier : automata , which is quite the feat considering it 's a spin-off from a spin-off and a product of hyperactive japanese studio , platinumgames . on the surface it looks like a generic action-rpg with a big emphasis on combat , but beneath there 's so much more . the combat model has the depth and nuance of the early devil may cry games , its story fits perfectly with the bizarre plot threads of the original nier , and its score is deliciously easy on the ears it 's almost a crime . ",
        "it 's a game as strange and charismatic as its director , and there 's no denying yoko taro has produced another classic that walks to the beat of its own drum .   "
