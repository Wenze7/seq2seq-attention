        "we 've had a slew of third-party , sony-approved ps4 controllers over the years , including the pint-sized mini wired gamepad and the pro-focused razer raiju . while welcome , they 've all been missing a crucial feature -- wireless connectivity . that changes this week with the onyx controller from japanese accessory maker hori . unlike sony 's pad , it sports asymmetrical sticks -- like the xbox one controller -- a rounder shape and longer , curved bumpers . the share and options buttons are also below the touch pad , making them easier to reach than on the dualshock 4 . ",
        "it 's not all sunshine and rainbows , however -- as the verge notes , there does n't seem to be a speaker or light bar on the back . the latter is mitigated by a small led bar on the front , sandwiched between the d-pad and right analog stick . personally , i 've always hated the light bar and would happily trade it for some extra battery life . the controller is available now in europe , though without an official price tag ; amazon is stocking it for £ 44.99 / € 69.99 , which is roughly the same as sony 's controller . ",
        "hopefully it will come to the us too .   "
