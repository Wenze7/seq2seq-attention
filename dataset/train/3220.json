        "what to make of the tax cuts and jobs act , the legislation passed by the senate at 1:36 a. m. saturday , by a 51 to 49 vote , with only republicans in favor ? any final assessment has to await a conference with the u. s. house of representatives that will attempt to bridge differences between the senate bill and the one already passed by the house . for now , though , the legislation is a mixture of really encouraging developments and really disappointing ones . encouraging is the reduction of the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent . ",
        "politicians from both parties have long acknowledged that the u. s. corporate rate is so high that it hurts american competitiveness . president obama in 2012 proposed reducing the rate to 28 percent , and eventually talked about a 25 percent rate for some manufacturers . a 20 percent rate , or even 22 percent , would be an improvement . it would still leave america 's corporate tax rate higher than places like ireland , where the rate is 12.5 percent . but it 'd be a big step in the right direction , toward solving what even mr. obama acknowledged was a problem . ",
        "the senate waits until 2019 to deliver the 20 percent corporate rate , while the house bill puts it into effect in 2018 . also encouraging is the prospect -- somewhat shocking , is n't it ? -- of politicians actually following through on a campaign promise . the potency of tax cuts as a political issue has been eroded over time by politicians who pledge them but fail to deliver . the republicans have n't managed to achieve their long-promised repeal of obamacare . successfully getting a tax cut passed into law after being elected in part to bring one about is almost enough to warm a voter 's heart , or to restore a person 's faith in government 's ability to act on the signals sent by elections . ",
        "it 's an antidote to cynicism . unfortunately , by that same standard , aside from the rate cuts , the content of the bill itself and the process behind it so far are pretty disappointing . the middle of the night , weekend , party-line vote is the sort of thing that republicans complain about , with some merit , when democrats control congress . a full text of the 479-page bill was provided to senators only hours before the voting began , and it was full of hand-written cross-outs and marginal emendations . the senate bill does n't meaningfully simplify the tax code . ",
        "a lot of americans will need not just a journalist or a politician but an accountant or a tax lawyer to explain to them how it will affect them . there 's an element of the whole thing that reminds me of the home renovation horror story about the guy who starts out replacing a doormat and winds up having to redo the entire kitchen -- what project managers call `` scope creep . '' the republicans set out to lower the corporate tax rate . once they did that , then rates for businesses organized in other ways looked low , so they had to lower those , too . ",
        "and once that was done , budget rules meant they had to `` recover '' the `` lost revenue '' somehow , with a variety of minor adjustments , even tax increases . together , those add up to lots of work for lobbyists and accountants . they can be revisited in coming years as a way to milk campaign contributions out of the interested parties . particularly dangerous is the practice of a political party using the tax code to reward its backers and punish its enemies . republicans , who now control the white house and both parties of congress , may find it humorous or convenient to raise revenue by increasing taxes on a handful of well endowed universities with overwhelmingly liberal faculties , and on the mostly democratic-leaning cities and states with high state and local income taxes . ",
        "but there will come a time when the tables are turned , and democrats will then be tempted to alter the tax code in a way that punishes republicans . the gop would be on higher ground if it stood on principle for a tax code that treats everyone the same . avoiding this sort of petty political vindictiveness is one of many reasons why a lot of people would prefer keeping their money in their own pockets in the first place , rather than sending it to washington to be doled out by politicians to favorites in the form of either spending or narrowly targeted and easily reversible tax breaks . ",
        "in the end , the best news of all about a tax cut may be that it leaves the politicians and lobbyists in the washington , d. c. swamp even less of our money to mess around with .   "
