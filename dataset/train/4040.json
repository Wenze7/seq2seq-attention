        "i might be losing my mind -- i have n't seen the sun in ... i do n't know how long . if it was n't for the brief twilight during the days i 'd assume that the only natural light that still exists in the world is from the moon and stars . in western astrology my sign is cancer -- the crab . apparently the moon rules us and makes us emo . 99.9 % of the time i do n't believe that though . the longer i spend under moonlight though , the more i feel my brain 's control fading and my heart getting stronger . ",
        "it 's weird -- i wonder if this is what most people feel like most days . my heart usually sits at the bottom of a deep ocean , a slow but terrifying beast that only those who bother to dive deep into my life will ever meet . yet -- in the past few days i 've felt the beast move to the shallows . yesterday i blamed it on feeling sick , but i 'm almost 100 % today . so no , i 'll blame the moon . that 's definitely it . i found myself really moved by the movie lion recently , i 'm sure if my tear ducts worked i 'd have literally shed a tear . ",
        "i told myself that it was because i have a strong desire to adopt children . i want to reduce the suffering in the world in any small way i can -- my ethics lecturer would be proud . if it was n't for the moon 's effect on me i 'd never admit that publicly . again yesterday , i found myself having a conversation with one of my nieces -- she started high school yesterday . she told me that she was fine but i could hear in her voice that she was nervous about it . she 's been in boarding school before but i think she 's worried about being one of the little kids again . ",
        "i wished i could 've been with her , taken her to her hostel and made sure she settled in perfectly . but her father was with her so i 'm sure she was fine . the moon is a strong thing , i felt a paternal instinct over a child that is n't even mine . i felt that i needed to talk about it to someone -- my bestie was n't available so i decided to chat with two other friends . one deals with his niblings all the time and often complains while another spent the whole weekend sending me videos of her niece singing . ",
        "i imagined that these two people -- out everyone i could talk to -- would understand this , `` emotions stuff . '' evidently i was wrong . the guy asked me why i do n't have children of my own if i 'm feeling sentimental about my niece . the other friend only replied an hour ago telling me about some really personal medical issue and then she wrote : thanks for listeningi just had to tell someonei love that i can tell you anything . how crazy is that ? over a day later and she did n't even acknowledge the message about my niece . ",
        "no wonder these people are going to get cut from the team . it 's funny -- they 'll complain to me that it happened so suddenly . stupid . i feel stupid -- not for expecting people to talk to me about weird sentimental stuff , but for the fact that i actually care about the echo . i feel annoyed by the ignoring of my message . i was talking about my niece , it 's important dammit -- listen . or do n't -- get fired , whatever . stupid chest pump ! see what i 'm talking about ? ",
        "i need the sun ... soon ! who knows what will happen if i continue feeling strong emotions ? i 'll probably start start writing poetry or telling the world about my deepest fears . maybe i should watch something mindless and action filled , perhaps that will balance me out . yeah , that should do it ...
