        "bangladesh interim coach richard halsall reckons mustafizur rahman is on his way to rekindling the early form with the ball that made him a sensation , and revealed that getting back to full fitness was the pacer 's priority . the young fast bowler had suffered a shoulder injury in england in 2016 , and had to undergo an operation , after which he could n't put up the sort of performances that the fans had quickly gotten used to . mustafizur did n't pick up a fifer against zimbabwe in the tri-series opener on monday , but his spell of 10-1-29-2 was a demonstration of his reprise . ",
        "the wily bowler used cutters and change of pace to good effect , picking the key wicket of brendon taylor , and then wrapping up the zimbabwean essay with the scalp of blessing muzarabani . the performance comes at a good time as the left-armer looks to silence his critics , who were growing in number due to his recent downturn in his form . since the shoulder operation , mustafizur has bowled well in bits-and-pieces - a spell or two against sri lanka in bangladesh 's historic test win , and against ireland during the tri-series in new zealand . ",
        "mustafizur also needed to regain his confidence after having sustained an ankle injury last october in the series in south africa , which ruled him out of the odi and t20i series . `` if you look at elite baseball , lots of their pitchers have a similar injury . pitchers throw at 90 mph , but it takes them two years to throw at 90mph , '' halsall told reporters in mirpur on tuesday when he was asked about how he views the comeback match of the young pace bowler . `` i think it has been 18 months since his injury . ",
        "he bowled the cutters and his pace is creeping back up to 85mph , '' halsall said . `` his cutter is brilliant as ever . his top-end is going up a mile an hour every week . it makes the cutter more effective . his confidence is coming back , ' he said . `` what is great to see is how hard he is working . he is constantly working on his skills . to see someone who is in love with his skill and passion , it is fantastic for everyone to see , '' he said . ",
        "`` we are used to seeing tamim and mushfiqur in the nets , but to see a bowler behaving as he does in every training session , is very encouraging , '' he added . according to shakib al hasan , mustafizur 's performance against zimbabwe was important , but he also stated that he never though mustafizur ` bowled poorly at any stage ' . `` i never thought he bowled too poorly at any stage , '' shakib said after bangladesh 's victory over zimbabwe . `` we ca n't expect him to take a lot of wickets all the time . ",
        "i think he is improving , because he is working hard in his bowling . i am satisfied with his bowling today , '' he added . regaining confidence has been key for mustafizur , but as has a technical change to his bowling - of running in and delivering from close to the stumps - that also played a part in his return to good form . shakib , and mustafizur himself , will hope that it continues when bangladesh take on sri lanka in their next fixture of the tri-series - against sri lanka on january 19 .
