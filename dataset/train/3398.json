        "washington -- president donald trump says a bipartisan immigration proposal is `` a big step backwards . '' he tweets that it would force the u. s. `` to take large numbers of people from high crime countries which are doing badly . '' trump seems to be defending himself against the furor over his vulgar words to describe african countries . trump questioned at a white house meeting thursday why the u. s. would accept more immigrants from haiti and africa than from places like norway . trump says the `` so-called bipartisan '' deal `` was a big step backwards '' because it does n't fund a wall along the mexican border . ",
        "he adds : `` i want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level . i want safety and security for our people . i want to stop the massive inflow of drugs .
