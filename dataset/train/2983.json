        "ronda rousey 's ultimate fighting championship career effectively ended last year , when she was beaten by amanda nunes inside 48 seconds . now it is approaching its formal conclusion , with rousey moving closer to throwing herself into a new adventure with world wrestling entertainment . two people close to rousey told usa today sports that she is finalizing details of her move to wwe . the people requested anonymity because the switch has not been announced . however , the evidence of rousey 's career change has been mounting for a while . rousey was at a wwe show in september and watched her close friend shayna baszler , a former mixed martial artist now making waves with the wwe . ",
        "during the event , rousey was caught in a stare down with leading women 's wrestler charlotte flair , in which rousey issued a challenge : `` you name the time , you name the place . '' that led to speculation that an official appearance is imminent , perhaps at wrestlemania 34 in new orleans on april 8 . the wwe did not immediately respond when contacted by usa today sports on wednesday . more : dana white does n't want a rousey ufc comeback . more : rousey posts gorgeous photos from wedding . `` i love ronda , and anything she can do to make money for her and her new husband then i am rooting for her , '' longtime friend and legendary wrestler , martial artist and stuntman gene le bell said . ",
        "`` she will get a lot of money and that 's great . '' le bell said rather than being a permanent member of the staff , rousey might be most effective as a spot wrestler , making occasional appearance at high-profile events . rousey has been busy of late , promoting a soon-to-be-released and self-titled website . she has also spent time working out at the wwe 's high performance center in orlando , fla. . the person with the greatest business interest in seeing rousey return to fighting essentially ruled it out recently . ufc president dana white counts rousey as a personal friend , and said he believes there is little she can gain from taking to the octagon again . ",
        "`` i would n't want to see it , '' white said last week . `` i would n't want it to happen . i care about her . she has got money ... and all that stuff . i do n't want to see it happen . '' such certainty makes this an opportunistic time to evaluate what rousey brought to mixed martial arts during her frenetic and remarkable reign . ahead of her defeat to holly holm in australia in 2015 and coming off six straight ufc victories , she was one of the hottest commodities in sports , in high demand for photo shoots , endorsements and movies . ",
        "looking back she may reflect that those extra-curricular activities caught up with her , but so too did the rest of the women 's field . once the ufc added women 's fighting the whole thing became more professional . by the time rousey lost to nunes she was coming up against an athlete who devoted her entire existence to excelling at mma , and it showed . `` ronda changed the game for all of us , '' recently deposed women 's strawweight champion joanna jedrzejczyk said . `` she showed us what was possible for women and she showed what sort of level you have to be at to fight against the best and to be the best . '' ",
        "the level of intrigue with rousey has actually increased since she started losing . she shunned public interviews since losing to holm with the exception of a couple of ellen segments . no one truly knew what she was feeling in the build-up to nunes , or since , as she blanked the kind of media commitments that are demanded of all other fighters . a recently released biographical film about her , through my father 's eyes , won first place at britain 's crystal palace international film festival , but largely focused on the earlier years of her career . ",
        "when rousey came into the ufc she was a trailblazer . named five years ago wednesday as the company 's first women 's champion even before her first fight , she is credited with being singlehandedly responsible for persuading white to introduce women into the company 's roster . assuming there is no return in her future , she departs while still one of the ufc 's biggest stars , perhaps without saying anything at all and for a new adventure where she might make even more money . which means she leaves just as she arrived -- uniquely .
