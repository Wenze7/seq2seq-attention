        "hundreds of years ago , double-hulled canoes traversed the seas of modern-day polynesia , crewed by voyagers able to navigate through open ocean without instruments using the stars , the sun , ocean currents , and other natural elements . these travelers , as part of the polynesian migration , helped colonize the pacific -- including the islands of hawai`i . these canoes disappeared more than 600 years ago . and then , in 1976 , a deep sea voyaging canoe built in the tradition of these ancient vessels sailed from hawai`i to tahiti . the canoe was named h ? ",
        "k ? le`a , `` star of gladness , '' and it inspired a whole new generation of modern wayfinders and voyagers . `` for all of us , for a lot of hawaiian people , for me , it was like watching the moon landing all over again , '' says david komine , an o`ahu native who served as a crew member on the 2014 m ? lama honua worldwide voyage , in which h ? k ? le`a embarked on a round-the-world sailing trip that took more than three years and included more than 150 ports of call in 23 countries and territories . ",
        "`` to see a voyaging canoe from hawai`i sail the traditional way back to tahiti , which was n't done for almost 600 years prior , was the flame that lit the hawaiian renaissance . the pride of hawaiian culture just exploded , not only here in hawai`i but throughout the south pacific , as well . '' the journey instilled in komine the desire to join the polynesian voyaging society , an organization founded on the legacy of pacific ocean exploration that promotes the art and science of traditional polynesian voyaging through educational programs . the polynesian voyaging society 's founders built h ? ",
        "k ? le`a , and the organization coordinated the worldwide voyage . between its first tahiti voyage in 1976 and its worldwide voyage , h ? k ? le`a was crewed by a select group of people , komine says . he was willing to wait , though : `` i 've always said , when the opportunity came , that i would get involved , '' he says . his father was a rodeo cowboy , and the younger komine followed in his footsteps , practicing all through school and eventually competing in collegiate rodeo at a school in west texas . ",
        "after getting injured during practice , a recuperating komine recalled the land and water activities -- little league , surfing , football -- his classmates had taken part in and that he had bypassed in favor of practicing his roping and riding skills and caring for the horses . `` i just thought , ` i 've got to try something different , ' '' komine says . `` the attraction of that grabbed me . '' over a two-year period , komine -- 22 when he stopped practicing -- slowly traded equestrian sports for watersports like paddling and surfing . ",
        "`` that 's when i made the transition from the rodeo to sailing and paddling in hawaiian culture , '' he says . komine returned to hawai`i and joined the hospitality industry on o`ahu , where he began working with the island 's sheraton hotels . he has been working with their hotels in hawai`i for about 33 years combined , at three different properties , and today works at the sheraton princess kaiulani in waikiki . watch : a perfect weekend in o'ahu , hawai'i all that time , komine waited patiently , and in 2008 his opportunity came . ",
        "that year , president of the polynesian voyaging society nainoa thompson , with the help of his colleagues , made the long-debated decision to plan and execute the m ? lama honua worldwide voyage . in late 2008 , a friend of komine 's who had gotten involved with the voyaging society in the late 80s and early 90s reached out : the society was recruiting new crew members to help sail h ? k ? le`a around the world . they both thought it was kind of crazy , komine admits . but in the same breath his friend said , `` you know , the one thing i learned while sailing with the polynesian voyaging society was not to bet against nainoa . '' ",
        "`` and when he said that , i said , ` sign me up , ' '' komine says . `` ` i 'm in . ' '' komine , along with the voyaging society 's other new recruits , began training in 2009 . komine moved from classroom training to sailing the double-hulled canoe , eventually participating in overnight and days-long sails . in 2012 , he was chosen to go to new zealand with a group of crew members to help bless , launch , and do sea trials on hikianalia , the sister canoe to h ? ",
        "k ? le`a . he helped sail hikianalia from new zealand to tahiti on her maiden voyage , his first actual voyage . and then , in 2014 , the worldwide voyage began . the voyage was broken into 31 legs of four to five weeks on average , he says , with about 280 crew members cycling through the various legs . during each leg , two ships each carried 12 to 16 crew members , each holding multiple responsibilities . these included tasks such as captain , watch captain , medical officer , carpenter , and more . ",
        "komine sailed on leg 1 , from hawai`i to tahiti ; leg 13 , from darwin , australia , to bali , indonesia ; leg 17 , from natal , brazil , to st. john , u. s. virgin islands ; and leg 31 , the final leg , from tahiti back to home port in hawai`i . `` i was blessed to sail on really good legs under good conditions , '' komine says of the journey . throughout , at the various ports of call , he and his fellow crew members served as ambassadors , meeting with scientists , world leaders , and local communities , helping to spread the message of m ? ",
        "lama honua : `` to care for our earth . '' `` it 's strenuous work , it 's time-consuming , it takes you away from your family , your job , your responsibilities , '' komine says . `` once you 're on the crew , once you 're on the canoe , everything else is pretty much put aside . there 's nothing you can do about your personal life at home . you 're just focused on sailing your vessel . '' taking so much time away from his responsibilities at home was n't easy , but komine had some help . ",
        "`` the sheraton hotels were a major sponsor in the worldwide voyage , '' he says . `` they made a huge contribution to the worldwide voyage . mr. frederick orr knew the importance of the worldwide voyage . he knew it was in the best interest that i participate and be a part of this . it was all possible because of his support and understanding of the worldwide voyage and the importance of it all -- the hotel and mr. orr were very accommodating to me . '' and participating was well worth the time away . `` it is one of the greatest achievements there probably will be of my lifetime , '' komine says . ",
        "he was one of the crew members sailing into home port at o`ahu 's magic island , where a grand celebration awaited the canoes ' homecoming . `` we knew there were going to be a lot of people , but we could n't imagine how big it was once we got there , '' komine says . `` we were able to go full circle . we started in hawai`i and we finished in hawai`i . we took the long route , we sailed around the world , and the pride ... you could see the pride in everybody 's eyes . ",
        "they were so proud to say , ` that canoe 's from hawai`i . that represented my culture . ' '' and the worldwide voyage 's message goes far beyond celebrating hawaiian culture and preserving the legacy of polynesian wayfinding : it also shares a message of ocean conservation , and loving and protecting the planet and its seas . `` the voyaging society -- it 'll always be the preservation of hawaiian culture and the art of wayfinding , '' komine says . `` but it 's gone beyond that now . it is now an environmental mission , as well , to help make people aware of our pressures on our oceans and our environment . '' ",
        "related : the worldwide voyage has ended , but the journey continues , as h ? k ? le`a travels throughout the hawaiian islands . back in o`ahu , komine and his fellow crew members speak at schools and in communities , educating young hawaiians on the crisis the planet faces and encouraging them to take steps -- now and in the future -- to protect it . `` we remind them that they are going to be the leaders , '' he says . `` that they 're the ones who are going to make the difference . they kind of sit up a little bit when you tell them that .
