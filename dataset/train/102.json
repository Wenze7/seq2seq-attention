        "cinnamon is a popular spice at christmas time , used to flavour everything from mulled wine to pumpkin pie . and , unlike many christmas foods , this one might actually be good for you . cinnamon , the bark of a small evergreen tree , has been used as a medicine for centuries , if not millennia . it is widely used in traditional chinese medicine for treating , among other things , acute traumatic pain and `` weak digestion '' . in ayurvedic medicine it is used to treat arthritis , diarrhoea and menstrual irregularities . in western medicine , it has been known for decades that cinnamon contains biologically active substances that act in a similar manner to insulin . ",
        "as a result , it has been proposed that the spice might be beneficial for diabetics . however , a systematic review of the evidence , published in diabetes care in 2008 , did n't support using cinnamon for glucose control in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes . effect on blood cholesterolrecent studies , though , suggest that cinnamon might be useful in lowering blood cholesterol levels . raised cholesterol is a huge public health problem as it increases the risks of heart disease and stroke . the world health organisation estimates that 2.6 m deaths - 4.5 % of all deaths , worldwide - are related to high cholesterol . ",
        "a recent review of 13 randomised controlled trials investigated whether there was a link between cinnamon supplementation and blood lipid concentrations . there were 750 participants in total - most of them were diabetic . they each took one to six grams of cinnamon powder daily , up to four months . the authors of the review found that cinnamon supplementation significantly reduced blood triglycerides and total cholesterol levels , but it had no effect on levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels , separately . however , when one of the studies was removed in a `` sensitivity analysis '' , cinnamon supplementation was found to be significantly associated with an elevation in hdl cholesterol , so-called good cholesterol . ",
        "another recent study compared supplementation with cinnamon versus a placebo on 116 asian indians with metabolic syndrome . the researchers found that those in the experimental group had significant reductions in total cholesterol , ldl cholesterol and triglycerides , compared with the control group . the experimental group also showed a significant increase in hdl cholesterol . so , in summary , the best available evidence shows that cinnamon may be able to reduce blood lipids in people with diabetes or metabolic syndrome . unfortunately , there is n't enough data to demonstrate benefits in non-diabetic people , specifically those with high cholesterol . ",
        "but is it safe ? cinnamon is considered safe for most people , when used in small amounts . however , the spice contains a compound , called coumarin , that can cause or worsen liver disease . of the two common types of cinnamon : cassia cinnamon and so-called true cinnamon , true cinnamon has much lower levels of coumarin compared with cassia cinnamon . the european food safety authority 's recommended tolerable daily intake of coumarinis 0.1 mg per kilogram of body weight . however , no long-term experimental studies have established the safety of cinnamon supplementation , nor of taking cinnamon with statins . ",
        "if you want to lower your total or ldl cholesterol levels , there are known effective , safe ways of doing so . these include losing weight , being physically active and eating a balanced , varied diet that is low in saturated and trans fats .   "
