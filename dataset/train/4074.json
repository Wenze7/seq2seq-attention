        "bittersweet melodies and feelings , all pinned together by a skewer of flowing guitar sound , intertwined male and female vocals , anointed by a holding piano sound and warm bass tones , aligned on ocd-like overthought drum beats . this is useless cities , a london base indie band . i talked to the band to get a little insight into what they 're up to . i 'd like to ask firstly what useless cities is all about ? how would you describe your sound , and where do you draw your inspiration from ? our sound is usually described as indie shoegaze . ",
        "we like to think of it as creating bittersweet melodies and evoking nostalgia in the listener . the sound is made up of male and female lead vocalists , delayed guitar , keyboard , bass and drums . i could sum it up in 3 words : lots of reverb . our inspiration comes from each of our different influences and each other . tom probably has the most refined shoegazey musical taste , and sebs our drummer is always thinking carefully about different new drum parts . conny adds the piano sounds and clare fills out the low end . ",
        "we recently discovered the importance of telecaster to our sound after a brief switch to a strat and have been experimenting with synth sounds . bands like the cranberries , the national , interpol and slowdive make up some of our influences and tend to be picked out by our listeners . what 's the story behind how it all began for you guys ? like most modern relationships , ours began on the internet . tom placed an ad , conny replied and then eventually clare and sebs joined in . we began rehearsing in a disused then refurbished public toilet in camden and we continue there to this day . ",
        "it is very cosy . within 8 weeks of forming we had played our first gig , and following some great shows at the monarch and the black heart we went to record our first ep . we have since released 2 eps and 1 single , with 2 more singles ready for release in the first half of 2018 . what has been the best experience so far in your music career ? that is a tough one as we 've had so many great experiences and fun gigs over the last couple of years . we really enjoyed our last recording session as we recorded with paul tipler who is great producer and has worked with a lot of our favourite bands , including some work with slowdive . ",
        "the response to our last single `` eyesore '' has been great and we 've had some international press coverage . we played oxjam east london and oxjam islington over the last couple of years and it is always one of our favourite gigs each year . what advice would you give to someone who is looking to kickstart their dream career with their band ? keep writing the music you love and believe in what you are doing . find the right people to work with and be nice ! where are you playing next ? we 'll be playing at the finsbury , london this 22nd january , 2018 . ",
        "where can people find your music ? it is all over the internet . check out our spotify , soundcloud , bandcamp . find us on www . uselesscities . co. uk , and of course facebook , twitter , instagram . thanks so much for joining me . by oscar sim√≤n chu ortega / gigride co-founder , part-time blogger , passionate about live music .
