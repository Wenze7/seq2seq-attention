        "american-jews quiestion the recent change in israeli policy regarding africans seeking to build a life in the jewish state . washington -- yikealo beyene 's story is -- up to a point -- perfect feel-good fodder for a saturday morning talk at synagogue . as a refugee from eritrea , he read anne frank 's diary in his native tongue and translated it , teaching the tale to kids in an ethiopian refugee camp . he sought out israel for the refuge it promised and ca n't stop talking about the kindnesses that israelis afforded him once he arrived . ",
        "he lived in israel for eight years , earning bachelor 's and master 's degrees , and is now living in seattle , a leader of his community . but beyene 's story , which he related in a speech on shabbat morning at ohev shalom , an orthodox synagogue here known for its politically involved congregation , hit a bump toward the end . that 's when he brought up his mission , backed by the new york-based philanthropist joey low , to stop prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's government from deporting or jailing tens of thousands of refugees from africa . ",
        "`` i now consider israel as my second home and i feel dutiful to defend it , '' he said . `` now if i stop my speech here , i would be a bit dishonest . '' some 60,000 african migrants entered israel prior to the construction of a barrier on its southern border with the sinai in 2012 . israel , which considers them economic migrants , not refugees from persecution , until now has encouraged the africans to leave by handing them cash -- generally about $ 3,500 -- and a plane ticket . about 20,000 have taken the offer , leaving nearly 40,000 in israel , most living freely . ",
        "this month , netanyahu said those who do not take the deportation offer face jail . rwanda and uganda reportedly are the likeliest destinations for deportees , though both governments deny it . in recent years the refugees have made their way to israel from various countries , including sudan , eritrea and somalia . `` as much as i love israel , i do not want to conceal how deeply concerned i am about the recent move by the government to expel african refugees and asylum seekers in israel to rwanda , '' said beyene , 33 . low , an investor who has donated millions of dollars to israeli causes over the years , says convincing american jews to pressure israel on the issue is a long shot -- but he is determined to try . ",
        "`` my heart is in israel , '' said low , who spends several months a year in the country and has invested in startups there . it 's especially painful , he says , considering that the philanthropy he founded has given millions of dollars to israel at heart , an ngo that sends young israelis around the world to improve the country 's image . `` you ca n't do something like this in the name of jews and israel , '' low said of the deportations . his parents were holocaust-era refugees , from germany and austria , and they loom large in his advocacy . ",
        "low , 66 , is also a founder of the interdisciplinary center , a research college in herzliya . american jewish protests against the planned deportation have been relatively muted and confined to jewish groups that are less reluctant to criticize the israeli government on policy issues . a recent exchange with israel 's foreign ministry on the matter was signed by hias , the lead jewish immigration advocacy group , leaders of the reform movement , the national council of jewish women and j street , the liberal middle east policy group , among other groups . even these groups , fighting what they see as threats to immigrants and minorities in the era of president donald trump , lack the bandwidth to make this a priority issue . ",
        "`` the american jewish community can be moved on these issues , '' said libby lenkinski , the vice president for public engagement for the new israel fund , which funds groups that assist the african refugees in israel . `` but between that and making it a cause celebre ? there 's some distance . '' `` we 're obviously fighting on a lot of fronts right now for fairness and justice for refugees , '' said melanie nezer , the vice president for public affairs at hias . `` it would be nice to have one problem -- we do n't . '' ",
        "russel neiss , a st. louis-based activist , is keeping a running list online of organizations that advocated for sudanese refugees from darfur in the mid-2000s -- when it was a signature jewish advocacy issue in america -- but which are silent now that israel may expel africans faced with similar dangers . it 's called `` never again is a lie . '' `` this is not something that should be particularly difficult in terms of standing up for what 's right ; it 's never historically been a right or left issue , '' he said . `` a dozen years ago you had the jewish community engaging in activities for many of the refugees who are in israel right now . ",
        "we have n't lived up to our own promises . '' jta contacted three of the establishment groups neiss has in his `` no comment '' column . one , the anti-defamation league , replied . ceo jonathan greenblatt said the group was `` greatly troubled '' by netanyahu 's plan . `` we urge the israeli government to refrain from implementing this plan , and instead focus on finding a more appropriate and humane solution to this issue , '' he said . the american jewish committee and the conference of presidents of major american jewish organizations did not reply ; nor did the israeli embassy . ",
        "low wants the jewish establishment involved and has been on a one-man crusade to make it listen , bringing in activists from israel and former refugees like beyene to meet with major players . he went so far as to threaten to suspend his annual $ 100,000 donation to uja-federation of new york unless it took a meeting . low said he knows he needs a breakthrough . `` if sheldon adelson called netanyahu up and said this is damaging to israel , would stop it , '' low said , referring to the las vegas casino magnate who is hugely influential in israeli politics . ",
        "low has made the calls seeking the conversation with adelson -- with no luck . the reaction at ohev shalom , a congregation packed with denizens of washington 's policy and academic communities , reflected the skepticism that the refugee advocates would face among conventional pro-israel jews . some congregants peppered beyene with questions , while others expressed real sympathy . rabbi shmuel herzfeld , who invited beyene to speak , acknowledged the reluctance but said israel had to answer for its actions . `` it 's not like the israeli-palestinian issue , however complicated that is '' and where `` there are two sides '' responsible , he said . ",
        "`` this is how to make sure asylum seekers are safe . '' netanyahu has cast the problem as a security threat , and centrist and right-wing pro-israel americans often hesitate to tread into issues of israeli security . `` today we are doing what we promised -- restoring quiet , the sense of personal security and law and order to the residents of south tel aviv and also those of many other neighborhoods , '' netanyahu said at a jan. . 3 cabinet meeting to discuss the deportation of 40,000 `` illegal infiltrators , '' as he described the refugees . ",
        "refugee advocates have decried the use of the word infiltrator , once reserved for terrorists , as racist . an israeli official who corresponded with the liberal us critics of the plan was more restrained , saying in a letter that `` the overwhelming majority of the illegal migrants who have arrived in israel over the past decade are neither refugees nor asylum seekers , but rather economic migrants who have come to israel in search of work . '' advocates for the africans say that the government vastly underestimates the number of migrants who would qualify under international law as refugees , noting that in other countries where africans have found temporary refugee , 56 percent of sudanese and 84 percent of eritrean applicants have been given asylum . ",
        "in israel , it 's less than 1 percent . they also note that the countries from which the africans arrive are genuinely beset not just by economic woes , but by severe persecution on the basis of ethnicity and religious and political beliefs . the advocates also question the rush to deport , asking why now . a fence that a previous government headed by netanyahu erected in 2012 cut the rate of africans seeking asylum to zero , as netanyahu often notes . the perception that crime festers where the refugees settle appears to be supported more by anecdotal evidence than by statistics . ",
        "advocates say their crowding in south tel aviv , which is already beset by poverty , demonstrates a failure to distribute the refugees throughout the country . africans who have taken the government 's offer of cash and a ticket to destinations in africa report that they are often left paperless and vulnerable to robberies or worse . in 2015 , islamic militants beheaded , on video , three eritreans in libya who were seeking passage to europe ; the three had spent time in israel and had taken the cash offer . others note that netanyahu has recently boasted of the inroads he has gained on the african continent . ",
        "mass deportations or incarceration of africans would cloud the business deals and visits to africa netanyahu has made in the past two years , said yosef abramowitz , an israeli activist on behalf of the refugees who has also done business in africa in the solar energy area . `` we live in a digital , wired world and there 's no way they 're going to drag people out of homes in israel and keep those relationships , '' he said . the refugees do not seek permanent status in israel , beyene said , but the chance he was afforded : to apply for refugee status in a third country . ",
        "that process is long and leaves africans in israel for years , advocates acknowledge . abramowitz and low said independently that should netanyahu go ahead with the jailings and deportations , there were a cadre of israelis ready to take to the streets . low foresaw protesters blocking the deportees from getting on the planes . abramowitz said activists in israel were organizing sanctuary homes for the refugees . low said he might not be there to join in . `` if they start deporting these people , '' he said , `` i could not see myself going back to israel .
