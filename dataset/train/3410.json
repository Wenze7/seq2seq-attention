        "the ex-boyfriend of reality tv-star ferne mccann has been jailed for 20 years after carrying out a brutal acid attack in a packed nightclub . arthur collins , 25 , hurled the corrosive substance over a crowd on the dancefloor at mangle e8 in what judge noel lucas said was `` a despicable act '' . sixteen people suffered chemical burn injuries and three people were temporarily blinded - one of whom still suffers from blurred vision in one eye . fourteen were the subject of charges . in court judge noel lucas described it as `` a deliberate and calculated attack '' and laughed off collins ' defence claims that he had little money - pointing to the fact he had two harley street hair transplants . ",
        "he said : `` i am a bit surprised by that . i suspect it was n't paid for on the nhs , and i dare say it was n't cheap . '' he then added : `` here i am told mr collins has no brass farthings to rub together , in effect , not withstanding his lease on a mercedes jeep and two expensive hair transplants . `` if i sound as if i am sceptical of the information i have been given , it is because i am . i do n't believe a word , frankly .

",
        "judge lucas ordered that as well as his 20-year prison term collins , of broxbourne , herts , will additionally be subject to five further years on extended licence . he branded collins `` an accomplished and calculated liar '' who had shown `` not a shred of remorse '' , telling him : `` this was a despicable act . `` you knew precisely what strong acid would do to human skin . `` having thrown the acid over the club you slunk away and hid in the rear and pretended to be nothing to do with the mayhem you had caused . ",
        "`` in my judgement it was deliberate and calculated and you were intent on causing really serious harm to your victims . `` twenty-two people reported injuries to the police after the acid attack at the club in dalston , east london , on april 17 , which was packed with bank holiday revellers . about | acid attackscollins told his trial he had been out celebrating the news of ms mccann 's pregnancy , which they had announced to her family the previous day . cctv showed him and co-defendant andre phoenix , 21 , arriving at the club at about 9 pm before getting into a confrontation with a group of men about four hours later .
