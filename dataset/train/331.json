        "injuries have presented mario hezonja an opportunity . an opportunity he is taking advantage of as he tries to carve out a role for himself once again . mario hezonja had open floor in front of him during wednesday 's game against the la clippers , and he was once again the player everyone imagined when they first saw him on sometimes grainy youtube video , hitting threes and dapping up opposing coaches . it has felt that player was long gone . the orlando magic essentially signaled there is no future with hezonja , relegating him to the bench and declining his fourth-year player option . ",
        "but there hezonja was performing a smooth spin move and a crisp pass through a tiny hole to a teammate to set him up for a shot . just his luck , the shot missed . but hezonja was all that bravado and confidence that made him the fifth overall pick in the 2015 nba draft . thanks to injury , an opportunity presented itself for hezonja . he went from playing virtually no minutes to starting the last three games . with the opportunity he was receiving , hezonja 's talent would eventually show itself . especially as he got more comfortable . ",
        "in wednesday 's loss to the clippers , hezonja scored 17 points on 6-for-11 shooting . he added nine rebounds and four assists . this was hezonja the magic always envisioned . he hit 3-pointers , he drove to the basket under control . defensively he was flying to protect the rim in transition and disciplined in his coverages . things clicked in this game for hezonja . at last , he looked comfortable . `` when you get consistent minutes , you can find a bit of a rhythm , '' coach frank vogel said before friday 's loss to the portland trail blazers . ",
        "`` it 's a chicken or an egg thing . you have to earn your consistent minutes to get that rhythm . he has had a tough situation here from the standpoint of coming in and we drafted the same position as him so it 's kind of put him further behind on the depth chart . his opportunities are lighter . when your opportunities are lighter , you 're not going to play that well . '' it is indeed a chicken or an egg problem . hezonja has struggled to crack the rotation ever since vogel came in as coach . ",
        "it felt like mario hezonja had a quick hook his rookie year with scott skiles as the head coach . but that was still his most productive year . his shooting percentage dropped and it made him hard to play . after all , hezonja was drafted essentially to be a shooter . shooting 29.9 percent from beyond the arc last year and 30.6 percent from beyond the arc this year , hardly inspires confidence in a shooter . then again , hezonja is not playing , averaging just 12.3 minutes per game in 26 games this year . in games where hezonja plays more than 12 minutes in the last two seasons , hezonja is shooting 45 for 161 . ",
        "hardly encouraging . this is all part of the difficulties of finding hezonja minutes . and ultimately why the magic seem less enthused about his future with the team . still , his talent is evident . even vogel had to admit that after his game wednesday . vogel said hezonja is one of the team 's fastest and most athletic guys . he also lauded his toughness , a trait that has seemingly been in short supply for the team this year at times . the trick with hezonja , according to vogel , is to stay within himself . ",
        "he can not try to do too much . his penchant for turning the ball over trying to force off the dribble is still evident -- he averages 2.3 turnovers per 36 minutes . the key to hezonja remains knocking down shots . that is how he will define a role for himself . `` with more touches , you get more confidence , '' hezonja said . `` it 's not a confidence thing . it 's how to be in a system and still doing your stuff . i was practicing as double as everyone was doing . ",
        "if i do that on the court , it will look like i 'm trying to show off , and we 're not going to win . you have to find your own rhythm while still in the system . if i go out individually , i 'm going to look good but we 're going to lose . everyone has to have that mindset . if we go on our own , we might win almost nothing . `` indeed , confidence seems to be brimming for hezonja . more than it has in some time . that is the result of getting minutes . ",
        "he is still young and could still salvage his career . opportunity though is what he needs . that is how he builds the confidence to play at a higher level . but he still needs to produce . he followed his strong game wednesday with a more mediocre one friday . hezonja scored just four points , missing both of his shots . his defense was still solid , but vogel opted to go in another direction at the end of the game . vogel said hezonja plays hard and that is all anyone can ask for . right now , hezonja has that part down . ",
        "now it is about production for him and how much of a role he can carve . hezonja admits he still needs to build up trust . he knows he can not freelance or go off script too much . and making shots is necessary for him . his defense has come a long way but still requires his full attention at times . but as long as the magic continue to face all their injuries , the opportunity is here for hezonja to build that trust back up . `` he 's playing with almost all backups right now , '' hezonja said . ",
        "`` there are trust issues , of course . that 's normal . but i think he 's doing better . we 've got to pick it up . we 've talked about that . we talked about him , we talked about us , we 've all got to pick it up . it 's not a one player thing . everyone has to pick it up and play more . `` the most important thing to hezonja remains contributing to a winning team . he knows his own production does not matter if it comes in a loss . ",
        "and him trying to over-assert himself will only lead to the bad outcomes he wants to avoid . the goal for hezonja right now is to carve out a role and show he has some nba value . his role now is to make shots and be active defensively . in the short term , that might keep him in the rotation a little bit longer -- a chance he has certainly earned of late . in the long term , that might intrigue another team to give him a greater chance than orlando can give . more from orlando magic daily orlando magic answer frank vogel 's call , but still need more5h ago orlando magic grades : portland trail blazers 95 , orlando magic 8815h ago magic wands : orlando magic vs. portland trail blazers -- dec. .
