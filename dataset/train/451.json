        "just days after the house passed its version of the federal tax law slashing corporate tax rates , house speaker paul ryan collected nearly $ 500,000 in campaign contributions from billionaire energy mogul charles koch and his wife , according to a recent campaign donor report . koch and his brother david spent millions of dollars to get the tax law passed and are spending millions more in a public relations campaign in an attempt to boost support for the law , the wall street journal reported . koch industries , one of the largest private corporations in the nation , operates refineries and manufactures a variety of products . ",
        "the new tax law -- which slices corporate tax rates from 35 percent to 21 percent , slashes estate taxes and includes a special deduction for oil and gas investors -- is expected to save the koch brothers and their businesses billions of dollars in taxes . just 13 days after the tax law was passed , charles koch and his wife , elizabeth , donated nearly $ 500,000 to ryan 's joint fundraising committee , according to a campaign finance report filed thursday . five other donors , including billionaire businessmen jeffery hildebrand and william parfet , each contributed $ 100,000 in the last quarter of 2017 , according to the records .
