        "hanoi - a vietnamese court on friday rejected the appeal of a dissident sentenced to nine years for anti-state propaganda , capping a grim year for activists in the one-party state . vietnam 's communist government has been accused of intensifying a crackdown on its critics in 2017 , jailing at least 15 activists and handing down heavy jail terms . the latest to be punished is anti-china activist tran thi nga , 40 , who was handed nine years in prison plus five years of probation in july for posting material online criticising the government . her appeal was rejected friday after a trial in northern ha nam province . ",
        "`` the verdict is biased and not objective , '' nga 's lawer ha huy son told afp after the hearing . several of nga 's supporters gathered outside the courthouse were ferried away by security forces earlier friday , according to activists ' posts on facebook . nga , who was arrested in january , is best known for calling on the vietnamese government to stand up to its massive neighbour china over over territorial disputes in the resource-rich south china sea . she also rallied for land and labour rights and protested the government 's handling of a massive toxic dump in central vietnam last year that killed tonnes of fish . ",
        "rights groups say her case is part of a protracted crackdown on dissent that has accelerated under the conservative communist leadership in place since last year . on thursday , five people in southern an giang province were jailed for between three and five years for `` anti-state propaganda '' after they hung flags of the former south vietnamese regime in several locations across chau doc city , according to state media and a court clerk who confirmed the sentencing to afp . the flag is considered an incendiary symbol by communist authorities and has been banned since the end of the vietnam war . ",
        "ahead of nga 's appeal , human rights watch called on authorities to drop charges against the activist and release more than 100 others currently in jail . `` tran thi nga and other vietnamese activists put themselves at grave risk to speak out against rights violations happening in their country , '' said brad adams , hrw 's asia director . `` vietnam 's friends and donors need to honour their fight by pushing for their unconditional release .
