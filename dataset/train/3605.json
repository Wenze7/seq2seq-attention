        "everton are expected to have a busy january transfer window , and it appears that their senegalese striker oumar niasse is just one of a number of players who could be sold in order to make room for new incomings . that is according to bbc sport , who also believe that summer signings davy klaassen and sandro ramirez may be deemed surplus to requirements at goodison park . with midfielders kevin mirallas joining olympiakos on loan and ross barkley moving to chelsea , manager sam allardyce certainly seems keen to make the team his own and get rid of any players who he considers deadwood . ",
        "niasse joined everton in 2016 , but in that time has only made 12 starts , with a return of five goals . his most recent appearance came in the recent 2-0 loss against manchester united , where he was guilty of missing everton 's best chance , and perhaps it was that match that convinced allardyce to sell . nope , niasse just has n't got it . tries his hardest but its not enough -- bolasieonthebreak january 1 , 2018 . it appears likely he will stay in the premier league , however , with brighton , crystal palace and west brom all rumoured to be interested in the striker . ",
        "klaassen and sandro , meanwhile , joined everton in the summer , but have been massively disappointing signings . both players have started just three times each in the premier league , with no goals or assists between them , and allardyce appears to have not seen anything from them to convince him that their fortunes will change . everton have already agreed a deal of Â£ 27m to bring in turkish striker cenk tosun from besiktas , and their january spending is not expected to end there . the toffees have been linked with sevilla midfielder steven n'zonzi and benfica 's rafa silva amongst others , and it seems highly likely that reinforcements will soon be joining the ranks at goodison park if allardyce is able to sell enough players .
