        "time out for whiskey a week or so ago , i wrote my first post about hitting rock bottom and deciding to turn my life around . i 'm already working on a continuation of my that post , in which i plan on recounting my first few weeks of weight loss . however , i 've been thinking a lot lately about how i incorporate alcohol consumption into my diet . this post gives me a chance to organize my thoughts and write a more formal approach for me to continue following . hopefully you 'll find something of value here as well . ",
        "a word on consumption , with a little buddhismbefore i get into my dietary considerations , i feel the need to explain how i enjoy drinking . there are two types of alcohol that i gravitate toward : bourbon and rum . and when i refer to rum , i 'm talking about good rum , not the rum-flavored , sugar-infused rotgut made by the likes of bacardi and captain morgan . i mean the stuff that has been carefully crafted , aged , and expertly blended . and do n't let anyone fool you , quality does n't cost an arm and a leg in the bourbon and rum world . ",
        "that 's really what draws me to these two fine spirits . both are the product of fascinating personalities , history , culture , science , and art ; which you can identify and appreciate if you consume them carefully . i also love the culinary art and philosophy that goes into making craft cocktails , and i know how to make some means ones : the old fashioned , the manhattan , the daiquiri , the whiskey sour , the palmetto . most importantly , i do n't drink to get drunk . i 've been completely shitfaced before , and it 's not something that i care to revisit . ",
        "the good thing is , i learned my lesson once . okay twice . and i learned it in isolation and not under the influence of peer pressure . i 'm grateful to have spent my 20 's sober , because having my first drink at 34 years-old has taught me to approach it with a bit more caution and grace . in terms of how much i consume , i generally limit myself to one drink , at most , per day . some days i do n't drink at all , or maybe i 'll pour myself an ounce of something and enjoy a small , mindful tasting . ",
        "on rare occasions i 'll have two drinks , usually a straight pour of whiskey or rum , followed by a cocktail . in social situations , i may consume up to three drinks , and i space them out over the course of the event so that i do n't get hammered . i 've recently learned how much i love making cocktails for other people , so playing bartender allows me to keep the juice flowing away from me . i guess that makes me an enabler . but some of you are just better to be around after you 've had a few drinks in you . ",
        ": -rrb- there are two benefits i get from alcohol . for one , i find it relaxing , especially when it helps to ease my social anxiety . and because my approach to booze is more mindful and culinary , it 's a rewarding experience to share something that i 've made with love . the other benefit i find is that it allows me to practice mindfulness , which is good for my mental and emotional health . i intentionally slow myself down and try to enjoy as much of the experience as possible . i pour a glass of fine , aged rum into a snifter . ",
        "swirl it round . watch it slowly flow down the side of the glass , the product of aging in a charred oak barrel . i take in the aroma and try to identify as many aspects of its character as i can . with some bourbons and rums , i could easily just sniff it for an hour , pour it back into the bottle , and feel satisfied with my experience . but a drink is meant to be drunk , so i take small sips , moving the liquid around my mouth and stimulating as many taste buds as possible . ",
        "as with the aroma , i try to appreciate the many flavors that jump out at me , the sweet balancing out the savory . finally , i feel the tingle as it goes down my throat . this is just one way of practicing mindfulness . i also try to do it while eating , walking , driving , and meditating . learning how to slow down and be in the present moment allows us to process all of the emotions and thoughts that cause us suffering . and the more we practice mindfulness in a variety of situations , the better we are able to be in control of ourselves and live with purpose rather than just spending our time reacting to things . ",
        "i 'm digressing . the point is , if i drink just to get drunk , then i 'd be denying myself an opportunity to practice mindfulness , which i 've come to value far more . anyway , now that you know i 'm nerd , let 's get back to the diet . conditionsbefore i allow myself to drink alcohol , certain conditions must be met . and i treat drinking straight alcohol differently than i do cocktails . because cocktails contain some type of sugar , and in an effort to be mindful of the potential cascade of bad decisions that consuming lots of sugar brings out in me , i 'm a bit more strict about them . ",
        "the first condition is that my weight loss trajectory has to be on track . here 's what that means to me : because weight can fluctuate up and down from day-to-day , i weigh myself every morning , and then at the end of the week , i average my weigh-ins , and use that number as my `` true weight . '' if my average weight for the week is at least one pound less than my average weight from the previous week , then i consider myself on track . if , however , my average weight is the same or more compared to the previous week , them i 'm off track . ",
        "so no booze for me . this typically happens because my diet is n't in check . the main reason why i have this requirement is because alcohol has the effect of lowering your inhibitions and stimulating your appetite . if my weight is heading in the wrong direction , and if my diet is n't locked down , adding booze will just make a bad situation worse . the second condition is somewhat related to the first and , admittedly , is n't very specific . it 's more like a wildcard that i can use based on how i feel that day . ",
        "as i mentioned before , weight can fluctuate , and i only consider the combined weekly average of daily weigh-ins to represent my true weight . it 's perfectly normal for me to step on the scale a few times in a week and find myself a pound or two heavier than i was the day before without killing my average for the week . however , if my weight increases by more than two pounds , it 's a sure sign that i rocked the boat a little too hard with my eating and need to make some corrections . ",
        "so if the scale makes me nervous that day , no booze for me . the third condition is a bit more reflective . did i only eat when i was hungry that day ? or did i do a lot of snacking because i was bored , stressed , angry , not mindful of my cravings , etc. ? if the answer to the first question is yes , then i can have a drink . if not , i 'll try again tomorrow . easy peasy . if i meet those three conditions , then i 'll allow myself to drink bourbon or rum by itself . ",
        "for cocktails , i add a fourth condition . first of all , the cocktails that i make tend to clock in at under 200 calories , so they are n't a big deal in the grand scheme of things unless i binge drink them , which i do n't . one of my diet goals , however , is to avoid added sugars , and my cocktails tend to contain about two teaspoons of demerara sugar . so , if i 've been good that day and have abstained from eating packaged , sugary junkfood or desserts , then i 'll allow myself to have a cocktail if i want one . ",
        "if one cocktail is the only thing i have that deviates from my goal of avoiding sugar , then i can live with that . the sugar content is so small , which is a huge departure from how i used to consume sugar , and it requires me to be mindful and in-touch with my eating and its impact on my body . i should add though , that if i 've eaten anything that day that i suspect has any `` hidden '' sugars , like most restaurant food , then that disqualifies me from having a cocktail as i have no idea how much sugar i 've consumed , and would rather not add any more to my system . ",
        "i may even consider cocktails off limits for the next two or three days . in conclusionis my weight loss on track ? did the scale freak me out that morning ? have i been good about only eating when i 'm hungry ? and have i avoided added sugars that day ? trial and error has taught me that these conditions help keep me heading in the right direction . the most important thing i 've learned during my recovery from obesity is to be mindful of everything i consume . alcohol complicates things , but it also gives me opportunities to practice mindfulness , which supports my physical , mental , and emotional health . ",
        "cheers .   "
