        "regarding the rangers , who might have added interest in monday 's game at the garden representing low-profile assistant lindy ruff in his first crack at the stars team he coached the previous four seasons : 1 . henrik lundqvist transforming his game on the fly at age 35 into a stylistic hybrid of martin brodeur and mike richter is tantamount to chris evert becoming a serve-and-volley tennis player after 13 years on the tour . yet that is just what the king has done these last six weeks in leaving his patented deep , patient , thinking-man 's technique behind to become a more aggressive , attacking , athletic and acrobatic goaltender . ",
        "`` you have to adapt , '' lundqvist told the post after saturday 's 5-2 victory over the devils in which he was routinely outstanding . `` there are so many more one-on-one plays -- so many more -- that i needed to change . you look at all the goalies who stayed around for a long time , and they adapted . `` there are still times when i find myself thinking a little too much and maybe get caught in between , but i think it 's going well . it 's fun for me . '' 2 . ",
        "lundqvist is on his best roll since he carried the rangers to a 14-2-2 getaway in 2015-16 . he has been sharper around the net and , dare say , even a bit better handling the puck the last couple of weeks . the netminder , who is expected to get his 16th start in the last 17 games and 26th overall in this one against the stars , is 11-3 with a . 928 save percentage . and 2.34 goals-against average since the beginning of november following a 3-4-2 / . 898/3 .21 line in october . `` you know , i played this way before , but just not here , '' lundqvist said , with an impish grin on his face . ",
        "`` that 's the way i played in sweden . '' lundqvist 's 25 starts are third most in the league , one behind calgary 's mike smith and toronto 's frederik andersen . his 1,406:08 of ice time is sixth in the league , behind andersen , smith , columbus ' sergei bobrovsky , tampa bay 's andrei vasilevskiy and st. louis ' jake allen . the workload bothers me less than the arbitrary 55-60 start cap placed on lundqvist prior to the last couple of years . hardly unique , lundqvist thrives on regular work . he is in prime condition . ",
        "sixty-five starts -- a number the king has n't reached since 2010-11 when he hit 67 , though he did start 64 two years ago -- seems about right . the rangers can worry about the impact the workload might have on lundqvist in late may and june . the question , though , is whether the rangers have enough confidence in backup ondrej pavelec to turn to him those other 17 -- now 13 -- times ? the blueshirts have nine remaining back-to-backs . as coach alain vigneault said saturday , `` they 're all big games . '' ",
        "meaning , pavelec is going start a number of them . i have wondered whether it would be possible to swing a deal with the coyotes to reacquire antti raanta , who returned from a second injury-related absence to lose 1-0 to the jackets on saturday , but the price would likely be prohibitive . if the playoffs started today ... you would n't be preoccupied ... 3 . this goal-scoring jesper fast is the player the rangers anticipated getting when they drafted the winger 157th overall in 2010 when he spelled his last name , `` fasth . '' ",
        "`` he 's like a hidden secret , '' rick nash said following saturday 's game in which fast moved into a top-six , matchup role on the unit with no . 61 and kevin hayes . `` not too many people around the league know about him , but he can do it all . he 's a special player . '' do you think the golden knights might like to have a do-over on their expansion draft selection from the rangers , from whom they took oscar lindberg rather than fast ? perhaps general manager george mcphee drafted by position and wanted a center . ",
        "perhaps the golden knights were put off by the hip surgery fast underwent following the playoffs . whatever , the rangers were able to keep a more valuable player in fast , who has always had the tools to be a productive offensive player . they were able to keep a more valuable player in michael grabner , too . 4 . speaking of whom : would three years at $ 10 million be enough to keep the austrian express from testing the open market on july 1 ? if not , what is the number that would prevent grabner from going to free agency ? ",
        "does grabner have more value to the rangers on the ice or as a trade-deadline chip ? probably in their lineup if he is viewed around the league as a third/fourth-line specialist . it is time for general manager jeff gorton to open discussions with no . 40 , who is working on the final season of his two-year , $ 3.3 million free-agent deal after coming off the five-year , $ 15 million contract he had signed with the islanders .
