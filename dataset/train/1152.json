        "the pokemon company is releasing a set of evil pikachu . earlier today , the pokemon company announced a new line of `` secret teams '' merchandise focusing on the evil antagonists of the pokemon games . from archie to lysandre and every big bad evil guy in between , this new line puts the spotlight back on the villains behind the main storyline of every pokemon game . the highlight of the new merchandise line is a set of plushes featuring pikachu dressed up as each one of the evil team leaders . you 'd think that a pikachu cosplaying as giovanni could n't be both adorable and utterly terrifying , but these plushes beg to differ . ",
        "you can check out all of the plushes in the gallery below : the new line is in honor of the `` rainbow rocket '' postgame storyline that takes place in pokemon ultra sun and ultra moon . after players beat the main game , they discover that the aether foundation employee faba has summoned a group of evil team leaders from different alternate dimensions to conquer the alola region once and for all . the new line of merchandise will also include a set of promo tcg cards , each of which features a different evil pikachu . the cards will be distributed to anyone who buys at least five pokemon tcg packs in pokemon center retail stores in japan . ",
        "sadly , these plushes will only initially be available in japan . however , we 're guessing it wo n't be too long before this batch of villainous pikachu also invade the united states and beyond !   "
