        "a small but storied sliver of retail space under rockefeller center will get a new life on wednesday after being shuttered for nearly a half-century . a former radio city music hall ticket booth -- a 43-square-foot space in the shopping mall under the theater -- is getting reopened by happy returns , a startup that accepts returns of unwanted merchandise purchased from online retailers . `` we are reactivating a space that was deactivated due to other modes of buying tickets , '' mark geller , co-founder and operating chief at happy returns , told the post . the original cash register was still in the booth when happy returns began moving in last week , he said . ",
        "the landmarked space , operated by tishman speyer , is happy returns ' first manhattan location and one of 50 mall outposts . the santa monica , calif. , company collects fees from online retailers in exchange for providing instant refunds for returns . it handles returns for 15 e-tailers , including everlane , eloqui , tradesy and shoes of prey . happy returns just raised $ 8 million in december -- on top of a $ 4 million round in may -- to fund an expansion to 200 locations this year .
