        "these days , it seems like everyone 's getting on the non-dairy milk train -- and for good reason . `` the milks on the market these days are very hard on the body to digest because they 're highly pasteurized and homogenized , '' explains nikki ostrower , founder of nao nutrition , a wellness-focused center in nyc . `` so even if you 're not lactose intolerant , you might have a hard time digesting it because the body does n't recognize it as milk anymore . '' the result ? all sorts of issues , including diarrhea , headaches , constipation , bloating , weight gain , and even hives . ",
