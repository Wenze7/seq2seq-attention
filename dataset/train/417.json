        "by richard martin barcelona - real madrid forward gareth bale has been ruled out of saturday 's la liga game at athletic bilbao , coach zinedine zidane said on friday , after the wales international picked up yet another injury on his return to action on tuesday after 63 days out . the french coach also added that captain sergio ramos will play wearing a protective mask after breaking his nose in the madrid derby a fortnight ago . bale came on in the 62nd minute of the king 's cup last-32 second leg match against fuenlabrada and had an immediate impact , setting up two goals for team mate borja mayoral in a 2-2 draw , with real progressing 4-2 on aggregate . ",
        "any hopes that this would be the start of a comeback from bale were quickly dashed the following day , however , with reports he had been ruled out of the game with athletic with another calf injury . `` it 's not much , just discomfort , but as he 's been out for so long it 's difficult , i hope it 's just a physical problem and is only discomfort , '' zidane told a news conference on friday . `` he needs to be with the team , train with the team and feel like another member of the squad . ",
        "we keep telling him this , that this is a tough time for him but he 'll come out of it , and we 'll keep supporting him until he is better . '' bale played a pivotal role in real 's champions league wins in 2014 and 2016 as well as winning the king 's cup final against barcelona in 2014 with a remarkable sprint down the touchline and finish . however , he missed most of last season 's liga and champions league double win with a series of injuries . `` we ca n't forget what he has done for the team . ",
        "when he is fit he is phenomenal , so we need to be patient with him , '' zidane added . real are fourth in the league standings but cut the deficit with leaders barcelona to eight points last week and face an athletic side in crisis . the basque side , the only team along with barca and real to have never been relegated from the top flight , are two places above the relegation zone . they are also reeling from a humiliating king 's cup exit to formentera on wednesday which lead to their usually loyal fans booing the team off the pitch . ",
        "`` the atmosphere wo n't benefit us , their fans will support their team as they always do and even more so when they host real madrid , '' added zidane . `` it 's going to be a difficult game , we 're going to have to fight . ''   "
