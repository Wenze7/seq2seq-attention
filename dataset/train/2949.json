        "an all-time classic between the pittsburgh steelers and new england patriots ended in ugly fashion for the former . a touchdown pass to steelers tight end jesse james was negated due to an infamous catch rule that requires a player to `` survive the ground . '' with no timeouts and the seconds ticking down , quarterback ben roethlisberger did n't ground the ball to stop the clock . instead , he faked a spike and forced a pass up the middle to wide receiver eli rogers . the pass was tipped off rogers ' hands and was intercepted by patriots safety duron harmon to seal the new england victory . ",
        "with the sting from the loss still setting in tuesday , roethlisberger let it be known that he takes full responsibility for the interception -- but he did so by saying that he should have listened to himself and clocked the ball instead of listening to his coaches . ben roethlisberger says `` i 'll take the blame for the int at the end of the game . '' says in hindsight , he should 've listened to himself and not the coaches , and just spike the ball as he wanted to - and as his teammates expected . ",
        "-- aditi kinkhabwala december 19 , 2017 . talk about a non-apology apology . that is not-so-subtle criticism of the pittsburgh coaching staff 's insistence on running one more play to try and win the game . who knows how well that would have played out on the sidelines and in the locker room after the game if roethlisberger went through with his plan ? roethlisberger was not done there , as he suggested that the officials charged the steelers their final timeout in the game in error . the instance came when the quarterback and head coach mike tomlin were making what appeared to be timeout gestures towards each other after juju smith-schuster 's 69-yard catch and run and , in roethlisberger 's mind , official tony corrente assumed that they were calling a timeout and charged them . ",
        "ben roethlisberger : ` we were angry ' over end of patriots game -- 93.7 the fan december 19 , 2017 . with nearly no time left on the clock , pittsburgh had the option to spike the ball , go for the chip-shot field goal , and send the game into overtime following the overturned touchdown . but this is all a classic should-have , would-have , could-have situation . at the end of the day , the new england patriots took advantage of the confusion and ended up the no . 1 overall seed in the afc . ",
        "there is no need for big ben and the ` lers to cry over spilled milk . it 's not out of the question that they learn from these errors and gain the ultimate revenge in the playoffs .   "
