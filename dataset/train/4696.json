        "as the holiday season is here , you go back home and visit your family , which means your mom will probably make you come with her everywhere they go . that 's what happened to me as they dragged me to a small christmas event , which was honestly rather boring until one thing caught my eye -- a donut food truck called jayne dough . jayne dough is a small mobile donut shop that does n't really have a particular location to set up . instead , they go to special events and cater them . according to their website , they are known for their potato donuts that are made of fresh , local florida potatoes . ",
        "unfortunately , they did n't have any when i went . however , they did have some unique flavors . i did the most reasonable thing when i saw the donut shop . i went straight to my dad and tried to convinced him to buy one of each flavor , and somehow i succeeded . i 'm still not sure how . so , here are my thoughts on the donuts i ate from jayne dough . there were two donut options in the food truck : cake and raised . each option had its unique flavor . the cake donuts were drier than the raised donuts , and were also more firm . ",
        "on the other hand , raised donuts were fluffy and doughy , which is why i preferred them . my favorites ... my top three donuts were the maple bacon donut , birthday cake with sprinkles donut , and the cinnamon and spice donut . the maple bacon donut was the perfect combination of salty and sweet . the bacon was crispy and not too salty . it 's saltiness was contrasted by the sweet icing and maple syrup . also , the crispiness of the bacon went great with the fluffiness of the raised donut . the birthday cake with sprinkles donuts was fluffy and sweet -- maybe a little too sweet for my preference . ",
        "however , the texture of combining something crunchy and fluffy was something i really enjoyed on this donut as well . the flavor was definitely birthday cake without it being overbearing and tasting like straight up cake batter . it was the perfect combination of cake and donut . finally , the cinnamon and spice donut was amazing . it was like eating a cinnamon pretzel , except in donut form . i do n't know how they did it , but it was delicious and i highly recommend it . you might be able to catch jayne dough and try these delicious donuts at the riverside arts market , which occurs every saturday from 10 am to 3 pm .

        "trust me , you `` donut '' want to miss them .   "
