        "airlines canceled 4,000 flights thursday because of the winter storm spanning the east coast , and hundreds more friday , according to flightaware . com , an online tracking service . the new york area was among the hardest hit . john f. kennedy international airport suspended flights about 11 a. m. in white-out conditions , high winds and nearly 5 inches of snow , according to the port authority of new york and new jersey , which operates the three major airports around new york city . laguardia suspended flights around noon and got nearly 4 inches of snow , according to the port authority . ",
        "laguardia hoped to reopen by 6 p. m. and jfk by 8 p. m. newark liberty international airport had one runway open at 4 p. m. , but the crosswind made landing difficult , according to flightaware . `` the issue impacting operations at the moment is the ability to plow snow fast enough , '' said sara orsi , senior marking manager for flightaware . `` as the storm moves through , de-icing capacity will be a greater concern and will limit operations at airports along the east coast . '' laguardia was expected to cancel 90 % of its schedule . ",
        "and newark had the most flights canceled with 1,009 by 3 p. m. , or more than 70 % of its schedule , according to flightaware . to get a sense of the scope of the disruptions with 4,030 cancellations by 4 p. m. , about 27,000 flights were scheduled thursday to , from or within the u. s . other airports with the most cancellations by that point were boston logan with 733 ; laguardia with 696 ; and kennedy with 597 . more : violent ` bomb cyclone ' wreaks havoc along the east coast . snow and high winds diverted dozens of flights to different airports , including 71 for jfk and 23 for philadelphia . ",
        "thirteen flights were diverted to washington 's dulles international airport from jfk , newark and philadelphia by 3 p. m. `` the vast majority are international flights that took off before the snow was an issue , '' andrew trull , a dulles spokesman . `` as they are getting over newfoundland in canada and elsewhere on the eastern seaboard from latin america , they are having to make diversion plans as the airport where they intended to land has closed . '' among the diversions from jfk to dulles were a qatar airways flight from doha , an emirates flight from dubai and an aeroflot flight from moscow , according to flightradar24.com , an online tracking service .

        "a singapore airlines flight was diverted from jfk to newburgh stewart international airport in new york state , according to flightradar24 . the planes at dulles are parked on holding pads . the passengers were carried away on mobile lounges . international travelers were processed through customs and border protection at the airport , trull said . airlines decide where to send planes based on proximity and logistical issues such as where crews are located . united airlines , for example , has hubs at newark and dulles . `` we regularly get diversions from philadelphia and new york because dulles does have the added benefit of size , so we can accommodate a number of planes , particularly the heavy , wide-bodies that have come in from overseas , '' trull said .

        "airlines are working with passengers on a variety of options , including new flights , bus rides to new york or hotel rooms in the washington area . `` this is an airline by airline decision , '' trull said . the massive winter storm moved up the east coast on thursday as weather watches and warnings stretched 1,000 miles from north carolina to maine . cold and wind gusts up to 70 mph closed schools and knocked down power lines . by 4 p. m. , airlines had already canceled 629 flights friday , according to flightaware . travelers should contact their airlines to learn about flight disruptions .
