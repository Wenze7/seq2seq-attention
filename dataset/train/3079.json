        "happy birthday , lebron ! the king is celebrating his 33rd birthday on saturday , and he 'll be playing on his special day for the eighth time in his career . that means we better see some chasedown blocks today ! ! the nba twitter account did us a huge favor and compiled all of lebron 's epic come-from-behind blocks that he 's haunted the opposition with for years , and today , every victim 's ptsd from lbj 's signature move will be renewed . block after block after block ! who does n't love watching this ? ",
        "those are some of his best ones ever , including the iconic game 7 thrashing of andre iguodala in the 2016 nba finals , which pretty much sealed the cavs ' first championship in franchise history . you got ta love all those angles . one thing i 'd love to know , however , is what in the world was jason richardson doing trying to land a 360 dunk on a fastbreak with lebron sprinting at full force down the court ?
