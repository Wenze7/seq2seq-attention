        "liverpool are eyeing a £ 44m move for roma 's alisson as they draw up contingency plans for simon mignolet 's reported departure . the belgian shot stopper has admitted that he may be forced to leave the reds due to the ` unhealthy ' nature of the goalkeeping situation under jurgen klopp . that has led to the times to don its speculation hat and claim that liverpool will look to bring in i giallorossi keeper alisson if mignolet does leave anfield , although the 25-year-old wo n't come cheap . liverpool have already plucked mohamed salah from stadio olimpico in the past six months to the tune of £ 40m and , whilst roma would find a bid of around the same figure hard to resist , would not want to weaken their side by selling to the premier league club again . ",
        "brazil international alisson has only been in rome for 18 months but he has already established himself as one of the best goalkeepers in serie a . the ex-internacional starlet has kept 16 clean sheets in 39 appearances for roma and , with 22 caps for his country 's senior side , has a wealth of european and international experience to draw upon . alisson does n't have a release clause fee written into his roma contract but is valued in the region of £ 44m - a fee liverpool would be able to pay after they scooped up £ 142m from philippe coutinho 's sale to barcelona . ",
        "however , alisson has gone on record to reveal that he is happy in his current surroundings for the time being - but his situation could change if he has a good world cup for brazil in russia this coming summer . he admitted : `` i am happy in rome . it 's always a pleasure to feel that lots of people are monitoring you but my head is focused on roma . i leave my future in the hands of god . in june , maybe we will speak about it again but for now i am concentrated on roma . '' ",
