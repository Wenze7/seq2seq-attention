",
        "`` taiwan certainly has an urgent need to establish a sound information security protection system before it can increase the trust that people and businesses have towards the digital environment , '' tsai told an information security event . `` with hacker attacks , internet extortion and fraud , these will affect people 's lives , social order , and even threaten national security . '' she did not set a timeline for achievement of the security goals . the threat of digital heists is rising as hackers adopt increasingly sophisticated tools and techniques , swift , the global messaging system used to move trillions of dollars each day , warned last month . ",
        "in february , the island 's stock exchange system also was attacked . the financial securities regulator had responded immediately with measures , tsai said . after tsai took office , taiwan had elevated information security to the level of national security , she added . the government has since added another member to its national security team , while the executive yuan , or cabinet , has created an information security division .
