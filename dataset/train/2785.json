        "pokemon go players are finally going to get a chance to evolve that dragonite . pokemon go announced the next community day event , a mini-event that happens once per month . february 's community day will take place on february 24th and will involve the dragon-type pokemon dratini . dratini 's involvement is huge for the pokemon go community , as its evolved form dragonite is one of the most powerful pokemon in the game . even though legendary pokemon have snatched the title of `` strongest attacker '' away from dragonite , it 's still considered a top-tier attacker and has additional value for being such a bulky defender in the game . ",
        "while pokemon go revealed the date and time of the next community day , they did n't reveal what exclusive move dratini would learn ... or whether it would retain its special move after evolving . that special move could make all the difference as to how useful this new dratini will be in battle . the other big announcement was that the upcoming community day will have a 3x stardust bonus , which will help players stockpile stardust for powering up their pokemon . when coupled with a star piece , players can get up to 4.5 x the amount of stardust than they usually do . ",
        "pokemon go 's first community day was a big success , as thousands of players took advantage of the surprisingly warm weather around much of the united states to catch pikachu that knew surf . many players headed out to take advantage of the increased spawn rate for shiny pikachu , a perk that pokemon go never actually announced . the big caveat to community day is that it will only last for three hours . february 's community day will take place between 2 pm and 5 pm eastern time ... although other continents will have their own time periods . ",
        "while the perks are big , the window to take advantage of them is pretty small . between the dratini reveal and the triple stardust bonus , players should have plenty of reason to stay excited for the next community day event . community day could wind up being the thing that saves pokemon go from totally alienating its fanbase in between major updates and upgrades .
