        "istanbul -- 13 january 2018 : president tayyip erdogan said on saturday that turkey 's military incursion in northern syria 's idlib province would crush kurdish militia forces that control the neighboring region of afrin . the kurdish ypg militia said turkish forces inside syria fired shells into afrin on saturday , but no one was wounded . turkish troops entered ... istanbul -- 13 january 2018 : president tayyip erdogan said on saturday that turkey 's military incursion in northern syria 's idlib province would crush kurdish militia forces that control the neighboring region of afrin . the kurdish ypg militia said turkish forces inside syria fired shells into afrin on saturday , but no one was wounded . ",
        "turkish troops entered idlib three months ago after an agreement with russia and iran for the three countries to try to reduce fighting between pro-syrian government forces and rebel fighters in the largest remaining insurgent-held part of syria . but the few observation posts which the turkish army says it has established are close to the dividing line between arab rebel-held land and the kurdish-controlled region of afrin . `` if the terrorists in afrin do n't surrender we will tear them down , '' erdogan told a congress of his ruling ak party in the eastern turkish city of elazig . ",
        "the kurdish ypg militia said turkish forces stationed in syria shelled several kurdish villages in the afrin region on saturday , without causing casualties . rojhat roj , the ypg spokesman in afrin , told reuters the shelling was carried out by turkish forces in dar taizaah and qalat seman -- areas where he said turkish forces had deployed as part of the agreement with russia and iran . `` from our side , there is no shelling at present , '' he added . erdogan has said the kurdish ypg militia is trying to establish a `` terror corridor '' on turkey 's southern border , linking afrin with a large kurdish-controlled area to the east . ",
        "in 2016 turkey launched its euphrates shield military offensive in northern syria to push back islamic state from the border and drive a wedge between the kurdish controlled regions . `` with the euphrates shield operation we cut the terror corridor right in the middle . we hit them one night suddenly . with the iÌ‡dlib operation , we are collapsing the western wing , '' erdogan said , referring to afrin . he also said turkey could drive ypg forces out of manbij . the mainly arab town lies west of the euphrates , and turkey has long demanded that kurdish fighters pull back east of the river . ",
        "`` in manbij , if they break the promises , we will take the matter in our own hands until there are no terrorists left . they will see what we 'll do in about a week , '' erdogan said . turkey was a major supporter of rebels fighting to overthrow syria 's president bashar al-assad , but is alarmed by the strength of kurdish forces -- which ankara says are linked to kurdish militants fighting in southeast turkey . it has criticized the united states for arming ypg and arab fighters in the syrian democratic forces , which drove islamic state out of raqqa and other parts of syria . ",
        "`` the u. s. sent 4,900 trucks of weapons in syria . we know this . this is not what allies do , '' erdogan said . `` we know they sent 2,000 planes full of weapons . '' reporting by irem koca in istanbul and tom perry in beirut ; writing by dominic evans ; editing by alexander smith .   "
