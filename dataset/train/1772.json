        "full-back james stokes celebrated signing a two-year contract extension with his 12th try in a campaign that just gets betterthe one ever-present in coventry 's starting side this season , full-back james stokes celebrated signing a two-year contract extension with a spectacular 80-metre interception try in last week 's win over old albanian -- his 12th in a campaign that just gets better . the try saw the 26-year-old edge back in front of hooker scott tolmie in a friendly rivalry between housemates to be cov 's top scorer which stokes says is definitely secondary to his desire to help cov secure promotion from national league one and , for him , a second spell in the championship . ",
        "`` it 's always nice to score , but you just want the team to win more than anything else , '' said stokes who , in his second season at butts park , has committed his future to the club until 2020 . `` when we are putting 40 or 50 points on a team then you start thinking ` i want to be on the score sheet as well ' and it can be a bit frustrating , but obviously the need to win the game comes first and you can worry later about scoring tries yourself . ",
        "100 tries for coventry rugby as record-breaking season continues with 16th win `` a lot of people thought i was smiling all the way to the line on saturday , but that was not my smile , that was me wading through thick mud and grimacing . `` every time tolmie scores , or nearly scores , you might see me put my head in my hands , but to be fair , i only want the best for scott . there 's a little bit of competition , but nothing too major . '' stokes has started all 16 games this term and believes the way the season is structured makes it possible to play in every match if avoiding injury . ",
        "`` i do n't think it 's been intentional , i think there was one game where i was meant to drop to the bench or miss out completely , but injuries and such meant that i played , '' said the england counties cap . `` i 'm happy playing every single game , and the way the league is structured and with postponements you can keep fresh . i like playing ! `` the breaks help if you 've got any niggles or anything like that . touch wood , i have n't had any issues -- to be honest , earlier in my career i had a phase of struggling with injuries , but in my last two years at cambridge i got out of that , i 've managed to stay injury-free and hopefully it will stay that way for the rest of the season . ",
        "`` we work quite closely with the strength & conditioning and physio teams , they keep tabs on us at every single session and if we 're carrying anything they will adjust our training , which is really good . `` i spent a bit of time at nottingham , their s&c and physio departments were awesome , but it was more treat rather than prevent . what we 've got at coventry is definitely the best i 've come across and i 'm not sure many championship clubs have got the same standard . '' the attacking performance of cov 's back three has been an exciting feature of their play with stokes enjoying a close understanding with wingers max trimble , in particular , and rob knox . ",
        "`` rowland winter said something about the three amigos , '' said stokes . `` max and i have known each other since we were about 12-years-old and are best mates . his mum is probably my second mum - and the same with his dad a well ! -- so i spend a lot of time at their house over holiday times and we share a house together now . `` we play very alike and we understand what the other wants , so in terms of counter-attacking we both know exactly where we want to try to get to -- it 's half the battle in that situation if you know where your support is going to be without ever hearing or seeing them , that 's perfect . ",
        "`` we just work hard on the training pitch to do that along with knoxy who is one of a kind . nick meredith `` i 'm very excited by the new contract and i ca n't wait for that to get started . i 'm very happy with the way things are going . `` the fitness and medical side is definitely one of the reasons why i 'm staying , obviously as well as the ambition of the club and its history , and also the support - you do n't get fans like ours anywhere else in national one and even the championship , it 's pretty unique . ",
        "`` if we go up i feel i 'm better prepared for the championship now . i was probably too young when i first gave it a crack , and the nottingham side i was trying to break into was challenging for the premiership and got to the championship semi-finals . `` i 've probably gone the harder route but it 's good that i 've come to appreciate rugby and that it 's about enjoying it . `` we ca n't really complain with 16 from 16 , we 've just got to keep going and keep working hard off the pitch , and on top of the eight games that we won at the back end of last season it 's a pretty good record to be proud of . ",
        "we 're definitely very happy with that as a squad . `` it 's very enjoyable -- you ca n't really complain when you win every single game , and we see plenty of ball in the back three which is always nice . `` the atmosphere in the squad is great . the team room is a fun place to be around , there 's no cliques or anything like that , everyone integrates and there 's a lot of banter flying around -- though not always good banter ! -- with the likes of brett daynes and knoxy , and phil boulton with his dry sense of humour . ",
        "`` the guys who have come from the premiership or the championship have all bonded in and offer an experienced voice when you 're on the training ground or playing , they give good quality advice and they 're good to be around . `` i 'd say the experience we have there is the big difference from last season . `` luke narraway has come in and completely transformed our defence , just by the way we play it makes our defending a lot more effective , and sam tuitupou and phil nilsen are just experienced heads and the ones you hear when it gets tough , they reassure and give you more confidence . ",
        "they 've definitely made a massive impact . '' can cov go through the whole season unbeaten ? `` we take every game as it comes , but if we 're on our game there is no team in the league that can beat us . if we 're going to be beaten , we 'll beat ourselves . we can definitely do the 100 per cent , it 's just up to us . '' the saying goes that an army marches on its stomach , and as an extra string to his bow stokes is also contributing to the team 's preparation by planning and providing pre-match meals . ",
        "`` it 's something i 'm interested in , '' he said . `` a lot of rugby players struggle with pre-game meals , which is not ideal , and it seems to be well-received so far . `` it 's something i might develop in the future , i 'll keep it there as an idea for a business i can perhaps take forward at some time .
