        "minneapolis -- the nfl has denied advertising space in the super bowl program for a veterans group that declined to alter language about standing for the national anthem . nfl spokesman brian mccarthy confirmed tuesday that american veterans , or amvets , submitted an advertisement last week to the third-party publisher of the game program with the message , `` please stand . '' mccarthy said the league , which has editorial control over the content , asked amvets to consider other options for the message , such as `` please honor our veterans '' or `` please stand for our veterans . '' ",
        "the two organizations were unable to agree on language in time to meet production deadlines . mccarthy said a separate ad from the veterans of foreign wars group with the words `` we stand for veterans '' was approved . some nfl players have taken to kneeling during the national anthem over the last two seasons to raise awareness of social and racial injustice , issues that created division within the league . the nfl announced tuesday that an owner-player committee was being created to try to address them . commissioner roger goodell was sent a letter dated monday from amvets national commander marion polk to express the lanham , maryland-based organization 's dismay with the league 's decision . ",
        "`` freedom of speech works both ways . we respect the rights of those who choose to protest , as these rights are precisely what our members have fought -- and in many cases died -- for , '' polk said in his letter to goodell . `` but imposing corporate censorship to deny that same right to those veterans who have secured it for us all is reprehensible and totally beyond the pale . '' amvets said the same ad was accepted by the nhl and nba for use in official programs for their all-star games . mccarthy said the nfl game program has `` never been a place for advertising that could be considered by some as a political statement . ",
        "the nfl has long supported the military and veterans and will again salute our service members in the super bowl with memorable on-field moments that will be televised as part of the game .
