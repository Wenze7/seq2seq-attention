        "the carolina panthers are for sale and a new owner could potentially move the team ... a shocking weekend for the carolina panthers began with an internal investigation launched into workplace misconduct by team owner jerry richardson . a little more than 24-hours later the nfl had taken over the case as carolina prepared to host the green bay packers . richardson was in attendance at the game in his usual suite overseeing the franchise . carolina won , putting them in position to earn a playoff berth with another win this weekend . following the game news broke that richardson had decided to sell his franchise , beginning a firestorm of rumors and speculation .

        "not only into the accusations which had surfaced via a sports illustrated report just prior to kickoff , but also about potential new owners and one factor in particular . will the carolina panthers move out of charlotte ? according to the charlotte observer , moving the team is a possibility and could happen as early as the 2019 season . the city currently has a previously negotiated contract in place ensuring the panthers remained for six year , but that expires in june 2019 . at that point staying in charlotte or the carolinas even , is not required .

",

",
        "however , without knowledge of who the new owner will be , speculation that a move is even possible becomes bothersome . without any contractual ties to the city and potentially no personal ones , the new owner is going to benefit from an outstanding piece of initial leverage . for now the focus remains on this season as perhaps the most important offseason in franchise history looms . the carolina panthers are for sale and a new owner could potentially move the team ... a shocking weekend for the carolina panthers began with an internal investigation launched into workplace misconduct by team owner jerry richardson .
