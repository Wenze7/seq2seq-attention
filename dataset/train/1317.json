        "amnesty international uk has cancelled an event set to be hosted at their london premises this week , after concerns were raised over the involvement of apologists for illegal israeli settlements . the jewish leadership council - organised event , originally scheduled for this wednesday , was a panel discussion on the united nations human rights council , titled : `` the unhrc and israel : how it works , what 's not working , and how it might be repaired '' . the event 's headline speaker was hillel neuer , who heads notorious pro-israel pressure group ` un watch ' . ",
        "however , after concerns were raised both externally and within the organisation , amnesty uk has pulled the plug , saying it has `` improved the way we review the hosting of events at amnesty '' . `` a wide range of organisations hold their events at our london office , but we reserve the right to withhold permission for our building to be used by organisations whose work runs directly counter to our own '' , said kerry moscogiuri , amnesty international uk 's director of supporter campaigning and communications . `` we are currently campaigning for all governments around the world to ban the import of goods produced in the israeli-occupied palestinian territories . ",
        "we do not think it 's appropriate for amnesty to host an event by an organisation that actively supports israel 's settlements '' . un watch , whose logo appeared on promotional material for the event shared by the jlc , has a track record of apologising for israeli violations of international law . in an article published just last month , un watch praised companies doing business in israel 's internationally-condemned settlements , claiming they `` promote peaceful co-existence by bringing jews and arabs closer together in a shared work environment '' . un watch also described israel 's occupation of the west bank and gaza strip in 1967 as merely an `` acquisition '' of the territory , after which , it added , `` jewish settlements were built on public land '' . ",
        "all israeli settlements established in the territories occupied in 1967 are illegal under international law , and many of them were built on privately-owned palestinian land . the piece was taken down in just the last few days , but is still viewable via google 's cache . in addition to its apologia for israeli settlements , un watch has repeatedly attacked palestinian and international humanitarian and rights workers , smearing un special rapporteur michael lynk , refugee agency unrwa , and even humanitarian workers arrested and tortured by israel . un watch head hillel neuer , meanwhile , who the jlc invited to speak at the event , has frequently singled out amnesty for attack , mocking the human rights ngo as `` pro taliban-hamas '' . ",
        "neuer has also described the occupied and blockaded gaza strip as a `` giant suicide bomb '' . the jlc , for its part , takes an active role in fighting the civil society , palestinian-led boycott , divestment and sanctions campaign , of which a boycott of settlement produce is a part . current chair jonathan goldstein met last summer with gilad erdan , the israeli minister in charge of efforts to undermine palestine solidarity activism and bds in particular . the jlc also backed , and its then-chair simon johnson spoke at , a rally in london in december 2016 to protest the un security council 's adoption of a resolution condemning israeli settlements . ",
        "in a statement released monday morning , the jlc condemned the cancellation , and sought to link the decision to `` antisemitism '' . `` it is highly regrettable that on this occasion amnesty international uk 's decision has targeted the jewish community '' , jlc chair jonathan goldstein said . there was no attempt by goldstein or the jlc to address the specifics of amnesty uk 's concerns .
