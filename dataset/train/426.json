        "santiago , chile -- the latest on the pope 's visit to chile : 9:10 a. m.three churches have been firebombed in chile on the first full day of pope francis ' visit to the andean nation . authorities say two churches were burned in the early hours of tuesday in the southern araucania region . the pope is set to visit with indigenous mapuches wednesday in temuco , the capital of araucania . the third church attacked was in puento alto , just south of santiago . including the latest firebombings , nine churches have been attacked in chile since friday . ",
        "in recent years , the mapuche have burned churches to agitate for the return of ancestral lands and recognition of their language . it 's not clear who has been behind the spate of recent burnings . ___ 9 a. m.pope francis is begging the forgiveness of chileans for the `` irreparable damage '' done to children who have been sexually abused by priests . francis opened his visit to chile on tuesday by referring directly to the abuse scandal in a speech to president michelle bachelet , lawmakers , justices and other chilean authorities . the scandal has eroded the credibility of the catholic church here and cast a shadow over his visit , the first by a pope in three decades . ",
        "francis said he felt `` bound to express my pain and shame at the irreprarable damage caused to children by some ministers of the church . '' he said he joined his fellow bishops in asking forgiveness , supporting victims and ensuring abuse does n't happen again . chile 's catholic church had already begun losing relevance when in 2010 it was found to have covered up for a prominent and powerful priest who sexually abused minors in his posh santiago parish . the vatican eventually sanctioned the priest , the rev. fernando karadima , in 2011 , but the church has yet to recover from the scandal . ",
        "6 a. m.pope francis will be under pressure tuesday to confront a priest sex abuse scandal during his first full day in chile , an andean nation where the majority identifies as roman catholic but strong currents of skepticism and even contempt for the church are increasingly present . many chileans are still furious over his 2015 decision to appoint a bishop close to the rev. fernando karadima , a priest found guilty by the vatican in 2011 of abusing dozens of minors over decades . bishop juan barros of the southern city of osorno has always denied he knew what karadima was doing when he was the priest 's protege , but many chileans have a hard time believing that . ",
        "`` sex abuse is pope francis ' weakest spot in terms of his credibility , '' said massimo faggioli , a vatican expert and theology professor at villanova university in philadelphia . `` it is surprising that the pope and his entourage do n't understand that they need to be more forthcoming on this issue .
