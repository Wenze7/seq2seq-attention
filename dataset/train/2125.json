        "catlins brewery owner norm macleod is frothing with new year plans . the brewery at kaka point , which has been making a name for itself since it began in 2014 , has just been upgraded . it 's not so much about productivity ; it remained a micro-brewery , with an output of 600 litres per day , macleod said . the upgrade is more about efficiency , so he can get the product - at least six types of craft beers and a cider -- out on the shelves faster . read more : * boutique beer heaven the scotsman , originally from lewis in the outer hebrides , may have moved on from home brew , but macleod still brews at home , in the basement of his house at kaka point . ",
        "`` we 've got limited space so we 've got to make that work efficiently . '' what would have taken up to two months to produce can now be turned around in 10 days . a key improvement has included refrigeration . temperature affects yeast levels , which means he now has far more quality control of the product . an extension of the brewery is also in the pipeline , along with a tasting area , with building plans and a liquor licence application to be submitted in the early new year . macleod and his family also do airbnb , which could tie in nicely with the brewery , he said . ",
        "he even grows a small quantity of hops near the proposed beer tasting area , which have found their way into his product , and would add to an authentic experience , he said . macleod 's passion , innovation and vision attracted his new business partner owaka farmer peter mcnab into the company six months ago . with his children running the family farm lochindorb station , mcnab was looking for something interesting to do in his retirement . his son and daughter-in-law lyndon and jade mcnab own and run a wedding venue , the former port molyneux school a short distance away at kaka point . ",
        "`` i thought there was some synergy with that . '' while he is the business brain in the operation -- the only brewery between invercargill and dunedin -- mcnab said he 'd been learning about brewing from the ground up . former business partner keith abbott had to give up his interest in the brewery , with the opening and expansion of his medical practice , based at cromwell in central otago . mcnab and macleod said they 'd had a hectic time doing the upgrade , hence productivity had taken quite a hit , but it was sensible to do all the improvements at once . ",
        "the race is now on to have enough product stockpiled for key events on the summer craft beer festival calendar .   "
