        "today one of my beloved webpage , came up with the following `` lifehack '' : set your autocorrect from ` guys ' to ` folks ' . the article indeed adds a bit more shade to the title , but this generated quite an amount of comments , from calling them ` feminazies ' , to '' i am female and i have always felt more comfortable using guys than ladies and gentlemen or whatever . and i am a feminista . '' but one also noted , that `` the word comes from guy fawkes of the gunpowder plot fame , and one dictionary definition is < people of either sex . > '' ",
        ", so there you have it , you 're ass is covered : -rrb- i had a quick chat with my friends , and altough seeming typical american issue , suprisingly this can occasionally be an issue even in the uk as well . on the defence , one teammate recalled , that in friends phoebe did refer to rachel and monica as `` guys '' , and this can mean a lots of things , even fire up some conspiracies , but all in all , language is changing , and so do people . its good to note , this article fires an interesting idea : if you have a recurring problem , or something you 're afraid to slip out , automate countermeasures , and listen , watch out for others feelings .

        "we have to adjust if someone is uncomfortable , and we have to understand , that people do n't want to offend each other . we just came from different cultures , different backgrounds . often these are unintentional . for example once -- when i had less experience with different religions -- we organised a big team lunch when one teammate was fasting , and i asked why he is n't coming . he understood it , did n't get offended , even if he was starving . i memorized it and held off with these kind of topics until the fasting ended . ",
        "a healthy team handles any issue proactively , and this is basically a retrospective action on both sides . if someone has a problem , raise it when it araises , and the other side with or wihout extra personnel , should resolve it and understand the confusion . a healthy team is happy , works together and gives a damn about eachother , living in unity and harmony . then you 'll have a team . if this is not given , they are just people working together . or just start using `` y ' all '' .
