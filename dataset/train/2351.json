        "bikram yoga is no more effective at improving health than doing the same yoga postures at room temperature , researchers claim . launched by bikram choudhury in the early '70s , bikram classes run for 90 minutes and consist of the same series of 26 postures , including two breathing exercises , practiced in a room heated to 35-42 degrees celsius with a humidity of 40 per cent . while bikram yoga is a favorite of celebrities such as jennifer aniston , madonna , george clooney and lady gaga , academics from texas state university and the university of texas have now found that doing yoga in a heated environment does not impact on vascular health . ",
        "for the study , 80 participants were enrolled and randomised to one of three study groups after preliminary screening . in addition to the heated and room temperature yoga groups , a control group was also included to account for the effect of time on our primary results , with the participants attending three bikram yoga classes a week for 12 weeks . the research showed that bikram yoga can reduce changes in the lining of blood vessels that are involved in the development and progression of heart disease . it also found that it can possibly delay the progression of atherosclerosis , which is a disease in which plaque builds up inside arteries and can cause a heart attack or stroke . ",
        "however , it found that it is not necessary for the yoga to be performed at a hot temperature with the same effects also being seen at room temperature . `` the new finding from this investigation was that the heated practice environment did not seem to play a role in eliciting improvements in vascular health with bikram yoga , '' said corresponding author stacy d. hunter . `` this is the first publication to date to show a beneficial effect of the practice in the absence of the heat . '' full study results have been published in experimental physiology . "
