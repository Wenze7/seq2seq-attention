        "top shoppers can now earn points even faster . if you 've decided to curb your beauty shopping obsession this year , ulta beauty is giving you one good reason to ditch your resolution . starting on january 19 , the retailer will be adding a new diamond level to its ultamate rewards program , which gives ulta 's top shoppers even more savings . related : while the platinum level used to be the top tier of the program , offering members who spent $ 450 or more per year 1.25 points for each dollar spent , a free birthday gift , a $ 10 birthday coupon , and double points during their birth month , the new level promises even more perks . ",
        "with the new level , shoppers who spend a grand total of $ 1,200 or more during the calendar year will receive all of the platinum perks , as well as get free shipping on all orders over $ 25 and an annual $ 25 beauty services reward card . top-tier members will also earn 1.5 points per dollar spent , so they 'll accrue points even faster . plus , those points never expire so you can save them for that special hair dryer you 've had your eye on . related : while dropping $ 1,200 per year is a lofty goal for most , it may convince you to limit all of your beauty shopping to one place , rather than shop ulta , sephora , and your local drugstore . ",
        "spending on ulta 's huge range of beauty services will also earn you points , and it 's one of the retailer 's best-kept secrets . many shoppers are n't aware that the store offers haircuts , blowouts , facials , and more -- so it can truly become your one-stop beauty shop . and if your annual beauty spend is still nowhere near diamond level even after factoring in facials ? even the basic membership offers points , a birthday gift , and double points during your birth month , making it worthwhile for even the most casual beauty shopper to sign up .
