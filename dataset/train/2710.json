        "name : tam-anh and ricky location : jack london square -- oakland , californiasize : 1,100 square feetyears lived in : 1 year , rentingat the end of 2016 , tam-anh and ricky decided to move in together , so they scoured craigslist for apartments and began their search for a new home -- an arduous task in the bay area 's competitive rental market . a few listings in , a description caught their attention : original loft , exposed brick , floor-to-ceiling windows , walk-in closet , fireplace . tam-anh says it felt too good to be true , but they emailed the leasing agent anyway . ",
        "`` it 's even more magical in person , '' the agent responded , inviting them to an open house to view the space . you can probably guess what happened next . `` the moment we stepped into the loft , the raw beauty of the space overwhelmed us , '' tam-anh says . there was an overwhelming amount of natural light , but it was just perfect for the bay area couple . the loft was wide open and featured warm industrial touches , including ornate chandeliers and brick walls . tam-anh and ricky quickly handed over their meticulously-prepared application packet , and less than six hours later , they received a call : the loft was theirs ! ",
        "apartment therapy survey : our style : unrealistic '90s sitcominspiration : my mom 's overgrown garden , the colors of willy wonka and the chocolate factory , don draper 's apartment , the library from beauty and the beast , and anything gold . favorite element : architecturally , the windows . the wall-to-wall , floor-to-ceiling windows perfectly light our home and provide life to our small plant collection . another favorite are the sonos speakers in every room . we are obsessed with music . we wake up to music , cook to music , relax to music . ",
        "sonos allows us to always be in control of our soundtrack . we love being able to control which hamilton song we want to hear , in which room , at what volume . #notsponsoredbiggest challenge : one of our biggest challenges is wall space for art . we 're both avid collectors of art and one of the first and most difficult things we had to do when we moved in was downsize our art collection . my passion project is called the beehive society , a collective specializing in pop-up gallery shows in the bay area . a close friend and i founded this to organize , curate and host art shows in the bay area . ",
        "due to the number of windows , ricky and i are limited on wall space where we can actually hang our personal art collections . first world problem , we know . so , we store a lot of our art in our closet and storage space downstairs and plan to cycle out some of our favorite pieces . what friends say : `` you only see places like this in the movies ! '' `` take your time . your home will grow and evolve with you . keep searching for that perfect piece , save up for the one you really want and do n't be afraid to mix and match . ",
        "as you keep living your best life , you will collect new treasures that inspire fresh ideas for your space . `` proudest diy : a very utilitarian answer , but the lighting in the bedroom . when we first moved in , the two wall lights in our bedroom were very dim . ricky figured out the perfect way to provide additional lighting , hide all the wiring , provide easy controls , and still match the style of the house . it 's been the perfect solution ! biggest indulgence : our almost-seven foot marble dining room table . ",
        "it 's a beast ! we ordered the legs separately so we could get them custom painted gold . once we screwed the legs on , it took six adults to flip the table over . we always joke if we move out of this apartment , the table has to stay because of how incredibly heavy it is . best advice : take your time . your home will grow and evolve with you . keep searching for that perfect piece , save up for the one you really want and do n't be afraid to mix and match . ",
        "as you keep living your best life , you will collect new treasures that inspire fresh ideas for your space . remember , it 's a constant work in progress and change is a good thing .   ",
