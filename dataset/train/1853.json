        "by arré benchmukesh ambani is a rich man . his wealth is the kind of material that can keep the comic mills running forever : mukesh ambani is so rich that if richie rich was made in india , it would be based on his life . mukesh ambani 's house is so huge that you need google maps to navigate around it . and mukesh ambani has so much money that he could get both messi and ronaldo to play football at his son akash 's birthday party . on dhanteras , mukesh ambani buys soan papdi that is actually made of gold . ",
        "see what i mean ? but the $ 41.8 billion question is , just how rich is asia 's richest man ? and exactly how much money is $ 41.8 billion ? now the nerds among you will quickly say that ₹ 2700905708021 is a number so big , it will take an entire minute to count if you move your middle-class fingers past every digit . and if you turn to the calculator , it will give up on you , so do n't bother . to truly understand $ 41.8 billion , you do n't need a calculator . ",
        "you need perspective . -- $ 41.8 billion is 50 per cent more than the gdp of his birth country , yemen . -- mukesh ambani could build 40 more antilias and still have money left to buy the world 's most expensive painting . -- mukesh ambani could bail out vijay mallya 30 times ! -- mukesh ambani 's reliance industries could buy 100 per cent of every company listed on the karachi stock exchange . are you getting a picture . still not ? ok let 's try this . mukesh ambani is so rich that if richie rich was made in india , it would be based on his life . ",
        "if you saw money lying on the street , how much would it have to be to tempt you into picking it up ? my guess , you 'd let a re 1 or ₹ 2 coin go . it 's probably not worth the effort . but what if you spotted ₹ 5 or ₹ 10 ? you might pick it up . that 's a handy sum of money for most of us . for a bollywood star that money could be ₹ 500 . for salman khan , it would probably be ₹ 2000 . the value could be ₹ 50,000 for patanjali ceo acharya balkrishna . ",
        "as per neil degrasse tyson 's wealth test , the amount that mukesh ambani could let go and not bother to even pick up if it was lying on the street , would be roughly $ 37620 , which translates to ₹ 24 lakh . so basically , ₹ 24 lakh is mukesh ambani 's ₹ 5 . if reading this ruined your day , i 'm deeply sorry . this article was originally published in arré . featured image credits : shruti yatam/arré .
