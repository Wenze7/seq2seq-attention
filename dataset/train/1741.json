        "in coming decades , oil producers using advanced drilling rigs and fracking tools could extract up to 70 billion barrels of crude from the sprawling permian basin , researchers say . john roberts , a researcher for ihs markit , began work on that estimate in 1987 , when he started collecting geological data in west texas for a small company in the midst of a crushing oil bust . over the past 2 1/2 years , roberts has led a sprint to build a gigantic database cataloging more than 440,000 wells drilled since the oil industry began plowing the permian basin in the 1920s . ",
        "`` we looked at the whole thing , grass to granite , '' said roberts , executive director of global subsurface content operations at ihs markit . what ihs found was that those 75,000 square miles in texas and new mexico could hold more crude in so-called recoverable resources - the amount that can be extracted with modern technology - than kuwait and argentina combined . and that 's if u. s. shale drillers can only extract 4 to 6 percent of the crude stuck in 52 different rock formations -- a typical figure for such plays . in 1973 , the year opec 's oil embargo prompted gas lines in the united states , oil companies in the permian basin pumped more crude than they would in any of the next 44 years , yielding a record 763.5 million barrels that year . ",
        "but almost a decade ago , drillers figured out how to extract crude from shale that had fed conventional oil-bearing formations for millennia . since 2010 , companies drilled about 20,000 sideways wells into the permian , reversing the region 's decades - long decline . last year , the oil industry almost beat its production record in the permian , extracting 740 million barrels of oil . the industry is set to break the record this year or next . over the past century , the permian has yielded 39 billion barrels , according to ihs . that it could pump another 70 billion barrels will keep companies busy for decades . ",
        "that 's not to say oil companies will ever reach all that crude . drilling some of these fields , roberts said , is n't financially feasible until crude prices reach $ 70 a barrel . oil settled in new york at $ 51.88 a barrel tuesday . last week , wood mackenzie , an energy research firm , said unless oil prices rise high enough to spur technological innovations to overcome the permian 's geological constraints , the region 's production could peak as early as 2021 , around 3.5 million barrels a day . roberts agreed . one piece of evidence that many in today 's cluster of oil wells are n't profitable : oil companies have left almost 2,300 wells dormant , waiting for crude prices to rise before they bring the drilled but unfinished wells into production . ",
        "`` they 're waiting on rosier times , '' roberts said .   "
