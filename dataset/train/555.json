        "in 2016 , auto sales growth in china rebounded from a brief slowdown , after the government slashed the sales tax levied on small-engine cars from 10 % to 5 % . for the full year , this stimulus drove a 15.9 % increase in deliveries across china 's auto industry . general motors was a big beneficiary , recording a 7.1 % sales increase despite a downturn in the mini commercial vehicle market , which its wuling brand dominates . however , many pundits worried that this momentum would n't last . after all , the tax on small-engine cars increased to 7.5 % in 2017 and returned to its original 10 % level this month . ",
        "despite this tax headwind , the general delivered another year of solid sales growth in china during 2017 . sales did slow to begin the year . in the first few months of 2017 , general motors did face a sales downturn in china . through may , gm sold 1.48 million vehicles in china , down from 1.54 million a year earlier : a decline of nearly 4 % . this hiccup was to be expected . it was common knowledge that the purchase tax for small-engine vehicles would rise in 2017 , so it made sense for consumers who were thinking about buying a small car to make sure they did so by the end of 2016 . ",
        "thus , there was an exaggerated impact on chinese auto sales in early 2017 from demand that was pulled forward to late 2016 . demand has rebounded . general motors broke out of its sales slump in china last summer . in fact , it has posted record deliveries in china for every month starting with june , including double-digit gains in several of those months . on thursday , gm reported that it ended 2017 on a high note in china , with deliveries up 13.1 % year over year to 491,702 in the month of december . this performance pushed gm china 's annual sales past the 4 million mark for the first time ever , to a new record high of 4.04 million . ",
        "for the full year , general motors ' deliveries in china increased 4.4 % . however , looking just at the period since june -- when gm returned to consistent growth there -- deliveries increased 9.7 % year over year : a remarkably strong result . general motors ' growth in china over the past year was driven entirely by the relatively young baojun brand , which hit the market just seven years ago . in that short period of time , baojun has become one of the hottest auto brands in china , with nearly 1 million deliveries in 2017 , up from fewer than 500,000 two years earlier . ",
        "based on its recent growth trajectory , baojun could overtake buick and wuling to become gm 's best-selling nameplate in china this year . gm can handle another tax increase . as was the case a year ago , general motors and its rivals are facing an uptick in the purchase tax for small-engine cars beginning this month . once again , the looming tax change probably encouraged some buyers to accelerate their purchases into december . nevertheless , gm 's strong performance during 2017 indicates that a modest increase in chinese purchase taxes should n't hold back sales for long . ",
        "continued sales growth in china -- as well as growing demand for higher-margin suvs and luxury vehicles -- should allow general motors to fully offset pricing pressure at the low end of the market . this situation points to a continuation of gm 's string of strong profits in its second most important market during 2018 .
