        "an experiment formed through necessity brought me to my new ethosi think we can all agree that 2017 was a roller coaster of a year . for me , this was especially true after losing my mother in june . i 'm lucky : i 'm an empty nester with work i can accomplish from virtually anywhere , and i have a husband who shares my values . so in may , 2017 when it became clear that my mom would n't get better this time , he was the one to suggest we move in with her . and off we went , from the bay area to the big apple , to be with my mother in her final days . ",
        "it was an honor to usher my mother out of this world she brought me into , with love and compassion . and it was also really , really draining , and sad , and challenging . people often asked me how we staved off boredom as they imagined us sitting around in the existential waiting room of her demise . ha ! nothing was further from the truth . our days flew by in a maelstrom of caring for her , being with her , running errands , calling doctors and hospice caregivers , arranging for visits from friends and family , and on and on . ",
        "i had no bandwidth for checking emails , keeping up with social media or the like . life was lived in the old school way i grew up . i gave myself permission , given the situation , to take on and respond to things and people only if such an interaction was not draining . i knew that i had to set that boundary for myself in order to be fully there for my mother and create a safe haven for all of us . i began to refer to this as my just say yes to joy campaign . ",
        "just saying yes to joy meant that i had to step away from things that may have felt important or difficult to set aside , but that i simply did n't have the emotional bandwidth to accomplish at the time . i stepped away from things that may have felt important or difficult to leave but that sapped my energy rather than expanded it . i stepped away from things that may have felt important or difficult to leave but that sapped my energy rather than expanded it . what 's the result ? i 'm sleeping better , getting more accomplished and therefore have more time to spend with people i care about . ",
        "rather than feeling that i 'm behind when the day has just begun , i greet each morning with energy and anticipation . i 've gotten myself back in the light of opportunity ; new and exciting opportunities abound ! i 'm thrilled to say the experiment that grew out of my own mourning has been uplifting and more powerful than i could have hoped for . it has forced me to consider each commitment and it has resulted in my feeling more and more in sync with my personal version of a life well lived . in fact , i 've decided to continue using this just say yes to joy filter in my life , at home and work . ",
        "as we begin 2018 , why not create your own just say yes to joy campaign ? ask yourself : what would my day look like if i just said yes to joy ? who do i want to spend time with and equally as important , what relationships would i have to relinquish ? how can i build on the successes i 've had in 2017 ? as i learn from 2017 and look towards the possibilities inherent in a new year i look forward to continuing or beginning work with you or someone you care about to set and attain goals and to build a strong and abiding sense of yourself : intellectually , physically , emotionally , spiritually and professionally . ",
