        "founder of the luxury brand hanan aljabr talks italian craftsmanship , fine leathers and her inspirationsprofile hanan aljabr friday , january 5 , 2018 - 3:58 pm italy was one of the first places i visited on vacation with my family . i used to go shopping a lot with my mum and my aunt . i remember going to a small fendi boutique in venice when the fendi baguette bag was very popular , and there was a whole wall of baguette bags in different designs . i 'd never seen anything like it . that 's when i started to be aware of the beauty of bags and i started to notice the quality . ",
        "i never thought i 'd start my own company , but i started collecting handbags and had quite a large collection , and i found that when i was walking down the street , i 'd see at least one or two other people with the same bag . the market seemed a bit saturated , and overwhelming , and i did n't feel inspired anymore , so my family suggested i should start my own brand and design my own bag styles . in august 2014 there were a lot of leather fairs happening , and i started to contact factories in italy . ",
        "the tanneries took me through the process of how they made the leather , and showed me all the possibilities of what you could do with it , which fascinated me . i really like muted colours , and in my personal style i focus a lot on fabric and cut , so i decided to translate this into bag design . i 'm not a fan of logos and branding , i prefer it when you can recognise a brand through silhouettes and colours . my first collection is focused on neutrals and exotic leathers . these neutrals comprise rich earthy tones and cool celestial hues , reminiscent of magical arabian landscapes and inky night skies . ",
        "i wanted to create some subtle signature design details for hanuxe , such as the strap being non-adjustable , and quite short . i also think it 's much more fun to have a bright colour on the inside of the bag . i source all my leathers from a very credible and ethical tannery in italy and the bags are made by highly skilled artisans in a workshop , which is located between florence and milan . i 've always been concerned with standards , and i only use the very highest quality animal skins . with skins like ostrich and crocodile for example , each skin is slightly different so no two bags will be exactly the same . ",
        "with hanuxe my guiding vision is less is more -- a unique fusion of italian flair and craftsmanship and my arabian appreciation for luxury that i hope will attract younger audiences to the pleasures of owning these unique , exotic pieces . the supreme quality of the leathers ensures the bags become more beautiful over time , creating items women will treasure for years to come . hanan aljabr was born in saudi arabia , but moved to the us when she was one before returning to saudi arabia aged 11 . she took two years to develop hanuxe and launched her first collection last year , adding a new range of cardholders in ostrich , python and lizard this february ; hanuxe .
