        "there are a few reasons why the boston red sox pitching might be even better in 2018 than it was in 2017 . hector velazquez should be counted among them . hector velazquez followed up a fantastic debut season in the mexican league in 2010 by rattling off five straight mediocre years . 2016 was his best season in that league though , and it led to a chance with the boston red sox . it was hard to know what you were going to get with the right-handed pitcher however . he had mixed results in the mexican league , and would be in a whole new world in 2017 . ",
        "velazquez wasted no time proving himself in triple-a though , dominating start after start . it quickly got to the point where i was wondering why the starter was n't getting a chance in the majors . he finally got his major league chance on may 18 . this did n't go to well though . in fact , you could call it disastrous . velazquez gave up six runs on nine hits over five innings . he looked extremely hittable and even led to some saying he just was n't a major league pitcher . that 's kind of a ridiculous claim after one outing though , is n't it ? ",
        "it would turn out to be , as it was the only appearance he made that was even remotely bad . velazquez ended up not getting another major league appearance until june 14 . that was in a long-relief appearance that saw him throw 3 1/3 scoreless innings . this led to another chance at a start , that saw him go 5 1/3 innings , giving up two runs . those would be the last two runs he allowed all year . the final five appearances of the year saw velazquez throw a combined 11 scoreless innings . his era dropped from 10.80 after his first appearance , to 2.92 at the end of the season . ",
        "over 24 2/3 innings , velazquez recorded 19 strikeouts compared to seven walks . he posted a 1.14 walks plus hits per inning pitched while opponents hit just . 236 against him . those are all great numbers , but the 29-year-old does n't have a defined role in 2018 . so what exactly will he be doing for boston ? it 's safe to assume velazquez will get a look in spring training . there , the red sox will try to figure out exactly who is making the roster in what roles , and who the emergency arms will be . ",
        "boston 's already got a strong rotation , and it 's tough to envision velazquez pushing the two-or-so pitchers ahead of him to get in on the action . out of the bullpen he proved to be effective too though . from there , he could earn a role as a long reliever/spot starter . of course , if steven wright 's legal problems are solved by then , he 's the front-runner for that position . due to all this , there 's a strong chance velazquez once again starts the year in triple-a . while he 's definitely earned the right to pitch in the majors , sometimes the cards just are n't aligned right . ",
        "that does n't mean he wo n't be a major factor to the red sox 2018 season though . expect velazquez to be the first emergency arm . should someone get injured , velazquez could be thrust into the rotation . due to this , he 'll have an inconsistent schedule . velazquez wo n't be making a start for the red sox every fifth day , but expect there to be plenty of appearances from the mexico native throughout the year . while a starter role seems ideal , boston could use him out of the bullpen throughout the year as well . ",
        "not only as a long reliever , but as a mid-late innings guy if needed . last year , velazquez made three one inning appearances in the majors . he combined to allow no runs on one hit and one walk , while striking out three in that time . those short outings do n't seem to phase him . with all of this in mind , the boston red sox seem to have a swiss army knife of a pitcher in hector velazquez . his role will never be completely defined , but they can use him in any situation necessary .
