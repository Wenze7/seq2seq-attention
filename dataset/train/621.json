        "hellohi , i 'm cameron and for as long as i can remember i 've never had a dream . never had aspirations . never had a goal . am i an exception to the rule ? most certainly not , i do know i 'm not alone in this struggle . this is a struggle to know ones self . a struggle to find purpose in this life . what am i here to do on this earth ? some people turn to religion as an escape . escaping these thoughts is what i tried to do , i did n't turn to religion though . ",
        "i turned to alcohol . it did n't last all that long , maybe a few months . i was lost , it really bugged me that i did n't know what i 'd do with my life . eventually this worry turned into anxiety , and my anxiety attacked me at night , just as i was about to fall asleep i 'd suddenly have this crazy intense feeling like i was going to die . that 's the moment i began drinking , it helped me to bypass that feeling . i 'd drink a few cans every evening , anticipating what was to come . ",
        "to this day i dread having a panic attack whenever i go to bed , sometimes my heart starts to race and i breathe like i 'm in trouble . that usually passes after a while though . getting past that blip in my past , i still have no idea what i want in life . i mean i do , i want to be happy , content , able to relax and chill whenever i want , that just does n't feel like enough , i 'm supposed to have this giant , well thought out plan . ",
        "but there 's no small print to what i want . the career , the lifestyle , the hobbies . all of those things are a myth . generally speaking i 'm not fussed with what job i do , as long as i 'm not infringing upon the morals by which i live my life . i 've had more jobs in many different fields than i care to list . from childcare to waste disposal and security . whilst i was doing them , it was cool , but if you asked me now , i would n't really want to do any of those jobs . ",
        "i 'd do them , but not because i want to . taking it back a decade and a bit , back to year 7 . we were all asked what we wanted to be when we were older . i had nothing . so i just said , a dare devil . these days my answer is more like , programmer or it support . truth be told i 'm still that clueless 11 year old that said dare devil . i 've spent the past 18 years having no clue what i 'll do with my life , i 've just been working , going to college and more work . ",
        "depression aside , not sad , not happy , just living . surely this is n't it ? if a career does n't come to me ... i will have go to a career i guess . updates to come .   "
