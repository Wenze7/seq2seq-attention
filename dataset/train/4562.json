        "earlier this year , facebook unveiled spaces , its inaugural attempt at bringing the social network to vr . and , seeing as facebook also owns oculus , it 's no surprise that spaces was a rift-exclusive at launch . but , just as facebook is on every platform and device imaginable , the plan for spaces was always to have it spread far and wide as well . that 's why starting today , facebook is making spaces available for the htc vive , marking the first time the app is going cross-platform . according to facebook , the vive app will have the same features as the rift version . ",
        "you 'll be able to create your avatar , go on virtual photo tours , broadcast live , view videos in 360-degrees , create art , play games and , yes , take virtual selfies . and yes , it 'll be cross-platform , so users can hang out in spaces on matter what vr headset they 're using . which is important , because vive is only the beginning . facebook plans on making spaces compatible with pretty much every vr headset out there , which could include devices from the likes of google , microsoft and maybe even sony . ",
        "in the meantime , vive users can head on over to facebook . com/spaces starting today to see if they want to partake in facebook 's vision of the future .   "
