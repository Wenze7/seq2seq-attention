        "according to a tweet from ken rosenthal , the san francisco giants are staying in contact with free agent jay bruce as a possible backup plan after losing out on giancarlo stanton . bruce is coming off a very good 2017 season in which he hit a combined . 254 with 36 home runs and 101 rbi between the new york mets and cleveland indians . he really carried the indians down the stretch and helped them clinch the american league central . the tweet from rosenthal also states that the backup plan for the giants after missing out on stanton was to bring in bruce and billy hamilton .

        "hamilton talks between #sfgiants and #reds , however , have faded significantly ... . -- ken rosenthal december 13 , 2017 . as we noted yesterday in our article on hamilton , it only makes sense to go out and get a power bat if they add billy hamilton to the lineup who brings little-to-no power . bruce would certainly add some thump to the lineup having five seasons with 30-plus home runs . however , i have my concerns with how he fits defensively in the outfield . maybe the front office is thinking that if they get hamilton he can make up for some of the defensive inefficiencies of bruce in right field .

        "it only makes sense to get both of these pieces . you ca n't have one without the other and expect to compete in 2018 . i think the idea of getting a defensive minded center fielder and a power bat in the corner outfield is a good direction to go , but the giants must have both . bruce and hamilton are n't the only available players who fit that mold , but those seem to be the players the giants are targeting the most with marcell ozuna now going to the st. louis cardinals . i think bruce fits better on an american league club , and i would n't feel comfortable giving him the years he 's going to want as a free agent .

        "but if the giants are able to land hamilton and bruce it would be a good start towards competing in 2018 . according to a tweet from ken rosenthal , the san francisco giants are staying in contact with free agent jay bruce as a possible backup plan after losing out on giancarlo stanton . bruce is coming off a very good 2017 season in which he hit a combined . 254 with 36 home runs and 101 rbi between the n. . .
