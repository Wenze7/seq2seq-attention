        "it finally happened . it was as if i had been subjected to the asch experiment for three years and finally , after so much pressure , i decided to yield . maybe my level of resistance was low . maybe i became a victim of society . or maybe , just maybe graduation was a damn good album . when the college dropout was released , on 10 feb 2016 , i was more concerned with my three week old daughter . nothing , i mean nothing can blow you away like your first child . her every movement was magic and it 's a time filled with firsts : her first cry , her first time bowel movement ... every first was checked off . ",
        "you are , like them , those first three weeks , far-sighted . you ca n't see beyond eleven inches either . and that is part of the reason why i ai n't give a damn about college dropout . the other reason was i hated `` through the wire . '' i mean , really abhorred that shit . the track was pedestrian as fuck to me , his raps were no better and everyone was trying to sell me on the fact that kanye was rapping from his hospital bed ? man , i was like , `` i could have waited until he healed . ",
        "'' `` slow jamz '' was a little better . only a little . i could tolerate that song . but yo , the black album was out then , so yeah , chalk and cheese . `` all falls down , '' okay , i liked that one . maybe the video got me . maybe it was because it 's because i was a little more receptive with a one-month old . i do n't know . i liked that one . but despite that , i ai n't want to buy the album . it never even crossed my mind . ",
        "and that 's mostly because i knew we were sitting on the manhattan project of rap in war with the dragon . i thought `` the workout plan '' was corny which gave me even more incentive to not buy into what people were selling me about kanye . late registration was released on 30 august 2005 , and it could have been the holy grail of rap , i just was n't in the spirit for it . when i left atlanta a year after i graduated back in 1998 , it was because finding work in my field was an impossibility . ",
        "but now i was back , working two shitty jobs , and hating every second of it . it was my first time in seven years working a job , job . that 's why the minstrel show connected . the lyrics on that album was on some grown man shit . then some kinda ... came out and that 's what i was listening to . i did like `` heard em say '' but not enough to buy the album . fast forward to september of 2007 , i was back in my element . back in new york . ",
        "back in television . shooting video , editing , taking photos . it was an exciting time . the first iphone was out . i was in a good place . leading up to the release of graduation , there was banter between kanye and 50 on who would sell more records on the first day . as it turned out , 50 's curtis was slated to be released on the same day , 11 september . only song i liked of 50 's in years was `` i get money '' so that was a no on curtis . ",
        "but yo ... i liked `` ca n't tell me nothing '' ... a lot . and hey , `` stonger '' was a damn good summer song . i was feeling like kanye had worked out his lyrical quirks , his flows were better , and that damn chipmunk shit was far behind us . i felt positive . positive in life and positive about graduation so i purchased it . and i loved it . i loved the murakami artwork , i loved the sequencing of the tracks , and by the time i heard that joe ski love beat on `` i wonder '' i was a self-proclaimed fan of kanye . ",
        "or so i thought . i read his interviews . ok . cool . kind of shrugged at the videos . but when i downloaded his first two albums , i still was n't impressed by them . had i fallen for the asch experiment with graduation ? did being in an environment surrounded by people that were positive about the album affect me ? was i really a fan of kanye ? i told myself , `` we 'll see when the next album comes out . '' then he dropped 808 and heartbreaks ... . maybe i 'm just a fan of graduation ... and kanye as a person . "
