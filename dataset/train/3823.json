        "minneapolis -- inside holman field 's historic terminal in downtown st. paul , work crews are frantically putting on finishing touches . they are completing an extensive remodel of a new restaurant , preparing for its grand opening in time for super bowl travelers . mac commissioners were briefed monday on how prepared the airports are , 48 days away from the big game . in the days leading up to the super bowl , minneapolis-st . paul international airport is expecting the arrivals of some 50,000 commercial airline passengers . scheduling arrivals and departures for an additional 1,100 private jets is an even larger challenge , partly because msp can only accommodate the parking for 275 private aircraft . ",
        "`` to accommodate 275 private jets we have to close down one of our runways , '' mac director of operations phil burke told commissioners at a meeting monday . the majority of private aircraft will use ramp space at flying cloud airport in eden prairie , st. paul 's holman field and anoka county airport in blaine . as for foot traffic , the nfl predicts 65,000 passengers will pass through security checkpoints as they depart minnesota on monday , feb. . 5 . that 's nearly 18,000 more than msp 's busiest day on record . `` you can just imagine all those people going through screeners at the airport , '' burke said . ",
        "that 's why the transportation security administration is bringing in extra staff from across the country to bolster the checkpoints . msp airport police will have their own full force of uniformed , plain clothes , canine and tactical officers for a constant presence . `` at a minimum , i want them to see and hopefully have a positive contact with one of our officers , that 's my ultimate goal , '' mac police chief mike everson said . those tactical teams will assist security details for dignitaries and heads of state , but not provide it for visiting celebrities . ",
        "the airports alone are staffing 1671 volunteers to assist all passengers super bowl week .   "
