        "you probably do n't know this but i 've been building the kegs & code brand since 2014 . i do what i can with the time i have since technically kegs & code still a side-hustle . looking back , i 'm amazed with the amount of time i have put into that brand creating the website , launching products , growing the number of stores that carry my products , growing the e-mail list , doing a little bit of social media , taking photos , making videos ... this brand was built from dusk to dawn . ",
        "so many late nights and definitely many early mornings to get kegs & code to where it is today . it hard to consider starting a second company/side-hustle from scratch , why not use the platform i have already built ? well ... long-term success does n't accept shortcuts , that 's why . when i launched the dusk to dawn podcast it was actually called kegs & code podcast . i rationalized that `` of course , they are linked . kegs & code is my side-hustle and the dusk to dawn podcast is all about talking about side-hustles . '' ",
        "that did n't feel right from the beginning but i forced this concept through . instead of creating a whole new website for the podcast , i created a single page under kegs & code . but then i wanted to offer courses down the road , so i created a new kegs & code homepage that would have three options : products , podcast and courses . i was in total denial that all of this was a bad idea . it was a shortcut to hard work . as soon as i launched the first episode of the dusk to dawn podcast i realized that kegs & code was an actual brand . ",
        "people associated kegs & code with beer , wine and design . to introduce a podcast about side-hustle and the early stages of pursuing a dream was like adding soy sauce to chicken parmesan . soy sauce is fine but not with an italian dish . i spent the next 7 days creating a new website , logo , intro , e-mail list and many other things for the podcast . i 'm still not super satisfied with the branding of the podcast , i put together a website so i could start adding the episode posts somewhere . there is definitely a lot i still have to do to get the dusk to dawn podcast to meet my vision requirements hahabut my mind can rest now knowing that i 'm doing the right thing , not the easy thing . ",
        "since now i 'm showing different facets of what i want to create and do , it 's smart to start working on my personal brand as well . `` hey this is lucas , the podcast host and creator of kegs & code . '' to be an avatar for all the things i put out into the world . again , i thought it made sense to have my personal brand attached to the podcast but after talking to a personal branding expert , she told me not to do that . she told me to create my personal brand separate from everything . ",
        "new website , new social media accounts and so on . she went on to tell me that even if i do n't dedicate too much time to those things yet , it 's important to at least have them in place to act like a glue to everything i create and long-term things would n't look so random . if i wanted to create an outdoor brand or product for instance , it could easily go under lucas alcalde . taking action : if you want/like to create stuff , start by creating your personal brand . i did n't do that because i thought i was n't good enough , i did n't feel confident to start lucasalcalde . ",
        "com for instance so i created kegs & code as a standalone company . nothing wrong with that but , being the creative person that i am , it was just a matter of time until i started to venture out and create new things that are not related to beer . now i can easily sell kegs & code for example and still have the kegs & code name attached to my name vs selling that company and sort of losing my identity as an entrepreneur because nobody knew who lucas alcalde is . you can listen to the audio version of this article here if you prefer : -rrb- about the podcasti started the dusk to dawn podcast to share the stories of people who are in the process of building their dreams . ",
        "when i started kegs & code i felt alone . i felt alone because people around me did n't understand my desire to become an entrepreneur . every week i bring on a guest to talk about the behind the scenes of their journey to become an entrepreneur and live life by design . your journey matters and you are not alone . former kegs & code podcastdusk to dawn podcast .
