        "by ernest scheyderhouston , jan 17 - sandridge energy inc plans to meet with activist investor carl icahn on wednesday over his demands for a board shake-up and other governance changes , part of a bid by the u. s. shale oil producer to quell tensions with its largest shareholder and most outspoken critic . icahn said in december he was considering a proxy contest to remove some or all of sandridge 's directors . a week ago , in a letter referencing the wednesday meeting , icahn called on the oklahoma city-based company to replace two directors with one designated by him and the second by other large shareholders . ",
        "the call for board seats came after sandridge terminated a $ 746 million deal to acquire rival bonanza creek energy inc that icahn and other investors said was too expensive and would burden the company with too much debt . `` i 'm not necessarily against the idea of them buying some assets at a good price , but i was adamantly against diluting the shareholders , especially in order to overpay for bonanza , '' icahn said in an interview . the billionaire investor will likely continue his harsh criticism of sandridge chief executive james bennett , who he blasted earlier this month for overseeing `` a period of massive value destruction '' at the company , including a bankruptcy filing . ",
        "`` i do n't mind a ceo making a lot of money if the shareholders have also prospered . but this is certainly not the case here , '' icahn said in the interview . sandridge declined to provide details of its executives ' goals for wednesday 's meeting , but spokesman david kimmel said in a statement that its board and management `` value constructive shareholder dialogue . `` the company has not set a date for its 2018 shareholder meeting nor a deadline for shareholders to submit resolutions for the proxy . the 2017 meeting was held in june . ",
        "icahn , who owns 13.5 percent of the oil company , also has called on directors to remove a so-called poison pill barring individual shareholders from accumulating more than 10 percent of shares . sandridge will meet with other top shareholders in additional to icahn . guggenheim partners investment management and fir tree partners , both of which opposed the bonanza creek deal , did not respond to requests for comment . sandridge executives have been selling their shares . john suter , chief operating officer ; philip warman , sandridge 's top lawyer ; and ceo bennett sold in aggregate more than 400,000 shares since the beginning of the year , according to regulatory filings . ",
        "shares of sandridge fell 1 percent to $ 20.03 in wednesday morning trading .   "
