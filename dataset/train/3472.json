        "a new blood test for cancer has shown promise toward detecting eight different kinds of tumors before they have spread elsewhere in the body , offering hope of early detection , researchers said on thursday . further study is needed before the test -- called cancerseek -- can be made widely available for its projected cost of about $ 500 , said the report in the journal science . the study , led by researchers at johns hopkins university , involved 1,005 patients whose cancer -- already pre-diagnosed based on their symptoms -- was detected with an accuracy rate of about 70 percent overall . ",
        "cancers were detected in the ovaries , liver , stomach , pancreas , esophagus , colorectal , lung and breast . for five of these cancer types -- ovary , liver , stomach , pancreas and esophagus -- there are no screening tests available for people of average risk . the test was able to detect these five with a sensitivity range of 69 to 98 percent . in numbers | cancer in the ukin 83 percent of cases , the test was even able to narrow down where the cancer was anatomically located . the test is noninvasive and based on combined analysis of dna mutations in 16 cancer genes as well as the levels of 10 circulating protein biomarkers . ",
        "`` the ultimate goal of cancerseek is to detect cancer even earlier -- before the disease is symptomatic , '' said the report . outside experts said more research is needed to uncover the true accuracy of the test , and whether it would be able to detect cancers before they cause symptoms . `` this looks promising but with several caveats and a significant amount of further research is needed before we can even contemplate how this might play out in screening settings , '' said mangesh thorat , deputy director of the barts clinical trials unit at queen mary university of london . ",
        "`` the sensitivity of the test in stage i cancer is quite low , about 40 percent , and even with stage i and ii combined it appears to be around 60 percent . so the test will still miss a large proportion of cancers at the stage where we want to diagnose them . `` timeline | cancer breakthoughsnicholas turner , professor of molecular oncology at the institute of cancer research , london , pointed out that the test 's one percent false positive rate may sound low but `` could be quite a concern for population screening . ",
        "there could be a lot of people who are told they have cancer , who may not have it . `` however , turner described the paper as `` a step along the way to a possible blood test to screen for cancer , and the data presented is convincing from a technical perspective on the blood test . `` many other efforts are under way to develop blood tests for cancer . `` i do not think that this new test has really moved the field of early detection very far forward , '' said paul pharoah , professor of cancer epidemiology at the university of cambridge . ",
        "`` it remains a promising , but yet to be proven technology . ''   "
