        "if you think you owe a lot of money on your credit card , you 're not alone . among u. s. households who have credit card debt , the average balance is somewhere in the ballpark of $ 16,000 . ouch . of course , racking up credit card debt automatically means losing money to interest charges so clearly it 's not the sort of thing you want to do . but interest aside , having too high a balance could negatively impact your credit score by driving up your credit utilization ratio . and that could take a long time to recover from . ",
        "to appreciate the relationship between credit card balances and credit scores , you 'll need to understand how credit scores are calculated in the first place .   ",
        "there are five different factors that go into establishing a credit score , some of which carry more weight than others : payment history , which refers to your ability to pay your bills on timecredit utilization ratio , which is the percentage of available credit you 're using at a given point in timelength of credit history , which is the amount of time you 've had your credit accounts opennew credit accounts , which is the number of accounts you open within a limited time framecredit mix , which speaks to the various types of credit accounts you holdas you can see , of the above factors , payment and history and credit utilization carry the most weight .",
        "but while having a high credit card balance wo n't necessarily hurt your payment history , a high balance could send your credit utilization ratio into unfavorable territory . your credit utilization ratio refers to the percentage of available credit you 're using up . for this number to help your credit score , it needs to stay at or below 30 % . on the other hand , a higher ratio can hurt your score . now here 's another scenario to look at . imagine you owe $ 2,000 on your credit cards , but your total line of credit is just $ 5,000 . ",
        "in this case , you 'd be looking at a credit utilization ratio of 40 % , which is problematic . in other words , when we consider the impact of a credit card balance on a credit score , it 's not just a matter of the amount owed . rather , it 's a function of that balance combined with the borrower 's total line of credit . even though you , as a consumer , might prefer to owe $ 2,000 on your cards than $ 3,000 , in the above examples , owing $ 3,000 on a $ 10,000 limit is better than owing $ 2,000 on a $ 5,000 limit strictly from a credit score perspective . ",
        "no matter what you consider a `` high '' credit card balance , the sooner you work on paying it off , the lower your credit utilization ratio is going to drop . and that could be just the thing to boost your credit score . so if , for instance , you 're doing well in the other four categories that go into a credit score , and you pay off enough of your balance to bring your credit utilization ratio down from 40 % to 30 % , you 're going to see your score go up . ",
        "it 's that simple . of course , it could very well be the case that paying down your balance does n't do all that much for your credit score . if you have a very high total line of credit -- say , $ 20,000 -- and you only owe $ 4,000 on your cards , knocking that balance down to $ 3,500 may not have as significant an impact on your score . but that does n't mean you should n't work on paying it off . quite the contrary -- the sooner you do , the less money you 'll end up throwing away on interest . ",
        "and that 's reason enough to work on getting out of debt , even if it does n't actually impact your credit score all that much . the motley fool has a disclosure policy .   "
