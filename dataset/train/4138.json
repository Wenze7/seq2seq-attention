        "milan -- inter milan 's undefeated start to the season was brought to an unlikely end on saturday with the serie a leader defeated 3-1 at home by udinese . inter captain mauro icardi had canceled out kevin lasagna 's opener but udinese put in an impressive second-half performance and took the lead through rodrigo de paul 's penalty before antonin barak sealed the result . napoli , which is a point behind inter , can reclaim top spot with a victory at torino later . roma also plays cagliari later . udinese moved 10 points clear of the relegation zone as its revival under new coach massimo oddo continued . ",
        "oddo has won three league matches after losing to napoli in his opening game . udinese took the lead in the 14th minute when silvan widmer cut inside from the right , dribbled in the area and rolled the ball across for lasagna to tap in . however , inter was back on level terms within a minute as icardi volleyed home antonio candreva 's cross . inter dominated the rest of the first half and came close to taking the lead on several occasions but oddo turned things around at the break , and it was udinese which was stronger in the second period . ",
        "the visitors almost took the lead immediately after the restart but inter goalkeeper samir handanovic somehow managed to deflect lasagna 's effort over the bar from point-blank range . icardi also came close to doubling his tally but he headed a corner over the bar . minutes later udinese was awarded a penalty for handball -- after video review showed the ball had not crossed the line before widmer 's cross was handled by davide santon . de paul sent his spot-kick straight down the middle to give udinese the lead in the 61st . milan skriniar almost leveled shortly after but his header came off the bar . ",
        "udinese wrapped up all three points 13 minutes from time when barak finished off a brilliant counterattack by heading in jakub jankto 's cross .   "
