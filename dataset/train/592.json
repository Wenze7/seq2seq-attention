        "until today that is ! by kevin didonato ms , cscs , ces -- level 1 precision nutrition certified and certified personal trainerthere are a lot of oils out there that are great for your health . for example , omega-3 fatty acids , have been shown to improve a whole host of cells and organs in your body including your brain , eyes , and heart . now , take coconuts and coconut oil . many people have deemed this product bad due to the high levels of saturated fat that make up its fat content . but , would you believe , coconut oil may be one of the best oils out there for improving health -- and shedding a pound or two . ",
        "the truth about coconut oilas previously mentioned , the majority of the fat found in coconut oil is saturated fat -- almost 90 percent of it . and , from what you have heard , saturated fat is a no-no when it comes to better heart health . but , would n't you know it , the saturated fat in coconut oil is actually good for you ! take a minute to catch your breath ... the fat in coconut oil is mainly lauric acid , which is a medium-chain triglyceride . this is important for two reasons . reason # 1 : lauric acid is not stored by your bodysince lauric acid is a medium-chain triglyceride , it is rarely stored by your body . ",
        "in fact , this fat is mainly broken down in the liver , meaning it is used for energy and not packed into your hips , butt , or thighs . adding in a tablespoon or two of coconut oil -- along with a healthy diet -- may actually lead to better overall weight loss . reason # 2 : coconut oil is important for heart healthas you know , controlling your cholesterol and monitoring your triglyceride levels are necessary for improving your overall heart health . and guess what ? coconut oil has been linked to lower heart disease rates and improvements in cholesterol . ",
        "this is one reason why coconut oil is great for better heart health . but , the benefits do not stop there ! in fact , depending on the type of oil you get , you may find it contains a whole host of antioxidants and polyphenols . these powerful nutrients are great for lowering inflammation and fighting off the damage caused by free radicals . what kind should you look for ? the best kind of coconut oil out there would be extra virgin . this type of oil contains more potent antioxidants and has a much stronger flavor . ",
        "or , you could try refined coconut oil ! this type of oil is milder in flavor , but still provides some of the antioxidants and plenty of lauric acid that makes this oil appealing . but , be warned . not all coconut oil is made the same . some companies may use harmful chemicals to make their oil , so be sure to do your background work . the hottest oil on the marketalthough there are a lot of oils that you can cook with there is one oil that is slowly making its way to the top of the list . ",
        "coconut oil -- which is 90 percent saturated fat -- has been shown to improve heart health , lower cholesterol , and reduce inflammation levels in your body . the main fat -- lauric acid -- is easily metabolized by your liver , so it is not stored by your body . if you 're looking for a new alternative oil -- one that contains healthy fats -- to cook with , then you should give coconut oil a try in some of your favorite recipes .
