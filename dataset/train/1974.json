        "sponsored : presented by astonfraud is rampant . for example , health care fraud in the u. s. is in the tens of billions of dollars , according to various estimates , and that number is growing . while cutting elsewhere , the trump administration requested $ 70 million to combat health care fraud in its latest budget , based on the drag on the economy . `` a large hospital creates more than a million sensitive medical documents each month , '' says seungki kim , ceo at aston , a blockchain company focusing on document storage and verification . ",
        "`` the documents are vulnerable to tampering , which can lead to fraud . there are also many nearly-identical versions of documents , which can cause confusion and lead to medical errors . a new form of blockchain technology is the answer . the cure for fraudwhile harvard business review breathlessly announced `` the blockchain will do to the financial system what the internet did to media , '' and the wall street journal proclaimed , `` the blockchain is the internet of money '' blockchain 's potential extends far beyond finance . aston 's initial aim is to use blockchain for document verification , which is the first step to stamping out health care fraud . ",
        "aston allows hospitals to issue and confirm medical documents electronically on smartphones and tablets . each new version of a document is immutably recorded to a secure blockchain , eliminating opportunities for documents to be stolen , manipulated or lost . `` as we move toward decentralized networks for information storage , we also need decentralized document authentication to ensure our documents are legitimate , '' kim said . `` that 's our end game . '' so far aston 's technology is being used at cha hospital and hallym university hospital , two of korea 's largest and most reputable health care centers . ",
        "it 's also being used by nh bank , one of korea 's major financial institutions , and coinlink , a cryptocurrency exchange . blockchain 's flaw -- and its fixthe basic principle behind blockchain is often also its greatest weakness . every few seconds , blockchain transactions are verified and recorded by thousands of computers around the world . sometimes the system can get bogged down . `` transactions on the linear blockchains that power bitcoin and ethereum ca n't be done in real time , '' kim says . `` the storage size and computing power required for blockchain-based transactions are enormous . ",
        "blockchain is still usable for cryptocurrency transactions , but bottlenecks are holding the technology back from its full potential . '' aston has made a technological leap called x-chain , which makes distributed applications like blockchain-based document verification feasible . the multidimensional solutionaston 's x-chain is a multi-dimensional blockchain that reduces the total chain size by up to 70 percent and reduces the verification time exponentially . with x-chain , every time a new document is created , a corresponding genesis block is added to the chain . an upgrade from linear blockchains , x-chain documents have their own individual blocks , rather than being lumped in with others . ",
        "when documents are modified , their blocks sprout sub-chains , containing all of the document-specific changes . verifying documents is much faster on aston 's x-chain because only the blocks related to that document need to be examined , and those blocks are much smaller in size than those created with existing technologies . `` using a linear blockchain for document storage means you have to go on a scavenger hunt every time you access the file to reassemble all of the pieces . with x-chain it 's more like going into a well-organized filing cabinet stored in a bank vault , '' said aston 's kim . ",
        "aston has seen early success in korea , where most of their team members are based . the country , which is home to three of the top five cryptocurrency exchanges , and leads the world in terms of trading volume in ethereum , was quick to embrace and adopt blockchain technology . aston just launched its public token sale on december 11 . to learn more about how x-chain technology is eliminating fraud across industries , and the company 's public token sale , visit the aston website . sponsored posts are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with venturebeat , and they 're always clearly marked .
