        "a few months ago , gary shilling called bitcoin a black box . he said he does n't invest in things he does n't understand and for this reason he would avoid what is currently the premier cryptocurrency on the market . for all the name calling financial thought leaders have indulged in whilst describing the phenomenon , i found this to be one of the most respectable even if most humble answers given yet . bitcoin is difficult to understand . jameson lopp made a sound argument this past march for the idea that no one really understands bitcoin . ",
        "such an undertaking after all does require an artfully crafted intersection of topics including cryptography , computer networking , data transmission , economic theory , monetary theory , and game theory . any one of these topics independently worthy of an entire life of study . this is what makes bitcoin such an awesome subject of interest . i 've always seen my time spent studying bitcoin as always something worth so much more than its price on any given day . all this having been said , i also believe it can be said that one may not fully understand bitcoin . ",
        "one can , however , seek to understand bitcoin enough . one can read chris burniske and jack tatar 's wonderfully well-researched and objective analysis laid out in cryptoassets among other books on the subject . one can listen to countless hours of andreas antonopoulos speaking on the topic on youtube or other podcasts . there is essentially limitless material on the internet available to the curious but ideally skeptic consumer regarding bitcoin . there are concrete facts that can be said about bitcoin . bitcoin is not a fraud . it is not a ponzi scheme and it is not a tulip . ",
        "bitcoin is a useful financial tool with great applications today in the realm of remittances and digital asset storage as well as many more to come . it makes us question how we communicate , distribute , and quantify value . bitcoin may be a kind of collective delusion but then again , so is today 's us dollar in many ways as well as the idea that the martian was the best comedy of 2015 . bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme . bitcoin is a decentralized , easily divisible unit of account based in a public , transparent blockchain ledger that can be only be modified primarily by way of cryptographic mining/mathematical consensus . ",
        "i hope i 've made the case for bitcoin as something not to be written off or completely understood but rather as something to be interested in , studied , and discussed . i look forward to further engaging the phenomenon at next month 's north american bitcoin conference and i look forward to the future that will be made better with the advent of satoshi nakamoto 's bitcoin . disclosure : i am/we are long btc core .
