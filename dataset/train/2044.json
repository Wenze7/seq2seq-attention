        "years ago , someone stole my credit-card info . i did what you 're supposed to do when that happens : call my bank , cancel the card , request a new one . when i later mentioned my stolen card to a co-worker , he cut me off mid-sentence to insist i do three things immediately : call my bank , cancel the card , request a new one . `` i had n't thought of that , '' i told him . unfortunately , i was too soft-spoken for my reply to register as sarcasm -- even though i 've had plenty of practice in this particular situation . ",
        "in spite of my age and experience , i seem to be a magnet for unsolicited advice that is often obvious and sometimes flat-out wrong . you know that frustrating feeling when tech support asks if you 've tried turning it on and off ? that 's my life . it 's the quiet person 's ongoing struggle : unlike our more extroverted counterparts , we 're typically more reserved and better listeners , which may give the impression that we need help making up our minds . `` someone may assume a shy person needs input or is looking for help with something . ",
        "they may offer unsolicited advice because they assume the individual is too shy to ask for their opinion , '' says amy morin , a psychotherapist and the author of 13 things mentally strong people do n't do . `` people may also think a quiet person does n't have an opinion , so they may offer unsolicited advice as a way to give them ideas . '' there 's also something more sinister going on : `` unsolicited advice may be an attempt at dominance , '' morin says . `` telling someone what to do or how to do things differently sends a message that says , ` i know more than you . ' '' ",
        "unsurprisingly , gender dynamics often play a role . in a 1987 university of pennsylvania study examining the relationship between the way people talk and their likelihood of doling out unsolicited advice , the authors noted that in general , the women in the study were `` more polite , '' using speech patterns that indicated weakness and uncertainty . men , on the other hand , were more likely to use assertive speech patterns . they were also more likely to give unsolicited advice . the researchers reported that `` gender does not come into conflict with that of status for female students . ",
        "however , gender not only conflicts with status and speech situations involving male students , but in fact overrides it . this results in first-year male students giving unsolicited advice to a female of higher status . '' the disappointing bottom line is , if you do n't speak assertively , people tend to assume they 're more knowledgeable or experienced than you are , even if you have rank . `` if the shy person seems indecisive , or is stumbling on his or her words , it may seem like an open door for others to jump in with their opinions , '' says public speaking coach amy castro . ",
        "`` body language that looks hesitant , weak , or helpless can also cause the advice givers of the world to feel it 's their duty to step in and take control of the situation . '' it 's easy to see how this could become a real problem -- like if you 're an introverted or shy person in a high position of power , for example , and have a dominant , extroverted subordinate who mistakenly thinks you do n't know what you 're doing and undermines you . even if it 's just a simple frustration , though , unsolicited advice is just that -- frustrating . ",
        "here are a few tips for how to handle it when you 're constantly on the receiving end . do n't take it personally . sometimes , castro says , the advice giver is talking simply to reinforce his or her own intelligence or competence ; they need any set of ears to listen to them , and yours happened to be available . this is why shy people often become a target for unsolicited advice from family members and friends : `` because these people know the shy person well , they know he or she will be unlikely to contradict the advice or fight the advice-giving , '' says castro . ",
        "or they may be projecting . when i was 22 , for example , an older friend had been on a series of bad dates and urged me to settle down as soon as possible . the dating pool was a shallow one , he said ; it was n't hard to see that his advice was more about his own frustrations . `` what 's funny about those who give unsolicited advice is that they are less concerned about the advice being followed than they are about having their say , '' castro added -- a vent disguised as helpful instructions . ",
        "when you realize that the advice is n't about you at all , the situation becomes a little easier to stomach . recognize when it 's actually coming from a good place . not all unsolicited advice is bad . a stranger once told me my tire looked a little low , for example . i had no idea , and even though i had n't asked , i was grateful for the input . `` it 's important to take a few minutes to think about advice before automatically following it or instinctively tuning it out , '' morin suggested . ",
        "`` examine the person 's motivation in giving you that advice . '' is it genuine concern , or is it a display of authority ? in her communication programs , castro suggests asking the following additional questions to help people weed out good advice from bad , whether it 's solicited or not : is the advice giver qualified to offer the advice ? have you heard the same advice before ? is the advice factual , or just opinion ? and finally , what are the consequences of taking , or not taking , the advice ? `` once we 've asked ourselves these questions , it usually becomes more clear about whether the advice is good and we should follow it , whether it is bad advice , or whether it 's just not helpful or useful at this time , '' castro says . ",
        "move on quickly . those who routinely give unsolicited advice , castro says , probably do n't expect and definitely do n't want you to challenge them , or to point out that their advice is unwarranted or wrong . especially if you 're normally a soft-spoken person , this confrontation can be surprising for the advice giver and uncomfortable for you . which is why it 's understandable that you might want to just end the encounter as quickly and painlessly as possible . it 's easy enough to nod and smile , diplomatically thank the person for their two cents , then do with it what you will , even if that means ignoring it . ",
        "`` one of the easiest responses to give that will end the conversation quickly is to simply say , ` you may be right , ' and then move on , '' castro suggests . `` this noncommittal response will appease the advice giver , while not giving away your power because you 're not saying that you accept the advice as correct or will take any action on the advice . '' shut it down . the problem is that the get-it-over-with tactic does n't do much to change the behavior of people who do n't take you seriously or ca n't seem to mind their own business . ",
        "if you want a slightly more direct approach , you can acknowledge the person 's advice and tell them you wo n't be taking it . castro suggests something like , `` that 's an option , but i think my plan will work just as well '' or `` thanks . if i need help or any advice , i 'll be sure to come see you . '' but if your goal is to really put an end to a pattern of unsolicited advice , you may need to let the person know more clearly that you do n't want any more of it . ",
        "`` if you choose this option , be sure to respond calmly , firmly , kindly , and without sarcasm , '' castro says . she suggests saying something like , `` i understand you 're trying to help , but i 'm comfortable with the way i 'm doing x. i 'd rather not talk about other options again '' or simply , `` thank you , but i do n't need advice . '' morin says the key is to respond in a way that maintains your own personal power : `` do n't follow someone else 's advice unless you want to do so . ",
        "manage your emotions so you do n't lose your cool , '' she tells me . `` regulate your own thoughts so you do n't automatically assume someone else 's opinion is more valid than your opinion . '' that 's just good advice .   "
