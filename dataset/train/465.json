        "your boss is terrorizing you -- but not in the way that 's been making headlines lately . no shoulder rubs , risqu√© jokes or meetings in hotels . instead , the boss is yelling . dumping work on you . constantly criticizing . in a 2017 survey from the workplace bullying institute ,19 % of respondents said they experienced workplace bullying -- and a whopping 61 % of bullies were bosses . `` for some reason at work we say ` well , they 're adults anyway , let them take care of themselves , ' '' says institute director gary namie . ",
        "`` we need employers to be as afraid of as they 're supposed to be afraid of sexual harassment . '' the institute defines bullying as `` repeated mistreatment of an employee . '' namie says `` boss bullies '' usually take four different forms : throwing temper tantrums , critiquing performance non-stop , withholding resources or spreading gossip to tarnish your reputation . surviving any of these bullies is n't easy . below , some tips on getting started . dismantle the myth the bully wants the employees to blame themselves -- to think they 're targeted because of laziness , poor performance or ineptitude . ",
        "but bullies often target the best workers , namie says . `` shame comes from that worthlessness , so bullies are always trying to put that on people , '' namie says . `` but they 're just the wizard of oz ... it 's just we rarely have toto to pull the curtain back . '' confide in someone telling your story is an important step before taking action , says stacy tye-williams , an assistant professor of communications studies and english at iowa state university . victims often report feeling isolated , confused or ashamed -- just as the bully intended . ",
        "`` being validated is huge , '' she says . `` they just want people to tell them they 're not nuts . '' telling a confidante helps the victim feel less alone , according to tye-williams , and also gives them the feeling of agency over the experience -- a feeling they 'll need when they 're planning next steps . `` work through what 's happening , because otherwise it 's very difficult to come up with an action plan if you yourself have n't come to terms or made sense of these different dynamics , '' she says . ",
        "make an action plan there are different paths out of the situation : confronting the boss , reporting the incident , or even changing jobs . the important thing is to not feel powerless . all of these bullying behaviors , namie says , are about control . the boss wants to control the workplace , the employees and even people 's perceptions of their targets . according to research from ben tepper , a professor of management at the ohio state university , some employees can find success fighting back , to wrest that control from the bully -- it helps them fight that sense of victimization . ",
        "`` people who have been targets of boss hostility are more likely feel victimized , which in turn leads to negative outcomes , '' tepper says . `` people are less likely to experience that sense of victimization if they engage in hostility of their own . '' that does n't mean matching the boss scream for scream . instead , it means beating the bullies at their own games : forcing a conversation , proving the bully wrong , refusing to do the extra work they assigned , etc. . but according to tye-williams , the best path is `` collective resistance '' -- finding another employee and going to report the problem together . ",
        "`` one voice is easy to discount in silence , but when you have multiple people all coming together , that tends to be the best way to go about it , '' she says . `` but that 's really hard , to generate the kind of support necessary . in those situations , everyone is putting themselves on a line .
