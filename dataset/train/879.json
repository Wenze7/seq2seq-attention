        "everything in life you believe you can get , you get . this is a pattern throughout life . think about it . you wanted a game console ? you got it . you wanted a car ? a house ? sure thing . boyfriend/girlfriend ? yup ! a job ? you got it . now , this is not to say that everyone has these things . oh no ! you only have what you believe in your heart you can attain . some may call these things manageable -- well , that 's exactly why you believed you could attain them . ",
        "and because of this belief , you got them . the circumstances of others ' may make it difficult for them to believe they can attain much , so , they do not . consider this concept and i think you 'll find most things will fall in line with it . when you encounter a challenge in life , you have two options in terms of how to approach it : option a -rrb- recognize the difficulty and improbability of success , and give in to the idea of impossibility . option b -rrb- recognize the difficulty , analyze what needs to be done in order to succeed , and act . ",
        "we need to work with the idea of possibility . successful people rarely live statistically sensible lives . this is one of my favorite lines ! success is a conscious decision , not a mathematical outcome . people of achievement have chosen to view challenges from the perspective of what makes them achievable , not from what makes them difficult . we need to look only at what we require to succeed . knowing this , we can simplify the two choices we have when faced with a challenge : option a -rrb- impossible . not doable . option b -rrb- possible . ",
        "doable . the action centers of the brain rely on the instructions you give to them . if you believe something is unattainable , your brain will not fight you on this , and you will not attain . conversely , when you think of something you believe you can get , your brain immediately starts to chart a course towards its achievement . depending on whether you choose option a or option b , you 're sending the message to your brain , and corresponding action will follow . long ago , it was widely believed to be impossible that a human could run a four-minute mile . ",
        "that was , until may of 1954 , when roger bannister was the first man to do it . the second man to do it ? june of 1954 -- a month later . since then , thousands of people have done it . teenagers have done it . woah ! what changed ? our belief changed . once the world realized that running that fast could be done , and once we believed we could do it , it was repeated endlessly . this is a beautiful illustration of this article 's message . we often base what we believe we can accomplish on what others have done before us . ",
        "countless people throughout history have risen to success despite difficult circumstances , from all walks of life . knowing this , there should be no reason you could not emulate their track . there is no reason you could not , despite your own difficult circumstances , rise above and on to succeed as others before you have . if you believe you can do a thing , you can do it . i 'm not talking about whimsical wishes . i 'm talking about unwavering , conscious belief that you can do something , go somewhere , or be someone . ",
        "if you do have this belief , there is but little that could obstruct your path to achievement . it starts with a decision that you make , a vision that you have . use belief as your starting point . mark trattmark tratt . www . theodysseyonline . com .   "
