        "top executives at uber used the encrypted chat app wickr to hold secret conversations , current and former workers testified in court this week , setting up what could be the first major legal test of the issues raised by the use of encrypted apps inside companies . the revelations tuesday and wednesday about the extensive use of wickr inside uber upended the high-stakes legal showdown with alphabet 's waymo unit , which accuses the ride-hailing firm of stealing its self-driving car secrets . apps such as wickr , signal , telegram , confide and snapchat offer security and anonymity , with features including passcodes to open messages and automatic deletion of all copies of a message after as little as a few seconds . ",
        "there is nothing inherently unlawful about instructing employees to use disappearing messaging apps , said timothy heaphy , a lawyer at hunton & williams and a former u. s. attorney in virginia . however , companies have an obligation to preserve records that may be reasonably seen as relevant to litigation or that fall under data retention rules set by industry regulators . in uber 's situation , chat logs that could help get to the bottom of the trade secrets case are now inaccessible . uber also faces a criminal investigation over the alleged theft . `` it 's a knotty question for courts and lawyers on when the obligation arises '' to preserve records , said julia brickell , general counsel at the legal discovery firm h5 . ",
        "but `` if someone uses a communication device to specifically hide information from litigation because you knew it would result in litigation , that would be foul from the start . '' richard jacobs , a security analyst whom uber fired in april and now consults for the company , testified tuesday that up to dozens of employees were trained to used ephemeral messaging systems , including wickr , to communicate so that their conversations would be clandestine and could not surface in any `` anticipated litigation . '' two officials still at uber testified wednesday that multiple teams used wickr . ",
        "among the users , they said , was anthony levandowski , a one-time leader of waymo 's autonomous vehicle efforts who the company alleges brought trade secrets to uber . wickr key evidence it is unclear when uber began using wickr , but the company said that in october of last year it began paying for a business version that gave it the ability to preserve messages for as long as a year instead of a maximum of six days . while the contents of an individual user 's wickr account would be impossible to access without the account-holder 's permission , the business version gives the company the ability see whatever information has not been automatically erased . ",
        "in the middle of the contentious court hearing tuesday , uber chief executive dara khosrowshahi tweeted : `` true that wickr , telegram were used often at uber when i came in . as of sept 27th i directed my teams not to use such apps when discussing uber-related business . '' u. s. district judge william alsup opened the pre-trial hearing by admonishing attorneys that counsel in future cases can be `` found in malpractice '' if they do not turn over evidence from specialized communications tools . an app such as wickr `` could be a way for levandowski to communicate ` by the way , how did we do that back at waymo ? ' ",
        "and all that vanishes in 30 seconds , '' alsup said . `` to me it 's plausible that it happened . and the evidence is gone now . because it was an intentionally set up system to not leave a paper trail . '' federal civil court guidelines enable judges to tell jurors that they can presume that information covered up by a litigant and now missing would have been negative for that party , brickell said . such a declaration could hurt uber , as its primary defense has been that waymo has turned up no concrete evidence of the trade-secret theft . ",
        "now , waymo can claim that such evidence was simply deleted . `` that they were so concerned about covering things up meant that they could have known what they were doing was a crime , '' said nick akerman , a lawyer at dorsey & whitney and a former federal prosecutor in manhattan . `` to me , that 's very powerful evidence . '' andy wilson , chief executive of forensics software maker logikcull , said it is already common for companies to search for usage of encrypted apps or deleted messages when conducting internal investigations . he said his company 's program is used by salesforce . ",
        "com and other businesses to scan emails and chat messages . emails showing a user signed up for a service such as signal or telegram are held against them in internal investigations , he said , as are records showing a text was deleted . `` it 's a huge win for because it shows ill-intent '' on the part of the subject of the investigation , wilson said .
