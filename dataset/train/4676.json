        "seoul - south korean president moon jae in said on wednesday he is willing to meet north korean counterpart kim jong un `` under the right conditions , '' a day after breakthrough talks between the two sides . he would agree to a meeting if there were prospects for `` tangible results , '' moon said at a press conference , adding that avoiding another war and a korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons were his main goals . the announcement came a day after talks which saw officials on both sides agree to key steps for reconciliation , including pursuing further bilateral talks , which moon also emphasized . ",
        "moon welcomed the resumption of inter-korean dialogue but stressed that his country will continue to work with the international community to `` de-nuclearize '' his northern neighbour . speaking at his first press conference of the new year in seoul , moon said his country has no plans to ease sanctions on north korea against the will of the international community . `` now the dialogue with north korea has begun , but because the north korean nuclear issue has not been resolved , south korea will continue to keep pace with the pressure and sanctions by the international community , '' moon said . ",
        "`` we have no plans to ease our unilateral sanctions against north korea that are in place in addition to international sanctions for now , '' he added . on tuesday , both sides agreed on the north 's participation in next month 's pyeongchang winter olympics , an easing of military tensions and the active pursuit of bilateral talks . north korea is expected to send 400 to 500 people for the games , yonhap news agency cited prime minister lee nak yon as saying . both sides still need to clear up the details . the largest delegation that north korea has ever sent to its southern neighbour for a sporting event was more than 600 people . ",
        "in addition to athletes and support staff , 300 fans travelled to south korea from the north for the 2002 asia games in busan , south korea . the deal came as pyongyang reopened a military hotline with seoul which had remained dormant since february 2016 . analysts say north korean leader kim jong un 's attempt to restore dialogue with seoul could be a gambit intended to drive a wedge between south korea and the united states . the two koreas remain in a technical state of war . the 1950-53 korean war ended with a ceasefire , but no peace deal was signed .
