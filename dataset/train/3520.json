        "the international monetary fund on thursday recommended india strengthen the independence of its central bank and bolster resources for its financial system regulators amid a bad debt pile-up at public banks . indian banks have some of the highest levels of debt of any emerging market , with the bulk of bad loans saddled in public-sector lending institutions . this debt burden means that banks have been stretched too thin to lend for fresh investments , holding back growth in asia 's third-largest economy . the imf -- in its annual assessment of the stability of india 's financial system -- said these conditions are testing the resilience of banks . ",
        "larger lenders appear sturdy but `` the system is subject to considerable vulnerabilities '' , the imf said in its report . in particular , a `` group of public sector banks are highly vulnerable to further declines in asset quality '' , it added . the imf said despite considerable progress there was scope for improving oversight of the financial sector , including in regards to the independence of reserve bank of india . `` notably , these include strengthening the rbi 's de jure independence as well as its powers '' over the public sector banks and `` expanding other financial regulators ' resources '' , the imf said . ",
        "the government has been urging the central bank to cut interest rates to encourage investment . the bank has been reluctant to do so , fearing that reducing rates -- already at a seven-year low of six percent -- could stoke inflation . india 's trouble with its sour debt hit national headlines last year when beer and airline tycoon vijay mallya fled to the uk to avoid paying nearly $ 1 billion in loans he owed banks . in may , the government gave the central bank greater powers to intervene in cases of bad loans , and to order lenders to deal with their debts under bankruptcy laws . ",
        "in october it announced a $ 32 billion recapitalisation plan for state-owned banks to help them clean up their books and revive investment as india 's $ 2 trillion economy slowed . the imf welcomed these steps but urged india to go further to improve the governance of public banks and avoid a future mounting of stressed assets .
