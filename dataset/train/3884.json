        "authored by wolf richter via wolfstreet . com , oops , they 're already rising . the us government bond market has further soured this week , with treasuries selling off across the spectrum . when bond prices fall , yields rise . for example , the two-year treasury yield rose to 2.06 % on friday , the highest since september 2008 . in the chart , note the determined spike of 79 basis points since september 8 , 2017 . that was the month when the fed announced the highly telegraphed details of its qe unwind . september as the month of the qe-unwind announcement keeps cropping up . ",
        "all kinds of things began to happen , at first quietly , without drawing much attention . but then the trajectory just kept going . the three-year yield , which had gone nowhere for the first eight months of 2017 , rose to 2.20 % on friday , the highest since october 1 , 2008 . it has spiked 82 basis points since september 8 : the ten-year yield -- the benchmark for financial markets that most influences us mortgage rates -- jumped to 2.66 % late friday . this is particularly interesting because the 10-year yield had declined from march 2017 into august despite the fed 's three rate hikes last year , and rising short-term yields . ",
        "at 2.66 % , the 10-year yield has reached its highest level since april 2014 , when the `` taper tantrum '' was winding down . that taper tantrum was the bond market 's way of saying `` we 're shocked and appalled , '' when chairman bernanke dropped hints the fed might eventually begin tapering what the market had called `` qe infinity . '' the 10-year yield has now doubled since the historic intraday low on july 7 , 2016 of 1.32 % : friday capped four weeks of pain in the treasury market . but it has not impacted yet the corporate bond market , and the spread in yields between treasuries and corporate bonds , and particularly junk bonds , has further narrowed . ",
        "and it has not yet impacted the stock market , and there has been no adjustment in the market 's risk pricing yet . but it has impacted the mortgage market . on friday , the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with conforming loan balances for top-tier borrowers , according to mortgage news daily , ended at 4.23 % , the highest in nine months . but historically , 4.25 % is still very low . and likely just the beginning of a long , uneven climb higher . and the impact on mortgage payments can be sizable . when rates rise for example from 3.5 % to 4.5 % , the payment for a $ 250,000 mortgage jumps by $ 144 to $ 1,267 a month . ",
        "this can move the payment out of reach for households that have trouble making ends meet . a one-percentage-point increase takes on larger proportions in a place like san francisco , where it might take a mortgage of $ 1.25 million to buy a median home . at 3.5 % , the monthly payment is $ 5,613 . at 4.5 % , it jumps to $ 6,334 , an increase of $ 721 a month and an increase of $ 8,652 a year . a mortgage rate of 4.5 % is still very low ! and it is likely headed higher . ",
        "since the financial crisis , the ultra-low mortgage rates were among the factors that have caused home prices to soar . but as rates are heading higher , the housing market is in for a big rethink . these higher rates are going to be applied to the now prevailing sky-high home prices . this will come in addition to the rethink triggered by what the new tax law will do to the housing market . there 's another aspect to this equation : homebuyers who are willing and able to stretch to cough up those higher mortgage payments ca n't spend this money on other things . ",
        "falling mortgage rates gave a huge boost to home prices and to the entire economy in numerous ways . but that process will go into reverse . so where will it go from here ? the 10-year yield is still historically low and has a lot of catching up to do with regards to the trajectory of shorter-term yields . in addition , the fed will continue to push its buttons -- gradually hiking its target range for the federal funds rate and proceeding with its `` balance sheet normalization . '' and as the 10-year yield rises , mortgage rates will respond , and housing bubble 2 will get a lot more costly to deal with . ",
        "even the bond market 's inflation expectations now exceed the fed 's target . read ... bond market smells inflation , begins to react .   "
