        "by dave thomas . with so much to play for , the los angeles chargers could have easily overlooked the 0-11 cleveland browns when they limped into the greater los angeles area sunday to play the bolts . despite looking sluggish at times , the chargers came away with their sixth win in the last eight games , scoring a 19-10 victory over the still winless browns . after scoring a combined 82 points in their last two games , the chargers could only muster 19 on this day . that said , it was more than enough to beat a team that very well could go 0-16 this season when all is said and done . ",
        "in beating the browns , the chargers mainly relied on their stingy defense to get the job done . going against a rookie qb in deshone kizer did n't hurt , either . when this game was over , kizer had been held to a mere 10-of-22 passing for 114 yards and one td . so , with their third straight win , the chargers now prepare to host washington next sunday before heading out on the road for games with kansas city and the new york jets , respectively . offense : b - . there was really nothing overly exciting about the los angeles offense on this early december afternoon . ",
        "quarterback philip rivers went 31-of-43 for 344 yards and one score . the los angeles rushing attack failed to put together any sparkling numbers , with starting back melvin gordon tallying 77 yards on 19 carries . through the air , wide receiver keenan allen continued his tear in recent weeks , catching 10 balls for 105 yards and a score . defense : a -- . after holding dallas to a mere six points on thanksgiving day , the chargers were equally up to the task against the worst team in the league . cleveland hurt itself too with turnovers , including an interception by adrian philips in the final two minutes to ice the victory for the bolts . ",
        "leading the way for los angeles on this day would be joey bosa , desmond king and jahleel addae . special teams : b -- . with starting placekicker nick novak still out nursing a bad back , the bolts had to turn to travis coons to handle the kicking duties . all coons did on this day was connect on all four field goal attempts and an extra point . although this game was n't the closest one the chargers have played this season , being able to hit extra points and possibly even game-winning field goals down the stretch of december could prove huge . ",
        "for now , coons handles such duties . coaching : a -- . enough ca n't be said about the job rookie head coach anthony lynn has done this season . sure , the chargers are only sitting at . 500 with a 6-6 record . that said , they could have easily gone in the tank after beginning the season 0-4 . lynn held the team together despite that horrific start . the reward now is a three-way tie for first in the afc west with kansas city and oakland . in head-to-head meetings , los angeles lost to kansas city , while beating oakland . ",
        "the chargers will get both teams one more time before the month is out . up next : . los angeles hosts washington before it returns to an afc slate of games to finish the season . the redskins are sitting at 5-7 , having lost to arch-rival dallas 38-14 in their last game . washington leads the all-time series with los angeles 7-3 . the two last met in 2013 , with washington winning 30-24 in overtime .
