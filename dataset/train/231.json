        "-- congressional republicans delivered an epic overhaul of u. s. tax laws to president donald trump on wednesday , bringing generous tax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest americans while providing smaller cuts for middle - and low-income families . in a re-vote due to a last-minute hiccup , the house passed the massive $ 1.5 trillion tax package that affects everyone 's taxes but is dominated by breaks for business and higher earners . democrats call the legislation a boon to the rich that leaves middle-class and working americans behind . the vote was 224-201 and came hours after the senate 's early morning passage along party-lines . ",
        "it is the first major overhaul of the nation 's tax laws since 1986 . on twitter and in white house remarks , trump hailed the outcome , his own efforts and the work of gop allies , including majority leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky , who had drawn the president 's wrath for the senate 's inability this past summer to dismantle the health care law . `` our team will go onto many more victories ! '' trump tweeted . congressional republicans have cast the bill as a blessing for the middle class , an argument they will stress in their drive to hold onto their congressional majorities in next year 's midterm elections . ",
        "but one comment by trump could complicate their messaging . in praising the bill , trump cited the deep cut in the corporate tax rate , from 35 percent to 21 percent . `` that 's probably the biggest factor in our plan , '' the president said at the white house . within minutes , during house debate at the other end of pennsylvania avenue , rep. richard neal , d-mass . , jumped on trump 's remarks , calling it proof that republicans were never interested in passing meaningful tax cuts for the middle class . the senate used a post-midnight vote wednesday morning to approve the measure on a party-line 51-48 tally . ",
        "protesters interrupted with chants of , `` kill the bill , do n't kill us '' and vice president mike pence repeatedly called for order . upon passage , republicans cheered , with treasury secretary steve mnuchin among them . senate majority leader mitch mcconnell , r-ky . , insisted americans would respond positively to the tax bill . `` if we ca n't sell this to the american people , we ought to go into another line of work , '' he said . in an eleventh-hour hiccup tuesday , the senate parliamentarian found that three minor provisions violated senate rules , forcing lawmakers to strip them out . ",
        "house republicans had passed the bill tuesday with all voting democrats in opposition . because of the language the senate removed , the house had to revisit the measure wednesday because each chamber must approve identical legislation before it can be signed into law . `` people have been hit by the media and the democrats on their tv screen that everyone is getting a big tax increase , and that 's just not the case , '' ryan said wednesday on abc 's `` good morning america . '' starting next year , families making between $ 50,000 and $ 75,000 will get average tax cuts of $ 890 , according to an analysis by the nonpartisan tax policy center . ",
        "families making between $ 100,000 and $ 200,000 would get average tax cuts of $ 2,260 , while families making more than $ 1 million would get average tax cuts of nearly $ 70,000 , according to the analysis . but if the cuts for individuals are allowed to expire , most americans -- those making less than $ 75,000 -- would see tax increases in 2027 , according to congressional estimates . despite republican talk of spending discipline , the bill is projected to push the huge national debt ever higher . ryan said wednesday the gop is willing to risk running up deficits with the aim of getting a higher annual economic growth rate . ",
        "trump is aching for a big political victory after 11 months of legislative failures and nonstarters . the president tweeted his congratulations to gop leaders and to `` all great house republicans who voted in favor of cutting your taxes ! '' congressional republicans , who faltered badly in trying to dismantle barack obama 's affordable care act , see passage of the tax bill as crucial to proving to americans they can govern -- and imperative for holding onto house and senate majorities in next year 's midterm elections . `` the proof will be in the paychecks , '' sen. rob portman , r-ohio , said during the senate 's nighttime debate . ",
        "`` this is real tax relief , and it 's needed . '' not so , said the top senate democrat as the long , late hours led to testy moments tuesday night . `` we believe you are messing up america , '' new york sen. chuck schumer told republicans , chiding them for not listening to his remarks . the gop has repeatedly argued the bill will spur economic growth as corporations , flush with cash , increase wages and hire more workers . but many voters in surveys see the legislation as a boost to the wealthy , such as trump and his family , and a minor gain at best for the middle class . ",
        "tax cuts for corporations would be permanent while the cuts for individuals would expire in 2026 to comply with senate budget rules . the tax cuts would take effect in january , and workers would start to see changes in the amount of taxes withheld from their paychecks in february . the top tax rate for well-off individuals would be lowered from 39.6 percent to 37 percent . the legislation repeals an important part of the 2010 health care law -- the requirement that all americans carry health insurance or face a penalty -- as the gop looks to unravel the law it failed to repeal and replace this past summer . ",
        "it also allows oil drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge . the $ 1,000-per-child tax credit doubles to $ 2,000 , with up to $ 1,400 available in irs refunds for families that owe little or no taxes . the bill is projected to add $ 1.46 trillion to the nation 's debt over a decade . gop lawmakers say they expect a future congress to continue the tax cuts so they wo n't expire . that would drive up deficits even further .
