        "tempe , ariz. . - the blaine gabbert experiment is over . cardinals coach bruce arians announced monday afternoon that drew stanton will start for arizona on sunday against the new york giants . jim mcisaac/getty imagesdrew stanton will replace blaine gabbert at qb for the cardinalsarians said he made the decision after watching the game film of sunday 's 20-15 loss to washington . `` it is no fault of blaine , '' arians said . `` i think blaine is going to be a hell of a player , but drew already knows all those scenarios . he 's healthy enough now and it 's just a matter of getting those touchdowns that are there from experience , and trying to win this game . ",
        "`` but it is no way an indictment on blaine . i think he 's played his ass off for weeks . `` stanton is healthy enough to be mobile if needed , arians said . `` if he were n't , i would n't make the switch , '' arians said . `` it has nothing to do with blaine . `` arians added that stanton knows the offense `` inside and out . '' `` certain things that come up during the game in critical situations , he 's been in it and knows it , '' arians said . ",
        "gabbert went 2-3 after replacing stanton as the starter in week 11 after stanton suffered a knee injury the week before . gabbert threw for 1,086 yards , six touchdowns and six interceptions while completing 55.6 percent of his passes . however , the offense has stalled recently . the cardinals have n't scored a touchdown in the last 10 quarters . arians felt gabbert made `` some poor decisions '' in sunday 's loss to washington , in which arizona went 0-for-6 in the red zone . after he watched the film , arians felt the cardinals should 've scored on at least four trips . ",
        "during a radio interview on arizona sports 98.7 fm early monday morning , general manager steve keim said sunday 's game will go down as one of the `` more frustrating '' of his tenure as arizona 's general manager , which started in 2013 . `` it was a frustrating game - disappointed , '' keim said . `` the fact that we were eliminated from playoff contention , you know , again , is a disappointment and i apologize to our fans , everybody in our organization and moving forward we have a lot of work to do . ",
        "it 's going to be a busy offseason . `` we 'll continue to evaluate this team the last two games . i promise , the product on the field in 2018 , we 'll finish much stronger . `` however , arians said the cardinals wo n't tank the last two games . `` i just think drew 's going to give us a better chance to win this game this week , '' arians said `` for me , we 're not going to throw our hands up and say , ` hey , let 's lose the games and get a better draft pick . ' ",
        "that 's all bulls -- to me . we 're going to take the guys we think can win this game and go win this game . `` the move comes two weeks after arians said a long-term deal for gabbert `` could possibly happen . '' arians also said how gabbert finishes this season will factor into his evaluation of gabbert as a potential long-term answer in arizona . that evaluation process has been difficult for arizona because gabbert has been playing with a slew of backups . four of the five starting offensive linemen sunday in washington were backups . ",
        "he has n't played with david johnson . adrian peterson was put on injured reserve this week . that changed and made it harder for arians to assess gabbert and the offense in general . `` oh , yeah , if it was carson and david and john brown and all those guys , i 'd look at it totally different , '' arians said .
