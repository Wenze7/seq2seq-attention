        "after facing a slowdown in sales growth during 2016 , comp sales trends began to strengthen at costco wholesale last spring . in the last few months , costco 's momentum has increased . indeed , for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 -- a period running from early september to late november -- costco reported stellar comp sales growth of 10.5 % . this helped the company achieve a 16 % increase in earnings per share . earlier this week , costco wholesale reported that comp sales growth continued at a strong pace in december . this news is yet another piece of evidence that costco 's recent uptick in sales growth represents more than just a blip on the radar . ",
        "strong sales trends continuein november , costco had the best monthly sales performance of its nascent recovery . comp sales increased 10.8 % , with broad-based strength across the u. s. , canada , and other international markets . these robust trends continued in december . for the five-week retail month , costco 's comp sales increased 11.5 % , or 8.8 % adjusted for gas prices and exchange rates . to be fair , costco received a roughly 2.5 percentage point comp sales boost last month from the timing of new year 's day , which added an extra selling day in the period relative to the prior year . ",
        "even so , costco 's fully adjusted comp sales growth of 6.3 % is very strong by any standard . it 's also right in line with the first-quarter trend , adjusted for the timing of thanksgiving weekend relative to the retail calendar . hardlines continued to be the top-performing merchandise category last month , with double-digit comp sales growth . sales of appliances and computers were particularly strong . fresh food and other grocery-type items performed well , too , with comp sales up in the high single-digit range . e-commerce also remained a standout last month , with comp sales growth continuing to exceed 30 % . ",
        "strength across the worldanother encouraging sign for costco is that comp sales growth remains strong in all regions of the world . for the month of december , comp sales rose 9.1 % in the u. s. , 6.1 % in canada , and 9.6 % in the rest of the world . cannibalization related to new warehouses opening near existing ones reduced comp sales growth by about 1.5 percentage points in canada and costco 's other international markets last month , and had a smaller impact in the u. s . the strongest comp sales growth came in japan , mexico , and the u. k.analysts are still underestimating costco 's strengthnotwithstanding costco 's steady run of strong comp sales growth in recent months , analysts still have relatively modest expectations for the company in fiscal 2018 . ",
        "the average analyst estimate calls for full-year revenue growth of 7.2 % . adjusting for the extra week in costco 's 2017 fiscal year , this translates to revenue growth of about 9 % . a third of the way into fiscal 2018 , costco wholesale has posted year-to-date net sales growth of 11.9 % . while it is true that year-over-year comparisons will become tougher in the second half of the fiscal year , costco seems well positioned to beat analysts ' revenue estimates by 1 to 2 percentage points . this situation should allow costco to power past the average analyst eps estimate of $ 6.55 this year . ",
        "costco stock may be pricey , but with one of the deepest moats in the retail business , the discount warehouse giant still looks like a solid bet for long-term investors .   "
