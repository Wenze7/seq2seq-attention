        "delays of at least half an hour affected 7.2 million passenger journeys in britainpassengers lost at least 3.6 million hours due to significantly delayed trains in 2016/17 , according to new research . delays of at least half an hour affected 7.2 million passenger journeys in britain , consumer group which ? said . it found virgin trains east coast was the train company with the highest proportion of significant delays , with 3.7 % of its services running between 30 minutes and two hours late . this was followed by virgin trains west coast and crosscountry . the best performance was by c2c at just 0.2 % , according to the analysis of office of rail and road data from april 2016 to march 2017 . ",
        "the research was released ahead of the 3.4 % average fare increase on tuesday . this is why brummies keep spotting ross kemp in birminghama separate poll of 8,200 uk adults by which ? found two in five commuters claim they were not told of their rights to compensation the last time they were entitled to a payout . this rose to over half of leisure passengers . which ? managing director of public markets alex hayman said delays suffered by passengers are `` even more infuriating '' when they struggle to claim compensation . he went on : `` the progress to date is simply not good enough . ",
        "`` if train companies ca n't simplify unnecessarily complex claims systems for delayed customers , then government must press for automatic compensation to be introduced across the industry so that people can get the money they are owed . `` paul plummer , chief executive of the rail delivery group , representing train operators and network rail , said : `` rail companies are working together to ensure more people arrive on time but when things go wrong it should be easy to claim any compensation due . `` as part of the industry 's long-term plan to improve , more operators are introducing automatic refunds and , in the last five years , the amount of compensation paid out has increased five-fold to Â£ 45 million a year . ",
        "`` paross kemp and armed police called to ` terrifying raid ' at shirley post officethe orr said it is expanding its monitoring of delay compensation to better understand the volume of claims for each firm and how quickly they are processed . a virgin trains spokesman said : `` clearly , it 's harder to run trains exactly to time over a 400-mile route , and around 80 % of delays are outside of our control . `` but we always want to do the best for our passengers which is why we make claiming for delays as easy as possible and introduced industry-leading automatic compensation on our west coast route . ",
        "`` shadow transport secretary andy mcdonald said : `` this research shows that private rail companies are failing to provide reliable services and the government is refusing to hold them to account . `` our railway is fragmented and the claims system is unnecessarily complex , meaning passengers are missing out on the compensation they are owed . `` the tories have had years to improve and simplify the compensation process but instead they are defending private train companies , rather than standing up for passengers . `` this is yet more evidence that privatised rail is broken , which is why labour will take our railway back into public ownership to be run for passengers , not profit .
