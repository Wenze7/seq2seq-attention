        "eight moms have filed a class action lawsuit against the state 's top judges claiming lengthy delays in the big apple 's family court system prevent them from collecting child support . the court 's own rules set a 60 - to 90-day deadline to handle cases , yet `` the reality is that these petitions are decided many more than three months or even years after the violation petition is filed , '' the manhattan supreme court suit says . `` the family court 's routine violation of its own rule prevents custodial parents , commonly mothers , from being able to provide for their children , '' the suit says . ",
        "there 's a total $ 7 billion in child support arrears in the state , with a `` staggeringly low collection rate of approximately 7 percent , '' according to court papers . the suit names chief judge janet difiore as well as administrative judges lawrence marks , carol sherman and jeanette ruiz as defendants . the moms want to force the family court system to abide by its own deadlines . they 're also seeking legal fees . `` this has been a problem that i identified a long time ago and i would just hope that the response of the court system would not be to dig their heels in , but rather to work collaboratively with advocates and custodial parents to make the system work better for everyone , '' said the moms ' lawyer , rene kathawala . ",
        "his clients are bronx residents liz martinez , heather schoonmaker , donna l. taylor-sanders and monique t. bowden , ebony daley and vanessa nunez as well as mona lisa gardner of brooklyn and maria martucci of staten island . a spokesman for difiore and the other officials declined to comment on the pending litigation .
