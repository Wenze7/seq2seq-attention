        "image credit : erik shilling/jalopnikplenty of companies are going to ces this year with big and flashy announcements of how they will `` disrupt '' things . toyota is one of them , aiming to change up shopping with its new e-palette concept . it 's an intriguing idea , but one that i could only see working out in places where street-side real estate is n't terribly precious . athe e-palette concept is the boxy pod thing you see above , which toyota envisions to be an automated space that 's suited for all kinds of needs : ride sharing , parcel delivery or mobile e-commerce . ",
        "in essence , it 's a bus , a delivery truck and a mobile store all in one . that last bit is the most interesting to me . in toyota 's press conference , it showed various clips of people looking at different kinds of merchandise brought to them in an e-palette . potentially , you could order something online and have the store come to you . it 's true that people still like thumbing through items when they shop . it 's why amazon is opening brick and mortar stores . image credit : erik shilling/jalopnikwhile online shopping is contributing to the death of retail in this country , the e-palette could strike a happy medium between the two . ",
        "you just could n't fit as much product in one of the pods as you could a traditional store . but if you live in an area that does n't have a particular store or item , then having it come to you would be pretty neat . what that would do to the cost of the item is unclear . yet , i ca n't see how these pods would help ease up traffic congestion . if the pods become stand-ins for stores , then would n't that add additional traffic to streets ? double-parked pods all over the place while people use them as offices or shops ? ",
        "image credit : erik shilling/jalopnikat any rate , the e-palette has the potential to backfire because it 's rather redundant . on the other hand , it 's got some very serious launch partners . toyota 's press release states that amazon , didi , mazda , pizza hut and uber will all collaborate with toyota on vehicle planning , concepts and testing . the e-palette will launch at the tokyo 2020 olympics . we 'll see how it fares there . image credit : toyota .
