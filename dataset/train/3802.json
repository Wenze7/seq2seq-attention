        "jeddah - for years areej al-ghamdi could only cheer her favourite football team from home , but everything changed on friday when saudi arabia allowed women into the stadium for the first time . the university student was among around 300 saudi women who thronged pearl stadium in the red sea city of jeddah after the ultra-conservative kingdom eases decades-old rules separating the sexes . `` i came with my father and my brother -- we 're fans of al-ahli , '' said ghamdi of the saudi premier league club facing off against al-batin . the young woman said she always used to cheer her home team from the comfort of her living room . ",
        "`` we love the club very much , and our home would often become an arena for supporters , '' she said . `` this is the first time we 'll be cheering for real , not just in front of the television , '' said ghamdi , who wore a black abaya robe and a black scarf with a green al-ahli scarf round her neck . `` it is so much better here . `` the game began at 8:00 pm , but two hours before the historic kick-off enthusiasm was palpable as women supporters began arriving at the stadium . ",
        "among the first were a woman accompanied by a younger female and a girl . a boy sat next to them in seats that had been reserved for women who come alone or with members of their families , namely male relatives . the women entered the stadium through a special gate , while male supporters filed in through a separate entrance . - ` historic day ' - saudi arabia , which has some of the world 's tightest restrictions on women , has long barred them from sports arenas through strict rules that keep the sexes apart in public . ",
        "glass panels were set up to separate men supporters from the women and family section of the stadium . `` this event proves that we are heading for a prosperous future . i am very proud to be a witness of this massive change , '' lamya khaled nasser , a 32-year-old fan from the red sea city , told afp . ruwayda ali qassem , another jeddah resident , spoke of a `` historic day in the kingdom which culminates ongoing fundamental changes '' . `` i am proud and extremely happy for this development and for the kingdom 's moves to catch up with civilised measures adopted by many countries , '' she said . ",
        "- ` daughters ca n't believe it ' - saleh al-ziadi brought his three daughters to the game . `` my daughters still do n't believe this is happening . they have not yet realised they will be cheering their favourite team inside the stadium , '' he said . the women entering the venue waited in long queues to be searched by women security personnel who wore orange vests over their black abayas , while inside the stadium another team directed them to their seats . jeddah resident noura bakharji was among those who patiently waited for her turn , and for a reason . ",
        "bakharji said she always felt bitter when her brothers came home from stadiums to tell her about the excitement of watching football matches in person . `` i always watched games on tv while my brothers went to the stadiums ... i asked myself repeatedly ` why i ca n't go ? ' '' she told afp . `` today , things have changed . it 's a day of happiness and joy . `` under saudi arabia 's existing guardianship system , a male family member -- normally the father , husband or brother -- must grant permission for a woman 's study , travel and a host of other activities . ",
        "fatimah baeshen , spokeswoman at the saudi embassy in washington `` rooted for the ladies '' in a message on twitter . `` as we speak ; saudi women fans are entering soccer stadiums ! this is more than women 's rights : today 's match between al-ahli and al-batin , and the ones to follow , are opportunities for families to come together and enjoy ksa 's national sport -- soccer ! i 'm rooting for the ladies -- enjoy ! '' baeshen tweeted . friday 's match was the first in a series that will be open to women : a second is due to take place on saturday and a third on january 18 . ",
        "and in june , as part of a reforms drive led by crown prince mohammed bin salman , authorities are lifting a ban that prohibited saudi women from driving . and the result of friday 's game ? a 5-0 defeat for al-batin -- and a victory for women in saudi arabia .   "
