        "andy turner reports from the ricoh arena as sky blues strive to bounce back from defeat at exetermark robins has named an unchanged coventry city side to face in-form swindon town at the ricoh arena this afternoon . the sky blues boss has kept faith with the starting line-up that lost 1-0 at exeter city last weekend , including striker max biamou who came under the spotlight after missing a glaring opportunity against the grecians as he continues to fire blanks in league two . it 's all the more surprising that the manager has n't made a change given that new loan signing josh barrett scored a hat-trick in the under-23s on monday when jordan ponticelli and stuart beavon were also among the goals . ",
        "ponticelli bagged a brace in the development game against crystal palace , making it five in two u-23 games for the teenager , while veteran striker beavon took his tally to three in two for jason farndon 's second string side . barrett , ponticelli and beavon are all included on the bench . elsewhere , jordan willis and tom davies continue their central defensive partnership with rod mcdonald again on the bench , and goalkeeper lee burge retains his place in the side ahead of liam o'brien . there 's still no sign of midfielders liam kelly and peter vicnenti , both of whom are back in training after recovering from their respective injuries . ",
        "city : lee burge ; jack grimmer , jordan willis , tom davies , chris stokes ; jordan maguire-drew , tom bayliss , michel doyle , jordan shipley ; marc mcnulty , max biamou . subs : liam o'brien , rod mcdonald , stuart beavon , dion kelly-evans , josh barrett , ben stevenson , jordan ponticelli .
