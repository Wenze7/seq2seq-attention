        "china 's top ballet company has become embroiled in a war of words with two of the country 's courts over a royalty dispute for a work best known abroad for being performed for us president richard nixon during his 1972 trip to china . the government-funded national ballet of china lashed out at the xicheng district people 's court on its microblog on tuesday , accusing the court and its presiding judge of `` legal corruption '' by `` wrongfully enforcing '' the ruling on an adaptation of the red detachment of women . it said would suspend the performance of the work , according to the statement . ",
        "the court countered online with a detailed statement of the legal proceedings , prompting beijing 's top court to share the link on its own online account before all statements were taken offline on wednesday . the red detachment of women has been a centrepiece of the company 's repertoire for decades and has been performed thousands of times since was adapted from a movie in 1964 by screenwriter liang xin . the revolutionary ballet tells the story of a group of women farmers on the southern island of hainan fighting for the communist party for national liberation . it was one of eight `` model '' revolutionary plays promoted by jiang qing , late chairman mao zedong 's wife , during the cultural revolution . ",
        "in 1993 , liang signed an agreement with the company to credit him as the source of the original material and pay him 5,000 yuan , based on an intellectual property rights law passed two years earlier . but in 2012 , liang , then 86 , sued the company for breach of copyright by continuing the perform the work without crediting or paying him . liang argued that under the 1991 law his agreement with company was valid for 10 years and should have been renewed when it lapsed . he demanded 550,000 yuan in compensation and an apology for the `` unauthorised '' performances . ",
        "when the case was heard in the xicheng court in 2015 , the company argued that the 5,000 yuan paid to liang back in 1993 was a one-off payment for allowing an adaptation of the movie . the court agreed that the deal between liang and the company remained valid but said liang should also be paid for the performances since 2003 . the court ordered the company , which is fully funded and supervised by the ministry of culture , to pay liang 120,000 yuan in compensation and issue a written apology on its website for not crediting liang . ",
        "the company appealed against the decision in an intellectual property court and lost . it appealed again to the beijing high people 's court in 2016 but the court refused to hear the case . liang died in january last year and his widow pursued the suit . on december 28 , the xicheng court said the it would enforce its 2003 ruling , ordering the company to pay liang 's widow 136,763 yuan and issue the apology . on tuesday , the company accused the xicheng judge of dereliction of duty in an online statement riddled with exclamation marks and emotive language . ",
        "the xicheng court then released links to documents covered the original hearings and appeals . the beijing high people 's court also weighed in , saying that `` those who have contempt for the law will damage their reputations , no matter how beautifully they dance '' . `` the more influential the figure or organisation , the greater the social responsibility they must shoulder to abide by the law . the national ballet of china , with its social status and influence , should acquire some legal knowledge , vent less one-sided emotion and not brandish its reputation , '' the high court said . ",
        "the remarks were then removed without explanation .   "
