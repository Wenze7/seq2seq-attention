        "a glenboig couple are counting their blessings after a `` christmas miracle '' saved them when a bus crashed through their garden wall . jim and helen hughes were walking down their driveway to wait for a taxi when the out of control vehicle careered on to their property . it 's the third time in just four years an incident of this kind has happened and the concerned couple say the problem lies with the chicane bend and traffic lights outside their main street home . the grandparents-of-nine are now imploring north lanarkshire council to intervene as they fear a member of their family may not be as fortunate in the future as they were . ",
        "a shaken helen , 73 , said : `` our phone rang just as we were leaving the house so i answered to check it was the ring back from the taxi company . `` if that had been seconds later , we 'd have been standing at the edge of our drive and the bus would have hit us . `` we have a big family and they visit all the time . i 'm terrified one of them is going to be in the wrong place at the wrong time . `` i feel quite shaken up by it really , as we 've both cheated death . ",
        "`` it 's feels like a christmas miracle . `` jim , 74 , said : `` the noise was horrendous , it sounded like something from a war zone . `` this ca n't keep happening as somebody is going to be seriously hurt or worse . `` there are solutions to this problem that need to be put into practice - and not just for our benefit . `` he continued : `` we 've had council staff out here before and they 've seen how dangerous it can be , especially during the school run . `` but whenever we chase it up we just get told there 's not enough money to fix it . ",
        "`` before the traffic lights moved there were no problems at all as buses had room to pass cars . `` but the positioning of the lights now mean it is too narrow and one misjudgment could lead to a disaster . `` the lights need to be moved back or the road needs to be widened . we 've even offered to remove some of our garden to allow for that . `` jim and helen , who used to own lamberton 's engineering in coatbridge , are relieved no-one was injured in the crash . helen said : `` there was a few people on the bus and we 're just thankful everyone is fine . ",
        "`` but next time that might not be the case as i think it 's only a matter of time before somebody gets hit . `` several ambulances and police cars were despatched to the incident , which occurred just days before christmas . helen went on : `` all the neighbours heard the commotion and came out to see what was happening as the emergency services were on the scene with their lights flashing . `` when she knew we were ok , one of my friends joked to me , ` at least you still know how to light up the village at christmas time ' . ",
        "`` a spokesperson for north lanarkshire council said : `` as with any incident on our roads , we will look into all the circumstances before determining the most appropriate action . `` our investigation will include establishing all the facts and a decision on what , if any , solutions can be deployed .
