        "today is the first day of 2018 , and i 'm going to greet it with positivity ! now that we 've rid ourselves of 2017 , it 's time to look ahead to all the great things that are going to happen this year . so , what am i most excited about this year ? 10 . e3 2018now , e3 is always exciting because it 's where companies show off their newest games and plans for the future , as well as the numerous independent developers that show off their new games , many with gameplay demos . ",
        "however , it 's being pushed back to number 10 because it 's a yearly occurrence , so i 'll give new things their time to shine . 9 . evangelion 3.0 + 1.0 now , i 'm insanely excited about the final film in the evangelion rebuild series , but i have one fear that puts it this high up on the list . i think it will be delayed again . i know , it 's basically just preaching to the choir , but the film was originally supposed to be released in 2015 . i think there 's a good chance that evangelion 3.0 + 1.0 could be released in 2018 , i think there 's a large chance it could be delayed even further . ",
        "8 . steven universeyes , steven universe will be back in action , and it seems like the story is going to be the best we 've seen yet . the show is coming back in a few days on january 5th . it also seems like we could get a somewhat stable schedule for the show , or at least less than 150 days between episodes . 7 . yoshiwhile we have n't heard much info on this title , we were shown it an its main mechanic last e3 . it 's a new yoshi game with a unique idea of being able to flip the stage to find different paths , secrets , and solutions to puzzles . ",
        "it also looks bright and vibrant , and almost has a woolly world feel to its graphics . 6 . kirby star allieskirby is one of nintendo 's most popular characters , and that 's due to his cute design and fun games . well this year we 're getting his debut on the switch , and it looks like a great time . it features one new defining mechanic , that being the ability to ally with enemies and combine powers to make strong and unique attacks . this feature almost ensures that it 's going to have a great multiplayer just like most other kirby games . ",
        "5 . doomsday clockwhile the first two issues of doomsday clock have already been released , the series has n't fully picked up yet . issue # 2 which recently released started to kick off the main events which will be followed up on in issue # 3 , and the following issues until the conclusion in october . 4 . bloodstained : ritual of the nighti am a huge fan of castlevania , so i am very excited for its spiritual successor . it 's also being led by koji igarashi , who worked on many of the great castlevania games , including symphony of the night , which is the style bloodstained is looking to emulate . ",
        "3 . solo : a star wars storylet 's face it , han solo is one of the best characters in star wars . he 's smart , funny , sarcastic , and is shrouded in mystery . so , getting to finally learn his backstory and how he gets the falcon and meets chewbacca is totally cool with me . this is in addition to donald glover playing lando calrissian , which is a match made in heaven . it also looks like this could be similar to a star wars guardians of the galaxy , which is just something everybody needs in their life . ",
        "2 . avengers : infinity warinfinity war is going to be the biggest marvel movie since the original avengers . we 're going to finally see thanos in action , as well as how our heroes have been doing since the end of civil war . this is all in addition to the promise that there will be death , and of at least one of our main heroes . while it is n't very difficult to eliminate certain people , some of the actors have been playing these roles for a decade , and might want to change it up . ",
        "1 . mega man 11honestly , how could this not be number one ? it 's the first time mega man will have a new game in seven years , and so far , it looks great . i 've been very excited for it , and i 've gone far enough to analyze the small trailer we got . capcom is going to release more info about it in the summer , presumably at e3 . hopefully mega man 11 will help wash out the bad taste that mighty â„– 9 left in many players mouths . either way , it 's going to be great to see the blue bomber in an original game of his own again .
