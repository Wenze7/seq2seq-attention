        "baltimore -- university professors and students are lending their expertise to local police departments looking for new ways to rebuild relationships and accountability with the communities they serve . universities `` can explore grant opportunities that we may not be aware of or eligible to apply for without their partnership , '' baltimore police commissioner kevin davis said in an interview with capital news service . `` the marriage of academic institutions and boots on the ground police departments allows us to explore new opportunities as well as new technologies , '' he said . the school of social work at the university of maryland , baltimore , is partnering with the baltimore police department on community policing efforts while the college park campus ' sociology department is working with the prince george 's county police department to help officers identify their biases . ",
        "johns hopkins university began a partnership with the police department to develop programs aimed at reducing violent crime in 2016 , according to a university press release . a broken relationshipthe department of justice 's 2016 investigation of the baltimore police department , which led to the consent decree between the justice department and the police , found that `` the relationship between the police and the community in baltimore is broken . '' `` many residents throughout the city of baltimore , and particularly in impoverished , primarily minority , neighborhoods , described being belittled , disbelieved , and disrespected by officers , '' the report said . ",
        "`` the consent decree and the doj report told us a lot of what we already knew about community-police relations in baltimore , '' said wendy shaia , executive director of the social work community outreach service the university of maryland , baltimore . `` i think this is a real opportunity for us to change those relationships . `` two school of social work projects are in the works . the first proposal will pair students from the school with officers working in four key `` transformation zones '' across the city . these zones are areas that had `` elevated concentrations of gun-related crimes '' in 2016 , according to the police department 's website . ",
        "the department intends to collaborate with outside organizations in these zones . the idea is that community-driven intervention strategies will reduce violent crimes overall . the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health is already working with officers in the transformation zone program , according to the police department 's website . the goal of the university of maryland proposal , shaia said , is to be able to place one graduate student working as a community analyst in each of the four zones , with a fifth student overseeing the broader mission of the program across all the communities . ",
        "`` as social workers , we have the perfect set of skills to help bridge the gap between community members and the police , '' shaia said . `` we want our students to think about community issues from a macro perspective so that ... they are recognizing all the societal , institutional , and structural issues that contribute to the complex and rippling impacts of poverty and oppression . `` the second project , said richard barth , dean of the school of social work , is a certificate program that would offer specialized training for police officers on community issues such as intimate-partner violence , suicide , youth violence , child abuse and neglect . ",
        "like police , social workers are `` first responders , and they have to be out working in families with many of the same problems , '' barth said . `` we work in a lot of the same sectors , with a lot of the same populations as the police . `` barth said that the school of social work surveyed officers to find out what they would want from a certificate program with the support of the police department 's chief ganesha martin and capt. rhonda mccoy of the department of justice compliance , accountability and external affairs division . ",
        "the survey received more than 600 responses , barth said . `` as the leading state organization for training people that work in protective services , we have a lot of training capacity , '' barth said . `` a substantial portion of 911 calls are not about violence prevention , but really are more about social problems that need a response . '' `` we see ourselves as an asset , '' barth continued . `` we work closely with the police and we would be delighted to do more training , but there are many other ways we can be of assistance to the police , and that involves the possibility of police-social work teams . ",
        "`` building ties between officers and citizens in baltimore is vital to this process , shaia said , but it also goes further into addressing the `` deep and long and wide history of racial segregation and oppression '' in baltimore . `` baltimore was ground-zero for racialized housing discrimination in the country , '' shaia said . `` i think what we 're seeing now is simply the result of our very deep , racialized history in this city . and until we begin to recognize it for what it is , that is always going to create a disconnect between our criminal justice system and our community . ",
        "`` the school of social work has been talking with the baltimore police department since before the consent decree was signed to offer support . shaia said that addressing these structural issues -- including education , substance abuse , employment , infrastructure and access to housing -- holds the key to beginning to tackle crime in baltimore . `` we ca n't just tackle crime by itself . we 've been doing that for years , and it has n't been working , '' said shaia . `` it 's going to take more than the police department . they are just one part of our infrastructure . ",
        "`` help from virtual realitythe university of maryland , college park has been working with the prince george 's county police department to develop simulation-based , virtual reality trainings to help officers recognize unconscious attitudes they bring to their policing . dr. kris marsh and dr. rashawn ray , both sociology professors at the university of maryland , college park , study implicit bias -- prejudice that develops and plays out unconsciously . implicit bias has been associated with differences in policing of individuals depending on their race , gender or sexual orientation . marsh and ray have created and begun offering classroom lessons on implicit bias for prince george 's officers . ",
        "now , they are taking their research and merging it with existing virtual reality technology to show officers how their biases can show up on the streets . in 2016 , the sociology professors approached computer scientists in the university of maryland institute for advanced computer studies with a proposal to develop a virtual reality simulation to complement their teachings . `` there 's some data that suggests that virtual reality has a longer-term effect than some of this two-dimensional kind of stuff that 's out there , '' marsh said . the maryland blended reality center , a collaboration between the university 's college park and baltimore campuses that innovates with virtual and augmented reality , embraced the sociologists ' challenge . ",
        "it anticipates debuting the implicit bias trainings in march 2018 , said the center 's associate director , barbara brawn-cinani , who works closely with director amitabh varshney . officers will wear headsets for training simulations , allowing for close detection of facial expressions of civilians they encounter in each scene , she said . while other virtual reality police trainings focus on strengthening officers ' decision-making abilities , these trainings aim to make officers aware of their personal biases . `` in an immersive environment where you 're able to track things on a much more refined level those things become very hard to hide , '' brawn-cinani said . ",
        "`` sociology 's initial thought was it 's very hard to work with implicit bias on the basis of it being unconscious , and if we have a way to really get into people 's heads it will allow us to help them address that and become aware of this . `` police departments across the country , including baltimore , use virtual reality trainings to provide officers a risk-free setting to practice use of force and verbal de-escalation . baltimore police sgt. regina richardson participated in virtual reality scenarios for the first time during her annual training in early december . ",
        "she said she enjoyed the experience and was pleased when she performed correctly . `` for something where we need to kind of just hold back a second to see what we have before we go blasting , i think it 's a good idea , '' she said .   "
