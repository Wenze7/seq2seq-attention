        "even before its listing as a unesco world heritage site in 1999 , wuyi mountain was already a popular tourist destination in china . the mountain scenic area straddles fujian and jiangxi provinces and contains a natural reserve and the ruins of an ancient city . nine-bend creek , which snakes about 7 kilometers through the area , is considered its lifeblood . the waterway does n't have exactly nine bends , and it 's certainly wider than the usual definition of `` creek . '' gazing down on it from above , it looks like an emerald belt cinched among craggy peaks . ",
        "visitors can choose either bamboo rafts or rubber boats to go on sightseeing tours on the waterway . the rafts , propelled by locals using long bamboo spars , allow tourists to take in the magnificent scenery at a slow pace . grotesque rock formations on either bank include ancient hanging coffins on cliffs . the rubber boats are more adventurous , taking in a route that includes some mild whitewater . for first-time visitors , the bamboo raft trip is probably the best choice because it exemplifies local culture . a raft can accommodate up to six people . ",
        "there are no sideboards . the surface of the river is right beside your feet . but there is no danger because the boatmen are experienced and skilful , and the current is smooth . of course , life jackets are always required , just in case . the whole journey lasts about 90 minutes . it begins from a dock in xingcun village and goes upstream to a dock near the wuyi palace . the popularity of the rafts does tend to spoil the natural serenity of the waterway . long lines of people wait to board rafts , and the number of rafts has grown so that it can almost seem like a traffic jam at times on the river . ",
        "cliff coffinsthose who have been to wuyi mountain never stop talking about the coffins on the cliffs lining nine-bend creek . they are found on 18 cliff sides in the mountain area and date back about 3,500 years , according to carbon dating . some of the coffins are perched on wood frames jutting from the cliffs ; some peek out of small mountain caves . the burial tradition symbolized respect for the dead , and their location vis-Ã -vis one another identified the social status of the dead . the higher , the better . it is believed that cliff burials are part of the ou culture . ",
        "ou was the name of a country that existed in eastern china some 3,500-4,000 years ago . the descendants of ou people are today 's zhuang ethnic minority . the zhuang recount a tale that has been passed down through the centuries . it is about an old lady living alone , who adopted a `` man with short tail . '' when she died , the man conjured up a wild wind to send her body up to the cliff . it is said that every march 3 on the lunar calendar , the man , who was actually the son of a dragon , would come to the cliff to pay tribute to the old woman . ",
        "that was the beginning of the song festival , a significant event in the calendar of the zhuang . magic powers aside , how did ancient people manage to hoist coffins so high on cliffs ? ancient books credit supernatural forces . no modern explanation has been verified . from a bamboo raft , visitors use binoculars to get a closer look at coffins nearly 100 meters above the water , marveling at a mystery yet to be solved . dawang peak and one-line skymountain attractions are as compelling as those on the water . dawang peak and one-line sky are considered sights not to be missed in the scenic area . ",
        "dawang literally means `` king . '' it is the first peak at the entrance of the wuyi mountain area , perched on the north side of the nine-bend creek . the shape of the peak looks like a black-gauze cap that ancient chinese officials wore , which is why the crag is also called official cap peak . the 530-meter-high peak is surrounded by cliffs . there is only narrow passageway to the top . it 's quite steep and so narrow at parts that only one person at a time can squeeze through . geographer xu xiake said in his work `` xu xiake 's travels '' that the passageway was `` one of the most difficult to navigate in wuyi mountain . '' ",
        "the view from the top of the peak is worth the painstaking trek . from there , one can view the nine-bend creek and an array of other natural attractions . but beware on the descent because going down is always harder on the legs than climbing . one-line sky provides a different scenery altogether on the southern side of the nine-bend creek . in a valley , a giant rock called lingyan , or `` rock of spirit , '' spans three caves . one is called fuxi cave . inside , a visitor can see a very narrow line of sunshine creeping through a long crack , as if someone had cleaved the rock with an axe . ",
        "it is very dark and wet inside fuxi cave , where white-furred bats live . you might see a row of bats staring at you if you look up . even if you do n't look , the pungent odor of bat guano will tell you the mammals are there . have no fear . bats do n't attack humans . wuyi palacewuyi palace , the most ancient taoist temple in the area , has undergone destruction and reconstruction . today , two 900-year-old osmanthus trees bear witness to the colorful history of the temple . first built in about ad 742 , the temple was revered by ancient emperors who worshiped lord wuyi , a mountain god in the area . ",
        "ancient people also believed that lord wuyi was in charge of land ownership in the netherworld . a ceremony was held to worship him before graves were constructed . many scholars and writers were associated with the temple during the song dynasty , including zhu xi , one of the most renowned philosophers of ancient china . wannian hall in the temple has been turned into a museum honoring zhu . his life is depicted there . other halls serve as a calligraphy school . behind the museum is a street replicating the song dynasty style , but sadly there are no real relics left there . ",
        "ruins of minyue cityminyue was an ancient ethnic group who lived in the wuyi mountain area . their king wuzhu , who died in 192 bc , built his capital about 24 kilometers south of the scenic area . the ruins of the city were first discovered in 1958 . covering 480,000 square meters , the ancient city once had a palace for the lord and residences for the nobles . outside the city wall , residences , workshops and graveyards were neatly laid out . nothing is left apart from some foundations . it is believed that wuzhu was one of the powers behind a rebellion against the qin dynasty and helped defeat the warlord xiang yu to found the west han dynasty . ",
        "he was rewarded with a lordship by emperor gaozu . the culture of minyue was rich . more than 4,000 pieces of pottery relics were unearthed in the ruins . the city also had quite an orderly drainage system , which was a model for ancient chinese cities . the splendor of the city , however , was short-lived . after wuzhu died , local nobles went to war with smaller neighboring nations . wuzhu 's descendant yushan even led a rebellion against the central royal court . minyue was destroyed . a museum sits on the ruins , where visitors can view pottery , iron and bronze relics . ",
        "if you gohow to get there : it takes about three and a half hours by high-speed train from shanghai to wuyishan city . the wuyi mountain national holiday resort is about 15 kilometers from the city . the hutao , ximen and nanmen bus stations all provide transport to the resort . there are three bus stations inside the resort . to get to the ruins of minyue city , take bus no . 6 bus from the wuyi mountain national holiday resort to the wuyi mountain bus station , where shuttle buses to the ruins are available .
