        "santiago , chile -- billionaire and former president sebastian pinera appeared headed to a victory in chile 's presidential runoff election , with more than 82 percent of the votes counted sunday night . officials said pinera had just over 54 percent of the votes to nearly 45 percent for center-left sen. alejandro guillier . analysts had predicted a closer race , but there had not been any opinion polls on the election for several weeks . the early results prompted pinera supporters to celebrate at his campaign headquarters . pinera won last month 's first round , but his 36.6 percent vote share fell far short of what polls had projected . ",
        "guillier got 22.7 percent in the first round and had been counting on support from backers of other left-leaning candidates who were eliminated . the 64-year-old guillier was backed by outgoing president michelle bachelet , but many chileans have been disillusioned by lagging economic growth under her watch , a problem based largely on lower international prices for copper , which is the backbone of chile 's economy . many leftists also feel she wavered on her promises of profound social changes in labor and education policies . pinera , 68 , struggled with large protests over chile 's inequality and demands for education reform during his first term as president , and left office in 2014 with low popularity ratings . ",
        "but he also oversaw annual economic growth of about 5 percent a year . `` i think we 'll win these elections and better times will come for all chileans , '' pinera said after casting his vote in the chilean capital . the conservative politician proposes slashing taxes on business to revive growth and vows to launch a $ 14 billion , four-year spending plan that includes fresh investments in infrastructure . guillier , a former tv anchor , promised to continue bachelet 's plan to increase corporate taxes to partly finance an education overhaul , reform the constitution and improve the pension and health care system . ",
        "`` i came to vote for guillier because he will continue bachelet 's reforms , and thanks to her i have a son studying industrial engineering for free , '' said genaro rodr√≠guez , an electrician in santiago . guillier also wanted to diversify chile 's copper-dependent economy and develop alternative sources of energy to lower investment costs . `` i think we 're going to win by a tight but clear margin , '' guillier said after casting his vote in his northern desert region of antofagasta . during the first round , beatriz sanchez of the broad front coalition came in third with 20 percent of the vote . ",
        "she pledged her support to guillier . ___ associated press writer luis andres henao in buenos aires , argentina , contributed to this report from buenos aires .   "
