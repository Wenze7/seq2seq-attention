        "nvidia stock has returned 85.7 % so far in 2017 , through dec. . 26 , versus the s&p 500 's 22.1 % return , continuing the party that started in mid-2015 . the stock 's meteoric rise is being propelled by the company 's transformation from being primarily a successful maker of graphics processing units for mostly computer gaming to also being a major force in artificial intelligence . in 2017 , nvidia unveiled or launched many new products and initiatives that should help drive growth in 2018 and beyond . below are some things that investors can probably expect from nvidia in the coming new year . ",
        "what wall street expects from nvidia 's earnings . wall street is projecting that nvidia 's earnings per share will increase 16.2 % year-over-year in q4 , which ends in late january . analysts expect eps growth in fiscal 2018 of 12.4 % -- much lower than the 60 + % growth nvidia is on track to deliver this year -- and predict 15.5 % growth for the next five years . investors should , indeed , be prepared for nvidia 's growth to slow in fiscal 2018 . the company 's data-center platform was on fire early in this fiscal year due to relatively easy year-over-year comparables , and got a big boost in q3 from the launch of tesla v100 for data centers . ",
        "that said , wall street has continuously and significantly underestimated nvidia , so there 's good reason to believe that its current estimates will also prove too conservative . in the last three quarters , wall street 's eps estimates turned out to be too low by 41.5 % , 31.4 % , and 19.7 % . here are several main things investors can likely expect from nvidia in 2018 : . 1 . launch of a post-pascal graphics card for gaming . it 's probable that nvidia will begin to release in 2018 a line of graphics cards for gaming based on a new gpu architecture . ",
        "in the off-chance this does n't occur in 2018 , 2019 seems a sure thing . the company 's current cards are pascal-based , and began rolling out in 2016 . the gpu architecture for the new cards might be volta , which the company launched in 2017 , and which has already made its way into several products . these include the tesla v100 for data centers and the monstrous titan v graphics card for pcs that 's aimed at developers working in ai and high-performance computing . however , there are rumors that nvidia 's next lineup of geforce cards will use a new gpu architecture called ampere . ",
        "the soaring popularity of esports should continue to drive many gamers to upgrade their graphics cards . 2 . more sales of volta-based data-center products . in the summer , nvidia began shipping the tesla v100 for accelerating hpc and deep-learning training . sales of this product provided a big boost to third-quarter earnings : data-center revenue soared 109 % from the year-ago period , and increased 20 % from the preceding quarter , growing to 19 % of the company 's total revenue . this platform helped drive 32 % growth in total revenue and a 41 % surge in adjusted earnings per share from the year-ago quarter . ",
        "all the world 's major internet companies and cloud-service providers are upgrading their data centers from pascal-based systems to volta-based ones . major server makers have also announced that they 're adopting volta . while nvidia likely booked in the third quarter a good chunk of the initial wave of business from the huge players , investors should be able to count on revenue continuing to roll in from volta upgrades . that is , as long as nvidia 's gpu-based approach to deep learning remains the favored approach to ai , which seems a safe bet for the near and intermediate terms . ",
        "3 . shipments begin for drive px pegasus platform . no crystal ball is needed here : nvidia has said that drive px pegasus will be available to its automotive partners in the second half of 2018 . pegasus , unveiled in october , is the world 's first ai supercomputer for powering fully autonomous vehicles . it 's an upgrade to drive px 2 , which began shipping in the spring of 2016 . several hundred entities are developing with the drive px 2 platform . pegasus promises to enable them to move beyond developing partially autonomous driving systems to developing fully autonomous ones . ",
        "drive px 2 is in audi 's 2018 a8 and all tesla production vehicles . toyota and mercedes-benz have said they 'll be incorporating the platform in models planned for launch within the next several years . auto revenue -- which accounted for 5.5 % of total revenue in q3 -- should grow faster as we draw closer to the imminent legalization across the country of fully autonomous cars . many industry experts peg this occurring within four to six years . the long-term picture remains bright . space did n't permit including more predictions , with a notable one left out being that nvidia 's edge-computing initiatives -- which include drones and smart cities -- should gain more traction in 2018 . ",
        "in short , the future looks bright for nvidia 's business and its stock , as long as two things remain true : the company 's gpu-based approach to deep learning remains the -- or at least `` a '' -- favored approach to this ai discipline , and intel is n't very successful in its plans to crash nvidia 's ai party by entering the discrete gpu space . while the deep-pocketed chip giant should n't be underestimated , nvidia has a huge seven-year head-start in this space .
