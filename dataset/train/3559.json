        "this is a story i have never told before and will never tell again . i actually got my start in investing in a stock-picking competition in middle school . i picked wang laboratories ... because ... wang . get the timeless reading ebook in pdf . thirteen-year-old humor . anyway , wang was a flop , and i lost money on it . talk about dating yourself -- the old-timers will recall that wang was actually an amex stock , the old curb exchange . i do miss the amex . i entered another stock-picking contest my senior year of high school , in my economics class . ",
        "this one was a bit more involved -- my team was competing against teams throughout the state , and every week we would get a printout of the results taped to the wall in the classroom . the economics class was full of jocks , including most of the guys i was on the wrestling team with , along with lots of the popular girls . my team was the jocks and popular girls and me . i was under a lot of pressure to come up with an idea . someone had actually given me a tip earlier in the year . ",
        "novell , a software company , from provo , utah . i think the idea was that you were supposed to build a diversified portfolio of stocks , but i just put it all in novell . it worked . we were one of the top teams in the state . i actually got invited to a board of directors meeting at my school to talk about how we did it . i made up some nonsense that must have sounded absolutely ridiculous . i had no idea what i was talking about . upon reflection , all of this took place in late 1991/early 1992 , and the stock market was n't doing so hot . ",
        "about 90 % of the teams in this stock market contest lost money . even being long novell , we made only about 15 % in a few months . that 's pretty crappy on an absolute basis , but great for the middle of a bear market . anyway , i had inadvertently stumbled across the number one way to get rich in america : put it all in one tech stock and hang on . that was a lesson i did not internalize . i was smart enough to understand that we won based on sheer luck . ",
        "then again , a lot of people in this country get rich on sheer luck . but is it luck ? take jeff bezos , or mark zuckerberg . two of the richest people in the world . how did they get rich ? they had one tech stock and never sold . zuckerberg is selling now , which is smart -- you have to turn it into food at some point . but basically these guys invested in themselves and compounded at a ridiculous rate . they put all their eggs in one basket . if zuckerberg had taken peter thiel 's $ 500,000 in 2004 and put it in the s&p 500 , he would have a lot less than he has today . ",
        "it still would have been a great investment -- i think a lot of people would be happy holding the s&p 500 from 2004 to 2018 . but if you are going to be one of the richest people in the world , you have to compound a lot faster than that . i think about compounding a lot . there are n't many businesses that compound at 100 % a year . a food truck is not going to compound at 100 % . a homebuilder is not going to compound at 100 % . a car dealership is not going to compound at 100 % . ",
        "pretty much the only thing that does is tech . one of the reasons facebook paid so much for whatsapp was its explosive user growth . it ended up not being worth $ 19 billion , but it looked like it would be . thing is , not all of us can work in tech . the type of growth rates that pushed bezos to $ 100 billion are an anomaly , and probably wo n't exist again for a generation or two . even buffett , who has beaten the s&p handily since inception , has had a tough time doing it the last few years . ",
        "the one piece of advice . back to bezos and zuckerberg and compounding at 100 % . this is why i love entrepreneurship -- i would never tell you to take $ 100,000 and put it in spy instead of investing in yourself . i do n't know if you 've ever seen the founder , about ray kroc , but the movie portrays his first wife as a bit of a suckapotamus , always throwing cold water on his ideas . sure , starting a business is risky . it is also fun ! if you have an idea , you need to think big , and execute on it . ",
        "if you have and idea , you need to think big and execute on it . there are people who think big but ca n't execute . there are people who think small but can execute . few can do both . here 's the remarkable thing about both bezos and zuckerberg -- they retained so much ownership in their companies through the fundraising process , through the ipo , and into maturity . people who think big , execute , and see it all the way through to the end are exceptionally rare . remember : diversification is for people who do n't know what they are doing .
