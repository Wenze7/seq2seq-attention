        "the engagement ratio per brand -- or average interactions per post per brand per 1,000 followers -- decreased on instagram , facebook , and linkedin . on twitter , the engagement ratio per brand increased slightly , up 1.08 % across the first half of 2016 . and yet for some stupid reasons brands continue to invest in social media ? the marketing industry continues to be in the midst of a mass delusion of epic proportions when it comes to social media . since about 2000 , the marketing establishment has been engaged in creating phony crises based on flimsy evidence , questionable assertions , and exaggerated claims when it comes to social media . ",
        "now , let 's get to the bullshit no , for the most part , consumers are not in love with brands no , consumers do not want to have a conversation with your brand , or an `` authentic relationship '' with it , or co-create with it , or engage with it , or dance with it , or take a shower with it . they want it to work well , taste good , be reasonably priced , and look pretty . we were promised that social media would be the magic carpet on which our legions of brand advocates would go to spread the word about the marvelousness of our brands , and would free us from the terrible , wasteful expense of advertising . ",
        "it has done nothing of the sort . in fact , it is often the exact opposite . social media is usually where people go to scream about the mistreatment they get at the hands of companies . and where companies go to beg forgiveness . most brands are finding that their social media programs are more time-consuming , more expensive , and less capable of driving sales growth than was promised . social media sites are quickly evolving into just another channel for delivering traditional interruptive advertising . social media is not going to die or go away . ",
        "it will continue to grow . but the fantasy of consumers having conversations about brands and sharing their passion for brands -- and the claim that this will replace or surpass traditional paid advertising -- is simply collapsing as the evidence rolls in . remember facebook in its initial incarnation ? it was the social media upstart that was going to slay the traditional advertising dragon . well , it seems that it has done just the opposite . it has become a juggernaut of traditional paid advertising . some of the baloney that facebook first tried to sell us was : consumers wanted to `` join the conversation '' about brands online . ",
        "social media marketing was going to make traditional advertising obsolete . and the experts , who published books to emphasize their own importance , have not been called on the carpet for the bullshit they tried to sell us . `` a few years ago , the company was telling brands to increase the number of people following their pages . now it says fans are largely irrelevant . collecting `` likes '' on facebook is still a great way to stay busy without actually accomplishing anything . just look at declining brands like coke . facebook has rigged the system so that if you agree to their terms of service , as far as they 're concerned , you are fair game . ",
        "and if their algorithm likes you , then you are now the new spokesperson for walmart . congratulations . this is not healthy . it is uber-false advertising . it is not ethical . our billionaire friends in the tech industry try to pass themselves off as high-minded visionaries . in fact they are turning out to be corrupt and unconcerned about our rights and privacy . your social media strategy does n't suck because facebook , twitter , youtube and blogs ca n't reach people . it sucks because you 're stuffing it with crap that no one is interested in and that nobody has time to read . ",
        "in the end , it 's still about making marketing uncomplicated . it 's about not looking at people as consumers and start looking at them as individuals . it 's about focusing on your brand website and finally it 's about the understanding that you do n't need social media to sell frozen pizza and ketchup . originally published at www . newmediaandmarketing . com on january 2 , 2018 .
