        "belkin has revealed its upcoming array of mobile charging solution just in time for ces 2018 . the charging accessories , which are already listed on the company 's official website , will range in function from wall chargers to power banks and wireless charging pads . none of the new products are currently available for purchase and are n't meant to be released before late spring or early summer , and prices have not been posted for most of the items as of this writing . however , anybody interested in the updates on the products can visit the belkin store to learn more via the source link below . ",
        "belkin has five wireless charging accessories set to hit the market over the course of this year . each falls under the company 's `` boost up '' brand and each offers 10w of output to ensure that devices compatible with qi fast charging solutions can power up a bit quicker . each is also said to be capable of charging through a 3 mm case . the first of the new charging devices is an update to belkin 's entry-level charging pad , which the company is marketing as the boost up bold . for those who need to be able to charge two devices at once , the company has also revealed a new dual wireless charging pad that has the same features as the first model but comes with a pair of pads . ",
        "that 's followed up by the boost up wireless charging stand . the stand allows more usage flexibility as it can charge a compatible device in either a horizontal or verticle orientation and is said to feature built-in safety mechanisms and premium materials . for on-the-go charging , belkin has also announced a new wireless charging car mount . the accessory includes an additional 1 amp standard usb port to provide users with a second option for charging or for refueling android devices that do n't feature wireless charging support . the boost up-branded wireless charging system , meanwhile , is designed to be mounted on top of a given surface or flush with it , but can also work with sub-surface mounting , the firm said . ",
        "moving past the wireless charging solutions , there has also been a new portable power bank announced by the company . the device features support for qualcomm 's quick charge 3.0 standard via an available usb type-c port and a standard usb port . its design is intended to be small enough to carry in a user 's pocket and is encased in a non-scratch material to prevent damage . called the pocket power usb-c 10k , it can reasonably be assumed that this is a 10,000 mah battery bank . finally , belkin has announced two new fast charging wall chargers . ",
        "both are designed to be plugged into a wall outlet in order to manage power delivery from the socket to a device through a usb type-c port . the first of the two is belkin 's home charger 27w which features a single usb type-c port and is meant to charge larger devices with a maximum output of 27w . the second product is belkin 's dual port home charger 39w . its features nearly mirror those of the home charger 27w but with the addition of a second , standard usb port set to an output of 12w .
