        "i think i have one of the most fowl mouths under the sun . if you 've read any of my previous articles , you 've probably noticed that i am not shy in the slightest about using cussing . i like to think i 've grown up a tiny bit over the last few years and have realized how unattractive it is when someone constantly swears . i obviously am the only one who can control the things that i say but that being said , i do blame my parents and the state of dirty jerz on why i 've picked up on this nasty habit . ",
        "thanks for that , friends . i 'm technically considered an adult now which means i have to start being more wary about how i present myself ; in my spoon articles , on twitter and at my internship on air at wvua23 news . slate broke down the most commonly used swear words in the united states very well so i am going to focus on those in alphabetical order . it 's time i take charge of my excessive swearing issue and come up with a few replacement words . author 's note : any resemblance to persons living or dead is purely coincidental . ",
        "- marc webb , producer of days of summer . let 's get started . 1 . angus angus , as in the type of beef used for hamburgers , is an excellent substitute for the a-word . this version should be used in the context of rear ends . e.g. : `` abigail was being a grade a pain in the angus last night . `` 2 . broccoli so , broccoli is a noun but for this purpose it will act as an adjective . abc family always changes the original word to `` witchy '' when they air mean girls . ",
        "catch my drift ? e. g. : `` brehany has been acting kinda broccoli lately . maybe she hit her quarter life crisis a little early . `` 3 . chickpeas ok , `` crap '' is n't really that serious of a bad word but it has a yucky ring to it in my humble opinion . so let 's give `` chickpeas '' a shot . e.g. : `` ah , chickpeas ! i forgot to get gas last night and i 'm already running late ! `` 4 . dill pickle dill pickle will replace a word that refers to the male anatomy . ",
        "the meaning has sort of evolved , though . most people nowadays use it when referring to a guy who is particularly rude or mean . e.g. : `` dylan totally blew me off last night to go play mario kart with his bros , what a dill pickle move . `` 5 . dragon fruitdragon fruit just became synonymous with the exclamatory phrase `` d*mn it ! '' there 's a sort of silliness but also severity to it depending on how you stress it . e.g. : `` dragon fruit ! my english paper is due at midnight and i 'm only half done , it 's 11:55 pm ! ",
        "`` 6 . fettuccine here 's an f-word alias to be used as an expression for when something goes awry . `` something '' could be stubbing your toe , getting a bad test grade , missing a flight , etc. . e.g. : `` fettuccine ! i forgot to set the oven timer and burnt my cookies ! `` 7 . french toast this one i stole from that iconic orbit gum commercial that aired in 2007 . use this when you 're appalled , disgusted or even just confused ! e. g. : `` what the french toast is going on here ? ",
        "`` 8 . horseradishi hate that stuff . this will be a filler for h-e-double hockey stick in the context of the unpleasant post-life destination . e.g. : `` wait , you did n't send out the general community meeting notes from last night ? go to horseradish , hannah ! `` 9 . prawn prawns are kinda like shrimp , but not exactly the same . that fun fact is not super important for this purpose , though . prawn can stand in for a word that also begins with a `` p '' that is usually followed by the word `` off . ",
        "`` e. g. `` i was pretty prawned off about alabama losing to auburn last week , but i do n't care that much because we made it to the playoffs and they did n't . 10 . shiitake shiitake mushrooms can be found growing on the mountain tops all over asia . the stimulus for this excellent stand-in is a confused austin powers . e.g. : `` david benioff and d. b. weiss really stiffed us with game of thrones season seven episode four -- it was barely 45 minutes long , now that 's some bull shiitake mushrooms right there . ",
        "so to clarify , i shall not judge if you 'd rather continue to cuss like a sailor . there are much worse things you can do than using foul language . like taking vyvanse unprescribed . or pulling too many all-nighters . or binge eating . you get the idea . take cleaning up that dirty mouth into consideration , though . we 're all getting older and that means we need to be cautious . you never know who is listening .
