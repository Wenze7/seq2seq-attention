        "it 's arrived - and with it , probably loads of your relatives . and food , cheese , alcohol and argumentsthe big day is here . after weeks and possibly months of planning , christmas day has arrived . and with it , probably loads of your relatives . and food , cheese , alcohol and arguments ... 7 am - the hangoverdespite your best intentions , and vowing to never ever repeat the worst hangover of all time from last year where you actually emerged back into civilised society the day after boxing day , many may wake up on christmas day feeling a bit delicate . ",
        "somehow that one quick pint at 5 pm on christmas eve spiralled into cocktails and then an ill-advised trip up town for 1 am shots , and now you 've woken up to a wave of regret , nausea and the aftertaste of kebab and after eights , which you stole from under the tree at 2.30 am . and a vague memory of shouting carols at your next door neighbour who heard you falling into the bins . alternatively , you may have had a night in , wrapping the last of your kids ' presents and getting a bit carried away on the eggnog . ",
        "and now you 've got to peel a million potatoes , cook dinner for 16 people , find where you hid the emergency gravy granules you bought back in october and try and undo the damage you created when you tried to build a doll 's house/toy plane at 2 am without reading the instructions . and so it begins ... 9.01 am - the first festive drink a glass of sherry and a handful of quality street is breakfast tradition on christmas day . a tradition that you yourself may very well have started . but tradition nonetheless . ",
        "and the reply to any disapproval will be , ` well , it is christmas ' . a phrase that will be uttered countless times throughout the day in thousands of households - and more or less as the answer to everything . from opening another tub of roses and having one more bottle of wine , to foolishly having a go on your nephew 's new bike and eating all the cheese , despite proclaiming that you could n't possibly eat another thing ever again . 10.35 am - the first falloutit does n't take long for tempers to flare . ",
        "the pressure of having a perfect day , being in close proximity to relatives you normally only see once a year , and people with ` important christmas day tasks ' being too hungover to move , can test the most patient of families . then there 'll be those festive guests who start a bit too early on the pre-dinner drinks , those tired and grumpy from spending all night constructing ridiculously complicated toys and those who are silently seething after being woken at 4 am to let in a drunk person who forgot their key . all the tension usually comes to a head when presents are exchanged , with kids arguing about who got what , people receiving what they gave you the year before , someone being forgotten , endless socks , and rows about there never being enough batteries for any of the new toys to actually work . ",
        "the great gift giving usually ends with someone tutting and saying ` all that mither and it 's over in five minutes ' . then there 'll be angry exclamations about the amount of rubbish and mess generated . especially as the bins wo n't be emptied until three weeks on wednesday . 11.10 am - christmas dinner crisis there 's usually something that goes wrong . forgotten roast potatoes , burnt yorkshires , over-cooked turkey , smashed gravy jugs . but christmas would n't be christmas without a food-based crisis , and the person in charge of the cooking - who insisted they did n't want any help and banished you from the kitchen - going into complete meltdown and vowing never to celebrate christmas again . ",
        "and then there 's that person who forgets to defrost the turkey . and is forever known as the person who ruined christmas . the solution is for the whole family to go to the pub . 2 pm - christmas dinner three hours later you all stumble back home , with a couple of extra guests and a massive turkey from dave down the pub , happily declaring to everyone that it 's a christmas miracle . and then out come the emergency chairs . from folding garden furniture , bar stools , laundry baskets and even the cardboard box for the christmas tree , there is an uncanny ability for northerners to make a chair out of more or less anything , meaning the back rooms of many homes will resemble a festive jumble sale come christmas day . ",
        "but christmas would n't be christmas without seeing all your paper-crown wearing relatives sat at various heights around the dining table / paste table extension - with your uncle towering precariously over the sprouts and your gran disappearing into a beanbag . one relative will be too drunk to even eat , one will sleep through the entire thing , there 'll be at least one argument about politics , gravy will be spilt and the roast potatoes will be accidentally left in the fridge , creating an almost riot . this is usually around the time that the first relative goes home , which coincides with the next big argument about who does the washing up . ",
        "3 pm - the queen 's speechafternoon nap6pm - board games nothing ensures that christmas day will spiral into an angry outbreak of bitterness and resentment than the words ` let 's play a game , it will be fun ' . you can guarantee within minutes of the monopoly board being brought out someone will refuse to play unless they can be the little top hat , the banker will be accused of cheating , dice will be lost , rules angrily debated , old arguments about what happened in the monopoly game of 1998 revisited , someone will cry , and a drunk relative will try and and run off with some of the fake money - even though they are not even playing . ",
        "and do n't get us started on scrabble . or trivial pursuit . all games will eventually be abandoned , with your mum cancelling christmas next year and declaring ` this is why we ca n't have nice things ' . 8 pm - christmas tv as jim royle said : ` christmas is the one day of the year where everyone gets together to watch tv ' . and after a day of arguing over the remote control and what to watch , peace and quiet finally descends as corrie comes on . as everyone gets into the festive spirit , the second tub of quality street comes out , a sherry trifle appears and your aunty even breaks out the ferrero rocher . ",
        "only you ca n't watch coronation street as there 's so many people packed in the front room there 's standing room only . your dad is sprawled asleep on the couch taking up three spaces to the anger of those sat on the floor , and all the emergency seating is being utilised . so you end up sat out in the hallway , watching through a crack in the door , with uncle mike who is having a time out on the stairs . 10.01 pm - bed time you 've had your new christmas pyjamas on since 6 pm , and after an eventful and exhausting day you decide to head off to bed . ",
        "if you 're visiting your old family home then you can guarantee your childhood bed will be surrounded by towers of emergency chairs , a foot spa , a box of borrowed plates , and possibly one or two relatives who went for ` a lie down ' after dinner . every 10 minutes someone will come in to retrieve a coat from the mountain piled on the foot of your bed , and you 'll hear a distant argument still rumbling on about the cost of landing on pall mall and park lane , some commotion about a half-frozen turkey being found in the tumble dryer with your mum 's best towels and at least one person crying . ",
        "the only thing to do is open another bottle of sherry . well , it is christmas . 11.59 pm - just one last bit of cheese the last relative leaves . and after all those naps you find yourself wide awake and a bit hungry . and hungover . so in a pretence of heading to tidy up the broken toys , scattered monopoly pieces and bits of pulled crackers , you head to the kitchen and find an abandoned cheeseboard on the windowsill and a plate of forgotten sausages on sticks . telling yourself that you 've had nothing proper to eat since a round of turkey sandwiches during doctor who , you tuck in . ",
        "the next thing you know it 's 8 am and you wake up in an armchair , wearing a crumpled paper crown and covered in crumbs , bits of cheese , bombay mix , pringles and the posh quiche for the boxing day buffet . as you vow never to eat this much ever again , your mum pops her head round the door and offers you a vol-au-vent and a glass of sherry . well , it is boxing day .
