        "this software-as-a-service provider is profitable and growing fast , which makes today 's price a bargain . the raging bull market has vaulted the pe ratio of the s&p 500 to above 25 . that 's quite expensive when compared to historic norms , which is making it hard for die-hard stock pickers like me to find compelling opportunities . however , even in today 's pricey market , i think i 've found a wonderful stock to buy : appfolio . this software-as-a-service provider is growing fast , well managed , and still has plenty of room to run . ",
        "here 's why it 's a stock that i 'd be happy to pull the trigger on right now . image source : getty images . what it doesappfolio is a software-as-a-service business that focuses on the needs of small and medium-sized businesses . the company got its start by catering to the unique needs of property managers . to this day more than 90 % of total revenue is still earned from its property management business . why would a property manager choose to do business with appfolio ? the answer lies in the company 's all-in-one , cloud-based solution . ",
        "once a customer gets setup they can manage all facets of their business with appfolio 's platform . this includes scores of mission-critical tasks like contracting , billing , collections , reporting , background check , tenant screening , and more . these features make it easy for property managers to keep their assets performing at the highest level possible . image source : appfolio . how does appfolio monetize its growing user base ? in three primary ways : users pay subscription fees to remain on the platform . this accounts for about 39 % of appfolio 's total revenue . ",
        "customers pay a fee whenever they use one of the company 's optional services , which the company refers to as `` value + services . '' this is a catch-all category that includes add-on tasks like payment processing , lead management , website hosting , and more . in total , value + services account for about 57 % of revenue . new customers pay a small onboarding fee . this category accounts for about 4 % of revenue . while the company 's property management software accounts for the lion 's share of revenue , appfolio also has a growing business that caters to the needs of small law firms . ",
        "called mycase , this solution helps lawyers with tasks like secured file sharing , time tracking , billing , and more . are appfolio 's services catching on ? here 's a look at the company 's customer count over the last few years : customer count 2014 2015 2016 2017 property manager customers 5,885 8,218 10,038 11,250 * property manager units 1.68 million 2.15 million 2.68 million 3.1 million * law firm customers 3,663 6,145 8,135 9,200 ** as of september 30 , 2017 . data source : appfolio . the growing customer count has allowed appfolio 's revenue to soar from $ 47 million in 2014 to an estimated $ 140 million to $ 141 million in 2017 . ",
        "that 's a lightning-fast pace . and yet , as great as these numbers have been , there 's still reason to believe that appfolio 's growth engine is just getting started . management estimates that its market opportunity within the property management business exceeds $ 5.0 billion annually in the u. s. alone . you can tack on another $ 2 billion when adding in the opportunity ahead of mycase . sparkling financialsmany high-growth software companies are happy to sacrifice near-term profits for explosive user growth . while this growth-at-any-cost strategy can work out well for investors in some cases -- just take a look at a long-term chart of shopify , workday , or splunk for proof -- running at a loss on purpose also greatly increases a company 's risk profile . ",
        "thankfully , this is n't a trade appfolio 's management team has to contemplate anymore . appfolio has been profitable for four quarters in a row , which suggests that the company has reached enough scale that it can invest for growth and still generate profits at the same time . that 's an attractive combination that i believe helps to reduce the company 's risk profile substantially . what 's more , appfolio also boasts a rock-solid balance sheet that has $ 64 million in cash and no debt . that 's a war chest that gives this company plenty of financial firepowers to keep the growth pedal to the metal . ",
        "moving forward , appfolio 's profits should expand at a faster rate than revenue thanks to favorable operating leverage . investors should applaud that fact . a strong cultureanother factor that makes appflolio a compelling long-term investment is its vibrant and engaged workforce . the company earns a strong 4.6 out of 5 stars on glassdoor . com , and ceo jason randall boasts a 100 % approval rating . given these numbers , perhaps it is n't surprising to see that appfolio has won numerous awards , including best places to work and highest-rated ceo . i also like that appfolio 's founders -- dr. klaus schauser and jonathan walker -- are still heavily involved with the business . ",
        "they currently occupy the roles of chief strategist and chief technology officer , respectively . image source : getty images . i 'm a big believer that cultivating an energized workforce can do wonders for talent and customer retention rates in the long term . that bodes well for this company 's continued success . appfolio is a buybetween its rock-solid business model , strong leadership team , wonderful financial statements , and huge growth opportunity ahead , appfolio is a company i greatly admire . in fact , the biggest knock i have against appfolio is that wall street has caught on to this company 's growth story . ",
        "shares are currently trading at more than 10 times sales and more than 77 times next year 's earnings estimates , both of which are pricy figures . if the company fails to deliver eye-popping growth numbers , then its shareholders could be in for a world of hurt . despite the high price tag , i 'd still think appfolio is an attractive enough business to warrant a purchase today . in case you think those are empty words , you should know that i plan on adding to my personal position as soon as the fool 's trading rules allow .
