        "the ideal form , equipment , and conditions for the first bobsled push . leg powercombined , the team 's legs can exert 3,855 watts , enough to light up 64 bulbs . mike sudal1 . on trackpicture a bobsled course as three sections : a 49-foot segment where athletes get their sleigh moving ahead of the starting line ; a 65-to 100-foot portion they use to build up speed after the clock starts ; and the remaining 4,000 or so feet down which they ride , twisting and turning , to the finish line . the first few runs of the day are always faster : each one creates more friction-increasing ruts , upping times . ",
        "2 . musclemana two-person bobsled team includes a pilot , who steers the sleigh , and a brakeman , who does most of the pushing . this athlete must generate enough force to break the inertia of a 375-pound sled . he needs preconditioned fast-twitch muscles : larger tissue fibers capable of short , sudden exertions . that 's why bobsled scouts often recruit sprinters from track and field or wide receivers from football . 3 . the big pushwhen the buzzer rings , the brakeman steps onto the ice , gripping two handles on the sled 's rear . ",
        "he bends his knees , leans forward , and might lock his arms straight : this directs the force for the initial push horizontally , directly from the athlete 's legs -- not his relatively weak arms . exerting a combined 5 horsepower , the team can bring the sled from zero to up to 15 miles per hour in just two seconds . 4 . aerodynamic outfittersair drags on a fast-moving sleigh , slowing it down . and the faster it moves , the greater that backward pressure grows . so designers give a bobsled a rounded , conical nose . ",
        "as it moves , this pointy prow splits the air , decreasing wind resistance . the humans also make their bodies more aerodynamic by wearing skintight compression-fabric suits that help further reduce drag . 5 . slip and slidein ideal race conditions -- a freezing , sunny day -- a thin , unnoticeable film of water forms on the ice , making the surface extra slippery . steel-alloy runners , sanded and shined , further decrease friction to allow the sled to slide . to improve traction , competitors wear shoes covered in 350 to 400 spiky steel needles , which cut into the ice with each step , allowing their feet to get a grip on the slick stuff . ",
        "6 . closing timeafter that initial push , the athletes cross the starting line and continue pushing for another 65 to 100 feet . then the pilot hops in , bringing the total weight on the brakeman up to about 575 pounds . he runs a few more steps , until his legs ca n't crank any faster , and jumps in just before the sleigh reaches 25 miles per hour . if perfectly executed , the push can shave enough time to put a team on the podium . this article was originally published in the january/february 2018 power issue of popular science .
