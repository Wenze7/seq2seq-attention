        "facebook caught some heat for pushing people to use the messenger app a few years back , but that may actually have been a kindness . messenger was a much better app than the main facebook client . although , over time messenger has become rather bloated and clunky in its own right . the head of messenger now admits the app is too cluttered , and changes are on the way . facebook 's plans for messenger in the coming year are detailed in a new post by messenger chief david marcus . in it , he makes a number of predictions about how messenger will be used in 2018 , but only a few items are actual changes on facebook 's end . ",
        "among his general predictions , marcus says more businesses will use messenger for support and that `` visual messaging will fully explode in 2018 . `` as for the clutter , marcus does n't have much of an excuse . he says the team just raced to add too many features without realizing how cluttered the app was becoming . messenger used to be about sending messages , but now it has customer service bots , games , payments , and more . facebook recently launched a `` lite '' version of messenger for developing countries , but people all over the world wanted to use it . ",
        "marcus promises a radical clean-up operation to make the app easier to use . that might include pulling features that have n't found success and streamlining some others . try not to get too hyped -- facebook 's idea of streamlining might differ from yours . source : facebook .   "
