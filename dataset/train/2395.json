        "i work in customer interaction solutions and i remember in the late 1990s when voice was king . 1800 , 0800 & 0130 numbers were sprouting everywhere . call volumes were growing , and businesses needed to better handle this growing channel . interactive voice response systems came to the rescue , allowing for segmentation of calls and later providing self-service experiences completely without a live agent involved . today , the telephone is no longer the only way your customers contact you . dimension data reported earlier this year in their annual benchmark report that the average number of channels contact centers offered to customers is 8 and expected to rise to 11 by 2018 . ",
        "most businesses admit to being challenged in handling the inquiries from their customers and are looking for solutions to manage this . this is where for many artificial intelligence is being seen as that `` coming to the rescue '' technology which will provide the automation businesses are looking for . what is artificial intelligence ? artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence by machines and comprises a number of technologies . natural language processing , or nlp is computers processing human language . a great example of nlp is spam detection . looking at the subject and body of an email and determining if it is spam . ",
        "nlp , like the ivr also allows for segmentation or classification of incoming requests as well as entity extraction which can then be used to best route the request and prepare the agent for response . along with nlp , machine learning is where ai can learn from interactions and improve over time . artificial intelligence in communications will remove friction , make for smoother , more efficient experiences benefitting both the user and the business . i want to cover 5 areas where ai may sooner or later play a part in your business . ai & messagingtext messaging can be as simple as sms , a web chat option on a webpage or a mobile messaging application . ",
        "all provide similar experiences ; typing short messages back and forth while carrying on a conversation . a text chat session with a customer can extend for a long period of time as there are delays in responding since it is not completely a real-time medium . automation here shortens the initial exchange ; collection of name , intent and any other initial details before bringing a live agent into the conversation would be a benefit . this is very similar to how many ivr solutions work today . providing a more efficient conversation once a live agent is involved . ",
        "enter chatbotsmost of you will have heard of chatbots by now . the subject of chatbots exploded onto the market in 2016 when facebook announced their messenger platform would support them and within 6 months there were over 18000 chatbots on the platform . many if not most , have been less than satisfying . messaging is hugely popular thanks much to apps like whatsapp and co and if any of you have children under 20 then you have one of these apps . even some businesses are trying out methods to add messaging to their channels of interacting with clients . ",
        "avaya has with their messaging automation released a solution which allows you to connect your social messaging channels to your contact center . messaging automation also provides nlp to initially interact with the customer , collecting all inputs , providing feedback and sending the customer to the right queue for agent handling . a seamless handover is guaranteed . avaya is also working with other ai messaging solutions which allows clients the flexibility to utilize the ideal solution for their business . ai & textwhile messaging is also text-based communication i separated this one out as here i wanted to share what is happening with email automation . ",
        "intelligent handling of emails has long been a challenge as emails may contain multiple intents as well as sentiments . avaya is working together with ityx , bringing their expertise in email automation into the avaya world . their 20-year experience in applying nlp and ml to the model of text analysis , insight extraction all the way to suggested responses quickly adds a new dimension to avaya 's solution capability . ai & imagesin the days after hurricane harvey hit houston , texas this summer , 100s of unmanned drones were flying over the damaged areas of the city . ",
        "the majority of those drones were brought in by insurance companies flying over their properties , taking photos and videos of the damage . artificial intelligence 's image recognition is used to then analyze the photos and extract specific details ; how high is the water over the car or is the roof of a house intact . google 's cloud vision api allows for anyone to try this . upload any photo and within seconds insights will be returned . avaya is working with a number of clients on adding similar functionality to their claims processing , taking photos attached to emails , extracting details and insights . ",
        "these insights can then be added to the request or ticket before an agent looks at the photos themselves . ai & voicevoice is the most natural way to communicate and for many voice is still their go-to channel . ai is now taking that ivr experience , which has grown from pressing buttons to speaking phrases to natural language now to what i call ivr 4.0 . some have begun calling this ` intelligent voice response ' . the power of nlp again here is providing a conversational interface which mimics live speech . speaking to these new solutions like you would speak to a person , asking questions , giving commands and having these executed . ",
        "gone are the days of menu trees and endless-loop options . avaya is working with nuance and 2 others excelling in this space to make this a natural extension of the voice service offered to customers . in addition to ivr 4.0 there is increasing interest in the world of virtual assistants . siri , google now , alexa and others can be used to interact with businesses as well . a few banks in germany have begun to add early features , accessing basic public data and playing this back via voice . we will see more interest and work in the next 12 months in this space . ",
        "ai & userswhile not a ` channel ' like those above , the role of ai in assisting users and businesses may be equally impressive . applications like ` intelligent pairing ' bringing the right agent together with the right customer to deliver the best results . agent augmentation or assistance will provide additional learned insights to improve cross or upselling and better next-best-actions . workforce optimization with improved traffic volumes and absence predictions . advanced ai analytics will provide deeper insights into sentiment changes and trending topics to better drive your business . avaya is working with companies like afiniti , cogito & scoredata bringing their solutions to enhance our solutions .
