        "a teenage girl tragically died just days after she was out partying with her friends -- completely oblivious to the fact she had terminal cancer . ellie walsh had been celebrating christmas eve with her friends without a care in the world when three days later she fell gravely ill . the 18-year-old from lincolnshire , england underwent surgery after a scan revealed a tumor in her stomach . lincolnshire is about 110 miles north of london . but there were complications during the lengthy procedure and despite the best efforts of doctors , she passed away . mom emma walsh , 37 , says she never got the chance to properly say goodbye . ",
        "`` we did n't realize just how ill ellie was , '' she said . `` she had tummy pains for a few years and then about five weeks ago , a scan showed she had a tumor . '' `` we have been going to the doctors since 2014 as she has lost a lot of weight and had bad pains in her side but it was always passed off and she was given paracetamol . '' `` she died during the operation but before she went in i told her i loved her and that i would see her later . '' ",
        "`` when they told me i was in shock and my head went into a spin . you could see they were upset but they did all they could . '' `` i would n't wish that on anybody though . '' she had just embarked on her career having just been taken on as a receptionist after impressing as an apprentice at law firm burton and co. . but while her death has come as a surprise , her mom has taken comfort from the fact that the pair got to spend a final christmas together and that her baby girl was able to live a normal life right until the end . ",
        "`` it is a shock , '' she added . `` ellie was out on christmas eve with her friends . '' `` she was quite a private person and had a small group of friends , but they have stuck by her all the way through school . '' `` they loved partying and even though ellie was usually quiet , she would talk to anyone on a night out . '' `` i am taking comfort from the fact ellie got to do all the things she wanted to do as had she had known , she would n't have enjoyed herself as much . '' ",
        "the distraught mom has since learned that the growth in her daughter 's stomach was likely cancer and even if the operation had been a success then ellie would have still most likely only have had a few months left to live . and she is glad that people will be able to remember her daughter for the bright and smiley girl she was . `` ellie was so kind and funny , '' she said . `` she was a great sister and daughter . '' `` she had a great sense of humor but was so brave . ",
        "i will miss her for ever . '' tributes have appeared online since ellie 's death was made public and her mom said that has really helped the family during a difficult time . `` i want to say thanks to everyone who has got in touch , '' she added . `` the nice things said about ellie have been a real comfort . '' `` both lincoln and sheffield hospitals were great as well . '' mary-anne mcnulty also paid a heartfelt tribute to her best friend of 14 years . she said : `` i went to primary school with ellie and we started secondary school together until she left to go to lsst , but we still remained as close as ever . '' ",
        "`` ellie was a kind , generous , beautiful and funny young girl . she will always remain my best friend and she will never be forgotten . '' an exact cause of death has yet to be determined .   "
