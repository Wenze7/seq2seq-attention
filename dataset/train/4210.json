        "he enjoys arcade style games . the post nier : automata creator yoko taro loves developers housemarque appeared first on playstation lifestyle . giant bomb has spoken with eccentric developer yoko taro , creator of the nier and drakengard series , about his 10 favorite games of the year . his picks are all interesting , but three games on his list come from developer housemarque . seems he likes that developer a lot ! here 's what taro had to say about housemarque : i 'd like to introduce housemarque , a developer that i love , with my top third , fourth and fifth titles . ",
        "with these three releases , we were able to enjoy games with great craftsmanship and gameplay . however , housemarque has recently released a statement that they are going to stop developing arcade style games . just as it is for cave , whom i mentioned earlier , this makes me really sad . i do want to believe that `` a new era will be born , and i want to be excited for new styles of games that will come out of it . '' however , i 'm 47 already , and i ca n't really imagine a future in which i 'm devoted to a new genre . ",
        "this was an incident ... that made me think that us , the players , will also fall and be left behind by the times as well . but what 's taro 's favorite game ? it 's a bit surprising : 1 . animal crossing : pocket campfrom the 3ds title , i have felt that the animal crossing series has a weird strangeness , or many gaps , in it . what lies beyond that strangeness is never explained in the game , so we have to imagine it for ourselves . but that made me think of how nintendo really is a great developer for being able to create a game that lets us imagine many things for ourselves , when the current trend in gaming is the sense of obligation to `` explain everything '' within the game . ",
        "check out giant bomb article for the full list . have you played any of housemarque 's games ? the post nier : automata creator yoko taro loves developers housemarque appeared first on playstation lifestyle .   "
