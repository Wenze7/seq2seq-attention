        "they now hope excavated remnants of flight sergeant emrys lewis 's plane can be displayed in merseysidea merseyside grandmother is looking forward to officially commemorating her heroic uncle after the solving of a 77-year mystery surrounding his death during world war ii . beryl wilson , nee lewis , 81 , from melling , wants to see the rolls royce engine and other artefacts from the spitfire aircraft , in which 24-year-old flight sergeant emrys ivor lewis tragically crashed on july 4 , 1940 , put on display in merseyside . this follows the excavation of the aircraft by a team of aviation enthusiasts , together with archaeologists from winchester university , which took place recently on farmland in the village of south owersby , near market rasen , lincolnshire -- with all the aircraft parts found now being cleaned up . ",
        "the spitfire had been 20 feet underground , and the excavation took place over two days late last year , with beryl and two of her four children -- karen wilson from blundellsands , and janet cahill from huyton -- there on the second day . a minute 's silence was held following the excavation , before a spitfire performed a flypast and victory roll in memory of emrys . on the day emrys died , he had been on a gunnery exercise over the channel -- while in the weeks before , he had conducted reconnaissance flights over dunkirk and belgium in the build up to the start of the battle of britain . ",
        "as he returned to his lincolnshire base on his fatal final flight , emrys got into difficulties flying through thick cloud . meet 96 year old ` lofty ' carr who survived on carrots after `` legging it '' from the germans in ww2the excavation was filmed and is expected to be included in a tv programme about the battle of britain currently being made by a production company , and to hopefully be screened later this year . grandmother-of-three beryl said : `` the enthusiasts who did the excavation were marvellous . i ca n't thank them enough . ",
        "they were so considerate and so reverent . they have promised to give me a propeller , which will be mounted . the only personal possession i am aware of is my uncle 's cigarette case , which has already been cleaned up . `` the rolls royce engine is pretty much intact and i am looking forward to what was found being put on display somewhere in merseyside once it is all cleaned up , because emrys was a liverpool boy . the enthusiasts have said they will be in touch when everything is ready . '' although beryl , emrys 's next of kin , had heard , growing up , that her uncle 's body had been escorted back to liverpool before being buried in a family grave in deiniolen , gwynedd , north wales , following a military funeral , she did not know for sure -- until recently -- that his body was actually recovered from the wreckage at the time of his death . ",
        "colin laneremarkable woman finally given world war two medal - 72 years lateshe said : `` that was a relief , but it was also a very upsetting experience . i went to the excavation site with trepidation because of the uncertainty . i was dreading them finding anything , because this would have led to an exhumation of his grave in north wales . `` i was always told the only person who was allowed to identify emrys was my grandfather , but whether he actually did or not i 've never known for sure . it was suspected there might still be some of emrys 's remains at the crash site , but we now know that is not the case . '' ",
        "the team of aviation enthusiasts from across the uk were given permission for the excavation by the ministry of defence -- under the protection of military remains act -- and the landowner . emrys was the brother of beryl 's father , leslie , and one of three boys . he was born in liverpool 's oxford street maternity hospital and lived in eton street , walton . he was unmarried , and joined the raf at 20 . colin lanevery rare d-day `` paradummy '' found after 73 years - in liverpool loftberyl explained : `` i had been told emrys 's spitfire came down in grantham . '' ",
        "and her daughter janet added : `` we had never been able to locate exactly where he was , and it was also unclear whether his remains were still in the ground . but a team of enthusiasts , led by gareth jones , have been investigating this story for six years . `` i suppose it 's difficult to know if information about emrys was made available at the time , because mum , who is now the next of kin , was so young then -- just four-years-old . `` it 's so very sad that emrys lost his life but , on the positive side , we now know that he was indeed brought back to liverpool and then buried in a family grave , where his mum and dad are also buried .
