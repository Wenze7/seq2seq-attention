        "fsu football is reportedly kicking the tires on former players in the program to fall remaining assistant jobs -- is that the best to move forward ? in the coming days following fsu football 's appearance in the independence bowl , the coaching staff for the 2018 season will take shape as new head coach willie taggart will focus on filling the remaining assistant positions that will open once the 2017 season officially comes to an end and those not returning will be moving on . currently , taggart has hired three assistant coaches to fill positions that are currently vacate to do coaches leaving for other jobs . ",
        "coming in next season will be new tight ends coach telly lockette along with running backs coach donte ' pimpleton and linebackers / special teams coordinator raymond woodie -- both coming with taggart from oregon . depending on who you speak with , taggart could be searching to hire at least four former fsu football stars to fill coaching positions on his new staff -- joining a fifth in defensive line and interim head coach odell haggins , who taggart is retaining for next season . the one generating the most attention is at wide receiver , where former national title winner ron dugans is reportedly being wooed to return to his hometown from his current job coaching receivers at the university of miami . ",
        "the miami herald reported last week that dugans was not committal when asked whether he would be staying with the hurricanes next season . another position of attention is at offensive line , where current segment coach rick trickett confirmed the bowl game will be his last with the seminoles . a name that keeps popping up is current michigan ol coach greg frey , who played on the 1993 national title team . finally , you have the defensive backs coaching spot -- currently held by defensive coordinator charles kelly , who will be saying goodbye after the season . ",
        "two names that pop up are both thorpe award winners during their time at florida state -- the serious name being terrell buckley , who spent five seasons as a ga and strength coach with the noles before becoming an assistant at akron , louisville and now mississippi state . the joking name has been that of fsu football legend deion sanders , who raised eyebrows when telling a twitter user `` you never know '' about the chances of him coming back to coach defensive backs -- a comment that was retweeted by taggart . as someone who grew up idolizing all four of those names watching the seminoles -- as well as chris weinke , who is has been reported did n't take a job at tennessee possibly because of a potential offer from the noles -- it would be fun to watch them come back and bring the noles back to title contention after this season ... but is it the best move ? ",
        "almost all the players on the fsu football roster were n't alive when buckley , frey and sanders were dominating in garnet and gold -- many of them know about what the two defensive backs did in the pro game -- and were small children when dugans and weinke won the 1999 crown . some may have studied the history and have the proper respect , but you have to wonder if all would have to come in and prove themselves at their alma mater -- something that those greats may not be prepared to do . in some cases , it is n't the best thing to go home again -- but willie taggart , in his introductory press conference , made it very clear he wants to return the seminoles to the consistent winning that occurred when all the names i mentioned were part of the program .
