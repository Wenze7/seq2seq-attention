        "states with legal weed should brace for legal battles should sessions follow through with federal marijuana crackdowns . by zach haller | january 4 , 2018attorney general jeff sessions announced thursday that he would rescind an obama-era policy that paved the way for legalized weed to flourish in states across the country . politico explains : in a long-awaited move , the justice department chief withdrew federal guidelines that effectively limited prosecutions of businesses and individuals who sold pot in a legal manner under state law , even though the drug remains illegal under federal law . sessions said future prosecutions would be up to individual u. s. attorneys . ",
        "however , the announcement appeared intended to discourage marijuana-related business by being deliberately vague about future federal enforcement efforts . the new approach will probably increase confusion about the legal risk of marijuana-related activity in states that have passed legislation allowing people to grow , buy or use pot . americans keeping tabs on the fight for legal weed would notice sessions ' past and present remarks on marijuana policy have been somewhat vague , and may or may not be further cause for concern depending how states enforce them . sessions ' claim that marijuana , a drug that has never killed anyone , is on the same level as heroin , a substance far more deadly and dangerous , illustrates how warped america 's criminal justice system is ; given the money talking on behalf of the private prison , pharmaceutical , and alcohol industries most financially invested in weed 's prohibition , americans must take on both corporate and government adversaries in this struggle .

        "fortunately , not even the president wants the feds to infringe on state 's rights when it comes to their laws on marijuana ; not only is it bad policy from a state perspective , it complicates decriminalization : if federal prosecutors are now able to enforce federal law in states where marijuana is legal , more will enter the prison system for doing something their state legalized , creating uphill legal battles as states defend their rights and the rights of their residents . jeff sessions ' going after marijuana is dumb , but it 's also anti-freedom and anti-federalismon thursday , the associated press learned that attorney general sessions is rescinding an obama-era policy that allowed ... www .

        "washingtonexaminer . comit remains to be seen how sessions ' guidance on federal marijuana programs would work in tandem with the trump administration 's july decision to name america 's horrific opioid crisis a public health emergency based on the rapidly escalating epidemic of opioid use and addiction . marijuana legalization in colorado has already led to a reversal of opiate overdose deaths in the state , according to research published in the american journal of public health . marijuana often effectively at treats the same types of chronic pain that patients are prescribed opiates for ; given the choice between pot and pills , many patients are now opting for the natural option .

        "earlier this year , trump 's doj levied charges against 412 defendants , including 56 doctors , accused of defrauding taxpayers around $ 1.3 billion , the largest opioid-related fraud takedown in american history . one would hope sessions will continue targeting far more dangerous white collar criminals ; if anything , sessions should be addressing the horrific racial bias and corrupt policing at the center of america 's crooked war on weed . analysis | attorney general sessions wants to know the science on marijuana and opioids . here it is ... speaking this morning before the national association of attorneys general , u. s. attorney general jeff sessions ... www .

        "washingtonpost . comregardless of the omens , those fighting `` the good fight '' in opposition to questionable trump administration policies will need to be more diligent in their scrutiny and louder in their activism . in addition to being a true cash crop that can bring much needed funding to our schools , cannabis itself can be used for countless other purposes that will help the transition to a literally greener society and economy once it is federally decriminalized . all kinds of weed-related businesses sprouting up show how the weed industry is already massively stimulating the economy ; notwithstanding federal interference , they can and should continue to flourish .

        "fortunately , leaders like washington attorney general bob ferguson are defending voter-approved state laws as sessions threatens regressive action . americans should identify leaders in their local communities and prepare to fight from the bottom up . 1 . we must decriminalize cannabis . many states have yet to take the first step : decriminalization . shamefully , cannabis remains on the schedule i list of controlled substances under u. s. federal law . this is particularly galling following the release of a 22-year-old interview published in harper 's magazine in which former nixon domestic policy chief john ehrlichman told explained how the war on weed took root : `` the nixon campaign in 1968 , and the nixon white house after that , had two enemies : the antiwar left and black people ... we knew we could n't make it illegal to be either against the war or black , but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin . ",
        "and then criminalizing both heavily , we could disrupt those communities ... we could arrest their leaders , raid their homes , break up their meetings , and vilify them night after night on the evening news . did we know we were lying about the drugs ? of course we did . '' this shocking revelation confirmed suspicions that there are indeed ulterior motives behind america 's policing of weed-related crimes that have long disproportionately targeted and afflicted minority communities . incumbent politicians at all levels have no ground supporting the prohibition , and should move toward a progressive stance on this issue before it disqualifies them to incoming waves of voters in 2018 , particularly youth and millennials . ",
        "2 . we must legalize medicinal and recreational use . the next step following weed decriminalization is the legalization of medicinal , and then recreational , cannabis usage . cnn 's weed , a surprisingly engrossing and well-done documentary from dr. sanjay gupta , is a must-watch for those skeptical of the benefits of weed . marijuana can be used as a treatment alternative for symptoms of virtually any ailment , mental or physical , and all people in america and elsewhere deserve the opportunity to seek it out as the natural remedy that it is . in recent years , following the lead of colorado and washington ; oregon , alaska , maine , massachusetts , nevada , and california have taken steps forward advancing access toward legal recreational weed use .

        "3 . we must pardon nonviolent drug offenders . in his final hours of the presidency , obama commuted the sentences of 330 nonviolent drug offenders ; in the alternate universe where obama was as progressive in deed as he was in word , he would have pardoned all nonviolent drug offenders in our country . in every instance , americans should push elected officials to issue these commutations as often as possible to mitigate the unacceptable racial disparity in america 's justice system . pity the sad legacy of barack obama | cornel westeight years ago the world was on the brink of a grand celebration : the inauguration of a brilliant and charismatic ... www .

        "theguardian . comuntil all 50 states and the federal government have decriminalized weed , americans should fight tooth and nail to advance legislation and candidates supportive of drug policy reform . this opposition must continue until there is n't even a trace of stigma remaining in our society against marijuana usage . it is both good for the goose and good for the gander to give americans and their communities full access to the myriad benefits of weed legalization , and to rid the negative effects of weed 's prohibition . every state is in its own place with marijuana laws ; considering how intertwined the issue is with advancing criminal justice reform and reversing the toxic influence of big pharma , the fight for legal weed is in many ways a true moral crusade .
