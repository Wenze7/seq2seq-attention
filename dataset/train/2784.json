        "computed tomography market analysis says it 's an imaging procedure that uses special x-ray equipment to create detailed pictures , or scans , of areas inside the body . it is also called as ct tomography and computerized axial tomography . in the computed tomography market analysis , addition to its use in cancer , ct scan machine is widely used to help diagnose circulatory system diseases and conditions , such as coronary artery diseases , blood vessel aneurysms , and blood clots spinal conditions , kidney and bladder stones , abscesses , inflammatory diseases , such as ulcerative colitis and sinusitis , and injuries to the head , skeletal system and internal organs .

        "ct can be a lifesaving tools for diagnosing illness and injury in both children and adults . scope & regional forecast of the computed tomography market analysisthe most modern computed tomography scan machines take continuous pictures in a helical fashion rather than taking a series of pictures of individual 's slices of the body . as the original ct machines did . helical ct has a number of advantages over older ct techniques . it is much faster ; producer 's better 3d pictures of regions inside the body , and this may detect small irregularities better . the newest ct scanners , called multi-slice ct multi-detector ct machine , allow more slices to be imaged in a shorter period of time .

        "north america , asia-pacific , latin america , and europe along with the rest of the world are playing an important role in terms of adoption and economic development . increase in the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases , orthopedic disorders and cancer , growing the popularity in ct scan diagnosis centers and increase demand for high quality of health care delivery . the statistics of the present computed tomography market analysis states a continuous technological advances and growing awareness amongst everyone is the vital driving factor . there 's estimation that ct scanner technology is expected to reach nearly $ 5.1 billion by the end of 2017 .
