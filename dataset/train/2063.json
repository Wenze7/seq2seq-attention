        "last week it emerged that apple has plans to discontinue the current iphone x model once the company introduces its 2018 iphone lineup later this fall . the news comes courtesy of reputed analyst ming chi-kuo who relays that apple 's next-gen iphone lineup will feature two brand new devices with edgeless displays , one being a 6.5-inch iphone with an oled display and the other being a 6.1-inch iphone with an lcd display . the current 5.8-inch iphone x , meanwhile , will be discontinued . following up on his initial investor note , kuo released a new report today which sheds a bit more light on apple 's strategy here . ",
        "as kuo details , apple is of the mind that if the current iphone x is available at a discount , it would eat into sales of apple 's brand new devices . kuo 's note reads in part : iphone x would hurt product brand value & lineup of 2h18 new models if it continues to sell at a lower price after 2h18 new models launch : lowering iphone x 's price after the 2h18 new models launch would be a negative to product brand value given 3d sensing and oled display are features of the new high-price model . ",
        "additionally , to sell iphone x at a lower price may have a negative impact on shipments of the new 6.1 â€³ lcd iphone in 2h18 . thus , we estimate iphone x will reach end-of-life around the middle of 2018 . at this point , it remains unclear what apple 's 2018 iphone lineup is going to look like . presumably , a next-gen version of the current 5.8-inch iphone x will be released alongside the aforementioned 6.5-inch model , which will likely be positioned as an iphone x plus . it also remains unclear what will come of existing iphone models that still incorporate touch id . ",
        "given apple 's penchant for having different iphone models at a variety of price points , we have to imagine that the iphone 7 will stick around as an affordable option for users looking to save some cash or who still are n't ready to embrace face id . incidentally , there are rumblings that apple in just a few months will release a revamped version of the iphone se . as a final point of interest , if reports about the current iphone x being end-of-lifed next year pan out , it would mark the first time in iphone history that a previous year 's model was not made available at a cheaper price point once next-gen models are released .
