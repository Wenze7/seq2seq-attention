        "amid the mud and wreckage of montecito 's east valley road thursday , scent dogs stella and decker stood with a five-member search-and-rescue team outside a destroyed home . before the men and dogs approached the structure however , the san diego-based team reviewed a number of potential dangers -- gas leaks , moving water , hidden swimming pools , electrical wires and deep mud . `` there 's astronomical safety hazards going on here , '' said scott fuller , logistics team manager with cal task force 8 . the two-legged searchers had duct tape wrapped around their pant legs to keep mud from sucking their boots off . ",
        "neither stella nor decker wore boots , though . `` ok , search , '' handler brent brainard called out to decker , a black labrador and weimaraner mix . decker raced off along debris piles in the backyard , trying to catch a scent of survivors . when people survive disasters such as the huge mudslide that struck montecito on tuesday , brainard said , they tend to find empty spaces where they can wait things out . brainard kept a close eye on decker as he balanced on piles of trees reaching to the house 's second story . ",
        "during the search , decker passed broken tables , downed trees and household items that had been flushed outside . as each pile was searched , pink tape was placed on trees to show that it had been checked . as decker moved closer to the house , however , he was suddenly swallowed by mud . `` oh , a swimming pool ! '' brainard shouted . `` decker just went in ! '' after scrambling to rescue decker , it was stella 's turn to investigate the area . she disappeared into the pool too -- this time at the other end . ",
        "after both dogs were back on solid ground and had shaken off the muck , the team prepared to move on , but not before they wrote `` pool '' on the wall outside the property . `` we 've never had to go through mud like that , '' said matthew kirk , stella 's handler of eight years . `` it 's definitely very challenging . '' had decker or stella found a survivor , the dogs would be given toys as a reward . stella gets a plush toy instead of the typical old fire hose that 's given to other dogs . ",
        "that 's because she 's missing half her jaw due to a tumor that was removed last june . the fire hose is too tough on her jaw brainard agreed with kirk that the conditions in montecito were entirely new . `` i have n't been on anything like this in california before , '' said brainard , who has had decker for four years . he got decker from the national disaster search dog foundation . `` this is next level -- the trees , the electrical wires , the gas we just discovered , this place is a wreck , '' fuller said . ",
        "it reminded him of katrina . he did a reconnaissance flight over the area . `` the thoughts inside my head were like , how are they ever going to recover from that . and i look at this and i go , how are these people ever going to recover from this ? but they will . with resilience , help from the state and feds , a lot of hard work . they will somehow . '' illinois sen. richard durbin , the senate 's second-ranking democrat , said president trump `` said things which were hate-filled , vile and racist '' during a meeting on thursday . ",
        "he referred to countries in africa , central america and the caribbean . `` this is going to be a long and difficult journey '' - santa barbara county sheriff bill brownthe death toll from massive debris flows that buried homes and cars under a torrent of mud and boulders rose to 17 in montecito . issa becomes second california republican to announce retirement as democrats look to reclaim house .
