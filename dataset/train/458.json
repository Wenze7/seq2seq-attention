        "it was a hard day and i was n't in mood for working . so i was just staring at the computer screen and desperately making myself do something . i used some methods that 'd helped me a lot . and i want to share them with you ! 1 . do n't get overwhelmedwhether you think that your task is hard or you 've got too much to do , you can do it . think of this work is a piece of the puzzle that 's helping you along your career path . you should not think that this work is frustrating , impossible or difficult for you . ",
        "just do it ! and after that you will be proud of yourself , because you 've made it . also it 'd be useful to create a `` got done '' list and outline all the tasks that you 've completed . you will see the progress of your work . for extra motivation , it should be in your sight for you to see the results . 2 . skill varietyyou feel like you are doing the same boring work day after day ? of course it 's not so stimulating . however if you are doing different things , it will motivate you . ",
        "so try to structure your day and work on different tasks . for example , instead of creating a presentation all day long , try to do some smaller things each day . thus you will stimulate different parts of the brain , and your motivation will increase . 3 . read about successread books about success or biographies of famous people . if you are very busy , you can read 20 minutes a day and make it your daily habit . the are lots biographies of successful people . for example , you might want to read `` steve jobs : a biography '' by walter isaacson . ",
        "you should read such books in the morning before going for work . it will inspire you to work hard ! 4 . sort out the prioritiesif you are keeping a journal or maybe a bullet journal , you will see what has a positive impact on you and your career and what is unnecessary and demotivating . you will stay focused and inspired working on activities that are meaningful . 5 . work done , have your funyou ca n't be motivated 24/7 ! it 's unrealistic to stay focused all the time . when you are at home , isolate yourself from working environment . ",
        "go offline in skype and slack , mute your phone notifications , do n't check your phone email . so try to complete all the tasks during the office day . it 'd allow you to relax , recover your energy and feel more refreshed the next day . ultimately , this will help you be more productive and do more in less time . how do you stay motivated ? what motivating books would you recommend ?
