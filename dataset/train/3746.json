        "investing . com - investing in cryptocurrencies continued to be strong at the start of 2018 even as regulators begin to ramp up talks to deal with the risk the new blockchain-based `` assets '' may pose to the financial system . the hype surrounding digital currencies has done little else other than increase in 2018 as traders begin to focus on a wider range of alternatives in what has been dubbed the `` great rotation '' as investors begin to search for a cheaper option than bitcoin that is wavering around $ 16,000 . tron gathering steam . tron has recently garnered attention as its market cap has catapulted from around $ 2.94 billion on january 1 to nearly $ 14.1 billion as of time of writing on friday , making it the seventh largest cryptocurrency by market cap . ",
        "tron is a blockchain-based , open-source protocol for the global digital entertainment industry in which trx , tron 's token , is circulated . it allows one-on-one interaction between the suppliers of digital content and the normal users and is seen as an alternative to platforms such as apple 's appstore or alphabet 's google play . tron was soaring more than 50 % on friday , taking its weekly gains to nearly 500 % . coinbase dampens ripple 's rally . ripple was under selling pressure on friday dropping around 10 % . that came coinbase squashed rumors that the more affordable bitcoin alternative was in the running to be added to the exchange . ",
        "`` as of the date of this statement , we have made no decision to add additional assets to either gdax or coinbase . any statement to the contrary is untrue and not authorized by the company , '' coinbase said in a statement . ripple , the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap , was still sporting weekly gains of around 65 % despite having pulled off record highs of more than $ 3.00 . ethereum pulls back from the $ 1,000 mark . ethereum , that lost its second place standing to ripple at the end of last week , was moving slightly lower on friday , pulling away from record highs above $ 1,000 . ",
        "bitcoin higher this year despite `` great rotation '' worries . despite concerns over the so-called `` great rotation '' , bitcoin is still holding its own in 2018 as it wavers around the $ 16,000 mark . though far from its record high of close to $ 20,000 last year , from its december 31 close at $ 13,800 , the largest crypto with a market cap of around $ 276 billion is up around 18 % this week . meanwhile , its offshoot bitcoin cash - the result of the `` fork '' from the world 's largest digital currency on august 1 in a move that was designed to be able to process transactions more quickly at a lower cost - was lagging its rivals with year-to-date gains of `` just '' 3.6 % . ",
        "regulators stepping up the pressure . perhaps precisely because of stellar gains in many of the cryptocurrencies , regulators have increasingly begun to examine the digital assets . in their crosshairs , cme and cboe exchanges launched bitcoin futures in december , sparking criticism from some industry participants who said they should have consulted the market more widely before allowing the products . the futures theoretically allow sellers to take short positions against bitcoins , but some observers have warned that , due to the extreme volatility of the digital assets , it could go so far as to cause major damage to financial system as a whole . ",
        "the commodity futures trading commission said thursday that it would convene its technology and risk advisory committees this month to discuss its `` self-certification '' process for listing digital currency futures and how those products are risk-managed and policed . the cftc further added that it had imposed a `` heightened review '' on bitcoin derivatives , adding that exchanges and clearinghouses that handle financial products tied to digital currencies will face tough requirements and scrutiny . meanwhile , the securities and exchange commission and the north american securities administrators association have both issued new warnings to investors over the risks of investing in bitcoin , cautioning that regulators may not be able to protect them from fraudsters . ",
        "so far , the stellar gains in 2017 and the continued rally this year seems to have offset the cautionary words from market regulators .   "
