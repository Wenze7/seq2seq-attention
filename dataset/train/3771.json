        "like any other business looking for ways to cut down on energy consumption ? the simplest way to do it is by switching over to led lighting from the traditional incandescent bulbs . an ordinary incandescent bulb is an ineffective light source with 90 % of the energy being converted to heat and only 10 % to light . moreover , the fluorescent tubes contain mercury , which is a hazardous element . if a fluorescent tube breaks the office or house would be poisoned with this neurotoxic element . thus , for all these benefits led tubes have become popular over the incandescent tubes . ",
        "why choose the led tubes over the incandescent tubes ? long-life : longevity is one of the prime reasons for choosing the led tubes . the led diodes and bulbs have a commendable expectation of operational life . it is almost 11 years at uninterrupted operation and 22 years @ 50 % operation . optimum efficiency : the high efficiency led tube consumes less power compared to the fluorescent tubes . compared to the traditional light tubes the led tubes consume far less electricity and exhibit 80 % to 90 % of energy efficiency . thus compared to incandescent tubes , the 80 % of electrical energy of the led tubes is transformed to light and only 20 % to heat . ",
        "low carbon footprint : another reason for opting for the high efficiency led tubes over the incandescent tubes is the capability of reducing carbon footprint . the led tubes do not contain mercury , are recyclable and thereby are eco-friendly . low blaze : low glow from the high efficiency led tube proves them to be soothing to the eyes . the ability of the led tubes to be dimmed result in the dynamic control of the colour , flexibility , light , and distribution making it a well-designed illumination system for achieving soothing light effects for the eyes . ",
        "no emission of heat or harmful uv rays : another benefit of using the led tubes is because they emit no heat or uv rays . thus even after being in operation for hours led lights do not cause accidental burn or fire . moreover , the led tubes produce a low amount of infrared light and nothing near to the uv emissions . instant lighting : the ability of the led lights to offer instant illumination make them ideal for infrastructure projects like signal and traffic lights . immediate switching : the led lights can be switched on and off without affecting light emission or its longevity , unlike the traditional tubes that take several seconds for reaching optimum brightness . ",
        "thus for all these myriad benefits of operating on low-voltage and durability , led tubes are a good substitute for the high-energy consuming , inefficient incandescent tubes .   "
