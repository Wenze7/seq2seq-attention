        "there 's been a lot of confusion and uncertainty about what exactly the transportation security administration will accept as a personal id at airport checkpoints starting in january -- but now the agency is backing off an earlier demand that some travelers would have to use passports instead of driver 's licenses . previously , the tsa had suggested that those from states whose driver 's licenses do n't comply with the specific requirements of the federal real id act would no longer have those licenses accepted as a form of id at the airport starting january 22 , 2018 -- and they would have to use something else , like a u. s. passport . ",
        "those states include kentucky , maine , minnesota , missouri , montana , oklahoma , pennsylvania , south carolina and washington state . there was even some confusion about whether or not california 's driver 's licenses were compliant with the real id law , although they apparently are good at least through october 2020 . well , now even the residents of those nine states listed above do n't have to worry either . the tsa is now saying that its enforcement of the real id law for driver 's license ids at the airport is being pushed back for everyone until october 1 , 2020 -- although it seems the tsa 's website has n't yet been updated to include the new effective date .
