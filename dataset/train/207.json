        "ahead of next season 's league reshuffle , the northern premier league 's long-serving chairman , mark harris , outlines some of his objectives on how to help grow the game more at steps 3-4 . it 's quite simple ; our level of football , and i am talking at step 3-4 , needs more money from the top end of the game and from the fa ... we are not talking about full-time professionals here or guys who earn a lot of money in the national league . these players have got houses ; they 've got mortgages , all of those things . ",
        "quite rightly we talk about the pressure on the fan 's pocket , but we do n't often consider the pressure on the player and the player 's well-being . if the fa could do something with better funding , it would be life-changing ... every league at our level has a league development grant and that is in the low tens of thousands . compare that when you go into the football league and the pot is in excess of £ 600,000 . as you go down the system , the gap in funding becomes substantial . steps 3 & 4 cover some big towns that do n't have football league clubs . ",
        "without them we might never have seen the likes of jamie vardy , stuart pearce and les ferdinand . the professional game ca n't thrive in isolation . there 's no point in bleating about it , and you do n't just get funding ; you have to present your case . but sometimes you do feel as though we are the forgotten part of football . we 're not part of the county set-up , which is to a degree playing for the love of the game ; neither are we leagues that are well-resourced from a sponsorship perspective , well-covered from a broadcast perspective . ",
        "but the perspective is they 're ` clubs ' , they 're bound to have money . if i took 200 clubs there would probably be 190 of those that would live week-by-week . the biggest challenge for non-league football is bringing in more volunteersif i lined up all 68 of my chairman in the northern premier league and gave them a choice of either £ 10k in cash or 20 new volunteers , very few would actually take the cash because it 's the volunteers that get you the money . it 's the volunteers that make the community programme work . ",
        "it 's about engaging the local community because life has changed ; the footballing audience has changed . to make all of that happen you are absolutely reliant on people and that 's why i passionately believe a coordinated volunteering initiative is required . i do believe there are people out there who would like to get involved in their non-league football club at both ends of the age bracket . i would like to see non-league football leading a national volunteering initiative to bring much-needed fresh blood into our level of the game . we must do more to support players against mental issues ... we have terrible tragedies on a semi-regular basis and we 've got a responsibility to these lads . ",
        "they 're playing on behalf of our clubs , and while we ca n't run their lives for them , if there are additional pressures and stresses they are suffering as a result of what they 're doing for us , we 've got a duty of care here and it 's something i feel strongly about . next season 's restructure in step 3-4 will not be perfect , but it 's the right thing to help progression ... we need to reduce the financial , mental and physical pressure on players and clubs , but it 's also about saying to clubs who will be coming up from step 5 : `` you ca n't stick your heads in the sand ; you need to know what life at the higher level is like . '' ",
        "that , for example , is why we at the npl are offering to meet with clubs at step 5 to say : `` look , we 're now in december , you may need some information about what life is like at the higher level . there 's no manual that tells you what your travelling costs will be like . how many fans do the away teams tend to bring ? how many programmes do you sell ? clubs need to know what is in front of them as they look to progress . the structure will give us more local derbies ... this puts the pennies into the till . ",
        "we absolutely want that and we want to reduce the pressure on fans and players ' pockets . the whole issue of creating this issue in the midlands is correct . the midlands is a massive hotbed of football and personally i do believe that it deserves its own league . the recent rainbow lace campaign was fantastic , but it displayed the best and worst of football . fantastic idea , but executed poorly ... the premier league and the efl headed it up , but why was n't the non-league football community involved more ? if you think of the number of clubs in the national league system , 1,500 , there are 350,000 people that play football who are connected . ",
        "particularly in the area of homophobia then that is something our clubs should do and can be encouraged to do , but we just need to find the right mechanic . whether the professional game has simply forgotten us then we just have to say ` ok , we totally support the objectives , but we 'll find our own way to do it . we picture non-league football as one happy family ... but is it ? saturday afternoons should be fun for everyone . we need to be seen , and i do believe that we can give some leadership to higher up the game and say this is actually something we really believe in . ",
        "in the npl , cleethorpes ' liam davis is the only player in english senior football to come out . liam has fronted the club 's equal game campaign and uefa have publicly thanked both the club and the league for our great support in publicising the initiative . in an uncertain , and often unhappy world , this kind of recognition makes it all worthwhile . * this article originally featured in the @nonleaguepaper , which is available every sundaytagged evo-stik northern premier league , mark harris , state of the game .
