        "monster hunter : world may be all about taking down big , bad monsters , but it 'll make room for cute creatures to help you out as well . monster hunter : world is n't set to hit xbox one and other platforms until january 26 , 2018 , but we 're already gotten some pretty good looks at what to expect . and while most of the trailers and early peeks we 've seen thus far have focused on the series ' main draw of fierce monster battles , the latest offers a look at something a little tamer : our kitty companions . ",
        "players will be able to take their own palico , the monster hunter : world 's feline companions , on hunts with them -- and they 're adorable as all get-out . not only will they help out on hunts , but palicos can cook food for you as well , as show off by the incredibly focused kitty in the trailer . to top it all off , each palico companion is completely customizable , featuring a full suite of options centered around their color , fur , pattern , eyes , ears , tail , and more . ",
        "you can add to the look by equipping your palico with different gear . custom kitty companions wo n't be the highlight of monster hunter : world for everyone , but they certainly do n't hurt either . speaking for myself , however , i would n't be surprised if the majority of my time in the game dedicated to palin ' around with and dressing up my palico . monster hunter : world hits xbox one , playstation 4 and pc on january 26 , and the game is up for preorder now . see at microsoft store see at amazon .
