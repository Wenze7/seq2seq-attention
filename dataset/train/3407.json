        "players in the miami hurricanes ' secondary made a name for themselves this season by rocking the turnover chain . just up the road in boca raton , lane kiffin 's florida atlantic owls figured out a different way to showcase their talents . `` put it on tape '' became the official motto of a secondary that vastly improved in 2017 after years of being torched by opposing defenses . fau 's secondary made 19 of the team 's 20 interceptions , led by the much improved play of junior shelton lewis and sophomore chris tooley . `` we always tell each other , ` give me one . ",
        "give me an interception , ' '' tooley said earlier this year . `` we all put each other on a pedestal to always be great . '' as there is much to discuss with the secondary as a whole , let 's begin by reviewing the owls ' 2017 performance at cornerback . mvp : choosing lewis and tooley as co-mvps would be easy to do , as each corner had four interceptions and forced a fumble . tooley was one of the owls ' best defenders when the unit struggled early , but lewis is our choice for mvp for how well he played after raekwon williams was lost for the season with a knee injury . ",
        "with the pressure on the secondary in two rivalry games that could make or break the season , lewis had a combined 12 tackles , two pass breakups and an interception in wins over western kentucky and marshall . biggest surprise : how much the cornerbacks stepped up after williams was hurt in the oct. . 7 win over old dominion . tooley continued his strong play , lewis became a shutdown corner and reserves korel smith and herb miller each made vital plays . miller 's fourth-quarter interception against western kentucky helped give fau 's offense the momentum it needed to eventually win the game . ",
        "who 's returning ? chris tooley , shelton lewis , korel smith , herb miller and diashun moss are among the more notable names returning . former pahokee quarterback tyrone smith jr. . is expected to see cornerback action as well this spring . who 's leaving : raekwon williams has exhausted all years of eligibility . biggest offseason storyline : how do the returning corners build off last season and not let the success get to their heads ? fau cornerbacks intercepted 10 of the team 's 20 passes and kept c-usa gunslingers like mason fine and mike white from making their standard explosive plays . ",
        "losing williams will hurt in the locker room , but the maturity shown by tooley and lewis in particular after learning under the departing senior should help in camp 's early weeks .   "
