        "wind tunnels toppling over pedestrians , broken windows causing glass to fall from the sky , solar rays creating unbearable heat , and sinking foundation are just a few of the mishaps that occur with buildings after being made . in this article we highlight buildings that have become infamous due to their post construction mishaps . 20 fenchurch street 20 fenchurch street is perhaps the most unfortunate building on this list . it has become known for its multiple mishaps such as the scorching of cars and a wind tunnel that topples pedestrians over . the building also won the carbuncle cup in 2015 , which is an annual award for the ugliest building of the year presented by architecture magazine building design . ",
        "vdara hotel & spasimilar to the walkie talkie building , the architect of the vdara hotel & spa in las vegas had miscalculated the reflective power of the sun . the curved structure of the building caused a solar beam that allegedly singed the hair of guests and made the hotel swimming pool area unusable . intempo skyscraperwhile initially designed to signify prosperity through spain 's economic tumult , the intempo skyscraper has instead become known as a building plagued with mishaps -- with some untrue stories . circling around the internet in july 2013 was an article written for el pais that had presented inaccurate information . ",
        "the article stated that despite workers trudging up 23 flights of steps to complete work on higher levels , the building was almost completed before it was realized that it was missing something integral -- the elevator . less than a month after the original story was posted , rafael ballesta , the sales manager for the edificio intempo residential towers , explained to dezeen that the building had included elevators in the initial drawings and had them functioning . in fact , the plans reveal that the towers feature six ` latest generation ' elevators . aon centerwhile cladding has been in the spotlight recently because of the grenfell tragedy , in 1973 the aon center gathered ample attention for it 's experimental use with italian carrara cladding . ",
        "of course at the time of construction , it was n't deemed as being experimental . while the cladding provided the building with a stunning exterior , it unfortunately only lasted a year before proving to be a poor choice . since carrara marble is thinner than traditional cladding , it resulted in cracking and bowing all over the exterior as well as one of the slabs detaching and crashing into a neighboring roof . this resulted in the entire building needing to be sheathed again . john hancock towerin a prior article we uncovered the plausibility of getting motion sickness while working in a skyscraper and provided ways to combat it . ",
        "unfortunately , it seems like we were a little too late with releasing the article since the john hancock tower not only had forgot to adequately brace for swaying but also for thermal stresses to window panels . this caused tenants to get motion sickness and hundreds of windows to pop out and fall into the street below . w.e. b. du bois librarythe w. e.b. du bois library is still known for being the tallest library in the u. s. despite structural problems causing it to sink . according to the boston globe , students continue to say that the building is sinking due to it 's volume of books . ",
        "this has not been proven , however , and there has been no official known cause for the phenomenon known as spalling - which is an occurrence where the building begins shedding brick chips . as an attempt to slow the process , 60,000 books were moved out of the building before it was discovered that the building was likely sinking due to being built on pond-saturated ground . image © n. chadwickimage © wiki commonsview additional buildings in the article originally published at caddetailsblog . com .
