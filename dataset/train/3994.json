        "this means that anyone trying to contact the hotel chain to book , amend or cancel reservations will be charged up to 68p per minute , unless they know to find the freephone number . the sun online was contacted by ben whitney , 53 , who said that he was worried that vulnerable customers - especially the elderly - could be caught out by the unnecessary charges . the tv editor , who lives in surrey , said : `` i think it 's unethical . so many people are n't aware of these extra charges being levied by companies through the back door . ",
        "customers have also been moaning about the premium rate number used by hotel firm on twitter . one said : `` how do you contact travelodge without using the premium rate 0871 numbers ? #travelodgeuk '' another said : `` mobile bill this month includes £ 20 for 3 calls to @travelodgeuk - it took 3 calls to get the help and advice i needed ! ouch '' . how much does it cost to call a premium rate phone number the cost of calling a phone number varies depending on the digits it starts with , your phone provider and whether you use a landline or mobile to call .
