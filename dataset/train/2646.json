        "dear friends and customers , after a long and hard battle with finding footing with our market , my planit co-founders and i have decided to close down the app . we are beyond disappointed by the sad reality that our vision of helping college students has come to an end . we genuinely apologize to those who have downloaded and use our app . your continued use of planit is encouraged , but sadly it will cease to function in do time since our resources to update will no longer be available . we are proud of what we have been able to accomplish , and are forever thankful to the people we have met and learned from along our short but sweet journey . ",
        "to our employees : thank you for your commitment . your hard work and effort will forever be valued , and there is no way we could have made it this far far without your support . you will have our full support during the exit , and our offices are available for your personal use until the end of the month . we have coordinated communication with recruiters to assist in job fulfillment if it is needed . we will do everything in our power to make sure this process is as smooth as possible and that your value is highlighted . ",
        "to our customers : you encouraged us immensely during our short journey , we are sorry for letting you down . thank you for having faith in what we created , we really hope you benefited from using our product . together we conquered over 125,000 tasks and completed 47,000 projects . we focused on fixing your problems , because we were in your shoes once . we did not provide you with a product that fits your budget , and for that we genuinely apologize . to the press and public : we wish we could have had a better relationship , but our ability to create coexist in a productive manner was never fully realized . ",
        "we still feel there is room in the market for a service like ours , because planit is still being used effectively by a few thousand people , however we were unable to convince colleges and universities heads and chairpeople to invest in a platform that would benefit their community . student stress levels still need to be addressed , hopefully they will all discover a healthy solution very soon . as for me , my goal during these next few weeks is to ensure our team members are provided sufficient assistance to secure your value in the job market . ",
        "i will be doing a lot of soul searching and reflection , and then off to try to solve another problem . thank you for everything , julian .   "
