        "stockholm -- an american scientist who shared this year 's nobel prize for medicine bluntly criticized political developments at home in his address at the awards ' gala banquet , saying that u. s. scientists are facing funding cutbacks that will hurt research . michael rosbash , who was honored for his work on circadian rhythms -- commonly called the body clock -- expressed concern that u. s. government funding such as that received by him and nobel colleagues jeffrey hall and michael young is endangered . `` we benefited from an enlightened period in the postwar united states . ",
        "our national institutes of health have enthusiastically and generously supported basic research ... the current climate in the u. s. is a warning that continued support can not be taken for granted , '' rosbash said in a short speech sunday night at stockholm 's ornate city hall . the 2018 federal budget proposed by president donald trump calls for cutting science funding by billions of dollars . `` also in danger is the pluralistic america into which all three of us of born were born and raised after world war ii , '' rosbash said . `` immigrants and foreigners have always been an indispensable part of our country , including its great record in scientific research . ",
        "`` literature laureate kazuo ishiguro of britain expressed concern about increasing tensions between social factions . `` we live today in a time of growing tribal enmities of communities fracturing into bitterly opposed groups , '' said ishiguro , who was born in japan . he said nobel prizes can counterbalance such animosity . `` the pride we feel when someone from our nation wins a nobel prize is different from the one we feel witnessing one of our athletes winning an olympic medal . we do n't feel the pride of our tribe demonstrating superiority over other tribes . ",
        "rather it 's the pride that from knowing that one of us has made a significant contribution to our common human endeavor , '' he said . in the norwegian capital of oslo , a survivor of the atomic bombing of hiroshima compared her struggle to survive in 1945 to the objectives of the group awarded this year 's nobel 's peace prize . setsuko thurlow , who was 13 when the u. s. bomb devastated her japanese city during the final weeks of world war ii , spoke as a leading activist with the nobel-winning international campaign to abolish nuclear weapons . ",
        "thurlow said the hiroshima blast left her buried under the rubble , but she was able to see light and crawl to safety . in the same way , the campaign to which she belongs is a driving force behind an international treaty to ban nuclear weapons , she said after ican received the nobel prize it won in october . `` our light now is the ban treaty , '' thurlow said . `` i repeat those words that i heard called to me in the ruins of hiroshima : ` do n't give up . keep pushing . ",
        "see the light ? crawl toward it . ' `` the treaty has been signed by 56 countries -- none of them nuclear powers -- and ratified by only three . to become binding it requires ratification by 50 countries . ican executive director beatrice fihn , who accepted the prize along with thurlow , said that while the treaty is far from ratification `` now , at long last , we have an unequivocal norm against nuclear weapons . '' `` this is the way forward . there is only one way to prevent the use of nuclear weapons -- prohibit and eliminate them , '' fihn said . ",
        "the prize winners were announced in october . all except the peace prize were awarded in sweden on sunday . the other laureates were american richard thaler for his work in behavioral economics ; american physicists kip thorne , rainer weiss and barry barish for confirming the existence of gravity waves ; and jacques dubochet of switzerland , american joachim frank and richard henderson of the united kingdom for advances in electron microscopy .
