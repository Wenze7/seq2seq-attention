        "now my practice is over . it is a little bit sad , because i 've already gotten accustomed to my students , who are very lovely , intelligible , curious and cute . i 'll miss it but now i have a feeling of satisfaction and gratitude for such experience . it gave me a lot . first of all , i proved to myself that i can work with the audience , can hold their attention , can be interesting to them , can teach something , can make them laugh and learn . though some things seemed to be impossible one year ago , now it became my daily routine and i am incredibly grateful for it . ",
        "one of the most important discoveries was to understand that a good teacher should `` read '' their students and correctly use the peculiarities of their temperament , character , even mood in educational purposes . because if you just follow your plan without paying attention to anything , your class will be useless and non-productive . what is more , i learned that it is significant to know how to lead the situation , especially in case of some difficult situations , for instance , when somebody did n't understand something and can not give a quick answer , and others start laughing at him , you have to calmly , but firmly say that we should be respectful to each other and it is normal to make mistakes because we are all here to learn . ",
        "or sometimes you have to say something fun to dissipate the tension , or to do some unusual gesture to pay attention to you , or to give some amusing association to the word that is hard to remember . saying otherwise , the teacher should be lively and interesting to listen to , but at the same time it is necessary to remember , that `` a kind teacher '' and `` a good teacher '' are two different persons . i would like to be the second one . as for the episodes , i watched the last 3 ones . ",
        "here are some facts , that were new to me or impressed me most : the tragedy in pearl harbor in 1941 , when japanese planes attacked hawaii and destroyed everything , killed 3000 people less than for 24 hours . after a while , the usa entered into wwiiatomic bombs exploded in japan . that action had a disastrous impact on ecology and people , hundreds of thousands of japanese people died because of the radiation . and the most awful thing was that there was no necessity in using those bombs , it was clear enough who was the winner . ",
        "videos of the tragedy 9/11 . it seems as if it were episodes from some thriller or film-catastrophe , especially when towers started falling down . it 's just hard to imagine that those events were real .   "
