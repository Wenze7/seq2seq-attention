        "hero paul ince is n't surprised by alexis sanchez 's decision to choose old trafford over manchester city . sanchez could have gone to the etihad and picked up a title winners ' medal in may but ince says that is further proof that big players do not believe in city in the long term and united are still the biggest force in english football . ince said : `` everyone is raving about city . but when it comes to the two clubs , man united are miles bigger than city . players would still prefer to go to them over pep 's side -- that 's a fact . ",
        "players wo n't go to city because they think they 're a bigger , more historic club than united . because they 're simply not . `` some might get the quick satisfaction of winning the league this year , but those years of history , and the side that mourinho is building -- players want to be a part of that . `` this signing only confirms that . sanchez had the opportunity to go into a team where he could have won a trophy . but he did n't , he chose to go to united because of everything they stand for and that says a lot about the size of the club . ",
        "`` city have some unbelievable players , but winning the league this year does n't mean anything . they need to do that year upon year and collect trophies to compete with united . that 's the true test . they 're not serial winners . united are and that 's why players want to be there . ''   "
