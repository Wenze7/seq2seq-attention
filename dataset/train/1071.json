        "with miami heat guard dion waiters now dealing with a banged up elbow , many are questioning his capabilities . the residents of waiters island have n't always had it easy . and lately , the beautiful days have been few and far between . a stark contrast to the bright sunshine seen through the entirety of 2016-17 . because after averaging 15.8 points , 3.3 rebounds and 4.3 assists a game last season , and signing a four-year , $ 52 million deal this past summer , miami heat guard dion waiters has regressed . it 's true that the 26-year-old has never been the most consistent of talents . ",
        "even last year , when he was putting up solid numbers , waiters went from scoring just four points in 19 minutes against the utah jazz , to then recording 27 points in 36 minutes versus the san antonio spurs two days later . but his super low-scoring games were rare . even if it took 26 shots to get there , the philadelphia-native would make sure he got his buckets in . however so far , 2017-18 has been a different story . while waiters may still be averaging 14.6 points , 2.4 rebounds and 3.7 assists per matchup , his efficiency is down . ",
        "and his performances are much more erratic . while he scored 22 points on 8-of-12 shooting in san antonio on december 6 , he then tailed just two points , shooting an abysmal 1-for-10 from the field in mexico city against the brooklyn nets . nevermind when he went scoreless versus the indiana pacers on november 19 . so is it time for the heat to be worried ? well , sort of . miami already had a right to raise an eyebrow when waiters announced his decision to forego surgery on a tweaked ankle . sure , this ensured he was ready to go as soon as the season started . ",
        "but he knew he would n't be at 100 percent . and that it would be a while until either the nagging disappeared , or he 'd get used to it . not exactly great news regarding a player who just received a pretty hefty deal . now , the fifth-year is nursing another injury : a banged up elbow . having hyperextended it a week ago , waiters is still dealing with the aftermath . most recently just re-aggravating it while setting a screen on monday night . his reaction ? similar to his mindset regarding his ankle . ",
        "`` i do n't try to think about it . me , i 'm a no excuse guy . i 'm whatever . `` unfortunately though , whatever wo n't cut it on the court . a place where waiters just has n't found his footing lately . especially from beyond-the-arc , an area that the guard usually makes himself right at home at . while he shot 39.5 percent from downtown last season , he 's at 31.5 percent currently . have the heat as a whole been dealing with inconsistency across the board as of late ? absolutely . ",
        "even goran dragic , who in the past has been solid as a rock , is struggling . but history is on dragic 's side , whereas waiters went from being kevin durant 's scapegoat with the oklahoma city thunder , to lebron james ' via the cleveland cavaliers . making it understandable why some fans have already started to sell their properties on waiters island . on the other hand , it 's never a good idea to count any part of miami out . after all , 11-30 did turn into 30-11 . with waiters very much setting things off into motion with two back-to-back 33-point performances , including his famous game-winner over the golden state warriors .
