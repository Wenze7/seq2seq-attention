        "but it has a great cost . this is why it is so scary and keeps everyone in the status quo . i 'm about to break out of the status quo and dive head into the abyss of total responsibility if it all goes wrong . i could very well lose everything , become homeless and everything , for all of my life so far , would have been for absolute nothing . yesterday i had a total absolute meltdown about this . the fear coursed through my body and i was yelling at myself to change course , what the hell was i doing , this is it ! ",
        "this is it ! you could lose everything . by everything i mean all worldly goods , the ability to house and feed myself and generally have to bunk in with my daughter for shelter . there were many factors that led me here . you can read it on the blog if you want the details . it 's what i 'm going to do now that has me frozen in fear . even though my kids do n't care that i do n't leave them anything when i die , i do . i want them to have at least something to fall back on . ",
        "it 's my job , and has been all of my life , to provide . i provided for my husband , i provided for my children and i have to leave them something when i 'm gone . it 's not an option not to . but i have to face the fact , the absolute black and white mathematical fact , that i may not be able to . not only that i may not be able to even provide for myself . it 's as scary as hell . there is an adage if you knew you would n't fail , what would you do ? ",
        "well of course i would do what i 'm planning , but failure is an option that has to be factored in and it is crippling . i want to not feel this fear , but i do . as i 've found over the last 2 years , the idea that i thought i could always get a job is no longer so easy -- at 52 no-one is hiring me , so that option is absolutely off the table . i do n't know if i have the courage to follow through , but i know i ca n't stay here either . ",
        "i 'm caught in the headlights and frozen . failure is always an option , whatever you do . it 's the cost of the failure that can make it bearable or insurmountable and i have to decide which of those i am facing .   "
