        "brawlout reviewthe nintendo switch has become a fantastic stage for new indie darlings to make a statement , but brawlout has some particularly large issues to address . for one thing , it 's undoubtedly going to be compared to a certain nintendo brawler franchise , that comparison coming bundled with some lofty expectations . brawlout does n't quite reach that bar , but it does prove itself to be a fighter worthy of recognition . let 's address the elephant in the room immediately : brawlout is absolutely smash bros lite . the fighting mechanics are nearly identical , the arenas all sport multiple platforms and pits on either side of the stage , and damage is dished out in a rising percentage rather than a falling life bar . ",
        "on the surface it 's a cut and paste job -- a decent cut and paste , but still -- and for me , that seems lazy and uninspired . the control scheme , in particular , is a dead ringer with basic attacks on a , special attacks on b , and directional inputs with each attack button producing new attacks . one key element keeps brawlout from becoming borderline infringement , and that 's the lack of a true blocking mechanic . that 's right , not a single fighter in brawlout can block attacks , instead putting the defensive focus on dodging and jumping . ",
        "this decision flies in the face of all fighting games let alone the series that inspired this game . at first , i was taken aback by the lack of shield , but as i became more familiar with the concept i have to say it made an impression on me . i like the idea of being at odds with the enemy and the stage concurrently , one false dodge backing me into a corner and massive damage . after a while i was getting around pretty well , handling ai opponents without much trouble . despite the lengthy learning process , i was enjoying each match and was eager to play more . ",
        "that 's actually the biggest downside to brawlout from where i stand : the learning curve is much steeper than i anticipated . perhaps that stems from previous smash experience , but learning these brand new characters and getting a feel for the brawlout way of fighting took longer than i 'd normally be comfortable with . the game takes out edge-grabbing , a staple of smash bros since the beginning , and un-learning that was rough in the beginning . the lack of edge-grabbing is exacerbated by how heavy each of these characters feels under my control . whenever i 'd get knocked off the stage it felt like a lead weight was tied to the character , each one falling much faster than i expected and causing me to mistime my recovery . ",
        "even the more agile characters feel like they 're hiding some extra pounds , and many a stock was lost due to my difficulty adjusting . once i figured it out though , the game really came into its own . brawlout does offer tutorials in its single-player modes , including some advanced tutorials to really get into the nitty-gritty , but only at `` game speed '' did i truly become comfortable with its nuances . the rest of the single-player modes include single fights and mortal kombat-style towers ranging in difficulty , giving me plenty of options to play before taking my skills online . ",
        "the online multiplayer played pretty well in the few matches i experienced , with very noticeable lag or issues , and being able to set up my own lobbies for custom matches is pretty neat . the game played well once i 'd gotten my feet under me , but familiarity does n't change one of the game 's most unfortunate flaws : the roster . despite the 18 character slots on screen the game only truly has eight different fighters , the other 10 being reskins . one character , olaf tyson , has three reskins resulting in four different slots for the same character , and that 's incredibly lame . ",
        "the addition of hyper light drifter and juan from guacamelee adds some indie cred , but not even they can overshadow the rest of this mess . this is a cheap expansion of a fighting roster not seen since clay fighter 2 : judgment clay and it annoys me greatly . brawlout had an uphill battle going into its nintendo switch launch , and while the fighting is good the lack of variety in the roster coupled with the steep learning curve brings the whole experience down a few notches . this does scratch my brawler game itch while i wait for smash bros on switch , but that itch will be back before long . ",
        "brawlout is not the permanent solution to my brawl withdrawal , but it 's adequate enough to be fun for a little while .   "
