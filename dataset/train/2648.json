        "ford motor company said its sales in china fell 6 % in 2017 . a change in government incentives , stepped-up competition from domestic chinese automakers , and a dearth of new products combined to set the blue oval 's chinese effort back after several years of growth . several of ford 's rivals were able to post year-over-year gains in china in 2016 . among them was a 4.4 % year-over-year increase in sales for ford 's old detroit nemesis , general motors . why ford 's china sales fell in 2017 after several years of growthford 's 2017 sales decline in china is a reversal after several years of good growth in the world 's largest new-car market . ",
        "what happened ? there were a few factors that put pressure on ford 's china sales totals last year . first and foremost , on january 1 , the chinese government 's sales tax on small-engine vehicles rose from 5 % to 7.5 % . many buyers had rushed to get their cars before the increase took effect ; the result was a big drop in small-car sales in the first part of 2017 . that put a big dent in ford 's sales of models like the focus early in the year . another factor : competitive pressures on pricing . ",
        "the domestic chinese automakers have been raising their game , particularly around quality and value . they 've become fierce competition in the lower-priced market segments , particularly around affordable small suvs . that competition put pressure on ford to cut prices coming into 2017 , pressure that ford initially tried to resist . the upshot : ford lost quite a few sales of models like the kuga before it finally cut prices on several models midyear . a third factor : by the standards of china 's market , most of ford 's product lineup is old news . ",
        "because of its huge size and the huge number of automakers competing for sales , china 's auto market moves very quickly . the global automakers that succeed are the ones that have new products arriving in their showrooms every few months , and that give their big sellers frequent updates . but for ford , 2017 was a quiet year on the product front . ford 's products still attracted plenty of buyers , but the company 's big sellers are no longer the shiny new entrants they were a few years ago . how ford will get back on track in 2018ford got a new ceo in may : jim hackett . ",
        "hackett recognized early on in his tenure that ford 's china operation needed a chinese-speaking leader who had a deep understanding of the local market . that 's something that , surprisingly , ford had n't had -- but it does now , with jason luo at the helm since august . last month , hackett and luo announced a comprehensive plan to boost ford china . the key points : `` more than 50 '' new vehicles for china over the next several years , including a slew of new suvs and plug-in vehicles . more local production , including the first lincoln to be built in china . ",
        "ford 's china-market models will get added technology . ford will streamline its distribution network to ensure that all of its dealers have easy access to its complete product range . ford will also look to reduce costs in its chinese operation , part of a global effort to contain cost growth that hackett hopes will boost ford 's operating margin over time . the upshot : ford has a china turnaround under way2017 showed clearly that ford 's china operation needed a rethink . the plan announced by hackett and luo in december seems to include the right things ; we 'll see how well it works over the next couple of years . ",
        "but investors should take note : a needed overhaul is now under way for ford in china .   "
