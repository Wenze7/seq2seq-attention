        "young `` dreamers '' brought to the united states illegally as children were left angry and disappointed after the us congress approved a temporary spending bill to end a three-day government shutdown without a deal to shore up their shaky legal status . us senate democrats on monday accepted the bill to restore funds to keep the government running for three more weeks in exchange for a promise by republicans to hold a debate on the status of the young immigrants . `` it 's irresponsible of everyone in congress not to pass something , '' said jovan rodriguez , 27 , who was brought to the united states from mexico by his parents when he was three years old . ",
        "`` i 'm really disappointed . '' republican us president donald trump was expected to sign the legislation , putting government workers who were furloughed back to work . last year , trump ordered an end by march to protections provided to the estimated 700,000 dreamers under the 2012 deferred action for childhood arrivals programme , or daca , programme , an executive order put in place by former democratic president barack obama . donald trump claims ` big win as democrats cave ' after signing bill to end us government shutdownunder the programme , young people who qualified were allowed to live openly in the united states , working and attending college and shielded from deportation . ",
        "a court has put a temporary stay on trump 's order . after news of the spending bill , some dreamers and their supporters briefly blocked the entrance to disneyland in california . marches and civil disobedience were planned in los angeles , san diego , washington and elsewhere . democratic lawmakers had initially vowed to oppose any bill to fund the government without an agreement to restore the daca protections . but republicans refused to budge , instead tying the spending bill to a programme favoured by democrats that provides health care to poor and working-class children . `` our members , including my brother jonathan , are in greater danger today because of the cowardice of us senators , '' activist cristina jimenez , executive director of group united we dream said in an emailed statement . ",
        "the leader of the senate democrats , new york senator chuck schumer , said on twitter he believed he would have enough votes to bring a deal on daca to the senate floor and pass it . schumer said he expected republican majority leader mitch mcconnell to honour his promise to open debate on the issue . `` if he does not honour our agreement , he will have breached the trust of not only the democratic senators but the members of his own party as well . '' activists said they planned to make their feelings known at the ballot box , targeting republicans who have railed against illegal immigration as well as moderate democrats who voted for monday 's deal . ",
        "`` we will be organising voters , the people who will bring the consequences , '' adrian reyna , 26 , said by telephone . an oakland , california , resident who was brought to the united states from mexico at age 11 , reyna said he started to work for passage of legislation to protect fellow dreamers during his student days at the university of texas . any legislation to protect dreamers , even if it makes it through the senate , could easily stall in the more conservative house of representatives , unless democrats manage to win back seats in the 2018 elections and exert more pressure , said larry sabato , a political analyst with the university of virginia . ",
        "the headwinds scare diego corzo , an 27-year-old who built a successful real estate business in texas but worries it could all be taken away . `` i will be living under a lot of stress , a lot of uncertainty and fear that everything that i worked so hard to accomplish can be gone , '' corzo said by telephone .
