        "after laying out first and second round draft plans for the baltimore ravens , i 'm back to explain what the purple and black should do the in the third round . as we all know , the ravens are entering the most important offseason in a while . baltimore will be looking at a lot of offensive talent in this draft . ozzie newsome will most likely have two picks in the third round , due to rick wagner 's free agent move to the lions . if the ravens do get two picks , they will be back to back at 82nd and 83rd overall . ",
        "the ravens can go a number of ways with these picks . i would like to see them take one defensive player and one offensive . they could also use both picks to trade up . whatever direction the ravens choose to go , let us take a look at options for both sides of the ball . defense : marcus allen , fs , penn state ; 6 ' 2 ″ , 210 lbsstrengths : nfl ready skill set ; good frameweaknesses : not a ball hawkeric weddle is a fantastic leader and still a good player . however , he is aging . ",
        "weddle turned 33 yesterday so selecting a good safety here is a good idea . teaming up allen to replace would work very well , as allen is a proven leader on the field . he and weddle are a lot alike on the field , but weddle is a little better of a ball hawk . there is no one better for allen to learn under than weddle . allen is a projected third rounder , and i hope he stays there . but do n't be surprised if you see him moving up . the penn state product has a chance to be an absolute steal , and teaming him up with tony jefferson moving forward can possibly make up one of the best safety tandems in the league . ",
        "breeland speaks , de , ole miss ; 6 ' 3 ″ , 290 lbsstrengths : really strong ; run defenseweaknesses : not great speedi do n't imagine the ravens will sign back brent urban . they let lawrence guy go last year , and with limited cap room , i imagine they let urban go too . therefore , they will need help on the defensive front . willie henry and carl davis played excellently , but you always need depth . ozzie newsome 's best aspect is selecting offensive and defensive linemen . breeland speaks would add to that track record . ",
        "speaks is a very skilled lineman . he does a lot of the dirty work and may not get noticed on the stat sheet . however , he is an impactful player that would help baltimore control the line of scrimmage . the ravens pride themselves on that very thing , and speaks is a really good value pick in the middle of the third . offensedrew lock , qb , missouri ; 6 ' 4 ″ , 225 lbsstrengths : strong arm ; top-5 potentialweaknesses : accuracyflacco is not only getting older , but he has n't played good football since 2014 . ",
        "flacco has regressed since the 2012 super bowl . however , the ravens are stuck with him for at least one more year and most likely two due to the gigantic contract we all know too well . so drafting a quarterback here to groom and learn under flacco would be a good decision . lock has a chance to be one of the best quarterbacks in the league . he has a lot of untapped potential and if the ravens do everything right , he can be the future of the position . lock has a very strong arm and likes to let it loose . ",
        "i do n't think lock is ready to come into the league and play right away , but he would n't have to in baltimore . hopefully , they draft lock or someone else as a successor for flacco . damien harris , rb , alabama ; 6 ' 0 ″ , 215 lbsstrengths : hard runner ; agile ; great visionweaknesses : pass protection ; breakaway speedi do n't really like the idea of taking a running back in this draft . i think with alex collins , kenneth dixon , and buck allen , you have a nice mix of different backs . ",
        "however , none of those guys are premier backs in this league . they are all just good , quality backs . nothing wrong with that , but fans and the organization alike are craving offensive playmakers . damien harris has the ability to be that . harris has excellent size for a back in this league . harris has amazing vision and patience . with a great offensive line coming back for baltimore , harris would thrive in greg roman 's zone run schemes . in 2017 , harris averaged 7.6 yards per carry with 11 touchdowns for alabama as a junior . ",
        "the year before , he averaged 7.1 yards per carry . harris can be a top back in this league , and unless saquon barkley amazingly drops in the first round , then harris is the only back i would take in this draft . next : 5 baltimore ravens who took a step forward this seasonfinal thoughtshopefully , the ravens receive a third-round compensatory pick . they could do a lot of things with two picks in the middle of the third round . possibly using them to trade up is an intriguing option but overall , the ravens still have a lot of good options in the third .
