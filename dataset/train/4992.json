        "namaste ! today , i 'll talk about my experience and my journey till start of jagriti yatra 2017 . i 'm writing this before the start of jy . i 'm excited a lot since this will be my first pan india yatra and that too with the upcoming change-makers of india . you will find several posts/blogs on experience of the yatra itself , but i thought pre-jy journey is also worth sharing . this article may assist you in cracking jy selection , organising your fundraising activity and planning for the one-of-its-kind yatra . i am aru mangla , and i am the co-founder of reneyou greentech pvt ltd , which is an impact venture in rural green technology field . ",
        "i 'm also a 3rd year management student at sscbs , university of delhi . for more details about my professional background , visit bit . ly/arumangla . abc of jagriti yatrajagriti yatra is a 15-day long , national train journey that covers 8000 kilometers across the length and breadth of india . every year , it takes 500 highly motivated youngsters , selected from thousands of applicants , to meet inspiring role models of india who are finding solutions to the challenges through their entrepreneurial activities . the aim is to awaken the spirit of entrepreneurship within india 's youth . ",
        "for further information , refer to jagritiyatra . comi came to know about jy when a senior in my college , durgesh rawat , got selected for jy 2016 -- 17 . i accessed more information about jagriti yatra and then i said to myself , `` you 're made for this '' , since i am involved in impact entrepreneurship space and am just fascinated by the opportunities lying in rural areas of our country . how to crack jy selection procedure ? if you 're about to apply , and wondering how can you succeed in the first attempt , there 's ashort answer to it . ",
        "just be true to yourself . just be honest with your answers and yourself . jy application form has questions which need essay type answers . i completed the form with 3 months delay , but filled it with full integrity and details . how to raise funds for jy ? there are three sponsorship levels for selected candidates . i got level 2 and hence , had to pay â‚¹ 40,000 for the yatra . the scholarship level is determined by the selection team on the basis of candidate 's financial background and experience of working in the impact area . ",
        "being a college student and also coming from a not-so-strong financial background , i was not able to arrange all the amount on my own , and therefore i resorted to crowdfunding for arranging the application money . i spread the word among my friends , relatives , teachers , acquaintances , etc. . i also resorted to a crowdfunding site , i. e. ketto . org , , alumni groups of jy on social media sites and crowdfunding groups . there are other ways as well to earn money to fund your yatra yourself . i referred to this awesome video and you willsee how easy earning money is . ",
        "one more unique way to earn money is to do a business . i 'll tell you my instance . this was the peak period of air pollution in my city , delhi . so , i arranged the distribution of respiratory masks in my college and around my home and thus provided a solution which was urgently required at that time and hence created an opportunity for myself . similarly , you can find a need around you and create a business opportunity around it . few quick examples are organising a trip for a group of people , organising a relevant conference/talk , etc. . ",
        "after all entrepreneurship is all about seeing the opportunity and grabbing it . how to prepare for yatra ? `` congratulations ! you 've been selected , and you 're a confirmed ` yatri ' now . '' receiving such a mail is altogether a different feeling in itself , a feeling of achievement , a feeling of self-belief . to make the fullest out of this once-in-a-lifetime experience , i prepared and planned . first things first , i deliberated and decided my objectives of going on this yatra . answer the why . what do you want to achieve from this experience ? ",
        "for me they are , diving deeper within my own self , get a network for my venture , explore india , etc. . yatra will be fun because there will be like minded people on board . what 's better if you get to know and meet such people even before the yatra . i created communities of my batch 's yatris . we planned meet-ups , listened others ' stories , shared ours . plan with them for the yatra . and lastly , i 'd say be an entrepreneur , optimise your yatra , maximize the returnsand build india through enterprise . ",
        "ps : i 'll definitely write about my yatra experience and learning . do tell if you want me tofocus on some particular aspect . follow me on medium and linkedin for more articles on jagriti yatra and topics like energy , sustainability , rural markets , etc. . yatra aarambh !   "
