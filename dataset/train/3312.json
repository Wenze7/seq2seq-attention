        "seth meyers delivered a scathing golden globes monologue that barbed all the right people . before the golden globes on sunday , host seth meyers said that he knew his monologue was going to be important . after all that has happened in the world this past year -- from donald trump to the #metoo movement -- there was a lot to dive into . the pressure was on for meyers to deliver the cathartic we all wanted was real , but there was probably no comedian in hollywood better equipped to take on the task . where jimmy kimmel did his thing at the emmys this year , meyers is cut from the saturday night live cloth and roasts trump as part of his day job . ",
        "`` good evening ladies and remaining gentleman , '' meyers said to kick off his monologue . `` it 's been years since white men in hollywood have been this nervous '' . one of the better jokes was a set up where meyers said he was n't the most powerful seth in the room . he pointed to seth rogan and quipped about a simpler time where rogan was the only guy messing with north korea . the best and most scathing joke was aimed at harvey weinstein . meyers noted that the sexual predator was n't at the awards show , but he would be back in twenty years when he 's the first ever person to be booed during the in memoriam .
