        "the world 's longest glassfloor bridge will open to the public on sunday in shijiazhuang , hebei province . the bridge , which stretches 488 meters , is 2 meters wide and hangs 218 meters above the valley floor between two steep cliffs in the hongyagu scenic area in pingshan county . it is paved with 1,077 panes of transparent glass , each 4 centimeters thick , and weighs a total of 70 metric tons . the sky bridge is designed to swing a little while visitors walk to its center , creating a thrill for visitors , according to hebei bailu group , the local tourism company that built the bridge . ",
        "while walking on the bridge , tourists can enjoy the surrounding hongyagu scenery , which boasts a unique geographic landscape with mountain views , natural waterfalls , ancient towns and temples . the bridge was designed to support up to 2,000 people , though it 's expected that only 500 will be on it at one time , said liu qiqi , director in charge of construction . `` the bridge 's load-carrying capacity is as much as 3.5 times the country 's standard for bridges . besides , we only allow 500 people on it at most , '' liu said . ",
        "it took a year and a half to build the bridge , which can resist the strongest winds . many glass-floor bridges and skywalks have been built around china in recent years . a bridge 430 meters long and 6 meters wide opened last year in the grand canyon scenic area in zhangjiajie , hunan province . it was said to be the longest and highest bridge of its kind in the world . but the one at hongyagu is the only one in china supported by structures beneath the span , liu said . about 300 kilometers southwest of downtown beijing , the hongyagu scenic area is near xibaipo , a popular visitor spot because of its revolutionary history . ",
        "the leadership of the communist party of china was based there from may 1948 until early 1949 . wang mian , a shijiazhuang resident , said she had planned to try the bridge on sunday but is nervous just thinking about it .   "
