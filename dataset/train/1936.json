        "donald trump is the most powerful person in sports this year . so says sportsbusiness journal in its annual 50 most influential list , which was published on monday naming trump `` for his angry , loud and visceral rhetoric that has divided the sports industry and caused massive reaction , response and reflection . '' `` there are many elements about this choice that are unfortunate , '' wrote the trade publication 's executive editor abe madkour . `` the biggest being it 's not a positive for the industry we work in and cover . but when pressed to decide who had the greatest influence -- positive or negative -- on the sports business this year , it came down to an individual outside of sports who had the business on its back foot since he arrived on the political scene in 2015 . ",
        "`` trump 's year in sports most prominently featured his battle , mostly by using twitter , with nfl players for their protests during the national anthem and the league for its failure , in his opinion , to address kneeling players by mandating standing during the star spangled banner . he also famously withdrew the golden state 's invitation to come to the white house after warriors guard stephen curry said he would n't go . recently , trump 's back and forth with lavar ball over being `` ungrateful '' for what trump said was his help to get ucla basketball players , including his son liangelo , out of china after shoplifting , got plenty of play . ",
        "`` nothing drove more attention to -- and response from -- the sports industry than trump , '' madkour wrote . the amount of media attention was overwhelming . `` nba commissioner adam silver , who finished first last year , was no . 2 on the list , followed by mlb commissioner rob manfred , nfl commissioner roger goodell and nbc sports chairman mark lazarus . the biggest year over year jumps on the list were fanatics owner michael rubin , who moved up 10 spots from no . 29 last year to no . 19 this year . ",
        "the biggest drop was under armour founder and ceo kevin plank , who fell 18 spots from no . 16 to no . 34 . two athletes made the most influential list : lebron james and colin kaepernick .   "
