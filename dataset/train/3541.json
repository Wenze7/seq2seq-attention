        "shelton -- a proposed 11-building fountain square complex on the 19-acre bridgeport avenue site which once housed the united illuminating western service center just got smaller . the city 's planning and zoning commission this week recommended that two smaller retail buildings and an outdoor coffee shop be removed from the proposal at 801 bridgeport ave. `` it 's a win for save our shelton , '' said greg tetro , a leader of the grass-roots group that has been fighting over-development . `` save our shelton is very pleased that this new planning and zoning commission is considering our recommendation for better , smarter developments . '' ",
        "commissioners jimmy tickey , anthony pogoda and mark widomski , all of whom were endorsed by sos in last fall 's election , and charles kelly pushed for the reduction in the number of buildings on the complex . originally , the fountain square proposal called for 11 buildings including a four story 123-room hotel , a pharmacy , a three-story 13,200 square foot office building , three retail buildings comprising 32,600 square feet of retail , two restaurants and a drive-through restaurant , a bank and a coffee shop . now it 's back to the drawing board for the new jersey-based developers ; dominick thomas , their derby-based land use lawyer , and their architect , patrick rose , of rose tiso and co. . ",
        "llc in fairfield . widomski , a first-term commissioner , said he would like the hotel to be more like a conference center that would bring more business into the city and pushed through a recommendation that the complex be surrounded by sidewalks . the recommendation for sidewalks on bridgeport avenue was made early in the evening to robert a. scinto , whose firm is proposing to build a 26,200 square foot shopping center on three acres at 899-905 bridgeport ave. , now holding eight vacant deteriorating buildings . scinto said he was willing to include that request in his plans as well as several suggestions from save our shelton members for benches and open green space . ",
        "the commission will discuss scinto 's proposal next month . `` it 's very heartening to see dialogue between the commissioners ... it makes for better discussion , '' said caitlin augusta , another sos member . `` hopefully they 'll require more open space amenities and push back on the buildings along bridgeport avenue . '' a preliminary resolution could be submitted as early as the commission 's feb. . 14 meeting .   "
