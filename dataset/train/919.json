        "dell has a new productivity tool that will help pc owners streamline their daily work : dell mobile connect . with this , android and ios users can mirror their phone 's display onto their computer display , enabling them to see and interact with their phone without actually touching the handset . even better , the software is available for anyone to download now . the downside ? you must have one of a select number of dell computers to use it . dell mobile connect is simple : download it onto your windows pc , download it onto your android or ios devices , then set the software up . ",
        "your phone 's display will appear on your laptop , so you can put the handset away in a charging cradle or drawer and get to work . notifications on your phone will be visible directly on your pc . you can make and take calls , respond to texts , and interact with apps . users are given control over which app notifications will appear on the pc , helping minimize distractions while working . audio from the handset will play on the pc 's speakers ; text can be typed with the pc 's keyboard . assuming the phone app supports this , you 'll also be able to interact with the mobile device using your pc 's touchscreen and mouse . ",
        "this all happens via a point-to-point connection , according to dell , meaning it is secure . before you get too excited , though , know this : there 's a small catch , and that catch is that not all pcs are supported . you 'll need to be using a new dell consumer-tier inspiron , xps , alienware , or vostro system . as for the mobile device , you 'll need to be using at least android 5 or at least ios 10 . the software is available through the microsoft store and through dell 's website .
