        "texas southern has been the swac 's top dog of late , winning the league 's regular season title the last three seasons and the conference tournament three of the past four years . it wo n't be a cakewalk for the tigers in 2018 . they have stiff competition . arkansas-pine bluff is a legitimate contender . the golden lions came into monday night 's matchup with tsu as the lone unbeaten team in conference , winning their first six league games . the golden lions remain undefeated , beating the tigers in dramatic fashion 74-72 at the h&pe arena . ",
        "martaveous mcknight connected on a 3-pointer to tie the game at 72 with 1.5 seconds remaining and was fouled . tsu coach mike davis was assessed a technical for arguing the foul call . mcknight missed the foul shot but made both technical foul shots to conclude the scoring . `` you never foul people on jump shots , '' tsu coach mike davis . `` that 's the worst thing you can do is foul a jump shooter . '' the loss was heartbreaking for the tigers , who erased an eight-point early second-half deficit and led by four points with 2:19 remaining before letting the golden lions escape with the win . ",
        "lamont walker 's desperation 3-pointer at the buzzer misfired , handing tsu its third loss in four games . derrick bruce scored 25 points and donte clark 21 for the tigers , whose 27-game home win streak came to an end . clark was coming off a 41-point performance in saturday 's win over mississippi valley state . bruce was 8 of 18 from the field -- 3 of 10 on 3-pointers -- but davis would like to have seen bruce go to the basket more . `` when they 're in a zone , that does n't mean you shoot jump shots , '' davis said . ",
        "`` just drive the ball . '' charles jackson scored 20 of his team-high 25 points in the first half for uapb , which went 0-14 in non-conference games . mcknight , who had 14 points on monday on 3 of 15 shooting , was coming off a monster game saturday at prairie view a&m , putting up a season-high 39 points with six rebounds , five assists and three steals . tsu , which led by as many as five points in the first half , stayed in the game with its rebounding . the tigers enjoyed a 45-29 advantage on the boards with marquis salmon collecting 10 .
