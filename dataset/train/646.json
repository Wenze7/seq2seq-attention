        "celtic and burnley both had officials at porto 's match with tondela this weekend , report a bola . the portuguese newspaper names celtic and burnley along with arsenal and manchester united as having spies at the match . a bola do n't pretend to know who the two clubs could be interested in , but it 's likely to be a player from porto , the home team . brendan rodgers often has his celtic spies at portuguese matches , sending scouts at least a few times a season . this season the visits have n't been quite as often as the previous campaign , but visiting porto would suggest an ambitious target is being watched . ",
        "burnley are one of the premier league clubs least seen at portuguese matches , so there 's every chance sean dyche has his an eye on some in-particular . porto won the match , with moussa marega scoring the only goal of the game . celtic were linked with marega last year when he was on loan from porto at vitoria guimaraes , and rodgers had scouts watching that club at the time . the striker may be out of the price range of both burnley and celtic now , and that 's unlikely to change if he continues scoring goals .
