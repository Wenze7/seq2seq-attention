        "and you do n't even have to house train it . the revolution will not be televised . it 'll be sent to your inbox by us . put simply , spotmini is a robot dog made by boston dynamics , the softbank-owned robotics firm that 's doing its best to imitate man 's best friend with motors and circuit boards . it 's strange , cute , weirdly dog-like , and , well , something you just have to see . it is n't just for looking at , though . it 's actually a helper tool to assist in household chores while using its four legs to balance . ",
        "in addition to its new , sleek design , it has an extendable arm to help with various tasks . can your pupper load the dishwasher like this one ? i did n't think so . `` spotmini has a diversity of capability , '' boston dynamics founder marc raibert has said about spotmini . `` its mobility is very good , its manipulation skills are coming along , the vision is pretty good . so we 're starting to turn the corner to think about how to make it a product . '' the company 's previous robot , a bipedal humanoid called atlas , was so agile and humanlike that many reporters and commenters thought it was a little eerie . ",
        "that reaction was enough to make google 's communications team think about distancing google x from the team in boston . `` smart robotics are going to be a key driver of the next stage of the information revolution , and marc and his team at boston dynamics are the clear technology leaders in advanced dynamic robots , '' softbank group chairman masayoshi son said when his mega-corporation acquired the company from alphabet . these robo-doggos will be leaping into our homes sometime in the next few years . keep your eyes peeled for their signature trot , coming soon to a home near you . ",
        "you 've read that , now watch this : `` boston dynamics ' atlas robot does a backflip '' : .   "
