        "the oakland raiders never really recovered from the decision to trade jon gruden to tampa bay 16 years ago . there was a super bowl trip the following season when oakland lost to gruden 's buccaneers and another play-off appearance in 2016 under jack del rio that garnered little optimism because quarterback derek carr was injured . but there has been mostly a run of losing seasons under nine coaches as only the cleveland browns had lost more games during gruden 's 16-year absence than the raiders . owner mark davis hopes that will all change now that he has finally lured gruden back for a second stint as the team 's coach . ",
        "a person with knowledge of the team 's plans said the raiders are planning a news conference tuesday to announce that gruden is leaving the broadcast booth to come back to coaching . the person spoke on condition of anonymity friday because the team has made no formal announcement . the raiders fired del rio following a disappointing six-win season and talk immediately turned to gruden , who has been out of coaching since being fired by tampa bay following the 2008 season . gruden has spent the past nine years as the lead analyst for espn 's monday night football telecast . ",
        "he is scheduled to work his final game saturday in kansas city when the chiefs take on the tennessee titans in a playoff game . then after that he will head to oakland with the task of resurrecting carr after a down year and getting the raiders back to the postseason . oakland won 12 games in 2016 to earn del rio a four-year extension but the team fell flat this season . the offense regressed after the decision to fire coordinator bill musgrave and replace him with untested todd downing . the defense struggled mightily before a late-season switch from fired coordinator ken norton jr to play-caller john pagano . ",
        "that led to the decision to fire del rio following his third season and go hard after gruden . espn reported that gruden will receive a 10-year deal that could be worth close to $ 100 million . gruden has already started putting together a staff with cincinnati defensive coordinator paul guenther among those expected to join . gruden told espn earlier this week that he had a good talk with davis about returning to the organization and believed there was a `` good chance '' it would happen . gruden spent four seasons as coach in oakland from 1998-2001 . ",
        "after leading the raiders to 8-8 records his first two years , gruden helped the team reach the afc title game following the 2000 season and got oakland back into the playoffs the following season . his tenure ended shortly after the `` tuck rule '' loss to the new england patriots when he was traded the following month to tampa bay for two first-round draft picks , two second-rounders and $ 8 million . gruden beat the raiders in the super bowl in his first season with the buccaneers but did n't win another playoff game for tampa bay in his final six seasons . ",
        "he has a 95-81 career record . the raiders have complied with the `` rooney rule '' and interviewed minority candidates for the job , according to nfl spokesman joe lockhart . `` i can tell you we believe the rooney rule was complied with , '' lockhart said . `` minority candidates were interviewed and we will wait and see the decision they make . `` a second person with knowledge of the team 's plans said one of the minority candidates who interviewed was tight ends coach bobby johnson . the person spoke on condition of anonymity because the raiders were not releasing the names of candidates . ",
        "this would not mark the first time the raiders brought back a coach for a second stint . late owner al davis hired art shell in 2006 , 11 years after firing him the first time . shell went 2-14 that season and was fired after one year . other teams have also done it , with one of the most recent notable coaching hires being joe gibbs in washington . gibbs stepped away following the 1992 season with three super bowl titles in his career . he came back in 2004 and had a 30-34 record in four seasons , leading washington to two playoff berths . ",
        "the timing of the news conference was first reported by the raiders snake pit website .   "
