        "organizational leaders as behavioural economists ? leaders shape culture through the choices they make ... and that is a matter of economicsin his classic book , organizational culture and leadership , ed schein proposes six mechanisms by which leaders can shape the culture in their organizations . the actions leaders take reveal the trade-offs they make , and make strong statements about what they think is important . since trade-offs and choices are the subject of behavioural economics , what can we learn when we view them from that perspective ? in part i we zoomed in on two of the mechanisms ; this post focuses on the remaining four . ",
        "`` how leaders allocate rewards and status '' rewards are often equated with bonuses , or with other material benefits , like a nicer office or a better company car . in predictably irrational , dan ariely explains the difference between two worlds in which we simultaneously live . one is ruled by market norms , where we see interactions as transactions , with a cost that should be less than the corresponding benefit . in the other one we 're guided by social norms . here , interactions are about ongoing relationships , and we do n't expect immediate or direct reciprocity . ",
        "instead we do what we believe is right , in the confidence that others will do the same . prominent use of material rewards makes the workplace into a place where market norms prevail . if that is not the kind of culture you want , then you need to think beyond using financial incentives . what else is valuable to you that you could ` allocate ' to your people ? it 's your ultimate scarce resource : your time . a leader who spends time with people who perform well , helping them with her wisdom and her network sends a stronger message to her team about what is important than if she were simply to pay the better performers more . ",
        "people see more significance in what is salient than what they can not see , even if they know it happens . furthermore , others will also see clearly what the leader regards as good performance . should she reward results , or actions ? context can play a huge role in outcomes , and it is best to reflect this in what you reward . if you value collaboration , constructive criticism or curiosity , rewarding people purely on the basis of their achievements may not be the best approach . what about status ? you can also narrowly see this as a kind of reward : giving people more responsibility is a way of recognizing them . ",
        "but a leader has a much richer grip on status . for example , how does she treat someone who has made a mistake ? people are generally loss averse -- and that includes averse to losing face and status . publicly berating a team member who made an error may seem like a clear way of setting an example , but if instead , you treat them with genuine respect , separate the decision from the person and indeed recognize the opportunity to learn , you are not only creating a climate of psychological safety that protects people 's status . ",
        "you also avoid being an asshole . `` what leaders pay attention to , measure and control on a regular basis '' conventionally , leaders are expected to pay attention to achievements : cost and efficiency savings , winning a new customer , meeting milestones and so on . they often do so too . but that is not how leaders ought to shape culture . through what they systematically pay attention to , leaders distinguish between what they find more important and what is less so . that , in turn , serves to form the habits that are the bedrock of the organization 's culture . ",
        "regular meetings are a great platform to do so . what is the first topic on the agenda ? is it the habitual review of business performance ? or is it devoted to discussing what team members have learned -- for example about how their work affects or serves their colleagues elsewhere in the organization ? what if , to kick off the weekly meeting , someone in the team were to give both a good and a bad example of applying the corporate values they recently experienced ? even if such themes are put on the agenda , there is a world of difference between placing them at the end , and moving them top of the bill . ",
        "and if you want to amplify that further , consider the ikea effect . people derive a personal sense of importance from investing their own time and effort in something . you could ask someone to talk about what they 've learned in the last couple of weeks as a by-the-by at the end of the regular team meeting . or you could ask them on beforehand to prepare a short talk about it , and place that first on the agenda . you probably know which choice will have the biggest impact . `` how leaders react to critical incidents and organizational crises '' they say that in prosperity our friends know us , and in adversity we know our friends . ",
        "it is the same in organizations : leader talk is cheap , and leader actions can still be cheap when the going is good , but it 's at crunch time that leaders really show their colours by the choices they make . the trade-offs we make reveal a great deal about what we are really like , and high pressure situations accentuate this even more . so a crisis is a time to be wary of knee-jerk reactions . hasty judgements will be with you for a long time . take the time to make decisions that will still stand up once the crisis is over . ",
        "the process by which you respond can be as significant as the actual response itself , there are also trade-offs to be made . determining a way forward on your solitary own is quick , and asserts your authority as a leader . but what if you traded some of that , and involved the team ? might take a bit more time , but it sends out a strong signal of inclusion and togetherness , and of respecting people 's insights and opinions crises are not necessarily only those that befall the organization . what if one of the team members has a serious problem at home ? ",
        "a leader who considers this is nothing to do with work , and who leaves the colleague to his own devices sends out a rather different message than one who flexes the team to reassign the workload , perhaps even freeing up some time for direct support to the team member with the domestic crisis . in good times , principles can look self-evident and easy to get behind . but when they are suddenly placed in conflict with each other , all eyes are on the leader . how will she respond when a customer demand requires everyone rolling up their sleeves and burning the midnight oil , and at the same time a team member has a seriously sick child at home ? ",
        "that 's when culture is really being shaped . `` how leaders recruit , select , promote and excommunicate '' new hires , and people who are promoted are beacons for ` the kind of person that gets ahead in this place ' . this is an area where leaders , more than elsewhere , tend to see themselves as rational , well-considered decision makers , relying on their unquestioned objective evaluation . unfortunately , reality is different . unconscious bias in personnel decisions has been receiving quite a bit of attention lately . an hbr article from june 2017 summarizes the problem and gives some tips to avoid the worst mistakes . ",
        "these range from scrutinizing the wording in job descriptions for concealed stereotyping to separating ` likeability ' as a trait to be evaluated , rather than allowing it to dominate all other information and simply promoting the person we like best . being blind to all irrelevant characteristics of a candidate is almost impossibly hard , however -- which is why the behavioural insights team developed a tool to help anonymize and randomize recruitment . but you can not delegate all decisions to a piece of software : as a leader you must have the final word . think about the message your choice will project into the organization . ",
        "what trade-offs are you making in selecting a particular external candidate for filling a role , or preferring one colleague over another for a promotion ? that 's what others will see and remember . also be aware of the potential bias in people 's perception : you may have been meticulously objective , but they may still think you selected someone because you went to the same school . so , do what you can to minimize bias , for sure , but also communicate your decision clearly and transparently -- that is the best way to use hiring , promoting and firing as a mechanism for shaping the culture you want . ",
        "we make choices all the time , and these choices tell others what matters to us . that is the background against which schein 's six mechanisms set out the kind of choices leaders make that shape culture . by deliberately adopting a economics viewpoint , you can make the choices that help deliver the culture you want . edgar h schein , organizational culture and leadership , 3rd ed , jossey bass 2004 dan ariely : predictably irrational , harper 2009 rebecca knight : 7 practical ways to reduce bias in your hiring process , hbr june 2017 behavioural insights team : applied , www .
