        "from a distance , the muffled sounds of laughter could be heard along with the loud crackle of a microphone . marxist guerrillas from the national liberation army were hosting an event for residents of noanamá , a village in the rainforest in northwestern colombia . after updating the audience on the latest developments in peace negotiations with the government , rebels took turns at the mic taunting each other with rhyming ditties that were met with raucous laughter and applause . among those trying out their wit that evening was an afro-colombian rebel whose nom de guerre is negro primero . ",
        "he joined the group , which is best known by its spanish initials , eln , when he was 15 years old , he said , but would not share his current age or where he was from . he did concede that he 'd previously been stationed in arauca , an oil-rich province that 's been the group 's stronghold for the past 35 years . asked what kept him and his comrades in the bush -- more than a year after the revolutionary armed forces of colombia had agreed to lay down its arms -- he responded : `` let me ask you something , my little gringo . ",
        "what would you do if you were born here , amid this misery and injustice ? '' an eln flag marks the limit of the rebels ' territory along the atrato river . photographer : ramón campos iriartea three-month cease-fire -- the first in three years of negotiations between the eln and the government -- expired on jan. . 9 . while the rebel leadership , which claims around 4,000 fighters , has pledged to carry on with talks , there 's a possibility the rank and file will resume attacks on a vital oil pipeline that runs through arauca . ",
        "since it was inaugurated in 1986 , the 485-mile conduit , which connects the caño limón oil field operated by occidental petroleum corp. . to the port of coveñas on the caribbean sea , has been dynamited about a thousand times -- or once a week , on average . there have been so many holes made in it some locals refer to it as la flauta . the attacks have claimed 167 lives and put the pipeline out of commission for 3,800 days , or 10.4 years , according to the state oil company , ecopetrol sa , depriving it and its private-sector partners of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue . ",
        "some 1.5 million gallons of crude have been spilled since 2000 alone , which has n't endeared the eln to environmentalists . the group was founded in 1964 by students inspired by the cuban revolution and catholic priests steeped in liberation theology . unlike the farc , which relied heavily on drug trafficking to fund itself , the eln has supported itself through a combination of kidnapping , extortion , and voluntary contributions . victor de currea-lugo , a professor at the national university of colombia in bogotá and a leading expert on the group , points out that arauca is virtually the only place in the country with little to no coca crops , thanks to an eradication campaign carried out by the eln . ",
        "bombings have taken a 485-mile colombian pipeline out of commission for 3,800 daysthe distinction never made much difference in washington , which designated both the eln and the farc as terrorist organizations in 1997 . under president george w. bush , washington sharply ramped up military aid to colombia , with just shy of $ 100 million earmarked for training and equipping a colombian brigade dedicated to protecting the pipeline . the prospect of a resumption of attacks in arauca is a worrying one for president juan manuel santos , who 's been working to lure foreign companies to colombia to explore for oil and minerals . ",
        "the colombian petroleum association , an industry group , expects investment by private oil companies to jump as much as 45 percent in 2018 , to $ 4.9 billion , spurred by an improvement in security and the introduction last year of tax breaks for those investing in former conflict zones . yet in a meeting with reporters in december , the association 's president , francisco josé lloreda , said that 's still too little to replenish crude reserves , which have dipped to the equivalent of five years of production . colombia 's neighbors , ecuador and venezuela , have about 40 years and 340 years of reserves , respectively . ",
        "`` we have used the pipeline as a strategy to influence government and to pressure multinationals , '' says negro primero . `` but we are not using it as a tool to influence the negotiations . '' after more than 40 attacks in the first nine months of 2017 , including one that shut down the pipeline for seven weeks -- the longest it 's been non-operational in 30 years -- there have been no incidents since the cease-fire took effect . the show of goodwill has n't mollified juan carlos echeverry , who stepped down as president of ecopetrol in august . ",
        "he calls the eln `` an anachronism '' and says the group `` needs to stop its irrational violence . '' it 's common to see indigenous and afro-colombian youth among the guerrilla ranks . photographer : ramón campos iriartebruce bagley , a professor at the university of miami who 's an expert on the conflict , says he feels optimistic about negotiations . while the rebels are often portrayed as intransigent , bagley says `` the eln is serious about peace . '' and so is the government : `` peace could attract lots of foreign investment , which santos needs asap . '' ",
        "negro primero says a treaty like the one struck with the farc in 2016 will amount to surrender or , even worse , could lead to the eln 's annihilation . since laying down arms , 11 former farc fighters have been assassinated , presumably by right-wing paramilitaries or paid hitmen working for landowners or politicians who would prefer to see the rebels behind bars or dead rather than reintegrated into society . the eln rebels are demanding guarantees of their safety if they disarm . bagley acknowledges that santos has n't fulfilled many of the pledges made in the peace process with the farc . ",
        "in particular , the government has dragged its feet implementing land reform and ensuring security . the eln argues its struggle is necessary to help bring about racial and environmental justice and fairer land distribution , and to resist exploitation by foreign corporations . in an end-of-year address posted online , the eln 's jefe máximo , who goes by the alias gabino , promised to continue negotiations even if hostilities resumed . meanwhile , colombia 's defense minister , luis carlos villegas , said in a speech in december that the army would `` confront with full force '' if the cease-fire is n't extended . ",
        "for his part , negro primero seems less than eager to lay down the u. s.-made m16 rifle that lies by his side during our conversation . `` we 're proud to be the last armed insurgency on the continent , '' he says . `` we 'll fight to the end if we have to . ''   "
