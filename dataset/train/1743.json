        "david and victoria beckham have unwittingly revealed their eye-wateringly expensive drinking habits after posing with a bottle of wine on snapchat . fashionista victoria , 43 , showed off an empty bottle of californian vino screaming eagle in her latest social media video , and according to some vendors , the wine can cost up to £ 2,750 , depending on its year of production . david 's tattooed hand was covering the bottle 's year of production , meaning the actual price of the wine remains a mystery . however , the cheapest edition of the wine , produced in 2014 , still costs £ 466 , a staggering amount for any connoisseur to spend . ",
        "meanwhile if you 're keen to purchase a bottle of the 2012 cabernet sauvignon you 'll need to cough up £ 2,464 . in a recent interview , victoria complained she would n't buy wine costing `` less than a tenner '' - but she did n't give any indication she 'd be willing to pay 275 times more . getty - contributorscreaming eagle 's 1992 imperial-sized cabernet once fetched the highest price ever paid for a bottle of wine during a charity auction . and the company website is so exclusive that customers have to sign up to a waiting list to even hear of the possibility of purchasing the posh plonk .

        "the beckhams - who bought a £ 27m country estate in 2015 - have shocked their fans with other extravagances on numerous occasions . david , 42 , has confessed to buying victoria an albino nilo crocodile himalayan hermès birkin bag - thought to be one of the `` rarest in the world '' - that cost a reported £ 80,000 and was encrusted with 245 diamonds . and in 2015 david was also mocked for paying £ 1,000 to eat pie and mash , his fave dish , on a transatlantic , private flight . in 2012 reports claimed they 'd spent £ 250k on an 11-night christmas holiday in the maldives and in 2016 victoria revealed she spends £ 50,400 a year on personal trailers .
