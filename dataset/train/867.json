        "with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies hitting new highs , initial coin offerings or token generation events continue to attract attention as a means of raising funding to finance new crypto projects . while regulators are still largely playing catch-up with the latest cryptocurrency trends , increasing scrutiny is being applied to the crypto world , and regulators are moving to apply legal frameworks to icos and crypto projects , including moves to ensure the crypto industry is paying tax and complying with securities law . previous articles by lupercal have identified some of the key regulatory considerations for icos . ",
        "at a high level , we see three regulatory areas that must be addressed by a project considering an ico : anti money-laundering/counter terror-financing law ; corporations and finance regulations , which often involves determining whether ico tokens constitute securities ; andthe tax treatment of ico proceeds . complying with these regulations can be costly and complex . the corporate tax outcomes alone could potentially result in over 30 % of ico proceeds being owed to a tax authority -lrb- in addition to value added tax that could apply at rates of 20 -- 25 % or more on parts of the proceeds ! -rrb- . ",
        ". tax and icosat a high-level , there are two key taxes that can impact an ico : income tax , imposed on the ` income ' of an entity , and vat , imposed on supplies made by an entity . vatvat systems effectively create a tax liability where an entity makes certain kinds of ` supplies ' . many ` supplies ' the average person makes are familiar : they include goods or services . but vat can apply to a much wider range of ` supplies ' than is commonly thought : insurance products , certain kinds of financial derivative products , and some vouchers for example . ",
        "while most regulators have not yet published their formal position on the vat treatment of tokens or coins issued by ico projects , there is a real chance that ico tokens sales could constitute supplies and be subject to vat . vat is a ` high compliance cost ' tax as the vat treatment of ico tokens may be different in each jurisdiction . without considering the impact of vat , you may wake up one morning to a large vat bill from a country half-way across the world . income and international taxincome tax rules vary across jurisdictions , but as a general rule , corporate income tax is effectively imposed on the ` net income ' enjoyed by an entity in a particular jurisdiction . ",
        "as we previously explained here , it may be that the proceeds raised from certain icos are taxable income under many jurisdictions ' corporate tax rules . this could mean that entities face a significant income tax bill shortly after their ico . our previous article explains how corporate tax may work in many jurisdictions on a domestic income tax basis . however , the global nature of ico projects -- which may involve a team spread across the world and purchasers located in nearly every country -- means that principles of ` international tax ' will likely come into play for an ico project . ",
        "in general , tax is imposed by a particular country on either : a residency basis , i. e. on an entity 's ` global ' income ; ora source basis , i. e. country-by-country where the income is generated . these rules effectively add another ` condition ' , to whether an amount is taxable income in a particular country . in simple terms , this means that a country imposes corporate tax when an amount is income and that income has a ` source ' in that country , or that income is generated by entities that are ` residents ' of that country . ",
        "if neither of those rules are satisfied , a country typically wo n't impose income tax on proceeds -- in this case , international tax rules effectively assume that such income will be taxable elsewhere and is a question for another country . the application of tax treaties entered into between various jurisdictions may further complicated the matter . icos and international tax structuringassuming that ico proceeds are ` taxable income ' , international tax principles potentially add another set of tax consideration for ico entities . these principles can be central to managing the global tax exposure of many multinational entities . ",
        "many ico projects are actively exploring or reconsidering the location of their token-issuing entity to manage potential tax outcomes , in part because of the tax residency considerations . of particular interest to ico projects is the use of ` tax neutral ' jurisdictions as the location of the ico issuing entity , with a separate service/development entity located where the other project members are based . another alternative that some operations have explored is to relocate their entire ico group altogether . in simple terms , if entities are resident in a jurisdiction that does not impose tax , they are not taxed on all of their global income . ",
        "at a very high level , the potential impact of adopting a structure where the ico issuer in based in a tax neutral jurisdiction , as compared to a higher tax jurisdiction , is illustrated below . but residency is the tip of a large iceberg of structuring considerations . poorly thought-out , ill-advised , and poorly implemented structures can cause many problems . complexities of structuring -- still the preserve of multinationals ? traditionally , international tax structuring was the preserve of major multinationals and high-net-worth individuals . effective international structures are complex , and require teams of very specialised , expensive lawyers and accountants . ",
        "major leaks such as lux leaks , the panama papers and paradise papers have brought international tax structuring arrangements to the forefront of public debate . complexities of tax structuring -- why does n't everyone do it ? while the basic operation of tax structures is more widely known than it used to be , it is no less complex . recent regulatory changes have made the area much more complicated than it once was . ico projects thinking of simply using an ` off-the-shelf ' structure to achieve desired tax outcomes should carefully consider their options before jumping on such ` solutions ' . ",
        "a structure that operates for one entity is often unlikely to work for another . knowing how to apply international tax law relies on a detailed , particular knowledge of the intricacies of tax law across key jurisdictions and a deep understanding of the commercial operation of the project . as many multinationals are currently finding as a result of the panama papers and paradise papers , the commercial drivers of a project , location of the relevant entities , and type of product/service being supplied will all combine to uniquely impact the tax outcome for each individual ico project . ",
        "in short , whether an ` on paper ' structure is valid can depend on the circumstances of the entity that adopts it -- it is often a much more complex exercise than it can seem . government/regulation attention on icosas most readers will be aware , many oecd governments around the world have sought to address certain structures that lead to ` tax avoidance ' outcomes for those that employ them . whether a specific structure is seen as legitimate or not often turns on the nature , type and location of the ico project 's activities . in many cases , having an ill-advised or poorly implemented ico structure may actually be worse than not having an ` optimised ' structure -- many countries impose penalties and interest for tax offences that can far exceed any perceived tax ` saving ' . ",
        "corporate vs. non-corporate entitiesin addition to the international tax aspects raised above , determining the type of entities involved in the ico project adds another dimension to ico structures . for instance , some ico projects have sought to use not-for-profit entities as the issuer of ico tokens as , on the face of it , these entities are exempt from corporate income tax , and so may avoid an income tax liability following tokens being issued . this approach is n't without issues though , as the founders of the tezos project are currently discovering : the foundation that raised usd 232 million for their project is still considering whether to fund their litigation fees for the three class-action lawsuits facing tezos in the united states . ",
        "founders and project executives of ico project that use not-for-profit and charitable entities may find that onerous compliance and regulatory considerations constrain their ability to develop the project as they see fit . importantly , how the foundation 's legal documentation is drafted can be key to how its funds can be used . conclusion -- so , is structuring an option for icos ? yes , structuring is definitely an option and an important consideration for icos . but deciding on an ico group structure should not be taken lightly and should be driven by the underlying commercial operations of the project . ",
        "key things to consider ... many ico projects have experienced the post-ico low of receiving a large upfront tax bill after the success of their project and so are drawn to complex and seemingly ` efficient ' structures to manage their potential tax obligations . however , deciding on a structure for your ico is a tricky and involved task that typically requires experienced advisors . every ico project will have unique circumstances , such as the location of the team and where fundraising will occur . often , the longer an ico project progresses without advice , the harder and more expensive it becomes to implement or resolve anything . ",
        "it can be tempting to run pre-ico structuring cheaply , but cheap solutions are often bad solutions . as projects like tezos highlight , setting up corporate arrangements right from the start can save huge amounts of money and headache in the long run . many structuring options come with trade-offs around risk , financial , commercial , legal , or tax positions . it is a good idea to discuss these trade-offs and considerations before choosing the right approach for your ico . it may be that the right structure for your ico is not international and does not involve residency considerations -- there are further options that can be explored for an ico project . ",
        "structures that use different entity types can be an effective means of ensuring that the ico ` lump sum ' is amortised or recognised over a longer period as the entity incurs more development expenditure , for example . getting good advice as soon as possible when considering an ico could significantly impact the long-term future of your project . lupercal capital and its network of specialist advisers have worked with many ico projects to guide them through complex commercial and financial considerations of running an ico . we also advise investors and purchasers on which crypto projects have addressed key commercial and financial issues , and set themselves up for long-term success .
