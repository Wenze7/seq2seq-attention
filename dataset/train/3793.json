        "rome - italy 's antitrust authority said thursday it had launched a probe into tech giants apple and samsung for allegedly shortening the lives of their products so clients would buy newer models . the watchdog accused the companies of a `` commercial policy aimed at exploiting the shortcomings of some components to reduce the performance of their products over time and persuade consumers to purchase new versions '' . it said it was also looking into complaints the pair failed to provide information on what consequences software updates pushed by the companies would have on products . the italian probe follows an investigation launched this month into apple in france over suspected `` planned obsolescence '' in some of its iphone models . ",
        "the us company was forced to admit in december that it intentionally slowed down older models of its iphones over time , sparking concerns it was unfairly nudging consumers to upgrade . at the time , apple denied it intentionally shortened the life on any of its products . it said it slowed models to extend the performance of the phone , which uses less power when running at slower speeds , and prevent unexpected shutdowns . the california-based group also faces a class-action suit in the united states . it has been a bad start to the year for samsung too : the electronics giant faces a legal case in france over the alleged use of child labour and other abuses in chinese manufacturing plants producing its products .
