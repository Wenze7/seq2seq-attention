        "washington -- republicans and democrats showed no signs of ending their standoff over immigration and spending saturday as americans awoke to the first day of a government shutdown and congress staged a weekend session to show voters it was trying to resolve the stalemate . the federal government shut down at the stroke of midnight friday , halting all but the most essential operations and marring the one-year anniversary of president donald trump 's inauguration in a striking display of washington dysfunction . last-minute negotiations crumbled as senate democrats blocked a four-week stopgap extension in a late-night vote , causing the fourth government shutdown in a quarter century . ",
        "behind the scenes , however , leading republicans and democrats were trying to work out a compromise to avert a lengthy shutdown . congress gathered for an unusual saturday session to begin considering a three-week version of the short-term spending measure -- and to broadcast that they were at work as the shutdown commences . it seemed likely each side would try forcing votes aimed at making the other party look culpable for shuttering federal agencies . more from cbs newssince the closure began at the start of a weekend , many of the immediate effects will be muted for most americans . ",
        "but any damage could build quickly if the closure is prolonged . and it comes with no shortage of embarrassment for the president and political risk for both parties , as they wager that voters will punish the other at the ballot box in november . social security and most other safety net programs are unaffected by the lapse in federal spending authority . critical government functions will continue , with uniformed service members , health inspectors and law enforcement officers set to work without pay . but if no deal is brokered before monday , hundreds of thousands of federal employees will be furloughed . ",
        "after hours of closed-door meetings and phone calls , the senate scheduled its late-night vote on a house-passed plan . it gained 50 votes to proceed to 49 against , but 60 were needed to break a democratic filibuster . a handful of red-state democrats crossed the aisle to support the measure , rather than take a politically risky vote . four republicans voted in opposition . in an unusual move , senate majority leader mitch mcconnell allowed the roll call to exceed two hours -- instead of the usual 20 or so -- and run past midnight , seemingly accommodating the numerous discussions among leaders and other lawmakers . ",
        "still as midnight passed and the calendar turned , there was no obvious off-ramp to the political stalemate . `` this is the one year anniversary of my presidency and the democrats wanted to give me a nice present , '' the president tweeted early saturday , also claiming they are `` more concerned with illegal immigrants than they are with our great military or safety at our dangerous southern border . '' even before the vote , trump was pessimistic , tweeting that democrats actually wanted the shutdown `` to help diminish the success '' of the tax bill he and fellow republicans pushed through last month . ",
        "white house press secretary sarah sanders later termed the democrats `` obstructionist losers . '' `` this is no way to conduct the nation 's business , '' senate minority leader chuck schumer said late friday . `` republicans know it . democrats know it . the american people know that this party is not capable of governing . '' democrats balked on the measure in an effort to pressure on the white house to cut a deal to protect `` dreamer '' immigrants -- who were brought to the country as children and are now here illegally -- before their legal protection runs out in march . ",
        "the president watched the results from the white house residence , dialing up allies and affirming his belief that democrats would take the blame for the shutdown , said a person familiar with his conversations but not authorized to discuss them publicly . predictably , both parties moved swiftly to blame one another . democrats laid fault with republicans , who control both chambers of congress and the white house and have struggled with building internal consensus . republicans declared democrats responsible , after they declined to provide the votes needed to overcome a filibuster over their desire to force the passage of legislation to protect some 700,000 younger immigrants from deportation . ",
        "republicans branded the confrontation a `` schumer shutdown '' and argued that democrats were harming fellow americans to protect `` illegal immigrants . '' schumer said a `` trump shutdown '' was more accurate . earlier friday , trump had brought new york 's senior senator to the white house in hopes of cutting a deal on a short-term spending agreement . the two new yorkers , who pride themselves on their negotiating abilities , started talking over cheeseburgers about a larger agreement that would have included greater military spending and money for a southern border wall . but the talks fell apart almost as abruptly as they started . ",
        "in a phone call hours later , the president raised new concerns about the deal he and schumer had discussed , according to a person familiar with the conversation . in a subsequent phone call with schumer , chief of staff john kelly said the deal discussed was too liberal . the white house did not immediately comment on that account . budget director mick mulvaney told cnn that `` not much has changed '' over the course of the day , but he predicted a deal would be reached by monday , when most government offices are to reopen after the weekend . ",
        "democrats in the senate had served notice they would filibuster the government-wide funding bill that cleared the house thursday evening . they were seeking an even shorter extension that they think would keep the pressure on the white house to cut a deal to protect the `` dreamer '' immigrants . `` we will not negotiate the status of unlawful immigrants while democrats hold our lawful citizens hostage over their reckless demands , '' sanders said in a statement . trump first described his discussion with schumer as an `` excellent preliminary meeting , '' tweeting that lawmakers were `` making progress -- four week extension would be best ! '' ",
        "but that optimism faded as the evening wore on . mcconnell did not attend the meeting because he was not invited , a senate gop aide said . trump had been an unreliable negotiator in the weeks leading up to the showdown . earlier this week he tweeted opposition to the four-week plan , forcing the white house to later affirm his support . he expressed openness to extending the deferred action for childhood arrivals program , only to reject a bipartisan proposal . his disparaging remarks about african and haitian immigrants last week helped derail further negotiations . trump had been set to leave friday afternoon to attend a fundraiser at his palm beach , florida , estate marking the one-year anniversary of his inauguration but delayed his travel . ",
        "as word of the schumer meeting spread , the white house hastened to reassure republican congressional leaders that trump would not make any major policy concessions , said a person familiar with the conversations but not authorized to be quoted by name . on capitol hill , mcconnell said americans at home would be watching to see `` which senators make the patriotic decision '' and which `` vote to shove aside veterans , military families and vulnerable children to hold the entire country hostage ... until we pass an immigration bill . '' `` we ca n't keep kicking the can down the road , '' said schumer , insisting on more urgency in talks on immigration . ",
        "`` in another month , we 'll be right back here , at this moment , with the same web of problems at our feet , in no better position to solve them . '' the four-week measure would have been the fourth stopgap spending bill since the current budget year started in october . a pile of unfinished capitol hill business has been on hold , first as republicans ironed out last fall 's tax bill and now as democrats insist on progress on immigration . talks on a budget deal to ease tight spending limits on both the pentagon and domestic agencies are on hold , as is progress on a huge $ 80 billion-plus disaster aid bill . ",
        "before thursday night 's house approval , gop leaders sweetened the stopgap measure with legislation to extend for six years a popular health care program for children from low-income families and two-year delays in unpopular `` obamacare '' taxes on medical devices and generous employer-provided health plans . a shutdown would be the first since 2013 , when tea party republicans -- in a strategy not unlike the one schumer is employing now -- sought to use a must-pass funding bill to try to force then-president barack obama to delay implementation of his marquee health care law . at the time , trump told fox & friends that the ultimate blame for a shutdown lies at the top . ",
        "`` i really think the pressure is on the president , '' he said . arguing that trump 's predecessors `` weaponized '' that shut down , mulvaney said friday the budget office would direct agencies to work to mitigate the impact this time . that position is a striking role-reversal for the conservative former congressman , who was one of the architects of the 2013 shutdown over the affordable care act .
