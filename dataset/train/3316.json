        "the toronto maple leafs have been struggling in all areas of the ice in 2018 , but there 's no denying that they miss nikita zaitsev on the blueline . zaitsev , who last played on december 15th against the detroit red wings , has missed 13 games with a broken foot . before the new year rolled around , head coach mike babcock was hoping to have zaitsev back in the lineup after the toronto maple leafs bye-week . well , the leafs bye-week has come and gone , and zaitsev has not returned . it appears the leafs wo n't see him back until at least early february , but there really is n't a target date yet . ",
        "there 's no telling how the leafs blueline will continue to perform without zaitsev for the next few weeks , but his absence has altered the leafs defense dramatically . rising minutesnearly every leaf defenseman has seen a large increase in ice time in zaitsev 's absence . morgan rielly has eclipsed 25 minutes a game five times since zaitsev 's injury . ron hainsey played a season high 26:23 versus the columbus blue jackets , and the game after , jake gardiner played a season high 28:07 versus the ottawa senators . no one , however , has seen their ice-time increase more than roman polak . ",
        "he was averaging 15:26 a game before zaitsev was injured . afterwards , his ice time jumped to an average 18:25 . with rielly battling an arm injury against the flyers , polak played nearly 20 minutes . although zaitsev 's injury opened the door for carrick , his minutes have really fluctuated over that span . he played a season low 9:36 against the new york rangers before the christmas break , but played a season-high 22:06 against the st. louis blues on tuesday . andreas borgman is the only player who 's seen his minutes fall since zaitsev 's been injured , but the difference is pretty small . ",
        "he 's only averaging about 30 seconds less time on ice each game . scrambled pairszaitsev 's absence left a hole in the top-four . babcock has filled it with connor carrick . the team first recalled martin marincin , who played two games and was replaced by travis dermott . dermott had a very impressive nhl debut but has only played four games since his call-up . babcock has decided to rotate dermott and andreas borgman into the lineup just so that they 're both not wasting away in the pressbox . in terms of raw possession , gardiner and carrick have played very well together in zaitsev 's absence . ",
        "both players play better together than without . however , gardiner is better playing away from zaitsev , but zaitsev plays better with gardiner than without . thus , when zaitsev does make his return , he 'll obviously slot back into his usual spot in the lineup . that means the leafs blueline is in for another huge shuffle when he does . eight defensemen , carrick in limbowhen zaitsev returns , toronto will be carrying eight defensemen on the team . there are two huge questions that will be tough to answer when zaitsev is ready to play . ",
        "the biggest one is what happens to carrick . he could n't crack the top six when zaitsev was healthy , so does that mean he returns to the press box ? he has n't played badly enough to justify doing that , but he does look like the odd man out in that scenario . there 's no way the leafs will continue to keep this `` rotation '' thing going on with carrick , borgman , and dermott . babcock seems to like dermott more than carrick , so it remains to be seen what happens with carrick in the coming weeks . ",
        "however , he did play over twenty minutes for the first time this season , so maybe babcock is starting to trust him more . more from editor in leaf toronto maple leafs blow another lead in loss to philadelphia3h ago 60th anniversary of breaking colour barrier15h ago toronto maple leafs : on the road to philadelphia1 d ago toronto maple leafs roundtable : this season 's most pleasant surprises1 d ago toronto maple leafs : fixing the power-play in one move1 d ago that only makes things more interesting . the other question is who gets sent down , because i ca n't see the toronto maple leafs carrying eight defensemen for the rest of the season . ",
        "right now , the team is in a constant rotation between andreas borgman and travis dermott for the sixth spot . neither has played poorly enough to justify being returned to the marlies , but someone has to be sent down . the leafs want to continue to watch dermott play in the nhl , and he 's been performing up to babcock 's standards . borgman made the team out of training camp , and sending him down now would just seem cruel . has dermott made enough of an impact to justify keeping him on the team over carrick or borgman , though ? ",
        "unfortunately , just in terms of seniority and nhl experience , dermott will probably be the one heading back down . final thoughtsall of this is purely speculation since the leafs have not announced a target return date for zaitsev . until we see zaitsev skate , he 's probably not returning anytime soon . when he does , though , the minutes on the blueline should be spread more evenly throughout . the leafs penalty kill will get a huge boost with his return , although it likely means carrick is sent to the press box and dermott to the marlies . ",
        "next : toronto maple leafs roundtable : most pleasant surprises right now , the toronto maple leafs are managing in zaitsev 's absence . they 're not sinking , but they 're not playing up to their usual standards , either . there are way more factors at play than just zaitsev being gone , but they could really use him just to ease off of running their top three defensemen into the ground . at the rate the leafs are playing gardiner , hainsey , and rielly , the players may not have enough gas in the tank left for a deep playoff run . ",
        "that 's a story for another day , though . until then , let 's just enjoy the ride and let zaitsev heal . -- all statistics are from hockey reference . the toronto maple leafs have been struggling in all areas of the ice in 2018 , but there 's no denying that they miss nikita zaitsev on the blueline . zaitsev , who last played on december 15th against the detroit red wings , has missed 13 games with a broken foot . before the new year rolled around ...
