        "nepal 's troubled south votes thursday in historic elections many hope will bring much-needed stability to the desperately poor country , but which have been marred by violence and fears of ethnic tension . the watershed vote marks nepal 's transition from a monarchy to a federal democracy , after emerging from a brutal decade of civil war only to stagger through political turmoil and natural disaster . thousands of police and soldiers had been deployed ahead of polling day in the capital kathmandu and the populous lowlands , with the build-up to the vote hit by violence that has left one dead and dozens injured . ",
        "the south is home to a mosaic of ethnic minorities who say a new post-war constitution denies them political representation , a cause that has sparked bloody protests in recent years . more than 12.2 million people are eligible to vote in the the second phase elections , which come 10 days after the country 's mountainous north cast their ballots . the streets of kathmandu were eerily quiet as polls opened , with vehicles banned from the roads due to security concerns . the vote will elect the country 's first provincial assemblies , devolving power away from a top-heavy central government that has cycled through 10 leaders in the last 11 years . ",
        "`` now there will be specific people responsible for different parts of the country it will be more accountable , '' said bishwa shrestha , 46 , after casting his ballot in kathmandu . the newly-elected assemblies will be tasked with naming their provinces , which are currently referred to by number , as well as choosing capitals and negotiating budgets with kathmandu -- all sensitive considerations that could rekindle tensions in the ethnically-diverse south . `` how the politics will unfold will depend on how the new parliament addresses the problems and how well the provinces can function , '' said political analyst chandra kishor jha , referring to the challenges facing nepal as it enters uncharted territory as a federal state . ",
        "`` if they can not fulfil their promises then the groups that have been part of the struggle will not stay quiet . there is possibility of conflict again . '' politically marginalised years of political turbulence have hampered development in the impoverished himalayan nation , which is still recovering from a powerful earthquake that hit two years ago , killing 9,000 people and destroying over half a million homes . it took nine years after the end of a decade-long civil war to agree to a new constitution . the charter adopted in 2015 mandated a sweeping overhaul of nepal 's political system to give greater autonomy to the provinces . ",
        "but it also sparked deadly protests in the south by ethnic minority groups who say it leaves them politically marginalised , and have demanded amendments to the charter . the communist cpn-uml party is expected to sweep the polls , buoyed by its alliance with the main maoist party comprised of former rebels who fought government forces for a decade . but the nationalistic cpn-uml has strongly opposed amending the constitution to address the demands of ethnic minorities that it views as being more closely aligned with india . many in the southern lowlands share close linguistic and cultural ties with indians across the border . ",
        "nepal 's powerful neighbour to the south has long played the role of big brother in the landlocked country . but in recent years kathmandu has played diplomatic ping-pong with its two large neighbours , india and china , who use big-ticket infrastructure projects to vie for influence . counting of ballot papers from both phases of the elections will begin once polling stations close at 5 pm . results are expected in the next few days . date created : 2017-12-07 .
