        "west ham united have reportedly quoted london rivals chelsea £ 20m for the services of striker andy carroll this month . earlier this month it was claimed that blues manager antonio conte had earmarked carroll as his top target in the january transfer window as he looks to bring in backup for alvaro morata , and was considering making a loan approach for the player . the hammers refused to entertain the idea of a loan move for the 29-year-old , however , and according to sky sports news , they have now informed chelsea that they will only consider offers of a permanent deal in the region of £ 20m for the player this month . ",
        "david moyes 's side are believed to be keen to avoid a protracted saga and would want any deal done quickly in order to spend the funds on replacements as they gear up for a potential relegation battle in the second half of the season . carroll has had a chequered career at west ham since switching from liverpool in 2012 , scoring 25 goals in 86 premier league appearances but spending 929 days on the sidelines through injury .
