        "a second woman has accused actor sylvester stallone of sexual assault , filing a police report last month in santa monica , calif. , according to the hollywood reporter and tmz . both outlets say the incident happened in the 1990s , which puts it outside california 's 10-year statute of limitations for sexual assault . the santa monica police department did not respond immediately to usa today 's request for comment . stallone 's attorney , marty singer , told usa today in an email his client `` categorically disputes the claim and it is apparent that the woman filed the report to get a media outlet to publish the story . '' ",
        "he did acknowledge , `` stallone had a relationship with her for less than a week while shooting a movie in israel in 1987 and that he was single at the time and she was of legal age . '' singer said the woman had been trying for over a month to get an unnamed media outlet to publish a story saying she was allegedly raped in 1987 and again in 1990 . `` a month ago , after the woman was notified that the publication was not willing to publish her story , she filed a police report alleging a rape that occurred 27 years ago , '' he explained . ",
        "`` there would be no reason to file such a report since she knew that it was too old a claim . however , she wanted a story published . notwithstanding that , she filed a police report , the media outlet refused to publish the story . '' singer added that he 'd told the police they would be filing a claim against her for filing a false police report . in mid-november , stallone was accused of sexually assaulting a 16-year-old girl in las vegas while shooting a movie there in 1986 . he would have been 40 at the time . ",
        "`` this is a ridiculous , categorically false story , '' said michelle bega , spokeswoman for stallone , said in november regarding the first accuser . `` no one was ever aware of this story until it was published today , including mr. stallone . at no time , was mr. stallone ever contacted by any authorities or anyone else regarding this matter . '' the weinstein effect : 120 + men accused of sexual misconduct . if you have ever experienced or witnessed sexual misconduct while working in the entertainment industry or news media , we 'd like to hear from you .
