        "in his weekly national television program , venezuelan president nicolas maduro unveiled a plan to evade international sanctions through an oil and natural reserve , backed crytocurrency called petromoneda . about a year ago , npr 's planet money conducted a podcast describing venezuela as an `` economic horror story '' arguing that `` venezuela did n't save its oil money . it used it to subsidize goods and services for the people . '' when oil prices crashed in 2014 , the problems began . in maduro 's december 3rd announcement , he stated that the petro will : `` help defeat the financial blockade and move toward new forms of international financing for the economic and social development of the country . '' ",
        "further , venezuela 's government is establishing the blockchain observatory , `` as an institutional , political and legal basis for the launch of the venezuelan cryptocurrency . '' venezuela 's belief is that the petro will allow the country to `` overcome the bureaucracy of the banks and the dependence on paper money . '' according to reuters , `` washington has levied sanctions against venezuelan officials , pdvsa executives and the country 's debt issuance . '' and , as a result of the recent surge in the value of digital currency such as bitcoin and its `` traction in the mainstream investment world , '' maduro is pivoting away from the u. s. dollar . ",
        "cryptocurrency and bitcoin particularly , is decentralized , meaning it is not issued through a central authority . further , digital currency prices fluctuate exponentially , even more than fiat currency . in this way , bitcoin prices are more-so attached to supply and demand rather than other currencies . despite this , many central banks have discussed issuing digital currency , but no country has done so yet . according to wired , there has been a desire to move away from physical cash toward a cash-less society in countries such as india and sweden . in venezuela however , implementation of such similar mechanisms or a new financial system may prove more difficult due to the surrounding financial issues faced by the countries 31 million citizens .
