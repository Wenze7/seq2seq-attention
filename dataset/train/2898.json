        "the tel aviv stock exchange announced on tuesday that it will blacklist bitcoin-related companies from being traded or listed publicly . `` we will not allow companies whose values are based on bitcoin values , such as natural resource holdings to be included in tase indices , '' head of the israel securities authority , shmuel hauser said in a tuesday press release . `` we will also consider not to allow trading in ` back-door ' ` costumes ' of bitcoins or alike . '' bitcoin -- a digital payment method -- has taken off in the past few months , fluctuating greatly . ",
        "it has gone from trading at $ 2,000 to around $ 17,000 within a few months , along with sudden 20 % plunges within a day , further raising concerns that it could be similar to the dot-com bubble . the cryptocurrency 's supply and demand remains unclear , along with the fact that no central bank is backing bitcoin as legal tender . since the israeli regulators ' announcement , natural resource holdings ' stock has gone down more than 25 % on tase . the company 's stock has risen some 7,000 % in the past year , and tase was debating whether to include the firm on its indices . ",
        "with its dazzling rise , the company could 've been considered for the ta-125 index , which includes the stock exchange 's 125 highest-capitalized companies . the isa is also considering whether to bar other cryptocurrency companies from listing on tase until the markets can agree to a more suitable regulatory framework . when it comes to initial coin offerings -- or unregulated start-up crowdfunding via cryptocurrencies -- tase is looking at tightening its regulations . icos can resemble stocks , and the offering and selling of these currencies can appear to be similar to traditional initial public offerings . ",
        "`` i nominated a task force at the isa that examines the conditions under which an ico is a security ? a currency ? a financial instrument ? or a hybrid that we may term as a ` coin security , ' '' hauser asked . the isa seeks to determine when icos can be classified as securities and fall under securities laws , and regulators will examine the issue on a case-by-case basis . hauser added that a report on icos should be submitted by the end of december .
