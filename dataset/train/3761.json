        "beauty editors have no shortage of skin-care and makeup goodies that come across our desks . so when we become obsessed with something , it says a lot . in our new `` beauty product of the day '' series , we wax poetic about the items that are truly game changers for hair , skin , and nails . there 's more than one way to nail that lit-from-within glow . if you 're looking to do it with skin care , there 's a serum for that . more of a makeup gal ? highlighter has you covered . ",
        "so , when celebrity facialist dr. barbara sturm -- the skin-care guru behind the famous blood moisturizer -- released a single product that combines the two , my ears immediately perked up . glow drops , as they 're fittingly called , are n't the kind of glow-inducer you simply work into your face between toning and moisturizing . the directions say you can either apply them post-moisturizing or on top of makeup . the sole purpose is to make you radiant , after all , and this hybrid helps you get there two ways . the magic happens because the drops contain a complexion-boosting blend of hydrating glycerin , purslane , rose extract , and mineral pigments , which deliver that glisteningly dewy look that everyone pines after . ",
        "to test it for myself , i try it for both purposes : as a skin-care step and as a sort of gloss over my makeup . when i slather over my skin post-moisturizing , it evens out my complexion and helps demolish any redness . on top of my tinted moisturizer and highlighter duo , on the other hand , the glow drops add an iridescence to my face . they also take care of dryness , which tends to come back to my skin after a few hours spent inside with heat . the moral of the story ? ",
        "dr. sturm 's radiance-inducing creation is basically a shortcut to an enviable luminosity any way you use it .   "
