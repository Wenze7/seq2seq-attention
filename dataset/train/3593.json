        "primark owner associated british foods achieved record retail sales in the week before christmas with strong growth in the uk . sales at primark were up seven per cent compared with last year , driven by increased store space , the company said in a trading update for the 16 weeks ended 6 january . as of that date , stores were trading from 14.2 m square feet compared with 13.1 m sq ft a year ago . abf plans to open 1.2 m sq ft of new store space in coming year . the firm said trading was `` good '' in the five weeks leading up to christmas , and it achieved record sales in the week before christmas . ",
        "abf said the uk delivered strong like-for-like sales , but sales across europe were held back by unseasonably warm weather in october . the firm said group revenue was four per cent up on the previous year at constant currency rates . quarterly sales grew across each business except sugar , which slumped by 12 per cent . abf expects a greater reduction in revenue and profit than previously forecast for the full year , mostly due to significantly lower eu sugar prices . the company maintained its full-year earnings guidance , saying it expects `` progress '' in adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings in its full 2017-18 year .
