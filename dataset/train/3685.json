        "angela merkel 's own party bloc is making her life more difficult as hard-liners seek to force the german chancellor to shift to the right in talks on setting up a government . after more than three months of post-election stalemate , merkel is seeking a commitment this week from the rival social democrats to start formal negotiations on extending their governing alliance . any coalition pact also has to accommodate her conservative bavarian sister party , the christian social union , and its tough line on immigration and european policy . merkel 's 12 years in office are feeding a growing sense in parts of her bloc that the exploratory talks that began sunday are the last chance for the current crop of leaders to stay in power . ",
        "the acting chancellor , spd head martin schulz and csu chief horst seehofer -- soon to be replaced as bavarian state premier by a younger leader -- are all vulnerable to a shifting public mood that is skeptical of another `` grand coalition . '' `` all three party leaders have a strong personal interest in the success of the coalition talks , '' said holger schmieding , chief economist at berenberg . a deal might involve the spd allowing curbs on migration demanded by the csu in return for expanded health and old-age benefits , he said . the talks resume at 9 a. m. on monday in berlin . ",
        "schulz told merkel and seehofer privately last week that his political career will be over if the csu , spd and merkel 's christian democratic union ca n't put together a government , bild newspaper reported saturday . seehofer agreed and appeared to suggest that merkel faces the same risk , bild said . the two sides are seeking to finish exploratory talks by thursday . if there 's enough common ground , spd leaders would ask a party convention on jan. . 21 to back full-fledged negotiations on a policy blueprint for a government . ` biggest risk ' many spd members are wary of serving as merkel 's junior partner for a third time after the party 's support plunged to the lowest level since world war ii in an inconclusive national election in september . ",
        "the spd convention `` is the biggest risk for martin schulz , '' schmieding said . merkel , 63 , is regrouping after her attempt to build a patchwork government with the pro-market free democratic party and the greens fell apart in november . she viewed the fdp 's walkout as an attempt to weaken her standing , rather than a result of policy disagreements , a person familiar with her thinking said at the time . modern germany 's longest political deadlock since world war ii has put decisions on hold on everything from euro-area policy to government spending , migration and social programs . ",
        "if the coalition bid fails , merkel may end up leading a government without a parliamentary majority or face a repeat election in which she has said she 'll run again . bavaria 's csu staked out its stance in a die welt newspaper op-ed by alexander dobrindt , the party 's parliamentary leader . he said the party is the vanguard of a `` conservative revolution '' that rejects excessive immigration , political correctness and overbearing government . the positioning reflects the impact of the alternative for germany party , which entered the federal parliament with 12.6 percent of the vote in september after vilifying merkel for refusing to shut germany 's border to refugees . ",
        "merkel 's bloc won the election with 32.9 percent , its worst result since 1949 . personal familiarity and budgetary leeway created by germany 's economic boom may smooth the way to a deal . merkel has governed with the spd for eight of her 12 years in office in a `` grand coalition '' of germany 's two biggest parties . `` while no immediate challenger is in sight , it does mean that it is now more important than ever for her to demonstrate that she can deliver on the one thing even dearer to cdu-csu than their conservative profile : being in government and running the country , '' said carsten nickel , managing director for europe at teneo intelligence in brussels .
