        "do n't always believe what you read ! especially regarding the topic of the arizona cardinals and head coach bruce arians . there has been a ton of news floating around about arians not returning to the cards in 2018 . icymi , @pfweekly has learned the #cardinals and bruce arians will part ways next week -- increasing odds larry fitzgerald retires rather than returning for 15th season -- hub arkush december 26 , 2017 . but hold your horses , because it looks like we 'll be learning of arians ' status with the team a little later on . ",
        "either way , it looks like something is going to change . according to a source , the pro football weekly report that cardinals coach bruce arians and the team will mutually agree to part ways after sunday 's game `` is 100 percent not true . '' the decision will be arians ' to make . -- josh weinfuss december 26 , 2017 . the two-time nfl coach of the year may be back for another go around with the cards after back-to-back disappointing seasons . however , the relationship between the organization and arians has n't been all bad . ",
        "since he took over the team in 2013 , he has gone 48-30-1 with three playoff appearances . it may be hard to fault arians with the lack of success this year , due to star players like carson palmer and david johnson going down with significant injuries . maybe the cards and 65-year-old arians want to link up for one last shot with their aging roster , before the team decides to change directions .
