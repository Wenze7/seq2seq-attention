        "marko arnautovic believes his team were very unlucky not to get all three points against bournemouth . the west ham winger knows his side played very well in the game , but were unable to secure all three points as bournemouth scored a contentious equalizer . the draw keeps west ham in 17th position , only a point above the drop zone . `` i think we were unlucky to only take one point , particularly with how the game ended , '' arnautovic said . `` it was a hard game , a difficult game , and it was tricky for both sides . ",
        "we tried to defend good but in the second half bournemouth attacked more . then i think we turned the game around into a winning position . `` after that , everybody knows what happened . i do n't know if i can be happy with this one point because , for me , the three points were taken away from us . `` it was zero points , then three points , then one point . it was a crazy game for people to come and watch . we entertained everybody this boxing day and i hope people enjoyed the match , but i would have enjoyed it more if we had won .
