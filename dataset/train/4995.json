        "playerunknown 's battlegrounds ' is on xbox today . the console 's more casual feel benefits players who prefer a more strategic , slow-moving pace , but that 's in part because the game 's signature jankiness is significantly jankier here -- it 's hard to play ambitiously when everything from switching weapons to jumping off the airplane is just a little more finicky . if you were hoping for a more polished battlegrounds experience , i 'm sorry . battlegrounds dominated the pc gaming world this year despite boasting more bugs than its developers can likely count . it 's a euphoric game -- a lip-biting , lean-into-your-monitor survival shooter that 's easy to get wrapped up in . ",
        "when developer bluehole announced battlegrounds would be coming to xbox at this year 's e3 , a wave of hype washed over the game 's dedicated audience while other players i spoke with wondered if its glitchy appeal would translate . the answer is yes and no . everything before the actual game is the same roller coaster of graphics quality and framerate drops . the opening screen 's gorgeous high-res image yells , `` this is a high-quality xbox one game ! '' . the lobby where players queue up for matches and the experience of parachuting down from an airplane onto the map look awful . ",
        "objects appear like to load in two dimensions . shadows simply pop into existence . gif gifcollecting items , organizing your inventory , switching between weapons and interacting with battlegrounds ' world feels about the same as it does on pc -- finicky , but ultimately fine in the grand scheme of the game . it often took me several button presses to open a door . picking up a specific item instead of the item next to it is not an easy feat . these are both feelings pc players are familiar with . battlegrounds ' xbox port made two of the game 's more common mechanics frustrating : switching between and reloading weapons . ",
        "although the control scheme notes that a simple `` y '' push should give me my ak-47 instead of my micro uzi , it often took a few pushes , and same with reloading with `` x. '' you have to just really want to do some things to get them done . aiming , of course , is not quite as easy as it is with a mouse and keyboard . i suffered through a number of awkward firefights that , on pc , would have been mercifully shorter : gifstruggling to make battlegrounds ' controller button-mapping feel fluid in my hands reminded me how of very much this game was built for pc . ",
        "there 's just a lot of menu stuff to do in the average battlegrounds game , and a lot of very swift changes that are made swifter on a big keyboard with lots of buttons . thankfully , the xbox port 's menu is actually quite intuitive and fast , making it easier to make certain changes mid-firefight . others , like shifting to a gun scope view , can be a little more testy . but battlegrounds is still battlegrounds on xbox , and once i adjusted to the game 's idiosyncrasies , its charm returned . battlegrounds rules . ",
        "nobody came to this game for its polished graphics or good game feel . lots of fans of the game 's pc iteration might be familiar with the `` how do people like this ? driving is impossible ! '' feeling -- and then the subsequent , `` you know ... . this is actually pretty fun . '' everything great about battlegrounds translates here , as well as everything bad . on xbox , i felt a little less stressed than i would be if i were on pc . with compromised aiming , it was easier to concentrate on the bigger picture . ",
        "i was more excited about exploring the world . if i was n't about to headshot someone , or make a swift weapon change when i needed it most , i could focus more on a more sprawling gameplay strategy . the ability to make minute changes to a mouse position for optimal aim does n't matter on console . i easily sunk into my couch while my character crouched in a bedroom , gun pointed out a window , just waiting . battlegrounds on xbox makes the game more for everybody , if possible -- as long as its glitchiness does n't deter you .
