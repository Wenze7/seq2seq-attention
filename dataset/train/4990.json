        "after posting my first post on crypto -- and seeing all the hype around the comments , i was immediately reminded that people are way too obsessed with bitcoin . no -- i 'm not publicly commentating on the asset . instead i 'm simply trying to make a rational argument for why people are too obsessed with the asset class . let 's do a thought experiment : imagine you invested $ 10,000 into bitcoin today at the current price of $ 17,000 . now imagine that the currency goes to the higher end of bullish predictions . congrats -- your stake is now worth $ 60,000 after fees or the equivalent of one year 's rent in san francisco . ",
        "not bad -- but also not life changing . consider a counter example -- imagine that you partnered with a friend to start a simple app that solved a simple problem , and raised $ 1mm of funding from a group of angel investors at a $ 5mm valuation . 3 -- 4 years later , that app was successful in solving a problem and is now worth $ 20mm - congrats ! in order to get the same returns on crypto , you would have to invest $ 2.66 mm of your own money in a wildly speculative investment . ",
        "even then you 're still not at par - as you 've acquired no real skillset . have fun with bitcoin , ethereum , and all the other altcoins , but remember , just because the numbers are updating 24/7 and the headlines are wild , it is not going to help you change the world . note : this is not to say that crypto and the blockchain and its entrepreneurs will not change the world .
