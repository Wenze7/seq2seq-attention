        "how much to have saved by every age is a perennial personal finance question , right up there with how to create a budget and how to start investing . but like so many money decisions , there 's no single , magic number that works for everyone . fidelity suggests having your yearly income saved at 30 , three times your income at 40 , seven times your income at 55 , and 10 times your income at 67 . it uses your salary as a metric in order to `` simplify your planning , and help you determine if you are on track throughout your working life '' . ",
        "morgan stanley , too , subscribes to this rule of thumb , suggesting three times your salary at 40 , six times at 50 , eight times at 60 , and 10 times by 67 . the best advice for saving as much as you canthere 's one question i hear as a personal finance writer more than any other . it is n't how to game the stock market , or become a billionaire - it 's simply how to make a budget work while still saving enough to retire comfortably . read morefor many people , those numbers just are n't feasible . ",
        "many people in their 30s , 40s and even 50s have no retirement savings . fidelity acknowledges that they 're more guideposts than hard-and-fast rules . perhaps a better way to think about retirement savings is n't in terms of your current salary , but rather what your expenses are and will be : do you want to maintain your current lifestyle ? downsize ? will you work at all ? how much will your superannuation payout be ? it 's a lot to consider . another option is to aim to put away 12 to 15 per cent of your salary each year , as vanguard advises , or to use this slightly more complex formula from morgan stanley . ",
        "no blueprint is right for everyone , but they all get at the same thing : at least have a frame of reference for how much money you 'd like to have , and work toward it . personally , i keep these figures in the back of my mind , but recognise that i likely wo n't hit all of them . what about you ? do you follow any of these , or have you made up your own ? watch more : tech & finance news .
