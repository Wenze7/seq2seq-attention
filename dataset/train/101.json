        "in our next edition of the denver broncos fanzone , i interview broncos fan britt cormack and get her takes on the broncos season . the denver broncos travel to washington to take on their final nfc opponent of the season , the redskins . this will be a good opportunity to see kirk cousins in a game and see if he could be the quarterback of the future for the denver broncos . this season could not have gone any worse for the broncos . but they get these final two games to showcase some optimism , if any , for the 2018 season . ",
        "there is no doubt this team will look different next season . but there is still some positive vibes going around broncos country despite the season . the next guest on the fanzone has been nothing but positive from our discussions this week . britt cormack is a denver broncos fan . she has been very positive about the entire season , despite what we have seen . it only gets better from here , right ? let 's take a look and see what britt had to say this week in regards to the broncos and on sunday 's game . ",
        "the denver broncos won their second game in a row . what impressed you the most from that game ? i am so impressed that this team is actually so bad , they do n't even know when they are supposed to lose ! * laughs * kidding . actually , booker 's hurdle and run to the end zone were great , sucks that it did n't count . but that 's sort of how everyone feels about the nfl right now , right ? i just love seeing my team play with heart and a fun play like that , we need more of that enthusiasm . ",
        "brock osweiler came into the game and got the win . with trevor siemian going on ir , do you think osweiler gives us a chance to win our final two games if he starts both ? i have feelings about brock . we keep forgetting that we would n't have gotten to super bowl 50 without him , you know ? he 's not that bad - we just like to have a complaint . i thought he looked great against the colts - throwing darts . does that mean we win the next two games ? consistency is not something we can expect from brock , we know that . ",
        "but we ca n't expect it from the team as a whole . all year we toss around this quarterback conundrum , but it is the whole team . everyone has to want it and they have to play as a team like they want it . as a denver broncos fan , what is your favorite memory of all time ? chargers game on january 3rd , 2016 - i went to the game sick as hell . throwing up at the tailgate and in the stadium and everyone kept saying i should go home . * laughs * but i knew manning was going to come back . ",
        "i just knew it and i was n't going to leave . sure enough , i went to concessions to get a sprite and heard this enormous roar . the stadium shook , manning was back ! the electricity of that time , that game , that team . i ended up getting my burst appendix removed that night . but man , so worth it . the broncos take on the washington redskins on christmas eve . what do you think the team needs to do in order to get another win ? what do they need to win ? ",
        "a christmas miracle ! * laughs * that 's tough . on the road , it comes back to consistency you know ? i do n't know if we have another road win in us this year . i want to believe and maybe this new burst of energy carries us . but regardless , it 's going to be fun to see cousins playing against the broncos with all the speculation that he might play with us next year ! which player on the broncos roster has impressed you the most ? i am continually impressed by von and the defense in general . ",
        "they really have carried so much weight this year and miller keeps showing up . booker more recently - like i mentioned before , he really does seem to hit the field and play with heart and i love it . that 's a hard attitude to maintain once you 're on the dark side of our current record and we do have players who are unwilling to give up . for that matter - i am impressed with the true fan base as well . can your fan base count as a team player ? hell yeah it can !
