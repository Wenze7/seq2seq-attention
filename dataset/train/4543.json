        "the chicago blackhawks made a trio of moves monday morning after winning sunday against edmonton , calling up tomas jurco , demoting john hayden and placing cody franson on waiversthe chicago blackhawks have made few moves this season that were n't injury-forced . in fact , it 's hard to say they 've made any that did n't come just after someone got hurt , with vinnie hinostroza 's call-up being the possible exception . but the blackhawks flipped the script monday , less than 24 hours after defeating the edmonton oilers . they called up tomas jurco , demoted john hayden to the rockford icehogs and placed cody franson on waivers . ",
        "the first two of those moves are surprising , to say the least . you would n't think the blackhawks would demote someone from their fourth line , as coach joel quenneville seems to like what he 's getting from that unit . it 's never been about scoring for hayden , lance bouma and tommy wingels -- it 's been about creating energy . but the blackhawks appear to want more offensive production in their lineup , and to that end they decided jurco was the better option . meanwhile , franson was being butted out on defense after the emergence of jordan oesterle . ",
        "it 's not terribly surprising franson is on waivers . should he clear , he can join the rockford icehogs , but there 's a chance another team will bite on the veteran blueliner . where does jurco fit in ? jurco was acquired from the detroit red wings last season as an attempt by blackhawks general manager stan bowman to add some complementary scoring punch . that effort failed , with jurco scoring just one point in 13 regular-season games and not being involved in the blackhawks ' playoff sweep at the hands of nashville . however , jurco has torn it up in the ahl , creating 25 points in 36 games for the hogs -- in addition to 38 penalty minutes . ",
        "so the blackhawks seem hopeful jurco has found some confidence that can translate over to the nhl , like hinostroza did . the big question is , where does jurco fit in this lineup ? if you want more scoring punch , that 's fine . but logically , jurco only fits in on the fourth line . and that line , as was said , has n't been asked to score . wingels has occasionally , while bouma really has n't . maybe adding jurco to that line creates something offensively ? patrick sharp seems a little rejuvenated playing alongside david kampf , with alex debrincat also on that line , so i would n't mess with that right now . ",
        "it basically means you 're shoehorning jurco onto a non-scoring line after bringing him up with the purpose of giving the blackhawks more offense . next : blackhawks ' defense , goaltending midseason gradesit seems a little odd to me . and maybe that 's why some on social media are suggesting a trade could be in the works . i guess we 'll wait and see . more from blackhawk up chicago blackhawks 2017-18 defense , goaltending midseason grades2h ago chicago blackhawks morning links-oil change5h ago 5 chicago blackhawks thoughts from 4-1 win over edmonton oilers18h ago chicago blackhawks host edmonton oilers tv listings , predictions , and more23h ago chicago blackhawks ' 2017-18 midterm grades for forward corps1 d ago the chicago blackhawks made a trio of moves monday morning after winning sunday against edmonton , calling up tomas jurco , demoting john hayden and placing cody franson on waivers the chicago blackhawks have made few moves this season that were n't injury-forced .
