        "the duke blue devils got back on track in acc play as they won their conference home opener 100-93 over the florida state seminoles . it was yet another comeback win for the blue devils and another display of how duke has the best front court in college basketball . florida state never went away today . maybe it was because duke was at home but it was one of those games where if you were n't looking at the scoreboard for a majority of the game , you would have thought that duke was up by a wide margin . ",
        "florida state seemingly made everything from outside the arc , going 15-32 from deep . they were led by phil cofer who led the seminoles with 28 points but did n't score for the final 15:54 of the game . braian angola chipped in 23 as well for the seminoles . for as bad as the blue devils shot from outside , 8-30 , they made up for it in the paint . they out rebounded florida state 53-35 and scored 56 points in the paint . marvin bagley dominated with 32 points and 21 boards . wendell carter added 14 points and 16 boards while combing with bagley to grab 18 offensive rebounds . ",
        "grayson allen added 22 points but only shot 3-10 from long range . this florida state team was pesky . they killed duke from downtown and that was what kept them in the game . early in the second half , it looked like they were going to pull away but duke went on a 14-0 run which included a bagley four point play and me jumping an unofficial two feet in the air following it . the seminoles had zero answer for dukes bigs . bagley and carter were having their way , grabbing seemingly every rebound in their vicinity and getting to the line a combined 17 times . ",
        "they only shot a combined 7-17 but still , the only answer florida state had was to foul the big fellas . takeaways : - trae young is deservedly getting praise as the most exciting freshman in college basketball but marvin bagley is the best basketball player in the nation . the guy is like a magnet . rebounds just end up in his hands at alarming rates and he knows what to do when he gets them . -- wendell carter is such a fundamentally sound big man as a freshman . i have yet to see him grab a rebound without two hands , which is a huge reason as to why he 's such a prolific rebounder . ",
        "he also has great footwork and feel in the post not only on offense but on defense as well . he also showed some major stones when he drew a charge with four fouls late in the second half . - grayson allen is exactly the leader this team needs . when things start getting hectic he provides a calming factor to the whole team . i 've still yet to see him miss the pump fake , dribble and take a three play . - trevon duval needs less minutes . while he 's been a good slasher for duke this season , his lack of an outside shot is a killer when duke shoots like they did today . ",
        "he got into foul trouble early and he makes some bone headed decisions that i 'm still trying to wrap my head around . give goldwire for minutes . - duke needs more production from the bench . they only had three points from the reserves on an alex o'connell three . by comparison , florida state had 24 bench points . the blue devils do n't have bad bench guys either . moving forward , i 'd like to see more production from them . more from ball durham duke mbb : looking back on 2017 and forward to 20181 d ago acc basketball power rankings2d ago duke football : quick lane bowl predictions1 w ago blue devils blow out evansville , 104-401 w ago former blue devil retires from professional basketball1 w ago the duke blue devils got back on track in acc play as they won their conference home opener 100-93 over the florida state seminoles .
