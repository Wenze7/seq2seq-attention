        "in its second weekend , star wars : the last jedi faced off against five new releases , plus two movies expanding around the country . unsurprisingly , the force vanquished them all . in fact , the estimated $ 102 million second weekend for star wars : episode viii earned more than all five of the new releases combined . box-office estimates are soft this weekend because christmas eve falls on a sunday and it 's hard to predict sunday grosses , but it appears that the last jedi will earn a little more $ 100 million over the four-day frame , bringing its 11-day total to a whopping $ 400 million . ",
        "that 's about 30 percent behind the force awakens but 25 percent ahead of rogue one . it 's also nearly doubled that haul internationally so far , so look for the last jedi to cross the $ 1 billion mark worldwide by the new year . the $ 102 million weekend is good enough that a movie that finishes a distant second can still be considered a big success . that 's the case for jumanji : welcome to the jungle , which earned $ 45 million over the four-day holiday frame and $ 60 million since its wednesday release . ",
        "given the huge holiday multipliers -- and the fact that every day between now and new year 's plays like a typical saturday -- that is a resounding success for the sequel , especially for one that comes 23 years after the original . solid reviews and good word of mouth should easily make the film profitable on a $ 100 million budget . pitch perfect 3 , likewise , looks solid , scoring $ 35 million over the four-day weekend . it 's not as beloved by critics as the first two , but an a - on cinemascore should boost the final chapter in the franchise to $ 100 million before all is said and done . ",
        "fourth place goes to another new entry , hugh jackman 's enormously joyous the greatest showman , which is not collecting the ticket sales it had hoped . it earned $ 12 million over the four-day frame and $ 16 million since its release on wednesday . critics are not loving the way the film papers over p. t. barnum 's problematic past , but audiences are digging it , giving it an ` a ' on cinemascore .
