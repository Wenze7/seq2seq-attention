        "do n't hold your breath waiting for twitter to ban president trump . the company explained in a friday blog post why it wo n't be blocking the commander-in-chief from its platform , without mentioning trump by name . `` blocking a world leader from twitter or removing their controversial tweets , would hide important information people should be able to see and debate , '' said twitter . `` it would also not silence that leader , but it would certainly hamper necessary discussion around their words and actions . '' trump detractors were increasingly calling for the social platform to block the president earlier this week , after he called out north korean `` supreme leader '' kim jong-un for bragging he had a nuclear button on his desk . ",
        "trump warned he , too , has a nuclear button , but `` it is a much bigger and more powerful one than his , and my button works ! '' north korean leader kim jong un just stated that the `` nuclear button is on his desk at all times . '' will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that i too have a nuclear button , but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his , and my button works ! trump 's grilling was kosher , according to twitter , because `` elected world leaders play a critical role '' in shaping conversation . ",
        "`` we review tweets by leaders within the political context that defines them , and enforce our rules accordingly , '' added twitter . `` no one person 's account drives twitter 's growth , or influences these decisions . we work hard to remain unbiased with the public interest in mind . '' with that in mind , trump has free reign to continue pillaging his enemies via tweet , with `` sloppy '' steve bannon still in his crosshairs on friday .   "
