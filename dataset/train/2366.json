        "after nearly 10 years since i 've traveled abroad for the first time i find myself today heading to my 26th country , and i find very curious how one can become resilient and smart towards the whole process , from arriving at the airport to finally boarding a flight . resilient because it 's just amazing how you stop minding the wait , which sometimes takes up to a whole day . it 's really okay to sleep in a chair , and when you 've done that time and again you start looking for good spots to do so , you 've marveled the art of finding them . ",
        "when your body hurts you just have to take the floor and use your bag as a pillow -- because you 're really not the kind who spends money on neck pillows , they 're worth at least a couple of days of good food abroad . when you have to work at the wait , you excel at being focused and you do n't even hear the noise or stare at the movement by accident -- when you do so it is consciously just to see the magic in it : people coming and going , sometimes with patience , sometimes with hurry ; people saying goodbye to their people , and people coming home ; the tears of sadness and/or joy ; the `` saudade '' being built or completely wracked apart by the warmest of hugs . ",
        "even though you 've seen it so many times before , the resilience also helps you to always see the beauty in it . but then , just for some time , as you still have deadlines to follow and jobs to deliver . something you do invest on though , is good technology : devices with long battery life , that wo n't leave you hanging , a kindle for the long wait that saves you loads of money on airport books and magazines , a 3g that works well in case there 's no wifi . it definitely helps you have more patience and spend time . ",
        "you are also very careful with your check-in , doing it long in advance mostly to take the best shot at getting a window seat . today i in fact got it for both my flights and that alone made me happy to close my check-in so early on . later , when i went to the line to drop my luggage , it made me even happier as there were around 200 people on the check-in line versus 2 on the online check-in/baggage drop-off line . that above is an example of the first thing that makes you smart . ",
        "as the airline attendant gives you the boarding passes , you think it 's such a waste of paper cause you already have them in your phone . then , when you reach the boarding line , you also cross at least 50 more people -- by just checking how many rows there are in total , and taking the emptiest one . by already taking off your laptop before you even reach the security check . by using the chip on your passport to check yourself digitally at the passport control counter . so many small -- but smart -- hacks that save you time and wait . ",
        "as you proceed to the gate , probably much sooner than needed because airport experts are not the kind that miss flights , you laugh hard at the prices of sweets and alcohol at the free shop , and harder at the people paying for them . you pass by those very expensive brands , see clothes worth the price of your whole trip , and find yourself being grateful to spend money not on things , but on experiences . you find a good chair near charging spots , just in case . you eat some snacks you brought from home , cause the thing you hate the most about airports is how much the food costs . ",
        "you fill yourself with gratitude thinking about what you 're about to live ahead . the people you 'll meet . the conversations you 'll have . the new place that will steal a bit of your heart , your new home for the time being . you think about what forrest says , that maybe destiny and nothingness coexist , and you 're about to write your own from scratch . the feeling fills your heart not with expectations , but hope -- and hope ... oh , for what 's coming , hope is all you need .
