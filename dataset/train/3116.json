        "the boston celtics can put their awful stretch behind them with a special christmas day performancethe boston celtics have finally reached the end of the most taxing stretch of the season . there has been no practice time , far too many back to backs and even multiple stints of three games in four night . the celtics went a stretch of playing eight games in 12 days , and they were not able to overcome their problems on a consistent basis . the celtics were rotating wins and loses , and were not able to instill any real confidence in any of their wins . ",
        "that was until they got their revenge on the chicago bulls . a few weeks ago it would have meant much less to beat that bulls team , but the celtics ran into one of the hottest teams in the league , and handled them the way they were supposed to . the celtics finally looked like the team that went on that crazy streak to start the season , but this bad stretch is still far from behind them . the celtics are going to have their toughest matchup in a while against the washington wizards , and even if the celtics have different faces , i get the feeling the wizards players are not going to care who is actually suiting up . ",
        "this could be the next rendition of a serious rivalry in the east , and it is the exact opportunity the celtics need to get their season back on track . all eyes will be on them , they are bringing momentum from the bulls win , and this can finally set them up to get back to practice and build on that top seed in the eastern conference . more from hardwood houdini balanced attack vs. bulls is something celtics should look to continue1 h ago boston celtics need a big win against bulls2d ago the gordon hayward injury takes it 's toll2d ago boston celtics depending too much on kyrie irving ? ",
        "2d ago boston celtics can not take talent for granted3d ago with brad stevens , the celtics will probably look at this as just another game , because that is what it is . there are no season determinations simply because it is on christmas , but this is the opportunity they need to shut down the doubters again . everyone has been questioning the legitimacy of the celtics this year , and there have been good reasons for that . those doubters will never fully disappear , but nobody will be saying anything if the celtics come out with their best on christmas day . ",
        "there are still issues with marcus morris , but the celtics are as healthy as they can expect to be at this point . they still have not been able to fully recover from the brutal stretch , but they had a night off , and they know they will have plenty of rest for the remainder of the season after this one game . the celtics can make their first great statement of the season since their great streak ended , and there is no better setting to do that in td garden on christmas . on top of everything , this is the first ever christmas day game being played on the greatest home court in the nba . ",
        "the celtics know a win is a win here , but nobody wants them going back to the inconsistent struggles that defined this stretch . the celtics want to come out functioning well on both ends , and using the same kind of balance that allowed them to bring the bulls down to earth . the wizards may not be a powerhouse in the league , but they always show up against the celtics , and just a decent game is not going to be enough against them . the celtics know this is their game to win , and they would be able to make up for a lot of disappointment by giving the home crowd a win on christmas . ",
        "the wizards have two players in bradley beal and john wall that will always be a problem . they have the individual defenders to be confident in the matchups with marcus smart and jaylen brown , but they can easily destroy this game . if the celtics come out and play like they have over the last couple of weeks , people will still have to wonder about this team 's ability to bounce back . that first win against the bulls is a great start , but they have to put in a lot more work to make up for how bad they have been . ",
        "the cavaliers and raptors are right behind them in the standings , and they have room to make up having played far fewer games . it may be a stretch to say this is the most important game of the season to this point , but if the celtics come out and show some of their real potential on christmas day , it could set them up for another great run after they get that chance to settle and get back on the practice court . the boston celtics have finally reached the end of the most taxing stretch of the season .
