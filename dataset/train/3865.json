        "boston -- eight months after ex-nfl star aaron hernandez hanged himself in prison , a new book by bestselling author james patterson is reviving unanswered questions . patterson spoke with the associated press on friday about what he calls `` the most fascinating , complicated and troubling crime story of our times . `` hernandez , a former standout tight end for the new england patriots , was found hanging by a bedsheet in his cell on april 19 , hours before his ex-teammates were due to visit the white house to celebrate their super bowl victory . the 27-year-old athlete had been serving life without parole for a 2013 murder . ",
        "just days earlier , he had been acquitted of a separate double murder . after his death , hernandez was diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy , a degenerative brain disease tied to head blows which can cause depression and violent mood swings . patterson 's book on the case , `` all-american murder , '' is set to be released monday by little , brown and company . ___ ap : most of your work tends to be fiction . what drew you to this real-crime story ? patterson : i do n't usually do nonfiction , but i was compelled to do this story . ",
        "you ca n't take your eyes off this guy because of all his gifts : his good looks , the smile , the beautiful fiancee , the baby girl , the $ 40 million nfl contract . when i was in my teens , my family moved up near boston , and i became a fan of the patriots and the other boston teams . i still am to some extent . ___ ap : why do you think hernandez killed himself if there was a chance -- however small -- of overturning his conviction and winning his freedom ? ",
        "patterson : most people who suffer from brain damage do not become murderers . my take is if you take somebody with a psychopathic personality -- somebody who enjoyed killing people -- hit him in the head a few thousand times and add some pcp and weed , you have a nightmare . and there are a lot of suicides with cte . ___ ap : what do you make of the rumors that hernandez may have been gay or bisexual and had a prison lover ? patterson : we never talked to anybody who said there was something to that . ",
        "he was in his cell 22 1/2 hours a day . he had virtually no contact with any prisoners . what could he do ? ___ ap : did hernandez have some kind of jailhouse conversion ? he wrote `` john 3:16 '' in ink on his forehead and in blood on a cell wall . patterson : he was clinging to this notion , real or imagined , that if he believed in jesus he could be saved . but he was over the top with everything . his thinking was scrambled big-time . ___ ap : why does this case captivate people so powerfully ? ",
        "patterson : this is the most dramatic and surprising murder mystery in the last 25 years -- including o. j. . the story is just stunning , from his days as a well-behaved kid in high school to his time at the university of florida to the nfl . it 's the most amazing fall from grace imaginable . ___ follow bill kole on twitter at . his work can be found here .
