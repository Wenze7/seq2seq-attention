        "he was left out in the cold this week when ireland head coach omitted him from his six nations squadjohn cooney believes his form for ulster deserves to see him ranked alongside the other irish scrum-halves . munster star conor murray is one of the world 's leading number nines but after that cooney reckons there is little to choose between himself , luke mcgrath and kieran marmion . yet despite having a superb first season at ulster , cooney was left out in the cold this week when ireland head coach omitted him from his six nations squad . ",
        "© inpho/darren kiddmunster hooker rhys marshall says discipline will be key to victory over castreshe admitted : `` i 'm a competitive person and i 've always felt a bit hard done by in general by the rankings at the moment . `` i 'd see myself as good as them so it hurts when other people say these guys are clearly ahead of you or they deserve to be ahead of you . `` on my performances i 've done just as well as them or even better . i 'm a competitive person so it does annoy me . '' ",
        "within weeks of arriving at kingspan stadium to replace ulster legend ruan pienaar , cooney had the fans on side . the ex-connacht pivot has performed at a consistently high level , something he says he 's always done after getting a few knocks during his career . `` if you 're overlooked at earlier ages the only thing you can do is give up or work extra hard . my main goal at the start was to work hard for the team and put everything in and be myself . `` i ran ridiculous distances as it was the only way i could show that everyone knew i was here and that i was part of the team . ",
        "`` i always say that one of the things i 've adapted is my mind-set and positivity and all that kind of stuff makes a big difference . `` i 've come with a good attitude and put myself out of my comfort zone and i think i 've done that . '' if ulster are to beat wasps today and qualify for the european champions cup quarter-finals for the first time in four years , they 'll need another big game from cooney . wasps have nothing to play for after last week 's shock loss at harlequins -- but cooney warns that makes them even more dangerous . ",
        "© inpho/ryan byrneleinster star jack conan will only blame himself if he does n't make ireland team for france showdown `` as harlequins showed last week , and also northampton , they are all playing to show a bit of pride in the competition at the moment . `` with the week off after i think they 're going to put a full strength team out and try and win . `` i think everyone loves these big games and we 've shown it the last few games . `` everyone doubted us last week and thought we could n't win but we kind of enjoy that doubt and people questioning our ability or our heart . ",
        "`` we will do what we have to do to get the win . ''   "
