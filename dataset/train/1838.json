        "eva sajoo is examining canadian identity and the future of a hyphenated nation in her latest research project . italian-canadian , chinese-canadian , irish-canadian and other hyphenated identities are at the heart of a new research project about canadian identity and the future of multiculturalism . eva sajoo , a researcher at simon fraser university , looked at italian identity in vancouver in a survey three years ago and has been asked by the city to expand her project for canada 150 . the first study presented a curious look at what it means to be canadian , she told cbc host of on the coast gloria macarenko . ",
        "`` it was really a fascinating look at how identity changes over time , '' sajoo said . the original study showed marked generational differences when it comes to how immigrants feel about their identity . first generation immigrants , she said , often feel a strong connection to their country of origin , while their children , born in canada , who want to assimilate more . `` the third generation , the grandkids , were way more interested in where their grandparents had come from and in learning to speak italian and learning to cook italian than their parents were , '' sajoo explained . ",
        "`` that 's a story that really a lot of us can relate to even if we are not italian . `` hyphenated nationsajoo 's newest project , called being canadian : the future of a hyphenated nation , goes beyond vancouver 's italian community to look at the wider scope of canadian identity . `` the question really is ` do we have a shared sense of identity that is different than having the same mother tongue or the same cultural background ? '' she said . the results are particularly important given the recent tension toward immigration in places like the united states and europe , sajoo said . ",
        "`` increasing rates of immigration have led to feelings of loss of community and tension around race and anti-immigration protests , '' she said . `` unless we have a sense of maybe shared values or some other thing that crosses our difference , then it 's possible that we may experience some of the same tensions . `` sajoo is gathering data for the project in an online survey . with files from on the coast .
