        "it is n't really christmas without `` a christmas carol . '' since 1843 , when charles dickens published what he called his `` little christmas book , '' it 's never gone out of print -- selling countless copies and spawning thousands of plays , readings , tv shows and movies starring everyone from alastair sim , george c. scott and christopher plummer , to jim carrey , scrooge mcduck and the muppets . this year marks the 150th anniversary of dickens ' reading tour in america , which seems to have renewed interest not only in `` a christmas carol '' itself -- but what prompted him to write it . ",
        "the new film `` the man who invented christmas , '' an exhibition at the morgan library & museum and even a novel all seem to come to the same ironic conclusion : that dickens might never have written his plea for charity if he had n't been desperate to make money . `` he was in debt up to his eyeballs , '' samantha silva , author of the new novel , `` mr. dickens and his carol '' told the post . his last works had flopped : no one cared for `` american notes for general circulation '' , and his latest serialized novel , `` martin chuzzlewit , '' was such a dud , dickens ' publishers docked Â£ 50 from his salary each month . ",
        "meanwhile , his wife , catherine , was expecting their fifth child and they 'd just leased a grand london home , which dickens refurbished . `` he was living well beyond his means , '' noted declan kiely , who curated the `` charles dickens and the spirit of christmas '' show at the morgan . `` nothing would do except marble mantels and paneled mahogany doors . '' the writer also loved to entertain , never stinting on the whisky , rum and brandy . but dickens ' generosity extended far beyond his own needs . `` though he fretted about money , he supported many charities , '' silva noted . ",
        "`` it was said that he rarely passed a beggar on the street without pressing a coin in his hand . '' not only did he have his own debts to pay , but he was responsible for his father 's . it was hardly the first time . decades before , his parents and younger brothers were carted off to debtors ' jail . only 12-year-old charles stayed behind , working in a blacking factory to pay their bills . those long miserable months , silva said , `` made him a passionate advocate of the poor and defenseless . '' ",
        "after he 'd written his way out of poverty , his father and brothers borrowed money in his name . feeling as squeezed as scrooge -- and just as contemptuous of the relatives he called his `` blood-petitioners '' -- dickens decided to pen a quick hit : a christmas book . as he told friends , the tale of scrooge 's journey to redemption took shape during his nightly walks through london . `` it was his custom to walk 15 , maybe 20 miles , '' silva said . `` there 'd be wonderful streets , where people with money lived , and three blocks away squalor . ",
        "he 'd look in people 's windows and see families like the cratchits gathered around a table or hearth . '' dickens recorded everything he saw , smelled and heard on scraps of paper , silva said : `` everything was material to him . '' the names of his characters came , as they often did , from the people he met and the sounds he enjoyed -- like the melding of `` gouge '' and `` screw '' that make up scrooge . silva believes scrooge 's first name came from a group called the ebenezer temperance society : `` dickens could n't abide hypocrites who wanted to save souls but take away what little pleasure they had . '' ",
        "the character itself , kiely says , is based on an earlier creation : gabriel grub , the nasty , child-beating sexton of `` the pickwick papers . '' but there 's a little of dickens ' own , cash-pressed self in there , too , kiely says : `` a philanthropist by nature , he was an immensely imaginative person who could ask himself , ` what if i were the opposite of this ? ' he loved to look into the dark side of london life , and also the dark side of his own nature . '' ",
        "in the original manuscript -- the gem of the morgan 's collection , on display now -- tiny tim was initially called tiny fred . kiely said he was based on henry burnett , the sickly son of dickens ' sister , fanny . the real boy died in childhood , a few years after tiny tim entered the world . working steadily , dickens started writing `` carol '' in mid-october and finished it six weeks later . since deciding to publish it himself , he was determined it be beautiful . `` he wanted gilt on the cover , gilded paper edges and four hand-colored illustrations -- for 6,000 copies , '' kiely said . ",
        "`` and it had to be done in 16 days . '' dickens gave his printer the manuscript on dec. . 3 . by christmas eve , all 6,000 copies had been sold at 5 shillings each , which kiely notes was one-third of bob cratchit 's measly , 15-shilling-a-week salary . though dickens hoped to make a thousand pounds from `` carol , '' his production costs were so high , he netted only a quarter of that . so dire were his finances that the dickens family decamped for a while to italy , where the living was cheaper . ",
        "but `` a christmas carol , '' widely embraced from the start , gradually made money . everyone wanted to hear the tale of scrooge 's change of heart , especially read by the author himself . and so , dickens , whom silva calls `` a frustrated actor , '' started touring . a wood engraving in the dec. . 28 , 1867 , harper 's weekly showed people `` laying out blankets in the snow in front of manhattan 's steinway hall , '' kiely said , waiting to buy a $ 2 ticket . he was , as silva put it , `` a literary rock star . '' ",
        "his books and readings helped dickens provide not only for his family , but the unfortunate around him . `` distressed , '' kiely said , by the number of teenage prostitutes on london 's mean streets , dickens helped set up a halfway house for them , designing a course of study to train them to become governesses and teachers . but even a man with `` a heart as big as the world , '' as silva puts it , was still a man , and a flawed one at that . in what kiely calls `` a classic midlife crisis , '' the 46-year-old dickens had an affair with an 18-year-old actress , nettie turner . ",
        "his wife , who 'd grown fat and dull after bearing 10 children , was kicked out of their home , while dickens enlisted her sister 's help in raising their children . he died at 58 , having delivered , in `` a christmas carol , '' what silva calls `` a sledgehammer blow against the miserly rich . '' in reminding us to honor this season of rebirth and charity -- `` and try to keep it all the year '' -- dickens gave the world a present , not only in years past , but now and in the future . "
