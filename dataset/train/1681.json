        "the steelers made it official . after an incredibly disappointing loss last weekend to the jacksonville jaguars that cost the team a shot at the patriots in the afc championship game , pittsburgh made a few changes to its coaching staff . most notably , the team did not re-sign offensive coordinator todd haley after his contract expired . now , the team has officially promoted his replacement . the steelers announced that qb coach randy fichtner would be taking over the offensive coordinator role while also keeping his spot leading the quarterbacks coach for the time being . fichtner has been with the team since 2010 , and has developed something that todd haley never had with the steelers : a great relationship with qb ben roethlisberger . ",
        "looking to keep things in the family , he was the logical next step to run mike tomlin 's offense . now , fichtner takes over one of the most talented attacks in the league , with high expectations staring him right in the face .   "
