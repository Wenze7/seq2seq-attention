        "`` successful people do n't wish for success , they pursue it . and to pursue it effectively , need a system . '' -- scott adams , how to fail at almost everything and still win bigthis is part two of a four-part series of posts dealing with improving your self-development program .   ",
        "part one focused on identifying your strengths and developmental needs through the following means : 1 -rrb- self-assessments and introspection of your own behaviors and attitudes , both generally and also through retrospective assessments of situations where you have taken the lead on something or acted as part of a group of people ; also included journaling and reviewing the results2 -rrb- 360-degree feedback : soliciting , gathering and analyzing feedback from your peers , supervisors and subordinates and looking for patterns in what they identify as your strengths and developmental needs3 -rrb- formal and informal assessments : i provided lists of several personality assessments that are either free or relatively affordable to individuals : myers-briggs , clifton strengthsfinder , hogan 's developmental survey , and others4 -rrb- how to consolidate these results with humility to identify strengths and developmental needs -- this information will inform the development of the approach for self-development in part two below .",
        "making yourself a standout leader , part two : establishing systems to growplease read and complete the actions from part one : identifying and owning your strengths and developmental needs before continuing to part two . the information gained is essential for becoming a standout leader . with all this information where do we start ? how are we going to turn this into appropriate actions to be a standout performer in whatever you want to do . almost everyone around us is chasing after goals -- annual evaluation goals , performance goals , health goals , etc. . i propose an alternative -- instead of chasing goals , follow the lead of scott adams and instead establish systems . ",
        "scott adams is the cartoonist behind the world-famous dilbert cartoon and the author of how to fail at almost everything and still win big . i was first introduced to his systems-oriented approach through the tim ferriss podcast and tools of titans book . why a systems-oriented approach ? in scott 's own words : `` to put it bluntly , goals are for losers . that 's literally true most of the time . for example , if your goal is to lose ten pounds , you will spend every moment until you reach the goal -- if you reach it at all -- feeling as if you were short of your goal . ",
        "in other words goal-oriented people exist in a state of nearly continuous failure that they hope will be temporary . that feeling wears on you . in time , it becomes heavy and uncomfortable . it might even drive you out of the game . goal-oriented people exist in a state of continuous pre-success failure at best , and permanent failure at worst if things never work out . systems people succeed every time they apply their systems , in the sense that they did what they intended to do . the goals people are fighting the feeling of discouragement at each turn . ",
        "the systems people are feeling good every time they apply their system . that 's a big difference in terms of maintaining your personal energy in the right direction . '' we want to go beyond listing goals and into creating systems which will empower your success in the long term . goals are useful in that they allow you to organize the specific things that you want to attain/achieve . if you set goals and that is it , that is fine . however , if you want to standout -- play the long game and look beyond goals and establish sustainable systems which will enable you to achieve continuous growth in your skills and build relationships that will see you forward towards success . ",
        "your systems should be built around several factors including : your strengths , developmental needsyour interests in what you want to get out of lifethe value that you want to create for yourself , your family , clients or organizationthe inputs from mentors or coachessystem-oriented approaches focus on arranging the actions and environmental factors of your life that will present you with the best opportunities . what you want to keep a target on is creating opportunities to build skills and establish relationships -- skills will grow your capabilities and value , and relationships are crucial for all success because it is through relationships that unheard of opportunities present themselves to you in the future . ",
        "goals play a crucial part in your path towards success as they set key way points and concrete objectives to attain within the frameworks of the systems you create . the video below gives a fantastic overview of this approach . the rest of the post is going to provide you a framework for documenting and planning out your systems for standing out a leaders and people in general . if you want to develop as a new leader how might you do this ? the u. s. army has established a system-oriented framework that can be applied to nearly any aspect of leadership that you want to grow . ",
        "now it 's time to get to work ! an outline for establishing your systemsi like to use a template that i learned from the army . this outline integrates elements of my capability evaluation and three areas for capability expansion : feedback , study , and practice . these three areas are all part of a continuous cycle of positive development . this simple , structured template is a very powerful tool for framing your system . the following methods can be found in fm 6 -- 22 leadership development , chapter 7 : learning and development activitieshere is how it breaks down : capability evaluation section : strengths indicators : those behaviors and actions that contribute to or support successful performance . ",
        "need indicators : those behaviors and actions that reduce or hinder successful performance . underlying causes : are the examples of why an individual may not be excelling at a particular leader behavior . capability expansion section : this section includes three developmental steps : feedback , study and practice . there is a relatively simple equation to review with yourself to assist in determining whether you need to pursue feedback , study , and/or practice : this model is applicable for any development action plan that you want to establish for yourself . i highly recommend you get a copy of fm 6 -- 22 to review the 50 + leadership competencies and actions plans detailed in chapter 7 . ",
        "the book is available through amazon or you may download the pdf or ebook versions from the us army here : fm 6 -- 22 on amazon : : / / armypubs . army . mil/epubs/dr_pubs/dr_a/pdf/web/fm6_22.pdf the reason this approach from the army is systems-oriented vs. goal-oriented is that all of the capability expansion tasks are focused on shaping behaviors in the long-term . none of the examples give specific goals such as `` lead thirteen land navigation training sessions in the next fiscal year '' or `` conduct four quarterly platoon sensing sessions to gauge the sentiments of the soldiers on my ability to create a trusting environment . '' ",
        "this goals are not relevant , they are risky and you do not know for certain whether attaining those numbers of actions will result in success or not . the most important thing to remember about these activities is that they should be steps that you take in order to optimize your life and environment to maximize attaining / developing skills and building relationships . even is individual goals are not met , you will have opportunity to grow through the localized failures . in part three we will dive into how to begin pursuing learning opportunities and taking concrete steps towards putting the system into action .
