        "kent -- if temperatures stay in the area of 42 degrees in kent for three to five days and there 's a bit of rain , officials said the ice jam on the housatonic river should thaw and the flooding threat will be neutralized . on jan. . 13 , several kent residents were evacuated from their homes because of flooding from the housatonic river , a state police troop l dispatcher said . law enforcement closed route 7 between route 341 and bulls bridge road on jan. . 13 and it was reopened on jan. . 18 . the road was reopened later in the week , but the threat of more flooding remained a possibility . ",
        "officials have been in `` constant contact with expert hydrologists and meteorologists from the national weather service regarding the ice jam , '' said state rep. brian ohler , whose district includes kent . ohler said the ideal situation would be for the ice jam to gradually thaw over three to five days . but for that to happen , he said there needs to be an average high temperature of 42 degrees and some minor or moderate rainfall . `` the river water needs to come back up to a level where it can begin breaking up the ice jam and therefore sending it downstream , '' ohler said in an update at 4 p. m. saturday . ",
        "during a meeting on sunday , ohler said officials will review the last three days and layout action plans for monday through wednesday , the days when ohler said there will be the most activity seen on the ice jam . ohler said warmer temperatures and some precipitation would provide the best opportunity for the ice jam to shift form its current foothold and start moving south . though only some kent residents had to be evacuated from flood-prone areas , ohler said it 's still important for the public to avoid the ice jam at all times . `` we must stress and reiterate just how dangerous the ice jam is , '' ohler warned . ",
        "`` the ice jam will become increasing unstable as it begins to break apart into smaller pieces and eventually flow downstream . '' the nws issued a flood warning for the area around 11 a. m. saturday until 1:30 p. m. monday . the warning said river road remains closed with limited access on johnson road . despite the flooding , ohler said the town is still open for business . `` do n't be afraid to come down to the town center , '' ohler said . `` the roads are clear and the shops are ready to welcome you with open doors .
