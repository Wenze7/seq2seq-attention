        "new haven -- during a performance friday at long wharf theatre , eight middle schoolers grappled with the complexity of portraying evil characters who learn to work together and appreciate nature . `` what i learned is , it 's a lot more fun being evil , '' said august hotis , 10 , with a little smile after the presentation of `` the nightmare on evil street . '' he and his friends are students at the connecticut experiential learning center in branford . some home-schooled students also participated . every year celc works with long wharf theatre 's education staff to produce an original play related to the theme of ecology and sustainability . ",
        "the effort is also linked to the theater 's three `` pillars '' of creativity , empathy and teamwork . before parents of the students were seated in an upstairs performance room friday afternoon , celc co-founder and educator melinda alcosser described the school 's mission as `` offering engaging academics combined with real-world learning for 5th to 8th grade students . '' alcosser noted the parents were encouraged to come to the theater with donations of hats , gloves and scarves for children who recently arrived in the new haven area from puerto rico and mexico . both of those areas have been hit by devastating natural disasters . ",
        "shortly before the 30-minute performance began , madelyn newman , the theater 's director of education , said she values the program because it is so collaborative and focuses on the individual needs of students . jared michaud , a yale junior who is a dwight hall urban fellow working part-time at the theater , told the parents it was interesting directing the play because `` we started without a script or any plan of what was going to happen . '' he said this is called `` devised theater . '' michaud said the kids came up with the idea of creating evil characters , all of them students at `` the evil school . '' ",
        "but gradually they discover the importance of teamwork and preserving nature . near the end of the show , a character played by gray storlazzi said : `` i learned that working together as a group is n't the worst idea in the world . '' after the performance , michaud noted the students had decided not to go with the usual story book ending of evil characters becoming wonderful human beings . `` they did n't want to all be nice but they wanted to get across the idea of respecting nature . '' matt goldblum , 10 , another cast member , said , `` it was really fun watching the play come together . '' ",
        "the other performers were : izzy wiltshire , lorenzo dalton , nick straka , emma martinmooney âˆš and addie morrissey . randall . beach@hearstmediact . com .   "
