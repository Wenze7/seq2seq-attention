        "green bay , wis. . -- despite a bleak playoff picture , green bay packers coach mike mccarthy left the door open for quarterback aaron rodgers to play against the minnesota vikings this weekend . `` aaron rodgers is sore , rightfully so , '' mccarthy said monday night , one day after rodgers ' return from a fractured right collarbone was n't enough in the packers ' 31-24 loss to the carolina panthers . `` he was hit too many times , took two big hits . so we 're working through that . so we 'll see what tomorrow brings . '' ",
        "of course , mccarthy made the comments before monday night 's game between the atlanta falcons and tampa bay buccaneers kicked off -- a game that , if the falcons won it , would eliminate the packers from playoff contention and mark the end of the team 's eight-year run of consecutive postseason berths . despite the return of rodgers , who broke his collarbone oct. . 15 at minnesota and missed the next seven games , the packers put themselves on the brink of playoff elimination by losing to the panthers when a late rally fell short . after throwing three interceptions while looking rusty earlier in the game , rodgers threw a 24-yard touchdown pass to tight end richard rodgers with 2:43 left in the game . ",
        "the packers then recovered the onside kick and were in position to force overtime when wide receiver geronimo allison fumbled at the carolina 28-yard line with 1:50 to go . `` i 'm disappointed like every man on the sideline is . it was an opportunity , '' mccarthy said . `` obviously there was extra energy in our locker room with aaron playing . i wish that energy would have been consistent throughout our team for the whole time . that 's a disappointment . '' rodgers worked hard to convince the team 's brain trust and medical staff to allow him to play against the panthers , and he admitted afterward that he did not play well , completing 26 of 45 passes for 290 yards with three touchdowns and three interceptions . ",
        "he also ran six times for 43 yards , although he took harder hits in the pocket than he did when he scrambled . what mccarthy and the medical staff must now weigh is whether rodgers should play if the packers have no postseason to play for . after the game against the panthers , rodgers hinted that he wanted to play saturday against the vikings -- the team that derailed his season -- regardless of the playoff picture , saying , `` i 'm a competitor . until they tell me otherwise , i 'm expecting to play . '' ",
        "mccarthy , meanwhile , railed against veteran panthers linebacker thomas davis ' blindside , helmet-to-helmet block on wide receiver davante adams , who was in the league 's concussion protocol monday but lashed out at davis on twitter earlier in the day . the nfl suspended davis for two games for the hit as a `` repeat offender , '' but mccarthy remained livid that adams was injured on what he called a `` dirty '' hit . `` there 's no place in this game for those types of hits . that 's been made loud and clear , '' mccarthy said . ",
        "`` that hit was totally unnecessary yesterday . as far as any type of rule changes , what they want to add , that 's obviously for future discussion . the player has been suspended , whatever you think about that . but davante was in a position that he should n't have been hit like that , and that was clear . `` i like ron rivera . i 've always respected the play style of his football team . but that hit was a dirty hit .
