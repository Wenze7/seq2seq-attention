        "follow cbsmiami . com : facebook | twitterwashington -- a big change is coming to staffers in the white house that has many expressing their displeasure . the white house is banning the use of personal cell phones within the west wing , citing security concerns , a move that has prompted widespread frustration . `` the security and integrity of the technology systems at the white house is a top priority for the trump administration and therefore , starting next week , the use of all personal devices for both guests and staff will no longer be allowed in the west wing , '' white house press secretary sarah sanders said in a statement thursday morning . ",
        "sanders said staff will continue be able to conduct business on government-issued devices . the ban on personal cell phones does not apply to the president , a person familiar with the decision says . the decision to ban personal cell phones had been under discussion for months , but never executed . it 's an idea chief of staff john kelly floated when he first entered the administration in july , but had not decided to enforce until now . it 's unclear why the policy was announced this week . the standard is expected to apply to everyone , including top officials like hope hicks , one person familiar with the decision tells cnn . ",
        "the policy has drawn the ire of those it will affect , with several staffers questioning how they are expected to stay in touch with their families while working 12-hour days . one source close to the white house said `` no one is happy '' with the decision , adding that no one inside the west wing believes the official explanation that the cell phone ban is for national security reasons . instead , it 's all about limiting leaks to reporters , this source said . another source close to white house said the policy is aimed at stopping leaking from inside the west wing . ",
        "`` it 's not about being secure . it 's about being suspicious , '' the source said . pressed thursday , sanders insisted again that the ban is `` about the security and integrity about the technology over here at the white house , '' and not about leaks from inside the white house . sanders said the decision to ban staffers from using personal cell phones in the west wing has been in the works for the past six months . during that period , sanders said the white house has looked for ways to increase white house officials ' ability to use `` other applications '' on their phones and to ensure compliance with the presidential records act . ",
        "in the early months of the trump administration , former white house press secretary sean spicer reviewed his aides ' personal and government-issued cell phones in an effort to ensure they were n't privately communicating with reporters amid a series of information leaks . he also informed staff that the use of encrypted messaging apps , like signal and confide , was a violation of the federal records act . though sanders said the phone ban will begin `` starting next week , '' there has not yet been internal guidance on the policy , and it 's still unclear when it will take effect . ",
        "some staffers are also still wondering whether there will be any exemptions and what the consequences would be for violating the personal cell phone ban .   "
