        "learn how to pre-qualify prospects with a pre-call survey ! have you wasted time on a prospect who turned out to be a terrible fit ? fix that common problem by asking clients to complete a sales pre-qualification survey before you get on the phone . this helps you focus on the right people -- and do `` fast failure '' with those who are n't . what kind of results might you see ? i recently helped a client overhaul their agency 's sales process . in the first two weeks , they shortened their initial calls by 33 % , while boosting their salesperson 's close rate on paid discovery . ",
        "let 's look at the questions i ask , how to customize this for your agency , and answers to common questions i hear from agency owners about doing sales pre-qualification surveys . the 7 questions i aski call my survey a pre-intake questionnaire . with an eye toward digital agency coaching and consulting , here 's what i ask : 1 . what 's your contact info , so i can match your answers to you ? 2 . why did you start your agency ? how has that matched up to reality ? 3 . do you lean toward running a lifestyle agency or a high-growth agency ? ",
        "if you 're not sure , check out my article on the topic . 4 . if you could wave a magic wand , what would be different 1 year from now ? what about 5 years from now ? 5 . what metrics would you use to track our success in working together ? 6 . if you 've worked with a business consultant , what did you like and not like about that relationship ? 7 . do you have any questions you want to be sure i answer during our call ? all of those are `` required '' questions , except # 6 and # 7 . ",
        "i 've considered splitting # 4 into separate questions , but keeping the combo gives me a window into the respondent 's thought process . be sure to customize the list to your agency 's situation . see below for my advice on how to handle the dreaded budget question . how to introduce your sales pre-qualification surveyonce someone reaches out via email or a contact form , i 'll reply like this : subject : helping you & hi , thanks for reaching out ! from what you described , it sounds like we 're a fit -- . ",
        "as a next step , let 's do an exploratory call to confirm . please take 15 minutes beforehand to complete my pre-intake questionnaire , to help you maximize the call . based on your responses , my colleague will follow up to schedule our call -- or if things are n't a fit , i 'll point you to alternatives . thanks ! karlas you can see , i frame the pre-qualification survey as part of a process . i also demonstrate how they benefit from doing the survey . should you ask about their budget ? yes -- but do n't be obnoxious . ",
        "instead of fishing with `` what 's your budget ? , '' give them an idea of what to expect . for instance , are you a $ 5,000 agency , a $ 50,000 agency , or a $ 500,000 agency ? to position yourself as a strategic agency , make a soft ask . cite your minimum level of engagement , and ask if they 've created a budget yet . for instance : `` have you created a budget yet for this work ? as a heads up , our clients typically invest a minimum of $ 40,000 a year . ",
        "our initial audit is $ 2,500 , and we can recommend your phase 2 budget after that . '' pro tip : if they have n't created a budget yet , do not do a sales call -- and definitely do n't create a proposal . when someone 's at the very beginning of their selection process , share your minimum level of engagement and share a wide budget range : `` solving that kind of problem tends to run $ 30,000 to $ 150,000 . i 'm glad to discuss further once you 've confirmed your budget internally . '' ",
        "if you really want to insist on knowing numbers up front , you should have a drop-down with budget ranges -- but i recommend making the question optional . note : i do n't ask about budget in my survey because most people do n't have an explicit budget for coaching or business consulting . in contrast , your clients should be budgeting for your help , so ask away . send the survey before or after scheduling the sales call ? if you have a high volume of prospects , consider asking people to complete the survey before scheduling them . ",
        "that way , you can turn-away people who are a poor fit , instead of taking up space on your schedule with a call that you 'd ultimately pre-exclude . if you find people in your target industry vertical are reluctant to do the survey , consider sending the survey after scheduling the call . you might also consider shortening the survey to fewer `` core '' questions . be sure the survey 's mobile-friendly , especially if your clients tend to be on the run . if someone 's initial email suggests they 're a strong fit , i 'll do things simultaneously -- schedule the call while asking them to complete the survey . ",
        "is there ever a time to skip a pre-qualification survey ? should you ever skip the sales pre-qualification survey ? probably not , but it depends on the strength of your sales pipeline . if your pipeline is weak -- and you 're willing to make compromises because you need cash -- you might skip the survey to reduce `` friction '' in the sales process . what if someone is referred to you by a current client or a referral partner ? use the pre-qualification survey with them , too -- not every referral is a fit . the key is that you frame it as part of your process -- most prospective clients like seeing that your agency has a process . ",
        "if your prospects tend to call first , your business development representative would ask pre-qualification questions by phone . what if they do n't fill out the survey ? worried someone wo n't fill it out before the call ? in my experience , that 's extremely rare -- it 's happened just twice in my several years of using the survey . in one case , she 'd missed the reminder about the survey . in the other , one of the three partners had started filling it out before he got distracted . if someone does n't fill it out because they think it 's a waste of time , that 's a good thing -- they 've just proven to you that they do n't value you and your process . ",
        "congrats -- you achieved `` fast failure '' by not wasting time on a poor-fit prospect ! do n't do calls with prospects who skip your pre-qualification survey -- if they are n't willing to spend 10-15 minutes on the survey to share about their business , why should you spend 30 or 45 or 60 minutes on the phone with them ? applying this at your agencyready to create and use a sales pre-qualification survey at your agency ? great ! using my survey as a model , make a list of questions that will help you vet people before the call . ",
        "you 'll need to find the right balance on how deep to probe , versus saving key followup questions for the exploratory call . consider linking the form directly to your marketing automation crm , to save you a step later . remember , this is about fast failure -- spend time on the sales prospects who want and need your agency 's help . but do n't let efficiency take over -- under the warmth & competence model , frame the survey as warmth for them , not competence for you . question : thinking about your agency 's most recent sales prospect , what do you wish you 'd asked before getting on the phone ?
