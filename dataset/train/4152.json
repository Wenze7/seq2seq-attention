        "jan 06 -- preston boss alex neil was impressed with the quality of his side 's goals after they put wycombe to the sword with a 5-1 thrashing in the third round of the fatwo divisions separate the two clubs and the gulf in class showed at adams park as the lilywhites , in good form in the championship , controlled proceedings from start to finish . neil said : `` whenever you come away to any lower-league opposition , the first thing you 're going to have to do is match them for effort , endeavour , willingness to win and willingness to work . ",
        "`` we did all that and what we 've got is some real quality players within our group and i thought that shone and came through . `` i thought the standard of some of the goals was excellent . `` josh harrop puts the ball into the top corner in one minute , alan browne hits a screamer from the edge of the box for the second and i thought the fifth goal was a fantastic move down the left side . `` it was a fantastic cross from greg and josh , who we 'd just put up front , managed to get himself of the end of it . ",
        "`` the only disappointment in the game , really , is that calum woods has hurt his hamstring and we 're devastated for him . `` preston led inside two minutes when harrop bent a brilliant free-kick into the top corner and browne produced an equally spectacular strike with a superb half-volley . daryl horgan 's own goal from luke o'nien 's cross gave wycombe a lifeline right on half-time , but the winger made amends by forcing will de havilland to score into his own net . browne then smashed in his second from the penalty spot before harrop completed the rout with a good header from cunningham 's cross . ",
        "wycombe manager gareth ainsworth said : `` the upset went out of the window in the first minute and we were outdone by a much better team today . `` fair play to alex neil , he 's got his team working really well . `` it 's the best preston team i 've seen for a long , long time and i think they 've got a real chance this year of making the play-offs . `` i think it shows the gulf in class between the leagues - we 're playing one of the form teams of the championship and it really did tell . ",
        "`` they were excellent today and we were beaten by the better team . `` we had one or two moments , but nothing like what we do to teams in league two . `` i was disappointed that we dropped off a lot and let people turn and get at us and their front three caused us all sorts of problems . `` but preston have played fantastic today and deserved their win . ''   "
