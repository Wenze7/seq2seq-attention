",
        "the subsequent search uncovered this little bundle of death . whilst we are awaiting ballistic results , we believe this is a machine pistol style weapon , which would be capable of fully automatic fire . stolen car collides with two police vehicles injuring officers `` a truly terrifying prospect to be on our streets . `` an investigation is now underway to determine what it is , where it 's come from , what it 's been involved in , and of course - who may now be missing it . '' police are appealing for any information related to the find . ",
        "they said : `` we believe the car had been there for several days . someone somewhere will have seen something . it would be na√Øve to expect everyone to want to openly and happily talk to us , so there are several ways you can go about it . our enquiry office is open 11am-7pm monday to friday . the 101 line is open 24/7 . you can even private message the page . alternatively you can speak to crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 . `` make no mistake - the people behind such a weapon , whoever they are and whatever they want it for , may well have access to other weapons . ",
        "`` we 've seen on our streets in recent months and years the carnage such weapons can cause , so getting them , and those behind the triggers , off the street has got to be a priority for all ! `` these people do n't care about your kids , your homes or your neighbours . the condition they kept this weapon in shows how little regard they have for everyone around them . keeping such a deadly weapon in a residential area is testament to that .
