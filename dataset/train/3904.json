        "prime minister justin trudeau sat down with u. s. corporate and financial leaders wednesday for a private roundtable at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland , to discuss the importance of the north american free trade agreement and its potential modernization . `` we just had a great conversation about all the jobs in canada and the u. s. that rely on nafta , '' trudeau said to reporters after the meeting . `` we talked a lot about ensuring that citizens , and workers and families on both sides of the border understand that the integrated supply chains , the trade back and forth between canada and the u. s. and mexico , has been tremendously beneficial and we 're going to keep working on that . ",
        "`` the canada-u . s. roundtable was chaired by dominic barton , global managing partner of consulting firm mckinsey and company . barton also chairs finance minister bill morneau 's advisory council on economic growth . `` the issue is the uncertainty and how it 's going back and forth and people do n't know what are threats and what is real . it 's the uncertainty ... that makes people nervous investing . so the faster we can get this done the better , '' said barton after the roundtable . `` it was about the importance of and that we have to have voices coming , not just from canada , but also from the u. s. nafta is important for u. s. businesses . ",
        "it 's important that we understand that . `` trudeau was joined by status of women minister maryam monsef . the u. s. members of the roundtable were : - andrew liveris , chairman and ceo of dow chemical . - david abney , chairman and ceo of ups . - david maclennan , chairman and ceo of cargill . - don rosenberg , executive vice-president and general counsel at qualomm inc. - paul jacob , executive chairman at qualcomm inc. - john furner , ceo of sam 's club . - larry fink , chairman and ceo of blackrock . ",
        "- tom farley , chairman and ceo of the new york stock exchange . - tom hayes , president and ceo of tyson foods . abney said that while nafta needs to be modernized , there 's no question it has been good for jobs . `` every 22 packages that either enters the u. s. or leaves the u. s. creates a ups job , '' he said . `` we believe there 's a win-win-win solution and we 're working with the governments in all three countries to make sure that we express our opinions . '' ` i am not donald trump ` as barton said , uncertainty over the future of nafta and , therefore , over canada 's preferred access to the u. s. market , makes trudeau 's davos pitch for more business investment challenging . ",
        "john manley , a former liberal cabinet minister and now ceo of the business council of canada , said trudeau simply needs to reassure businesses that canada is committed to nafta . `` and he will probably make the case that when cooler heads prevail , nafta may be changed , but it will continue and businesses can expect to continue to benefit from the easier access to the united states ' market , '' said manley , who is also attending davos . while the focus for canada is wooing business investment , strategic political meetings are taking place as well , of course . ",
        "for example , morneau is expected to meet wednesday with his u. s. counterpart , steve mnuchin , who is also a friend . being part of a new trans-pacific partnership trade deal , announced tuesday , comes at a good time for trudeau in his pitch to investors , said manley , because it shows canada favours liberalized trade with the fastest growing economic region in the world . `` it shows we favour a system of rules for trade with asia that are not , frankly , dictated by china . and by saying canada is part of tpp -- without saying so -- the prime minister is saying ` i am not donald trump ' and i think that is a good thing , '' manley said . ",
        "` canada is a place to be'ulrich spiesshofer , ceo of abb group , a power and automation technology company headquartered in switzerland , does n't see the uncertainty over nafta as a deterrent to investing in canada . `` abb has made a choice , a long time ago , to be active in canada , '' said spiesshofer , adding that just last year abb opened a new campus in montreal employing more than 700 people . `` we think canada is a place to be , '' he said , pointing to canada 's education system that means his company can attract good , talented people . ",
        "spiesshofer is also not overly concerned about the recent massive tax cut in the u. s. , which greatly diminishes canada 's competitive edge on corporate taxes . `` it does n't mean that canada is not attractive . all together it 's an important market and we 're happy to serve it , '' he said . trudeau attributes abb 's recent montreal expansion to meetings he had with the company two years ago when he was first in davos . he also credits his january 2016 davos meeting with thompson-reuters decision to open a new technology centre in toronto in the fall of that year . ",
        "in other words , trudeau is making the case that coming to davos is worth it , and he can successfully sell canada . but it 's not always a slam dunk . in 2016 , trudeau and his ministers met with the head of general motors in a bid to ensure its oshawa plant continue . it remains open , but this past december gm announced it is scaling back production of the plant and cutting worker shifts .
