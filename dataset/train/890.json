        "madrid - catalonia 's ex-leader carles puigdemont , currently exiled in brussels after a failed independence bid , faces arrest if he returns home despite having parliamentary immunity , spanish prosecutors said saturday . puigdemont , who fled to belgium in late october after madrid sacked his cabinet over their breakaway attempt , is eyeing a return to power after scoring big in regional elections in december . but back at home , he risks being detained on charges of rebellion , sedition and misuse of public funds . several other separatist lawmakers are already in custody in spain over their role in the regional parliament unilaterally declaring independence on october 27 . ",
        "`` it 's inadmissible that the privilege of parliamentary immunity should be interpreted as impunity , '' the office of spain 's general prosecutor said in a statement . `` the guarantee of immunity does not mean that we ca n't place him in custody on a court order , '' the statement said . `` by running away and supporting acts which culminated in the declaration of independence , shows that he persists in his criminal plan . `` prosecutors also pointed to the separatist leaders already behind bars , saying they were also detained despite their parliamentary immunity because of the `` extreme gravity '' of the facts . ",
        "earlier this month , the supreme court had decided not to free former catalan vice president oriol junqueras , in custody since november 2 . judges said there was a risk he would `` re-offend as there is no sign that the defendant has any intention of abandoning the route he has followed until now '' . junqueras and puigdemont were instrumental in catalonia 's push to break away from spain via a referendum that took place on october 1 despite a court ban . - ruling from abroad ` illegal ' - in a major blow to the central government in madrid , pro-independence parties won an absolute majority in regional elections on december 21 . ",
        "as the sole candidate from catalonia 's separatist grouping , puigdemont announced this week that he could govern the region from brussels if he is re-elected president . the parliamentary vote to choose a new catalan leader is due to take place by the end of january . but spanish prime minister mariano rajoy reiterated saturday that governing catalonia from abroad would be `` illegal '' . echoing remarks he made monday , rajoy said madrid would maintain its direct control over catalonia and will take the matter to court if puigdemont sought remote rule . the catalan parliament 's legal experts say any presidential contender has to be physically present , but puigdemont insists he has the legitimate mandate of the people to rule . ",
        "he wants to present his candidacy and government programme to parliament -- a prerequisite to being voted in -- remotely via videolink or by having someone else read it for him . his lawyer jaume alonso-cuevillas said saturday all scenarios were currently being considered . `` president puigdemont never dismissed the possibility of presenting and submitting his candidacy in person , '' the lawyer told catalonian public television , adding that his client was `` aware of the risks he faces '' . alonso-cuevillas has previously said that puigdemont `` could not be arrested '' in barcelona because of his immunity .
