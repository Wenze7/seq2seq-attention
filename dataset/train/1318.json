        "in the u. s. , the first planned clinical trials of crispr gene editing in people are about to kick off . china , meanwhile , has been racing ahead , having already used the gene-altering tool to change the dna of dozens of people in several clinical trials . the wall street journal reports that so far in china , at least 86 people have had their genes edited , and there is evidence of at least 11 chinese clinical trials using crispr . one of those trials , the wsj found , began a year earlier than previously reported , putting the start of the first chinese crispr trial in 2015 . ",
        "china 's rapid advancement is the result of more relaxed regulations , and a willingness to forge ahead with cutting-edge research despite potential unknowns and safety concerns , which are significant . one recent paper , for example , suggested that crispr could trigger an immune response in a majority of patients , which could render potential treatments either ineffective or dangerous . china 's rapid-fire approach has set off a biomedical duel between the u. s. and china , and sparked concerns among western scientists that the chinese trials have been irresponsibly premature . in china 's 2015 crispr trial , the wsj reports , 36 patients with cancers of the kidney , lung , liver and throat had cells removed from their bodies , altered with crispr , and then infused back into their bodies to fight the cancer . ",
        "other chinese trials have sought to use crispr to treat hiv , esophaegeal cancer , and leukemia . a trial slated for this year in china will enroll 16 patients . meanwhile , the first human crispr trial in the u. s. , at university of pennsylvania , will enroll just 18 people , and is designed primarily to test whether crispr is safe . chinese scientists may end up being the first to cure cancer using crispr , but it 's unclear what repercussions may come with rushing through these early safety trials .
