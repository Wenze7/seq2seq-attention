        "over the past few years an increasing number of cities and counties have become active in regulating the activities of employers . this year has been no different , and commencing in 2018 , employers should prepare for a number of local law developments that will have an impact on the way they treat their employees , including the following : on july 1 , 2018 , the minimum wage in the cities of los angeles , santa monica and malibu , along with unincorporated potions of los angeles county , will increase to $ 13.25 for employers with 26 or more employees and $ 12.00 for smaller employers . ",
        "northern california locations , including san francisco , berkeley , palo alto , san jose and numerous others will also increase their minimum wage in 2018 . on january 1 , 2018 , santa monica will increase the required amount of sick leave for employers with 26 or more employees to 72 hours , and smaller employers to 40 hours . san francisco will expanded its parental leave ordinance to require employers with 35 or more employees to provide paid parental leave beginning july 1 , 2017 , and on january 1 , 2018 , employers with 20 or more employees must also comply with this requirement . ",
        "further , san francisco enacted its own lactation ordinance effective january 1 , 2018 , which improves upon existing state and federal requirements by ensuring that the designated area for expressing milk is safe and clean , has a surface for a breast pump , includes a place to sit and has electricity . additional requirements include access to a nearby sink and a refrigerator , and dissemination of a written lactation policy . effective july 1 , 2018 , san francisco also will ban employers from asking applicants about their prior salary history , and will also prohibit disclosure of a current or former employee 's salary history without the employee 's authorization , unless the history is already public . ",
        "employers will also be prohibited from retaliating against an applicant for refusing to disclose salary history . finally , the northern california city of emeryville passed a law which is similar to san francisco 's earlier retail workers bill of rights . the law applies to certain retail and fast food companies that becomes fully enforceable in 2018 . in brief , for employee schedule changes initiated by the employer , the law requires advance notice to employees . employees have right to decline , and `` predictability pay '' must be paid when the employer adds or subtracts hours or moves to another date or time , cancels , or adds a previously unscheduled shift . ",
        "such pay is required at the rate of one hour of regular pay when notice of the change is less than 14 days , but more than 24 hours , in advance of the change . additional pay is required when less than 24 hours of notice of the change is provided . also , before hiring additional workers , work must be offered to part-time employees . other features include an employee 's right to rest a certain number of hours between shifts and an employee 's right to request a flexible working schedule .
