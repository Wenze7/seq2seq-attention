        "this shooting comes just one day after a shooting at a high school in texas . a teenage girl was wounded at italy high school on monday after a 16-year-old suspect , who is now in custody , opened fire with a semi-automatic handgun . there have been at least seven school shootings in 2018 so far , this latest shooting will be the 8th . kentucky state police and the federal bureau of investigation 's louisville office are working together to investigate this latest incident . `` fbi louisville is aware of a school shooting at marshall county high school with multiple victims , '' the agency tweeted .
