        "the boeing company stock had an outstanding 2017 as the company benefited from ongoing strength in the industry and internal execution on its aircraft platforms . in order to assess whether the company will have a similarly successful year in 2018 , it 's useful to look at what went right last year and the trends going into this year . in this vein , here are the five key things to look out for this year . end market growththe international air transport association is the most widely followed aviation industry body , and its forecast is for more growth to come . ",
        "two of the key numbers to focus on are airline profitability and passenger load factors . airline profitability tends to correlate with aircraft orders , and the higher a load factor is , the more pressure airlines will feel to expand capacity . as you can see below , the iata expects airline profitability and load factor to carry on their strong uptrends in 2018 -- good news for boeing and chief competitor airbus . record deliveries and strong ordersboeing 's 763 deliveries in 2017 represent an industry record , and as you can see below , orders of 912 were significantly in excess of deliveries in 2017 . ",
        "ultimately , boeing 's backlog now stands at 5,864 representing , 7.7 years of deliveries at the record rate achieved in 2017 . bridging the gap to the 777xit 's not just overall orders that count -- the type of order and how it fits into boeing 's production plans are also very important . toward the end of 2016 , boeing announced a production rate cut on the 777 to a rate of just 5 per month starting in august 2017 from a rate of 8.3 a month previously . the rate cut was partly a response to weak orders -- there were just 17 orders for the 777 in 2016 . ",
        "it 's a concern because boeing needs to bridge the gap in starting production on the 777x -- the new version of the 777 with a planned first delivery date in 2020 . the good news is that boeing received 40 orders on the 777 and 20 on the 777x in 2017 , and based on management 's planned delivery rate of 3.5 per month in 2018 and 2019 , boeing is `` in an oversold position in 2018 , and approximately 90 % sold out in 2019 . '' meanwhile , the 20 orders on the 777x bring the backlog to 326 . ",
        "all told , boeing 777 & 777x orders in 2017 will help keep production going on the 777 and make sure a healthy backlog is in place for the 777x when it enters production . deferred production cost on the boeing 787another area of concern for investors is the issue of the deferred production cost on the 787 program . in a nutshell , boeing uses the program accounting method -- revenue and cost are spread out over the lifetime of the program . theoretically , as the unit cost of each additional aircraft falls as more are produced , and revenue goes up , the deferred production cost should fall . ",
        "as you can see below , the deferred production cost is indeed falling as production increases . moreover , boeing received 94 net orders on the 787 , the best year since 2013 , and management plans to increase the production rate on the 787 to 14 a month from 12 a month currently . boeing 737 programas of october , the company had 4,431 boeing 737 aircraft in backlog , representing 7.9 years of production at the current rate . however , orders on the 737 have been so successful that management plans to ramp up production to 52 a month in 2018 , and then 57 a month in 2019 . ",
        "the demand is there , now all boeing has to do it execute on the production ramp and reduce the unit cost of production going forward . boeing in 2018all told , strong order growth has caused ramps in production on the 737 and 787 , and this should help bring forward margin expansion as more aircraft are produced . it 's a demonstration of boeing 's ability to benefit from margin expansion as demand increases . more of the same in 2018 -- and the iata forecast suggests a strong aviation market -- and boeing could have another great year operationally .
