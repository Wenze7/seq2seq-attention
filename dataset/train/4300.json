        "can someone just sign already ? ! yu darvish and jake arrieta have brought the offseason starting pitching market to a standstill as just about every team waits to hear where the two will end up . the minnesota twins are one of those teams playing the waiting game for darvish 's services , and will not move on to any other pitcher before they hear back from him . the twins were a surprise playoff team last year as they improved 26 games from 2016 to win 85 games and secure a wild card spot . they are now looking to build around last years success and the obvious area of need is their pitching staff . ",
        "the twins do not have much depth in their starting rotation behind ace ervin santana , and could really use a few arms behind him . along with adding darvish , the twins would be wise to add some lesser free agents like andrew cashner or jaime garcia as well . as the twins continue to wait on darvish , we all wait for the free agent market to develop , and as this guy points out on twitter , a lot of great players remain unsigned . hopefully , some of these names will begin to come off the board , because the hot stove is ice cold right now .
