",
        "finke hit his 3 in front of the illini bench , got fouled by isaiah roby and made the free throw for what looked to be the play that would give illinois its first big ten win under first-year coach brad underwood . palmer finished with 24 points on 10-of-19 shooting after a dismal 1-for-9 outing in a loss at penn state on friday . evan taylor added 13 for the huskers . trent frazier scored 19 points , finke added 16 and leron black had 13 for the illini , who are winless in six true road games .
