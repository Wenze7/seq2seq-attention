        "` transformative technologies do n't change you , they help you be a better you ' , i experienced this useful reminder this christmas eve in suao , a taiwanese township . it was the fourth day of our family holiday , by then we were habituated to minor linguistic hurdles . though this was hardly a spoiler as most taiwanese working in the hospitality business use voice translation apps for full blown chinese-english conversations . however , our cab driver this christmas eve was different . while we were rushing to make it in time for our dinner reservation at an italian restaurant , he asked me an unusual question using his phone 's voice translation app , `` kya aap hindi jaante hain ? '' ",
        "after recovering from the mild shock of hearing perfect hindi in a cab in suao , i nodded yes , which put a triumphant smile on his face . he subsequently went on to display his knowledge of india , `` hum sab jaante hain ke hindustan china ke paas hai '' . the rest of the interaction was a seamless chinese -- hindi conversation between us , or rather between our respective android and ios phones . just a regular chat , between regular folks . the hindi translation , perhaps slightly less accurate than english , only added to the fun . ",
        "such as , when we were about to reach , i heard , `` hum restaurant ek hafte mein pahunchenge '' ! the experience reinforced a simple realisation . as contradictory as it may sound , meaningful technologies change our lives by maintaining continuity . my cab driver continued to service a non-chinese client . he even continued simple conversations that friendly cab drivers indulge in . at one level , his life continues as usual , yet at another , there 's a profound change . he is just being able to do more of what he wants to do . ",
        "there in was my lesson -- technologies that have the power to transform , simply allow us to be a better version of who we are ! and yes , we made it in time for our italian dinner !   "
