        "have you ever made a dramatic change in your hair style ? you go to your barber or stylist , get in the chair and a few moments later you are looking at the transformed you . you go out among your family , friends and co-workers and receive compliments that make you smile from ear to ear . after some time , you begin to miss having long hair and then you start the process of growing it out again . however , to reach your goal , you will need to get through the dreaded `` awkward stage . '' ",
        "the awkward stage , also called the `` ugly stage '' or the `` hat stage , '' is when your hair has grown long enough that it looks like it needs to be cut again , but not quite long enough to create the style you want . it is the stage of transition and it can simply be dreadful . it is also when you may be tempted to abandon your goals and go back to where you started . not because you wanted to stay , but because you ca n't handle the awkwardness of the transition to get you to where you want to be . ",
        "you may go back to the short hair style , not because you want to but because you feel stuck there . the problem with the awkward stage is that when you look back over the time it would have taken to transition , had you maintained your course of action , you would have made it . but during your transition , you could not handle the awkwardness . however , if you can subdue your urge to bail out of the transition to attain your desired outcome , you can get to the other side of the awkward stage . ",
        "i have worked in middle schools for over 16 years and one thing i know for sure is that middle school students go through a long awkward stage . from the time they enter as sixth graders fresh from elementary school , to the time they leave eighth grade to head to high school , they are in transition . these students are almost unrecognizable by the end of middle school in appearance and personality . the worse time of transition is the middle of the middle , also known as seventh grade ! some of us are still living in the awkwardness of seventh grade . ",
        "we may be resting on the `` potential '' we were told we had or in accomplishments long since past and almost forgotten . at some point we realize we can no longer stay where we are , but do n't know if we can make it to the place we want to go . let me tell you , if you look back and realize you have achieved your goal but did n't because of the awkward stage , you will wish you stuck with it . in the awkward stage , you may be self-conscious and want approval . ",
        "the worst thing you can do in the place of transition is allow yourself to be vulnerable to the opinion of someone who has the opportunity to poison your position . even the most trusted friend or family member may unknowingly reinforce your doubts and even increase them . that is why it is very important to encourage yourself and be mindful of the opinion of others . never let someone else 's opinion of you knock you off course . they will tell you to turn around because what you had was good enough . do not relent . ",
        "if you can take it , you can make it to your goals . endure to the end . before you reach anywhere worth going , you will have to go the way of the awkward stage . transition is necessary . we admire butterflies because of their transformation from caterpillars , and we also admire caterpillars because of their transformation into beautiful flying creatures . it is the chrysalis that we forget , the cocoon that we should embrace . it is the transition that allows us to achieve because without it , we can not move forward . ",
        "you have to be relentless in your pursuit of your goals . you have to want your dreams bad enough that the awkwardness and self-consciousness of transition no longer scares you enough to make you turn around . fear is a shadow . it was never meant to intimidate you . it was made to trigger your ability to overcome challenges . for some of us , we are terrorized by the idea of not receiving approval . you should never be paralyzed by other people 's opinions . the people who share their opinions are many times projecting their insecurities and shortcomings on you . ",
        "they want company in their place of insecurity . however , you should use this as motivation and say `` i will show them what is possible . '' do not relent . the awkward stage is simply a stage of transition . it was never meant for you to stay there and it was never meant to cause you to turn around . the awkwardness you feel is a signal that you are on the right path . it means you are enlarging your territory . it means you 're growing . i love my students . seeing them enter middle school and spending three years with them is awesome . ",
        "at the beginning i know they will not be in middle school forever , even though sometimes it feels like it . each day presents its own challenges , which can make for some long days . however , i hold onto this quote , `` the days are long , but the years are short . '' when you are in the midst of transition , the days , the weeks , the months and even the years feel longer than they are but in the end , it will be worth it . do not turn around . ",
        "embrace the chrysalis , that is where the transformation is happening . that is where you grow .   "
