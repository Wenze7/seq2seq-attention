        "live windsor more streams windsor west mp brian masse wants the windsor port authority to transfer control of ojibway shores to environment canada or to the city of windsor . the 13-hectare natural area on the west side of windsor is considered an ecological gem and is currently being managed by the windsor port authority . last month , the detroit river canadian cleanup , a local environmental group said they wanted the site protected . mark garneau , the minister of transport , which owns the land , provided masse with a letter saying the windsor port authority has legal and administrative autonomy to determine its own course of action . ",
        "the letter closes , stating : `` i encourage all stakeholders and interested parties to continue working together toward a consensus that will benefit all involved . '' masse said the windsor port authority could do two things . first , he said if it transferred the land it would be able to save money . `` it 's going to cost them money by keeping the property , '' said masse . `` by their own figures it 's costing them some $ 70,000 to do that . '' second , by giving the property to either the city or environment canada , he said the land could make a `` wonderful gateway to the gordie howe bridge . '' ",
        "as well , this could open it up to potential tourism , recreation and possible research in environmental works . masse said he has written the board of directors for the windsor port authority asking that it act on this . concerned residents are rallying behind masse . tom henderson is the chair of the detroit river canadian cleanup . he said the group he represents does n't care how it 's done , they just want the area protected . `` we 're asking minister garneau in his capacity as minister to require the port authority to keep it green forever , '' he said . ",
        "his group fears that the port authority could clear cut and develop the land , which it wanted to do in 2013 . it dropped the plan after strong opposition to the development . `` since then they have been super guardians of the property , '' henderson said . the port authority has chased out intruders and repaired any damage done , but it has a mandate if it wants to , to develop the shore , he said . windsor port authority declined to speak directly on masse 's proposal . david cree , the president and ceo of windsor port authority told cbc it 's working on a solution for ojibway shores and will discuss it at its next board meeting in january .
