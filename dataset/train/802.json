        "one of my biggest fears in the world are spiders . i hate them . one of my biggest things i enjoy most about cars are convertibles . so what happens when those two things get combined into one ? my tester featured this week is the 2017 fiat 124 spider . i affectionately called it the fiata and the reason is , this is an automotive collaboration between fca and mazda . the 124 spider is very much like the outstanding miata in exterior and interior looks . the spider has slightly more power and is a little more performance-oriented than the miata . ",
        "both are two-seat drop tops that are loads of fun . i borrowed this car for a week to drive in my daughter 's high school 's homecoming parade . i drove around a few members of the homecoming court in this drop top . the two members were a little cramped riding in this two-seater , but we made it work for our short , 2-mile ride along the parade route . the car was a hit with many of the parade viewers . it stood out amongst all the other typical convertibles . there was only one car like it . ",
        "but it also made me sad to have to keep the car at only 5 mph as this car is a cruiser . like the miata , the fiat spider is fun to drive every time you 're behind the wheel . it was one of my top 10 favorite vehicles of the 2017 model year . it 'd be a car that i could purchase and enjoy . driving is supposed to be fun , and fiat makes it fun with this little roadster . my tester was the extra-fun spider abarth , which means even more horses and a beautifully tuned engine that makes a nice growl . ",
        "the 1.4-liter turbocharged engine makes 164 horsepower . that 's faster than a miata and drives even faster , with spry handling and agile performance . turning and cornering are an absolute blast . there are n't enough superlatives to discuss how fun the spider is to drive . a six-speed manual transmission will be extra fun for enthusiasts . my tester had a six-speed automatic which had very minimal turbo lag . inside , the fiat closely resembles the miata , only with a slightly more quality touch points . the low-mounted seats are well-cushioned , but do make for difficulty getting in and out of the car , especially for taller passengers . ",
        "in fact , anyone over 6 feet tall may be really cramped when the roof is up . but it 's a roadster and that top is supposed to be down anyway . unfortunately , the spider gets the mazda infotainment system and not chrysler 's . as such , it 's cumbersome and not intuitive . with the top up , road noise permeates the cabin , but that 's to be expected from a such a lightweight vehicle and thin roof . putting the top down is extremely easy , but totally manual . it 's a two-step process that requires very little effort . ",
        "the 124 spider has an epa rating of 25 mpg/city and 36 mpg/highway . i averaged just over 29 mpg in a week 's worth of heavy-footed driving . fuel economy was the farthest from my mind whipping corners and feeling the open road in this roadster . fun trumps fuel economy every time . the fiat 124 spider has a starting price around $ 24,000 for the basic , non-abarth trim . my tester had a base price of $ 28,195 . the extra money the abarth costs is totally worth it for the sweet sound of the exhaust and the extra horsepower . ",
        "my tester had leather and the customer-preferred package for a total msrp of $ 30,450 . driving in a parade is fun . but driving on the highway , top down , wind in your hair , feeling the road below you are what driving is all about . the fiat 124 spider makes driving fun . maybe i 'll even like spiders now -- the creepy , crawly kind . then again , probably not . but i definitely like the 4-wheel kind of spider ! 2017 fiat 124 spider abarthprice/as-tested price ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... $ 28,195 / $ 30,450 mileage ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 25 mpg/city ; 36 mpg/hwyengine ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 1.4-liter 4-cylinderhorsepower ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 164 hp/184 lbs .
