        "and details of a new hopes and dreams collaborative writing project for 2018what is it that draws us to reading , to books ? there 's any amount of discussion here on medium about why people write , but let 's turn the question around . why i read may not be the same thing as why you read , but that does n't matter . all reasons for reading are valid , provided that it 's something you actually want to do . reading should never be a chore . why do i read ? curiosity is the underlying thread for me .

        "i want to lose myself and i want be transformed . i want to be someone else , to fully inhabit their soul and feel everything they feel . i want to experience another city , another country so completely that it feels like home . i want to inhabit the past and experience the future , in all its myriad multiplying realities . i want to learn something new every day . i want my heart to be warmed and my thoughts provoked and all my preconceptions shattered into a thousand tiny little pieces . i 'm a frustrated time traveller at heart .

        "and there 's something wonderfully evocative about the pale papery scent of pages . yes , i 'm one of those people who is drawn to the tactile nature of books . right now , i 'm currently reading crown of blood by nicola tallis . it 's a life of lady jane grey , a teenage girl who became queen of england for thirteen days in july 1553 . history books can create a barrier of dry facts and dusty exposition between subject and reader , leaving you wondering who these people actually were . this is not one of them .

        "jane is a strong-willed and fiercely intelligent young woman with a strong interest in religious radicalism who reads plato ` for fun ' . we meet her ineptly ambitious parents and their love of card games . and we experience the deadly world of tudor court intrigue , which ultimately ends in jane 's execution for treason . however , the descriptions of gemstones are a little too detailed for my liking . overall i 'm happy with the book i 'm reading right now . but i 've noticed reading comes in trends . sometimes nothing seems to fire your imagination , and at other times you hit a run of pretty decent books .

        "very occasionally , you 'll stumble across something outstanding . that got erika sauter and me thinking about a new collaborative writing project for the early part of this year . the theme is simple : 100 favourite books for 2018 . to take part , all you need to do is write about a book that is important to you , and inspire us to seek it out for ourselves . then post it to hopes and dreams with the tag ` 100 books for 2018 ' . it 's entirely your choice , and you can post as many or as few times as you like . ",
        "come and share the books that matter to you with us . but in the interim , perhaps you 'd like to answer the question that set this off in the first place . why do you read ?   "
