        "las vegas -- making cleaning less of a chore : that 's the goal of some devices unveiled this week at ces in las vegas . ten minutes and a half-gallon of water is all it takes for the heatworks tetra to do the dishes . the counter-top device needs no plumbing hookup . it 's modular : it holds two place settings at a time , or you can use inserts to convert the entire thing to , say , wash wine glasses . the tetra also can be used to ` dirty ' your tableware with dinner : it can cook food sous vide . ",
