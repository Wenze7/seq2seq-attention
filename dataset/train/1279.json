        "brussels - a top eu official on thursday accused several european countries , including ireland and the netherlands , of being tax policy `` black holes '' and promised to pressure them to change their ways . `` obviously many countries in the european union are places where aggressive tax optimisation finds its place , '' eu economic affairs commissioner pierre moscovici told reporters in brussels . `` some european countries are black holes i want to address this , '' he added . former french finance minister moscovici spoke ahead of an eu finance ministers meeting in which the bloc was expected to whittle down a month-old blacklist of non-eu tax havens from 17 countries to nine . ",
        "when the list was announced in december , ngo oxfam said four european countries -- ireland , luxembourg , malta and the netherlands -- deserved to be on the list if the eu 's criteria were being faithfully applied . moscovici denied this , but added : `` if you realise that the tax flows go to this or that country : ireland , the netherlands , luxembourg , malta , cyprus , let 's talk about how to solve things . '' these countries often serve as eu headquarters for global multinationals , offering complicated tax schemes that help companies -- such as google , apple or facebook -- to shift profits and avoid big tax bills . ",
        "but instead of expanding their list , the 28 eu finance ministers meeting on tuesday are expected to absolve eight countries - including panama and south korea . they will now go to a so-called `` grey list '' , jurisdictions that have made unspecified commitments to the eu on reforming their tax laws . moscovici warned against breaking citizens trust and called on ministers to make public any commitments made , repeating similar pleas in european parliament . `` we can not accept that member states are secretly negotiating exemptions for tax haven nations that have fallen in favour , '' said french mep eva joly of the greens party , a major advocate of fair tax policy . ",
        "the grey list , which currently includes 47 countries , will be complemented by the eight struck from the blacklist , including the united arab emirates , tunisia , mongolia , macao , grenada and barbados .   "
