        "the first fifty shades freed teaser showed us a wedding and a possible kidnapping . the second gave us guns , a car chase , and ana 's revenge-seeking ex-boss . but the third look at the film , which just dropped today , may contain the biggest bombshell of them all . in the new trailer , we see newlywed anastasia steele living an existence so charmed that even she is n't sure it 's real . `` i just ca n't believe that this is my life that i get to live with you , '' she tells christian . ",
        "but we soon find out that things are n't all wine and roses . as first shown in the previous trailer , the lovebirds embark on a major renovation project as they settle into their new life together in a stately old home . and the drama starts right away , when a gorgeous architect shows up and gets a little too friendly with christian , prompting ana to step in . `` please stop speaking to my husband as if i were n't here , '' she tells the architect . `` you may call me mrs. grey . '' ",
        "from there , the tease continues to sizzle , as elena reappears in christian 's life . but that 's nothing compared to the return of ana 's ex-boss jack , who is obviously unhinged and wants revenge on his former employee . and just when we think we ca n't take any more , we see ana 's shocked face as a voice tells her , `` it seems you 're pregnant , mrs. grey . '' of course , all of this is in addition to snippets of the steamy scenes we 've come to expect from the franchise . ",
        "see it all in the new fifty shades freed trailer above , and check out the action on-screen when the movie hits theaters on valentine 's day . what did you think about the fact that ana is expecting a baby in the new fifty shades freed trailer ? let us know @britandco ! you might also likea `` lord of the flies '' remake is happening with female actors and twitter is up in arms this holiday drinking game will keep you merry and bright margot robbie had never heard of tonya harding before ` i , tonya ' "
