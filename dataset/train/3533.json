        "it 's no secret that philadelphia 76ers head coach brett brown is beloved by san antonio spurs players . so now that spurs and kawhi leonard are reportedly strained , could this be an opportunity for the sixers as trade deadline approaches ? knowing when to hold em , and knowing when to cash 'em in , are the most instinctive talents an nba personnel executive can possess . windows of opportunity to upgrade a team do not come with road maps , neon signs , nor gps tracking . when you are in the presence of a team-changing opportunity , the executive must know it then and there . ",
        "and he must understand the value point . go up to that point in compensation , but do not go over . the philadelphia 76ers now need such a man . right now , philadelphia 76ers president bryan colangelo may be standing on several such opportunities . we already know that the trade deadline is approaching . and with it , two nba rumors involving the philadelphia 76ers are heating up . one involves the charlotte hornets and guard kemba walker . the other involves the orlando magic and power forward aaron gordon . unhealthy rosterthe philadelphia 76ers , when healthy , is a cleverly designed set of interchangeable lineups . ",
        "in short , each `` star '' on the team has sufficient backups to play most of or not much of the available minutes in any given game . and the remainder of the roster can change out to give more offense or defense , more height or more speed , as the game dictates . but the news flash of the day ? this team is not healthy . the team has seen almost nothing from rookies markelle fultz nor furkan korkmaz so far , and korkmaz is likely done for the season . j. j. redick is good when healthy , but he is now out for the second time this season . ",
        "jerryd bayless , a veteran who missed nearly all of last season , has missed eight games this year already . so the philadelphia 76er are included in two nba rumors so far to improve the team . now a third opportunity is emerging . next : leonard spurred by spurs philadelphia , pa -- february 8 : robert covingtonleonard spurred by spursthe san antonio spurs have played 46 nba games so far . wing kawhi leonard has played nine . and there is the rub . in fact , of 82 games in any season , the best leonard has ever done is 74 games last season . ",
        "and with the current report of `` out indefinitely '' due to an injured quad muscle , the spurs patience is wearing thin . actually , wearing thin `` again '' . it seems that the san antonio spurs were interested enough in trading leonard before the season to entertaint trade talks with the new york knicks before the season started . firestorm of rumors and reportsand that 's setting off a firestorm . after a 25.5 points per game season , leonard would be justifiably upset if he was truly on the trade block . but in his absence , the spurs are 30-18 this season . ",
        "and his price tag averages a cool $ 20 million a year . so the spurs would be wise to consider offers at this point . so what would the 76ers offer for such an opportunity ? next : not too much , not too little . just right . los angeles , ca -- november 15 : bryan colangelo of the philadelphia 76ers before the game against the los angeles lakers on november 15 , 2017 at staples center in los angeles , california . note to user : user expressly acknowledges and agrees that , by downloading and/or using this photograph , user is consenting to the terms and conditions of the getty images license agreement . ",
        "mandatory copyright notice : copyright 2017 nbae not too much , not too little . just right . the trick is to offer just enough to entice the spurs to deal , but not so much as to give away too much . and the san antonio spurs love defense as well as offense . for the moment , the spurs have the 25th and the 55th picks of the 2018 nfl draft . but the spurs roster is aging , and the team knows that mano ginobili and pau gasol are on their last nba contracts . all that considered , the spurs are not in any `` fire sale '' mode over leonard . ",
        "he is an outstanding player who brings very high level of offense and defense . and right now , these philadelphia 76ers need some help on both sides of the court . but the team is fighting their own set of injuries . so if the team pushes a healthy player off to the spurs , the result could be counter-productive . on the flip side , the spurs need more than a casual package to garner interest . this is a playoff team rumored to be at odds with a standout player . a player already named in outlandish deals . ",
        "deal with itso to pull this one off , the philadelphia 76ers must push both players and picks , all the while balancing salary cap issues . the trick is to push the salary impact so that neither team is crushed under the exchange . that should n't be too challenging to do considering the recent flurry of free agent signings by the team . so here is one scenario : this trade places the san antonio spurs into great standing to reload , while giving the team enough talent to sustain post-season momentum . on the flip side , the infusion of kawhi leonard to the philadelphia 76ers bolsters the team 's playoff hopes , while infusing more `` fit '' players into the team scheme . ",
        "next : nba rumors philadelphia 76ers roster needs help nowwith a trade deadline rapidly approaching , you can bet bryan colangelo , the man who `` loves the deal '' is trying to find one right now . with a potential opportunity to land wing player kawhi leonard , the sixers need to act fast . you can bet the celtics are on the phones now as we speak . more from the sixer sense nba rumors philadelphia 76ers roster needs help now10h ago philadelphia 76ers sign larry drew ii to 10-day deal16h ago philadelphia 76ers need to stick with tlc when redick returns18h ago 4 sixers rank in nba 's top 100 players19h ago what 's the ideal playoff matchup for the sixers ?
