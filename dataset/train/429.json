        "even with a big win on the road , the dallas cowboys have to feel dejected by not getting any help from other teams which will be needed down the stretch . for the dallas cowboys , any good news is welcoming . especially after their horrific november . winning a second game in a row , in blowout fashion no less , has to feel good . doing so over divisional foes is always a touch sweeter . after three weeks of games where dallas could only muster single digit scoring , back-to-back 30 + point weeks feels a lot more normal for this team . ",
        "unfortunately , so does the nail biting that comes with depending on others for a possible playoff spot . while it is nice to dispatch the washington 's and new york 's of the football world , a few other teams need to experience failure for any of it to matter . this past sunday was not such a good day for that . every team that the dallas cowboys needed to lose , except the seattle seahawks , won . that is especially unhelpful when there is less than three weeks left . not only is time a factor , but so is positioning . ",
        "unfortunately for the dallas cowboys , there are five teams ahead of them . with five teams and just two spots , the margin of error is razor thin . before we get into the logistics of who and what to root for as we head into week 15 , let 's rejoice in the victory that was on sunday . in a reversal of fortunes , the cowboys did not play well in the first half only to fall asleep at halftime . this particular game was tight until the middle of the fourth quarter . depending on how to choose to look at that , you can either be happy that the defense is starting to look a little better or you can show concern for the offense . ",
        "maybe you even do both and cover all your bases . while it was not ideal to be in a 10-10 deadlock against a 2-10 team , at least the cowboys were able to pull away . how they did so may be more impressive than the actual doing so part . for one game , at least , all the guys this team needs to step up did just that . dez bryant and jason witten both found the end zone . cole beasley made some big time catches to extend drives and dak prescott finally was dak prescott again . ",
        "more from the landry hat dallas cowboys : the smartest move they 've made all year ? 8h ago the dallas cowboys four biggest giant killers on sunday14h ago dallas cowboys : dak prescott leads against new york giants1 d ago dallas cowboys remain focused on playoffs , not draft position1 d ago dallas cowboys explode in the fourth , beat giants 30-101 d ago after a month of really questionable outings , prescott finally had a great day . completing 20 of 30 passes for 332with three touchdowns and no interceptions , the cowboys quarterback did what is expected . ",
        "he led this team to a victory and was a prominent reason for said victory . last week felt like washington was disinterested in winning . on sunday , new york certainly gave it their best shot . dak 's run of inaccurate days came to an end at met life stadium . not only did he make a lot of good throws , he also put this team in positions of advantage by reading the defense well and making the correct audibles . no better example of that was on display than his 81 yard touchdown to rod smith . ",
        "noticing the defense was man-to-man with no safety help , prescott put smith into the slot . this move forced a linebacker not known for coverage into a predicament . 81 yards later , the cowboys put the nail in the giants coffin . dallas will need this type of play from prescott to continue as they have to run the table in order to even consider january football . as previously stated , that may not be enough however . as it currently stands , carolina and atlanta are your nfc wild card teams . seattle , also 8-5 , leads the group dallas is in , known as `` in the hunt . ",
        "`` that group also includes detroit and green bay , both 7-6 . for the cowboys to make the playoffs , they first need to finish at 10-6 . from there , they need green bay and detroit to both lose a game . lastly , atlanta has to lose twice . seattle losing one is a given since they play dallas in week 16 . carolina , with sunday 's victory over the vikings and their schedule , is out of reach for dallas as well . looking at those teams remaining schedules , there are absolutely viable opportunities for all of this to occur . ",
        "green bay finishes the season at carolina , home against minnesota and at detroit . even if aaron rodgers comes back , i would expect at least one loss there . detroit is home versus chicago next week before they hit the road at cincinnati , ending up at home versus green bay . if rodgers does come back , i would bet the farm the packers win that game . seattle has that date with an ezekiel elliott-led cowboys team two weeks from now . in between the rams and cardinals visit . the one loss dallas needs from seattle could come a week before they even play . ",
        "as for atlanta , they have road games at tampa bay and at new orleans before they finish at home versus carolina . since both new orleans and carolina are fighting for the division in addition to a playoff spot , both games should be difficult for the falcons . of course , it all does not matter if dallas has just one slip up . fortunately , it appears the defense is starting to figure things out . if prescott can find his 2016 form , the odds are good that dallas will win out . the question will be if everyone else can lend a helping hand too . ",
        "even with a big win on the road , the dallas cowboys have to feel dejected by not getting any help from other teams which will be needed down the stretch . for the dallas cowboys , any good news is welcoming . especially after their horrific november . winning a second game in a row , in blowout fashion ...
