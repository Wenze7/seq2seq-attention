        "new twist on iconic london tube map could spark recruitment bias debatejobs aggregator adzuna has recreated the iconic london tube map by showing average salaries near each tube station , but does it show bias towards the capital ? with jobs near the barbican district -- famed for its arts centre and expensive flats -- offering the highest average wage at over £ 52,700 , other high paying locations include monument , bank and cannon street . surprisingly , wages in kensington and chelsea , one of the uk 's wealthiest areas , were among the lowest in the capital averaging between £ 25,000 and £ 29,000 per annum . ",
        "doug monro , co-founder of adzuna , noted that location might be a key consideration for jobseekers looking for a boost to their salary . he said : `` jobseekers hoping for a step up the pay scale can pinpoint better-paid positions by looking closely at location . `` londoners love to argue about whose tube line is the best , and in terms of pay the waterloo & city line takes top place in the commuting charts , with the circle and central lines following close behind . `` meanwhile , victoria line commuters may boast of frequent tubes and a speedy service , but this research conclusively shows jobs located along the victoria line route offer the lowest pay , proving the victoria line is not where the money is . ",
        "`` yet , all this focus on london could reignite the debate whether london has too great a pull on the nation 's talent . last year , recruitment grapevine spoke with ed sutcliffe , managing partner at met marketing , based in leeds , who said that there is a `` drain of talent to london . '' certainly , sectors such as media , finance and fashion have some of their most attractive positions in the capital . whilst adzuna 's re-working of the tube map is certainly creative , by showing opportunities in london , as well as the wages on offer , there is a danger that vacancies around the rest of the country could be left in the shadows .
