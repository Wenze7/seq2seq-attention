        "toronto -- john herdman , who led the canada 's women 's soccer team to back-to-back olympic bronze medals , is taking over the canadian men 's program . he replaces the fired octavio zambrano , who was named head coach of the canadian men 's national team program last march . herdman 's new title is national team head coach and men 's excel director . the surprise announcement came monday evening . `` it was an organizational decision . octavio 's departed canada soccer effective immediately , '' canadian soccer association president steve reed said in an interview . ",
        "reed denied that any specific incident had triggered zambrano 's sudden departure . `` we 're looking at long-term , what we felt was necessary in terms of the development of our programs on the men 's side , '' he added . `` and we wanted to build that long-term alignment much like we 've experienced on the women 's side . `` when we did that organizational review , we determined that john herdman was the right person to lead that . '' former assistant coach kenneth heiner-moller takes over the canadian women . coach of the danish women 's team from 2006 to 2013 , the dane was a part of herdman 's coaching team at the rio olympics as a part-time assistant before moving to canada to be a full-time member of his staff . ",
        "heiner-moller 's title will be national team head coach and women 's excel director . canadian women 's captain christine sinclair responded to the move by tweeting `` speechless right now ... '' the canadian men are currently ranked 94th in the world while the women are no . 5 . the 42-year-old herdman took charge of the canadian women in august 2011 . he succeeded italy 's carolina morace after a last-place finish at the 2011 world cup in germany . the women 's program was in a dark place . gradually the charismatic herdman built it back up while developing a pipeline of young talent . ",
        "the english native took canada to a record-high fourth in the world rankings after winning bronze at the 2016 olympics , cracking the top five for the first time . herdman had been linked in some circles to the vacant english women 's coaching job but he wanted to keep his family in canada . he had recently talked of a move back to the men 's side of the game but not until the 2020 olympics . it appears that the men 's opening came sooner than expected . `` i 've done seven years with the team , '' herdman said in an interview monday . ",
        "`` i 've enjoyed every minute of it with the group . `` but i 'm a builder , i 'm a developer . with canada soccer and the rest of the crew we sort of built that program back up from scratch , built the high-performance system , built the talent development system , brought the right people in . '' `` i just feel the team is there now . they 've got the players , '' he added . `` they 've got the players to be successful and that 's often the hardest thing to do . '' ",
        "herdman previously served as head coach of new zealand 's women 's team and national director of football development . the 59-year-old zambrano , a well-travelled coach from ecuador , previously coached club sides in colombia , ecuador , hungary and moldova as well as the los angeles galaxy and metrostars in the early days of major league soccer . his record at the canadian helm was 3-2-2 . the canadian men were ranked no . 117th in the world when zambrano was hired by victor montagliani , currently president of concacaf . while herdman has inherited a huge challenge in the men 's team , whose lone world cup qualification was in 1986 , there are positive signs . ",
        "plans are under way for a domestic league in the form of the canadian premier league and canada is part of a joint 2026 world cup bid with the u. s. and mexico . soccer is also front and centre with toronto fc 's recent mls championship run . `` it 's an exciting time , '' said herdman . `` it really is an exciting time for the men 's game and i think that 's where hopefully my skill sets come in as a strategic thinker , a person detailed with planning who can look towards 2026 but also keep one eye on 2022 -- which is what i 've been doing with the women 's side -- synthesizing a football system to get the best out of it ... and then driving the changes through , getting the right people around the team to make the changes . '' ",
        "herdman will be in charge of the senior men 's team and all national youth sides from the under-14 level . in other moves , bev priestman will serve as women 's national excel director and as assistant coach to heiner-moller . zambrano succeeded spain 's benito floro , whose contract was not renewed in september 2016 after another failed canadian world cup qualifying campaign . floro 's record was 9-11-10 from 2013 to 2016 . last november , herdman was awarded the jack donohue coach of the year award by the coaching association of canada . `` coaching is my passion , '' herdman , a native of consett just outside of newcastle , england , said in 2011 when he was hired by the canadian soccer association . ",
        "`` it 's what i get out of bed for every day and this is an opportunity to do something special . '' herdman grew up playing soccer , describing himself as an `` ok '' central midfielder . he went on to play semi-professional football in the northern league and for his university . knowing a pro career was not in the cards , he started to take coaching courses at 16 . he had his own soccer school at 23 and then spent three years at the sunderland academy where he worked with a young jordan henderson , now a liverpool star .
