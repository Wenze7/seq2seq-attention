        "they were doing a roaring trade at shawbury service station . hats and gloves , coal , logs and screenwash were flying off the shelves as the temperature plunged in the shropshire village to -13 c , the lowest in the uk this year . met office it 's officially the coldest night of the year so far with a freezing minus 13 Â°c at shawbury in shropshire #brrrr pic . twitter . com/wmim1rgv2e december 12 , 2017 `` we 're doing pretty well , '' said gwen brown , who was serving behind a counter . `` people have been stocking up on woollies and fuel . ",
        "it 's also been lovely walking around and looking at the snow in the trees . the stars have been brilliant too . it 's not so good if you have to drive anywhere but it 's been great for the children . they have been loving it . '' brown had an extra helper in the service station because the village school was closed : five-year-old eva , who was enjoying her first taste -- literally -- of snow . `` it 's cold and crunchy , '' she said . `` i ate some -- it tasted like ice . '' ",
        "the village bakery was a cosy place to while away a few minutes . its owner , mark lee , said the locals were comfort-eating pasties , pies and hot vegetable soup . `` we also sell a lot more bread . i suppose it 's partly because people ca n't get to the supermarket . it 's good for the local shops , at least . '' a few doors up at the elephant and castle , the bar has also been heaving over the past few days . `` the roads are a nightmare so people are staying off work and enjoying themselves , '' said a bar worker , victoria keeling . ",
        "sixteen-year-old ben houlihan had been roped in to work a shift at the pub as a waiter because his college was shut . actually , he would have preferred to be in the classroom . `` i 'd rather not miss a couple of days of education , '' he said . for the older locals of shawbury , this was a good time to remember harsh winters past . the cold snap in the winter of 1947 was harsh and long -- and clothes and food were still rationed , making it all the more miserable . villages in shropshire were cut off for many days and farmers lost stock . ",
        "to mark this cold snap , the shropshire star produced a four-page snow special and carried a black-and-white photograph of local people venturing out on to the frozen mere at ellesmere . oli claydon of the met office said the `` albedo effect '' was one of the reasons shawbury was so chilly -- the thick snow bounces the sunlight back into the atmosphere , preventing the temperature from rising at ground level . the clear skies that have produced sunny days and bright nights mean clouds have not kept any heat in . and because shawbury is landlocked , the sea does not warm the village up . ",
        "bad news for joe grant , 70 , who was struggling to stay upright on the icy pavement . `` it 's ok for the kids ; it 's pretty terrible for us oldies , '' he said . sandra morgan was also not amused . her gas fire had stopped working and her water supply had frozen . `` no heat , no water , no fun , '' she said . `` i ca n't wait for it to warm up again .
