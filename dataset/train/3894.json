        "on thursday , governor andrew cuomo announced that new york state will clean up decades old ground water contamination that 's spreading under several long island communities . bethpage , n. y. -- on thursday , governor andrew cuomo announced that new york state will clean up decades old ground water contamination that 's spreading under several long island communities . the u. s. navy admitted responsibility for the pollution , but has yet to remedy it . sammy moussa prepares food in a hot truck in the shadow of the grumman property in bethpage . he makes it with bottled water , and does n't dare use tap . ",
        "`` never . i do n't drink it , i do n't give it to customers , '' he said . that 's because for decades a toxic plume of ground water has been flowing beneath the land where decades ago , the navy and grumman dumped contaminants . for years , the public water has been treated to remove toxins , but now governor cuomo said he is launching a complete fix , no longer waiting for the polluters to act . `` we are announcing that new york state will take action , number one , we are going to fully contain the plume , and number two we are going to fully treat the plume . ",
        "enough damage has been done , '' he said . it 's welcome news for a bipartisan group of long islanders who did not think the plume could be contained , and have gone to battle with the u. s. navy to pay for the clean up . `` no community should be afraid to drink its water . this is a true holiday gift for all of long island , '' adrienne esposito , citizens campaign for the environment , said . new state testing shows the plume is bigger than thought -- 2 miles by 4 miles -- and spreading quicker , endangering the water in other communities , and within 20 years , the ocean . ",
        "it 's even more contaminated containing 24 chemicals . the state will drill 14 wells around its perimeter . `` so it ca n't spread and there will be further wells inside the plume to remove all the hot spots , '' bethpage water district superintendent , michael boufis said , '' that will do the trick . this is a huge step moving forward . '' `` the navy and the federal government will just clean the water at the well heads before you drink it . what the governor is doing is very bold , trying to contain the actual plume , '' assemblyman andrew raia , , said . ",
        "the cost to contain the plume is $ 150-million . the governor said the state will do the work now and recoup it from the polluters later , and through the courts if necessary . the well system will extract and treat the water using carbon filtration , air stripping technology , and ultraviolet light as well as advanced oxidation .
