        "lima , peru -- the honeymoon , as it were , is apparently over . a day after pope francis grabbed headlines by pronouncing two flight attendants man and wife while flying 36,000 feet over chile , the conservative catholic commentariat on friday questioned the legitimacy of the shotgun sacrament and warned it could cheapen the church 's marriage preparation down the line . `` do you know what 's a ` marriage ' ripe for annulment ? '' tweeted the traditionalist blog rorate caeli . `` one celebrated apparently on a whim in an airplane whose celebrant can not even be sure if parties are validly baptized . ",
        "`` for those who missed the news , francis on thursday presided over what the vatican said was the doctrinally and canonically legitimate wedding of paula podest and carlos ciuffardi , two flight attendants from latam flight 1250 that brought the pope , his delegation and travelling press from santiago to the northern city of iquique . as the happy couple told journalists after the fact -- and after serving breakfast -- they had hoped to just get a blessing from the pope . they told him that they had been married civilly in 2010 , but that their plans for a church wedding fell through when an earthquake hit . ",
        "as ciuffardi told it , the pope proposed that he marry the couple right there , in part to motivate other couples to contract a church wedding at a time when more and more couples are merely cohabitating . `` he told me it 's historic , that there has never before been a pope who married someone aboard a plane , '' ciuffardi told reporters from the back galley . the surreal scene had the effect -- at least temporarily -- of giving francis a bit of a reprieve after his visit to chile was dominated by a church sex abuse scandal . ",
        "canon lawyer ed peters , a consultor on the vatican high court but a frequent critic of francis , questioned whether a host of church laws were followed , including the requirement that the couple undergo pastoral counseling and that the church have evidence that there were no obstacles to the marriage . in a follow-up blog post friday , peters noted a chilean media report from december saying the couple was hoping for an airborne wedding presided over by francis , suggesting the portrayal of the surprise ceremony was anything but . ciuffardi said chilean reporters had suggested it before the fact , but he insisted he and podest were only looking for a papal blessing , and that nothing was confirmed until they were airborne . ",
        "conservative blogger phil lawler mused that priests might now have a harder time trying to properly prepare catholic couples for marriage now that francis had set the papal precedent of completing the process between takeoff and landing . `` does he ask them to reflect seriously on their commitment ? nope , '' lawler wrote at catholic culture . `` does he question them about their years of cohabitation ? evidently not . does he hear their confessions ? not likely . plan a dignified ceremony ? not at all . `` to be sure , the naysayers all hail from the anglo-saxon blogosphere , which is among the most vocal in criticizing francis , especially on issues of marriage . ",
        "francis has split the church over his cautious opening to allowing divorced and civilly remarried catholics to receive communion , so any issue related to marriage is particularly sensitive . at the more liberal-leaning catholic tablet , vatican reporter christopher lamb suggested that the airborne nuptials were part of the `` paradigm shift '' that francis is trying to press in the church . `` it 's not that the pope is doing away with the need for rules , for canon law or for paperwork , but rather ensuring it is correctly prioritized , '' lamb wrote . `` for the pope , these things must support the spread of the gospel , and not become like the thorns that grow up and strangle the seeds in the parable of the sower .
