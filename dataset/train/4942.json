        "as the junk rally smashes past bullish year-end forecasts in first few trading days of 2018 alone , the clouds are gathering for a stormy second half of the year , according to nervous fund managers and strategists . with spreads at 2007 lows , investors who 've built up heavy credit positioning need to time their exits carefully : too soon and they 've missed out on what could be the last gasp of the bull run . too late , and they risk being saddled with outsize losses just as global monetary stimulus fades . `` it came pretty damn quickly , '' said ken monaghan , co-head of high yield at amundi pioneer , with $ 53.7 billion in assets . ",
        "`` spreads can crank a bit tighter -- 20 to 25 basis points -- and then we 're in coupon-clipping mode . '' monaghan is `` more nervous '' for the second half of the year , `` especially if there 's a concerted effort by central banks to put their foot on the brake . `` a slew of strong economic data , intensifying risk appetite and fresh inflows into exchange-traded flows have helped bond prices on their latest leg up . as the debate intensifies over whether valuations are driven by fundamentals or mindless liquidity , calls investors and strategists make this year could make or break wall street careers . ",
        "while monaghan at amundi is sanguine over current high-yield valuations , citing the strength of the business cycle , others are more bearish . `` there will be a crossover point later this year , probably the third quarter , where global quantitative easing turns to global tightening , '' said zachary chavis , bond portfolio manager at sage advisory services , referring to investment-grade credit . `` at that time , there may be a shock , and it 's anyone 's guess where markets go , '' chavis , whose firm manages $ 12 billion , said . ",
        "`` in the meantime , there 's a good technical bid for paper . people think they can get out before the market turns . `` the junk rally is one of capitulation , suggesting investors are waiting for the just the right moment to leave the party , said jody lurie , corporate credit analyst at janney montgomery scott llc , citing the jump in u. s. corporate leverage . `` the are plenty of people waiting to rush for the exits . markets are at the point where they are very sensitive . `` noel hebert of bloomberg intelligence puts it succinctly : valuations are divorced from balance-sheet reality . ",
        "`` it 's very difficult to tell where things are going to go . this is n't a world where fundamentals matter in any shape or form . '' -- with assistance by adam tempkin , and robert elson .   "
