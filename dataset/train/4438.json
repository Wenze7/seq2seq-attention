        "with the parameters of tv continuing to explode , most movie directors are finding their way to the small screen . but that format 's maestro , aaron sorkin , is finally making his mark as a director on the big screen with his feature adaptation of the book molly 's game by molly bloom . while some believe low budget dramas are bound to be boxed out by event films on the big screen , sorkin 's fingerprints are proof that there 's no greater place than the cinema when it comes to high stakes , stylized drama . ",
        "`` i 'm in denial about the business changing . i only know how to write the way i write and i hope i do n't outlive my usefulness , '' says sorkin . the stxfilms/eone/mark gordon company film goes wide tomorrow in 1,608 theaters after a limited christmas day debut that has grossed close to $ 7m . you 've written some iconic movies with riveting protagonists : the social network , moneyball , steve jobs and now molly 's game . for you what 's the through-line between mark zuckerberg , billy beane , steve jobs and molly bloom ? ",
        "i had never thought about that . zuckerberg was an anti-hero , so was steve jobs . billy beane was a genuine movie hero and so is molly bloom . i knew that from the moment i met her . an entertainment lawyer i knew socially asked me to read the book and it was a fantastic ride . but when i went to meet molly , she was n't the person i was expecting . the person i met was brilliant , strong as a tree , sly sense of humor , and built of integrity . the book was just the tip of the iceberg and she left the breadcrumbs of a great story . ",
        "but there would be hundreds of hours after that . after i met her , i got a call from mark gordon who heard i was interested in the book as well . so we decided to work together to option it . we set it up at sony at the time when amy pascal was head . she bought the book and attached me to write . when sony changed hands , mark wanted to finance the movie himself . when did it become evident to you that molly 's broken relationship with her father was the crux of a film about a glamorous poker room host ? ",
        "that would n't become evident in the first hour of our meeting . it was n't until we became comfortable with each other . she only spent a few pages on him in the book . he drove the kids hard in regards to academic and athletic excellence . what became fascinating to me was how and why she did n't tell her full story about him in the book . what ended up in the movie were two stories married : her story from the book as the world 's biggest poker game runner , and the present day story of idris elba 's lawyer-character trying to keep her out of jail . ",
        "`` i 'm going to figure you out , '' he says . in their second scene together , he 's asking the same types of questions i was asking her through that research period . i wanted that dramatic journey i took where i was n't expecting much from the meeting to believing she 's a real life movie heroine . there always seems to be a lot of development drama when it comes to bringing your films to the screen . steven soderbergh was attached to moneyball and dropped out . steve jobs went through a number of cast attachments and budget changes with sony attached before the film moved to universal . ",
        "why is this ? first of all , there are n't a lot of movies written by anyone anymore that have a smooth no problem path to the big screen . social network had no problem getting to the screen , but you 're right about the others . the scripts i write are n't no brainers to green light . i do n't write a straight down the middle movie ; there 's a slight knuckle ball aspect , like the three-act structure in steve jobs or the voiceover dialogue in molly 's game . it is n't an easy movie to label exactly : it 's not wolf of wall street and it 's not rounders . ",
        "so while some studio heads get excited after they read a great script , they get nervous when their marketing departments say , `` we do n't know how to sell this . '' studios are more comfortable with making $ 100 million movies than $ 30 million . that said , i 'm incredibly lucky that every one of my movies has been made . why direct now ? you even stayed away from directing your own tv shows . did amy pascal ever lobby you to direct at sony ? when i write a script , i always want the best director . ",
        "as far as west wing goes , i had tommy schlamme and his crew of great directors . i was never thinking of directing episodes because that meant not writing an episode or two . you need to prep and do post . the only other time i thought about directing was the social network . amy and scott wanted me to direct . i was about to say ok when it was decided that david fincher would take a look . i thought once he passes , i 'll direct . david did n't pass , and good thing for me because he made the best possible version of the social network . ",
        "my reasons for saying yes to molly 's game was because there 's a gravitational pull with the project toward the shiny decadence of its glamour and hollywood names . i wanted to tell a story against the backdrop of this , with a bigger , deeper emotional story at the forefront . the first time i met molly , i thought in this case , i might be the best director . your films deal with power struggles . the industry has been rocked by sexual harassment allegations and purging itself of men who 've been awful to a number of women . ",
        "as a tale of female empowerment , how does molly 's game add to the conversation ? molly has to navigate a world filled with powerful men , many who feel as though she 's not respecting their power enough , and they feel the need to punish her in a big way . that feels relevant to today . i 'd gladly trade a fortunate time for the movie to be released in a world where these things have n't happened . i doubt they will stop happening and the only incidents we get to hear about are those in hollywood , politics and the media where we know the names of the perpetrators and the victims . ",
        "when a senior partner in an investment bank sexually harasses a junior partner , or a manager of restaurant harasses a waitress , the media is n't going to cover those victims . so , i think that molly 's game is going to resonate . related stories ` last jedi ' unseats ` wonder woman ' as second-highest grossing pic of 2017 with $ 423m + aaron sorkin on becoming a director with ` molly 's game ' : `` you do n't finish a movie , it just gets confiscated '' - behind the lensdaniel day-lewis stitches ` phantom thread ' ; jessica chastain deals ` molly 's game ' - specialty b. o. preview .
