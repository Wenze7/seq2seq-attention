        "galveston , texas -- adrienne correa sucked in a breath as she slipped on her wet suit 115 miles offshore of galveston -- but it had nothing to do with preparing for her 70-foot dive to the coral reef at the flower garden banks national marine sanctuary . it had everything to do with her nerves . about two months had passed since hurricane harvey deluged the gulf with trillions of gallons of freshwater , upsetting the salty environment to which the marine organisms are accustomed . and she had no idea what she would find . if harvey 's impact on the reef was anywhere near as bad as the 2016 tax day floods -- which caused a mass die-off of coral and other marine animals -- the reef and its inhabitants were in serious trouble . ",
        "but her mind was put at ease as she dove deeper into the chilly october waters of the gulf of mexico . with the exception of a few areas , the reef appeared to be intact and thriving . `` relative to the images we saw from the 2016 event , this was a happy dive , '' correa , a rice university marine biologist , told the houston chronicle . `` you could see immediately there was not mass bleaching , there was not mass tissue die-off . you could tell this mass mortality event was n't occurring . ",
        "`` but that does n't mean problems wo n't arise in the coming months , she said , which is why she and other researchers , in partnership with the national oceanic and atmospheric administration , are gathering samples to determine how the habitat may have been impacted . `` we 're worried about all the floodwater that came off upland areas making it that far out , '' said shelley du puy , noaa education and outreach coordinator . their discoveries , though still far from publishable , could help guide policy makers toward better ways to monitor urban sprawl and greenhouse gas regulation , correa said . ",
        "the reef needs to be protected , she added , because it 's `` an incredibly valuable resource culturally , ascetically and economically . `` correa has spent years studying coral reefs across the globe , but she always finds the colorful , surprisingly intact flower garden banks distracting . at a time when there is an 80 percent decline in stony coral cover at reefs everywhere , correa encounters colorful coral the size of cars rising up around her on dives to the area . sea turtles and lobsters can be found resting in the reef 's nooks and crannies , with nearly 300 different species of fish -- from barracudas to angelfish to mardi gras wrasse -- swimming in and around the area , according to an august 2012 united nations presentation . ",
        "manta rays glide gracefully over the reef , as moray eels pop out of the coral crevices when a meal comes into view . dive to reefs in the summer and you 'll likely spot a whale shark visiting the sanctuary . flower garden banks is one of 13 federally designated underwater areas protected by noaa and includes three separate reef areas : east flower garden bank , west flower garden bank and stetson bank . noaa wants to expand the sanctuary by about 383 square miles of reefs and other bottom features -- an additional 15 banks -- but the proposal has yet to be approved by the trump administration . ",
        "the banks were discovered by fishermen in the early 1900s and named for the brightly colored sponges , plants and other marine life visible below their boat , according to noaa . at a time when a quarter of coral reefs worldwide are considered damaged beyond repair and two-thirds are under serious threat , according to the world wildlife federation , the flower garden sanctuary reefs are considered some of the healthiest in the region . scientists believe this is because the reef is located so far offshore -- 70 to 115 miles -- and sits so deep in the ocean -- 55 to 160 feet -- that it does not face the same effects of climate change as other reefs worldwide . ",
        "the beauty and diversity of the reefs draws visitors from all over the world : up to 3,000 divers visit the sanctuary 's crystal clear waters each year via commercial dive boats , according to the u. n. presentation , and that brings money to the area . but studies on the true economic impact of the sanctuary appear to be lacking . a 2015 noaa study examined survey data from both commercial and recreational fishing operations , as well as for-hire diving operations . the study found that they brought in about $ 6.2 million annually for an area in the northwestern gulf , which includes the sanctuary . ",
        "after annual operating costs , profits for the three industries were about $ 1.6 million , according to the study . but the profits made by these operators ca n't be the only thing that is taken into account when determining economic impact , du puy said . people who fish and dive in the sanctuary also buy gas , food and gear in the local towns . they stay in local hotels and shop in local retail stores . the boats have to be maintained by mechanics , manned by a captain and crew , and the budding scuba divers must be taught the ropes . ",
        "`` these guys spend big bucks to charter a vessel to go 115 miles offshore , '' du puy said . `` all the boats , the captains , all the money they spend on the gear ... it adds up . `` buddy guindon , a commercial fisherman who owns katie 's seafood market , said he and about seven other fishing operations in the galveston area catch around $ 5 million worth of fish -- including grouper , red snapper and golden tilefish -- from the sanctuary each year , which then gets distributed all over the country . ",
        "the study found that commercial fishers such as guindon caught about 400,000 pounds in the northwestern gulf annually . on any given day when waters are calm , scott hickman , owner of circle h outfitters and charters , said that 20-30 recreational fishing boats can be found at the sanctuary . fishing for wahoo is popular in january and february , hickman added , but the summer months are popular for catching amberjacks and grouper . fling charters is the only company that takes for-hire diving trips to the sanctuary , and sharon cain , the company 's office manager , says that is their sole money maker . ",
        "naturally , their busiest time is the summer , cain said , but they do take trips out during the rest of the year . the company gets about 90 divers each week during peak seasons , and they make about $ 550,000 each year , she added . recreational divers hoping to catch a glimpse of colorful stony coral , manta rays and even hammerhead sharks arrived at the sanctuary 's eastern bank in july 2016 to instead find water that was an unusual , hazy green . the sickly sight only worsened after they plunged into the water . ",
        "tissue was falling off the coral . sponges looked like they were melting . sea urchins were dead and falling apart on top of the reef . even the lobsters , normally buried beneath the coral colonies for protection , were standing on top of them trying to get away . `` even just a bleaching event can be catastrophic for the reef because so many organisms live inside , '' correa said . `` but this -- when you see all the organisms falling apart at once -- that 's alarming . `` a noaa report released that same month stated that about 50 percent of corals were dead in certain areas . ",
        "researchers quickly gathered samples , but correa said they had no idea when the mass die off started or how long it had been occurring . in other words , it was a `` puzzle with missing pieces , '' she said . freshwater had inundated the salty environment following the april 2016 tax day floods , correa said , sucking the oxygen from the water . the reef , essentially , was suffocating . though the sanctuary is monitored throughout the year , correa said the mass die-off puts researchers on high alert when it comes to these extreme flooding events . ",
        "so when hurricane harvey dumped 13 trillion gallons of water on southeast texas in late august , researchers were ready . the first set of scientists boarded a boat in september to gather water , sediment and coral samples . they went out a second time in october . correa was pleased to see in october that the reef had not died off in mass , but she was not blind to the evidence of stress on the organisms that live there . coral colonies and sponges -- typically uniform in color -- were mottled and grayish , while some sections looked shriveled and sunken . ",
        "scientists tracking the freshwater moving into the gulf after harvey watched as the water 's salt content dropped 10 percent in september , according to rice university 's website . but by october , the level had returned to normal , the website stated . it 's still not clear what impact that will have on the reef , which is why correa and her team are gathering samples to test for conditions such as low water salinity , poor water quality and bacteria that thrives on low oxygen . during harvey , about 149 million gallons of raw sewage and industrial discharges poured into neighboring communities and waterways . ",
        "additionally , about 100 companies , including valero energy , exxon mobil and arkema , reported spilling chemicals . `` frankly , these types of events are frightening because in the short term , when you have 13 trillion gallons of rain there 's not a lot you can do to stop it , '' correa said . `` and then its luck of the draw , how it mixes with the salt water and where the wind moves it . `` researchers , including correa , will continue monitoring the reef . they have an expedition planned in april to take more samples . ",
        "correa and her team received about $ 72,000 in emergency federal funding to conduct this research , but scientists are hoping to receive even more . the national marine sanctuary foundation is requesting $ 5 million from congress as part of a hurricane supplemental package to `` support water quality monitoring at flower garden banks , '' according to a foundation document . `` rapid resource assessment efforts with regular monitoring cruises are needed to track changes in the health of coral , invertebrate and fish in the and the surrounding areas at more frequent intervals , '' the document states . ",
        "`` assessing and monitoring the impacts from hurricane harvey on the ecosystem will provide vital scientific and socioeconomic information to manage the area for long-term sustainability . `` ultimately , they hope to develop some predictive modeling that can show which wind conditions would significantly increase the risk of freshwater moving into the gulf and into the banks . that type of system would arm them with better arguments for policy makers when they are making choices in terms of urban sprawl , paving everything and regulation of greenhouse gases . `` the flower garden banks are the jewel in the crown of the u. s. reefs because they are one of the few as a whole that are not significantly degraded , '' she said . ",
        "the area is important to `` fishers , the diving industry , this is a cost that we 're incurring '' if something happens to the reefs . ___ information from : houston chronicle , is an ap member exchange shared by the houston chronicle .   "
