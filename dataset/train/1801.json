        "the insider picks team writes about stuff we think you 'll like . business insider has affiliate partnerships , so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase . sonos ' new speaker , called the sonos one , is the company 's first model with amazon 's alexa built in . by combining the intelligence of an echo with the audio quality sonos is known for , this is the best-sounding alexa-enabled speaker you can get right now . if music is something you take seriously , or you 've been meaning to start a smart home and/or sonos speaker collection , this is the best way to accomplish both . ",
        "if the original echo had one problem , it was its weak speaker . amazon realized this around the same time that sonos saw the transition people were making from connected speakers -- a category it dominates , for good reason -- to smart speakers . the result : amazon built an echo with a better speaker inside , and sonos built a new entry-level speaker with alexa inside . i was recently sent the new sonos one speaker to test , and i think it 's the perfect smart home gadget for music lovers . what makes the sonos one so great is that it combines the best parts of a sonos play : 1 and amazon echo without introducing any friction . ",
        "if you know what sonos speakers sound like , you 'll know what to expect in terms of audio quality . it 's generally very good , and an improvement over the play : 1 , which is the only other sonos speaker i 've spent any time with . i listened to music from a few different genres and services , and the one handled everything very well . it 's still a mono speaker , so do n't expect stereo separation , but i was impressed at how balanced songs sounded . the bass is a little on the powerful side , but if you find it overwhelming , there 's always the option to tweak the eq digitally . ",
        "the one is also controlled using the same sonos app fans of the platform have been using for years , and includes the same streaming service integrations . if you have a network of sonos speakers in your house already , the one will integrate with them once it 's set up . on the alexa side , if you 've ever used an amazon echo , you 'll know what to expect with the one , too . you can use it to control smart home accessories , integrate with third-party services through new skills , and answer questions whether they 're simple or complex . ",
        "like an echo , everything related to the one 's smart home integrations is set up and maintained through the alexa app . in my testing , the one was able to do everything my echo plus could without any problems . some have reported the one is less responsive because it does n't have the same mic array as an echo , but that was n't my experience . the sonos one is as much of an echo as one made by amazon , so if you 've been interested in starting a smart home and a sonos speaker collection , you can accomplish both at once with this speaker . ",
        "that 's especially true now that the one can play songs from your spotify library through alexa voice commands . if listening to music is something you do passively , you 'll probably be satisfied with the second generation echo . for people who take it more seriously though , the sonos one is the smart home speaker i 'd recommend hands down .
