        "medicilon 's chemistry department has more than 100 chemists , who are experienced in the cooperation with major domestic and international pharmaceutical and biotech companies . our services cover a variety of research interests in novel drug research , including target validation , hits evaluation , lead optimization , candidate nomination , preclinical development and ind filing . email : marketing@medicilon . com . cn web : www . medicilon . comthe present invention relates to methods and assays for identifying agents useful in the treatment of fibrotic diseases , in particular diseases related to fibroblast migration and differentiation . ",
        "the invention provides polypeptide and nucleic acid targets , sirna sequences based on these targets and antibodies against the targets . the invention is further related to pharmaceutical composition comprising sirna sequences based on the targets and antibodies against the targets for use in the treatment of fibrotic disease . the invention further provides in vitro methods for inhibition of fibroblast migration and differentiation . cells were triggered with 0.2 % hi-fbs plus 50 ng/ml pdgf-bb and the maximum open area of the wound was measured . moi 12 was used and the time of wound closure was set at 13 h. subsequently the complete rescreen was performed in one batch using these optimal conditions . ",
        "2.2 data analysisin the rescreen , the performance of positive and negative controls served as success criteria for each plate . the data distribution of duplicate raw values showed a spearman rank correlation of 0.73 between duplicates . in addition , a clear separation was observed between signals of positive and negative controls . hit identification on rescreen data was performed using the robust z-score based on negatives . the `` robust z-score method '' combines negative control measurements altogether under the assumption that they are inactive and serve as controls , taken into account outlier values in order to minimize their undesirable influence . ",
        "a separation between positive and negative controls was observed , with p3 being the strongest inhibitor , and p2 , p4 , and p5 being moderate inhibitors of wound healing . 2.3 resultsan overview of the results obtained for the controls and samples in given on fig . 3 . the robust z-score method with a cut-off of 1.2 was used for the rescreen . at this cut-off less than 5 % of negative controls were identified as false positive hits , while over 71 % of positive controls were a hit . after sequence confirmation , 216 shrna constructs were identified targeting 229 genes . ",
        "3.5 fmt assay protocolthe set-up of the fmt screening protocol is presented in fig . 5 . the complete validation assay was performed in the normal human lung fibroblast donor fb0202 . the cells were seeded at a concentration of 3000 cells/well on purecol-coated 96-well plates . on day one , cells were transduced with the 216 shrna carrying viruses from the fibroblast wound assay rescreen . on three plates a well with non-transduced cells was taken along in order to monitor the general virus effect on the αsma expression . on day five , cells were triggered with 0.5 ng/ml tgfβ and the cells were allowed to undergo fmt for three days . ",
        "on day eight the αsma expression was determined using high content imaging and subsequently quantified using the above-described algorithm . for the validation of the 216 confirmed hits a different plate layout was used , in which the outer wells were excluded in order to avoid possible plate effects . furthermore , to enable hit identification based on negative controls , at least 30 % of the wells in each plate consisted of negative controls . in addition , five positive controls were included . 3.6 resultsa clear separation between positive and negative controls was observed . the correlation between biological duplicates was compared using spearman rank correlation . ",
        "for all duplicate plates the spearman coefficient was 0.92 or higher . similar to the rescreen of example 2 , the robust z-score based on negatives was used for hit calling in the fmt validation screen . fig . 6 shows the results for controls and samples after normalization with the robust z-score . transduction of cells with adenoviral constructs , resulted in an increase in αsma expression in fibroblasts . however , this appeared to be a general virus effect irrespective of the encoded shrna . four out of five selected positive adenoviral controls did inhibit fmt below the basal levels expressed by fibroblasts triggered with tgfβ only . ",
        "to determine the robust z-score cut-off value to be used for hit identification , at least 4 out of 5 positive controls should be identified as a hit , with none of the negative controls as false positive and only one of the six `` no virus '' samples as false negative . all plates fulfilled these additional acceptance criteria at a cut-off of ≦ − 1.8 and therefore this cut-off was selected for hit calling . in addition , single hits with a z-score ≦ − 1.8 cut-off of which the corresponding replicate had a z-score ≦ − 1 , were also considered .
