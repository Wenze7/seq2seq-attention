        "in the wake of three separate allegations of rape or sexual misconduct lodged against him in recent weeks , actor ed westwick has officially been dropped from the bbc 's agatha christie drama ordeal by innocence . according to the hollywood reporter , the former gossip girl star 's scenes in the production , which had already wrapped filming and had been scheduled to air around christmastime , will now be reshot later this month , with the actor christian cooke stepping in to fill westwick 's role . the change in programming was announced on friday by co-producers mammoth screen and agatha christie limited , along with the news that a new air date will be released soon . ",
        "as 2017 came to a close , three women came forward in rapid succession to accuse westwick of sexual misconduct . one of the women , the actress kristina cohen , recounted a graphic memory of one such encounter on her personal facebook page : . so i went and laid down in the guest room where i eventually fell asleep , i was woken up abruptly by ed on top of me , his fingers entering my body . i told him to stop , but he was strong . i fought him off as hard as i could but he grabbed my face in his hands , shaking me , telling me he wanted to fuck me . ",
        "i was paralyzed , terrified . i could n't speak , i could no longer move . he held me down and raped me . westwick has vehemently denied all of the allegations against him in the past , and denied ever knowing cohen . `` i do not know this woman . i have never forced myself in any manner , on any woman , '' he said . `` i certainly have never committed rape . '' westwick 's replacement in a role in the wake of sexual assault allegations is n't unprecedented . in 2017 , director ridley scott subbed out kevin spacey for christopher plummer after the former was publicly accused of sexual misconduct .
