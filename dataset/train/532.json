        "the most important poll number to come out this week had nothing to do with defeated alabama senate candidate roy moore . it had to do with fox news and donald trump . we 'll get to the numbers in a minute . first : some disclosure . i 'm a fox contributor and a trump skeptic . that makes this an awkward column to write , for reasons that should be fairly obvious . regardless , i do n't think i am revealing any state or corporate secrets that fox is the president 's favorite news network . he says as much all the time . ",
        "according to cbs ' mark knoller , as of last october , president trump gave more than three times as many interviews to fox and fox business as he has to nbc , abc and cbs combined . he 's given two to religious networks and zero to cnn . some fox defenders would say this is understandable because the other networks are so hostile toward the president . they certainly have a point . fox critics would say that trump favors fox because the network is exceedingly friendly to the president . some even call it trump 's `` state tv . '' ",
        "the critics have a point , too , though an important distinction needs to be made . most of the president 's interviews have n't been with the news side -- which i think usually does a very good job of covering the news honestly and fairly -- but with the opinion side . sean hannity , probably trump 's favorite host and , reportedly , an informal trump adviser , explained in april 2016 , `` if i 'm interviewing hillary clinton , it 's gon na be a hundred times harder than any republican , because i believe the republicans . ",
        ". . have a far better vision , one that i agree with . . . i 'm not a journalist , i 'm a talk show host . '' . many other cable hosts pretend that they are dispassionate journalists when any reasonable viewer can see that they are ideological and political partisans . msnbc host rachel maddow touts her show as covering the news `` without fear or favor . '' i do n't know about the fear part , but any remotely objective viewer would see an awful lot of favor -- to democrats , liberals , trump critics , etc. . ",
        "still , the same objective viewer simply must concede that fox , particularly `` fox and friends '' and the primetime line-up -- with hannity at the forefront -- is objectively and intensely pro-trump . the news side is a different animal . but even here it 's fair to say fox does n't follow the path forged by other news organizations , which often appear so determined to hurt trump that they fall for bogus stories which my national review colleague rich lowry calls , `` too anti-trump to check . '' whether that makes them biased toward trump is ultimately in the eye of the beholder . ",
        "that hannity & co. . bend over backward to cast trump in as favorable a light as possible really is n't up for debate . but there 's a difference between favorable and helpful . much of the opinion stuff essentially involves mirroring trump 's twitter feed , attacking trump critics and railing about the `` rigged system , '' `` fake news '' and the `` deep state . '' it 's so much muchness , as the british say . the focus on the reality show drama and cult-of-personality stuff is distracting from the more straightforward , if more boring , case for the white house . ",
        "that may not be evident in the ratings , but it is in the polls . trump has been hemorrhaging support among key demographics for months , despite a much improving economy , victory over isis and mostly excellent judicial appointments . which brings me to those poll numbers . suffolk university and usa today released a poll this week which found that among people who trust fox news the most , the president 's approval rating has been sinking . his favorability among fox devotees in june was 90 percent . in october , it was 74 percent . ",
        "this week ? fifty-eight percent . if that trend continues , he will be underwater with the fox audience long before the 2018 midterms . you can cry `` fake polls , '' as trump often does . but was the same poll fake in june ? or are the same trends that led to trump 's historically abysmal approval ratings now reaching even the fox faithful ? from virginia to oklahoma to alabama , establishment and anti-establishment gop candidates alike have lost in large part because democrats , independents and a significant number of republicans disapprove of trump more than they approve of him . ",
        "his pander-to-the-base approach still does wonders for hannity & co. 's ratings , but ratings are n't votes . jonah goldberg is a syndicated columnist and author . he explores politics and culture for national review as a senior editor . he is the author of `` liberal fascism '' and `` the tyranny of cliches : how liberals cheat in the war of ideas . '' for more of his reports , go here now .   "
