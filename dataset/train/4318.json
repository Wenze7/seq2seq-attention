        "mlb trade rumors for the miami marlins are nothing new , but the latest development with christian yelich is quite telling . mlb trade rumors and the miami marlins go together like peas and carrots . peanut butter and jelly . with the departure of national league mvp giancarlo stanton and all-stars dee gordon and marcell ozuna , mlb trade rumors are stirring on who 's next to take their talents to out of south beach . if you are betting person , you best get some action on christian yelich , who is not happy with the current situation in miami . ",
        "not one bit . yelich 's agent , joe longo recently talked to espn on the matter , with the details quite telling on just how bad things are in miami . `` they have a plan . i respect that plan , but that plan should n't include christian at this point in his career . he 's in the middle of the best years of his career . `` we can appreciate the brutal honesty of yelich and longo , but that statement alone speaks volumes . it 's apparent that no legitimate mlb superstar wants to play for the marlins during their massive rebuild , and who can blame them ?
