        "former inter milan coach andrea stramaccioni has defended his old club over the sale of philippe coutinho . coutinho was sold to for € 12m five years ago . he joined barcelona this week for € 160 mm . `` i am not surprised by coutinho 's move , as phil has improved a lot in the premier league , and above all playing for brazil , so he deserved a top club , '' stramaccioni told panorama magazine . `` he was able to work on his weaknesses and go for goal more , while also working off the ball . ",
        "phil had made his debut at inter under rafa benitez and was a protagonist of my team . `` coutinho started really well , but wesley sneijder was in his position , so obviously there was a lot of competition for playing time . his evolution was already in progress . `` the offer from was hard to resist and his desire to go to england proved decisive . it was a difficult moment and cou was one of the few young prospects we had with such a high value on the market . `` we needed to balance the books and his sale was followed by sneijder 's departure . ",
        "i understood and respected the decision made by marco branca and piero ausilio , albeit with a heavy heart . `` nobody was happy with his sale , because we could tell even then he had enormous potential . i am still in contact with philippe , as he always was and still is an exceptional lad . along with his technical quality , he has remarkable humility and a great work ethic . `` he has a wonderful girl by his side who grew up with him and helped him remain the same boy he was in brazil . ",
        "that helped his enormous talent on the field to develop fully . ''   "
