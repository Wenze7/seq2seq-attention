        "the united nations ' political chief is heading to pyongyang on tuesday for a rare four-day visit en route from china , which has called the resurfacing of tensions on the korean peninsula regrettable . `` in response to questions received on the democratic people 's republic of korea , under-secretary-general for political affairs jeffrey feltman will remain in the pyongyang area throughout his visit , '' the un said in a statement on monday , adding that feltman met with chinese vice-foreign minister li baodong on monday in beijing . the unusual visit of feltman - he will be only the second such official to visit pyongyang in seven years - comes amid intensified tensions on the peninsula as seoul and washington kicked off their largest-ever five-day joint military air exercises on monday , following pyongyang 's launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile on nov 29 . ",
        "pyongyang said that the drills would push the already acute situation to the brink of nuclear war , according to the korean central news agency . `` tensions resurfaced on the peninsula after two months of relative calm , and all related parties did n't catch the window of opportunity that china has appealed for them to take advantage of . china feels regret about it , '' chinese foreign minister wang yi said at a joint news conference with his mongolian counterpart in beijing . the foreign minister also said that while china takes an open-minded attitude toward solutions to the nuclear issue on the korean peninsula , all parties should jointly abide by the regulations and spirit of security council resolutions . ",
        "`` the resolutions represent the common will of the international community , and they are the global duties that should be followed by all members , '' wang said . `` propositions and measures that are against or not included in the resolutions lack international legal support and will jeopardize the execution of un resolutions , '' he explained . us senator lindsey graham said on sunday that he believes it 's time to start moving the families of american military personnel out of south korea . foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang said on monday that china hoped all parties would do more to help ease tensions and avoid provoking each other . ",
        "wang junsheng , an expert on korean affairs at the chinese academy of social sciences , said no party will win by continually flexing its muscles .   "
