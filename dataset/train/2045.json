        "image credit -- edds86/redditback in 2015 , microsoft announced a new controller for the xbox one in the form of the xbox elite controller . this was a more expensive controller , but one of its key features is that it is modular and customizable according to the needs of the gamer , and it turns out that gamers do n't mind paying for such features . microsoft had claimed that the controller was selling like hotcakes , and now fast forward 3 years later it seems that microsoft could have a new model in the works . images have been posted onto baidu and reddit in which the new and updated controller and its design are being shown off . ",
        "the reported specs include a usb-c port for charging , bluetooth support for gamers playing on windows 10 pcs , three-level hair trigger locks , longer key travel for the paddles , and a three profile switch . it also reportedly has an adjustable tension mechanism for the thumbsticks , which as the verge points out seems to be in line with a patent that microsoft filed for back in december 2017 . now whether or not these images are legit are unclear , but the verge 's source has confirmed that they are genuine , so take that for what it 's worth . ",
        "no word on when the controller will be launched , but e3 2018 in the middle of year does seem like a pretty good possibility .   "
