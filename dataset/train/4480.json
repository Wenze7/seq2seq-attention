        "the law of least effort `` truth is ever to be found in the simplicity , and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things . '' -- isaac newtonin a period of information overload , there 's never been a better time to simplify life . the raging struggle of modern existence can lead to inner turmoil if we 're unaware . the key to living an inspired life is to simplify it . to gain clarity on what 's important , let go of unnecessary conditions and tune into what you value most . most people chase material possessions believing they 'll be happy , only to realise it makes matters worse .

        "the more clutter in your life , the less capable you are of knowing what 's important since you are distracted by insignificant issues that vie for your attention . naturally , you react to what is taking place before you instead of what 's essential . health , relationships , family and living my purpose are central aspects to my life nowadays . it 's taken an entire lifetime to reach this point , yet it 's well worth it . that which brings you joy and happiness require the least effort . i 'm drawn to the quote by henry david thoreau who said : `` as you simplify your life , the laws of the universe will be simpler ; solitude will not be solitude , poverty will not be poverty , nor weakness weakness .

",
        "1 . surround yourself with remarkable people `` our life is frittered away by detail ... simplify , simplify . '' -- henry david thoreauthese include : friends , family , romantic partners , co-workers and those who offer you support and encouragement . significant people are those who encourage your personal growth . they are your humble ambassadors in times of need and wo n't desert you through crisis . the company of such people leads to simplified living because your needs are met through close connections . great people inspire and strengthen you , not drain your energy .

        "energy vampires rob you of your vital force , so be aware them . they want to gain something and are unwilling to offer anything in return . steer away from them , they will deprive you of your long term happiness . 2 . let go of what no longer serves you `` truth is something which ca n't be told in a few words . those who simplify the universe only reduce the expansion of its meaning . '' -- anais ninletting go of what no longer serves you is essential to simplifying life because you free yourself from what consumes your energy . ",
        "this includes : people , things , places , relationships , travel , behaviours or habits . if it does n't bring you joy , remove it from your life or distance yourself from it . however , do n't fill the void with something else , simply allow it time to recede , so you have less to focus on . in doing so , you free up mental and emotional resources for more important matters . create a space for something wonderful to appear and trust it will take its place , since nature abhors a vacuum .

        "3 . focus on experiences , not things `` i think people want very much to simplify their lives enough so that they can control the things that make it possible to sleep at night . '' -- twyla tharpthe lie that happiness comes from material possessions is one many fall victim to . sure , it might offer happiness for a short while , although once it wears off you yearn for something more . newspapers are filled with stories of people who inherit millions of dollars , only to find themselves more miserable than before . this is not due to money per se , rather the stress associated with managing large sums of money . ",
        "accumulating material objects amplifies insecurities already present in a person . focus on experiences and surrounding yourself with friends and loved ones . travel more , perform random acts of kindness , do charity work if that appeals to you . the key is to find fulfilling experiences that embody who you are . for example , i enjoy creative hobbies and feel lively when engaged in these endeavours . find time for these activities and you 'll be happy and content . 4 . be in tune with your nature `` reduce the complexity of life by eliminating the needless wants of life , and the labors of life reduce themselves .

        "the old paradigm is gradually falling away to make way for the new . this is n't about a new world order , for it 's much simpler than that . it 's an expanding of consciousness and fading of primitive thinking , once dictated by our primal urges . the changes herald a new way of perceiving the world via our sixth sense . people are harnessing their intuition to make sense of the world around them . be willing to upgrade your model of reality to coincide with the change . remove preconceived ideas about how life should play out since these concepts keep you trapped in the past .
