        "in a year defined by deals -- disney-fox , discovery-scripps , sinclair-tribune and at&t 's government-interrupted merger with time warner -- the biggest question for the media and entertainment sector entering 2018 is : who 's next ? with six major movie studios shrinking to five and one of the big four broadcast networks suddenly on an uncertain path , it is clear that the m&a pace will only accelerate in the new year . among the dance partners likely to take a twirl : viacom , cbs , sony , lionsgate and mgm . and that 's just on the content side -- distributors , having taken 2017 off , are likely to tango in 2018 , with dish , charter and altice among the deal-inclined . ",
        "`` in a consolidation phase like this , this is a game of musical chairs and the chairs are disappearing quickly , '' said one industry executive . this past year will go down as the time when traditional media companies had their collective jurassic park moment , looking in the rear-view mirror and seeing a giant t. rex closing in . consider the rankings of tech and media companies by total market capitalization -- together , apple , google , amazon and facebook have a combined market cap that 's closing in on $ 3 trillion . the only traditional , non-telco media players at $ 100 billion or greater are disney and comcast . ",
        "viacom 's market cap is just $ 12 billion . media companies will likely feel pressure to bulk up , just to compete . disney 's $ 66 billion offer for the majority of 21st century fox 's film and television assets is widely seen as a defensive maneuver -- an attempt to fortify the media conglomerate for battle with the bigger , better resourced technology companies that are rushing into the entertainment business . in the coming clash of titans , disney has expanded its pantheon of superheroes to include the x-men , fantastic four and deadpool , added a lucrative sci-fi/fantasy franchise in avatar , and loaded up on popular television fare including the simpsons and american horror story . ",
        "it plans to harness this wealth of entertainment assets to launch a streaming service of its own to challenge netflix . the mega-merger only underscores the fate of the media left-behinds , those smaller industry players that will find it increasingly hard to survive in the land of giants . veteran telecommunications industry analyst craig moffett has been tracking , quarter by quarter , the steady loss of cable and satellite tv subscribers and the gains made by new distributors like slingtv , directv now , hulu tv , sony playstation vue and youtube tv . moffatt notes that the number of subscribers to these new , cheaper digital alternatives , or virtual mvpds , is hard to quantify -- the best guess is around 3.4 million subscribers to date . ",
        "but the winners and losers are starkly apparent . traditional broadcasters -- abc , cbs , nbc and fox -- are included in these new , cheaper programming bundles . players with cable-only offerings , like viacom or discovery networks , have `` huge holes in their coverage . '' `` this yawning disparity with respect to positioning among vmpds is unmistakable in the numbers , '' moffett observed , adding that , `` in a rapidly shrinking distribution universe , inclusion on the emerging alternatives is seen as an imperative . '' this harsh reality may drive weaker television players , like viacom , into the hands of an acquirer -- or perhaps renew conversations to reconcile with its network ex , cbs . ",
        "while it has recovered from the chaos and ratings free-fall of the late-philippe dauman period , viacom under ceo bob bakish has a potent set of cable assets but also a host of questions around advertising revenue and the turnaround prospects for paramount pictures . lionsgate has been a consistent acquirer of companies , absorbing starz this year after a previous deal for summit . it also is among the bidders on the distressed , though still valuable , remnants of the weinstein company . but lionsgate 's collection of media properties also could make it an attractive acquisition target -- especially for a company shopping for content . ",
        "the santa monica entertainment company 's television business encompasses nearly 90 shows on 40 different networks , including netflix hit orange is the new black and syndicated juggernaut family feud . its feature film unit , even without more installments in the hunger games young adult franchise , outperformed one of the six major studios at the domestic box office in 2017 . the company has scored this year with family film wonder and carryover business from oscar-nominated musical la la land . in october , it announced joe drake was returning to the company as co-chair of the film unit . ",
        "direct-to-consumer is another key priority for lionsgate , which added two new streaming services to starz 's 2-million-subscriber-strong on-demand platform . two more streaming services launched over the summer -- kevin hart 's laugh out loud and pantaya , which offers day-and-date access to spanish-language films as they debut in latin american theaters . regulatory changes in washington , d. c. , may well accelerate the pace of media acquisitions . the fcc 's vote to repeal net neutrality rules clears the way for telecommunications companies and cable operators to prioritize access to their networks -- essentially , collecting a toll from streaming services looking to deliver content to subscribers . ",
        "`` which could mean that any digital service will only be able to guarantee their u. s. users a high quality of service if they broker a deal with each and every telco , '' wrote midia analyst mark mulligan . telecommunications companies may well abandon all pretense to `` neutrality , '' and give an edge to entertainment services they own . sprint might decide to make song streaming flawless when delivered via its part-owned music service , tidal , but less musical for spotify or apple music . similarly , at&t could throttle video viewing on netflix to give an advantage to its own directv now service . ",
        "`` those telcos without strong content plays could find themselves in the market for acquisitions , '' mulligan writes . `` for example , verizon could make a bid for spotify . '' as the fcc throws out the rulebook on the internet , it is making similar moves to strip away decades of regulation limiting local tv ownership . as sinclair gets set to claim tv stations that could reach a majority of u. s. households , fox is also salivating at the thought of ramping up in local . meredith , having swallowed up debt-laden time inc. . ",
        "this year , may be less inclined to hang onto its station portfolio , some wall streeters reckon . with its asynchronous moves in 2017 , the department of justice , which filed suit to block at&t - time warner , will be a major factor in 2018 on the deal front , as will the fcc . doug creutz , an analyst with cowen , issued a note just before christmas raising his price target on disney and predicting a final blessing by the doj . `` in most of the main areas where the doj could have an objection -- consolidation of tv studios , ownership of the regional sports networks , taking control of hulu -- we think disney has a fairly compelling pro-consumer argument to make , '' he wrote , compared to the comparatively `` vague '' assertions of at&t . ",
        "in one alarm bell that hollywood should heed , he added that the merger of the two film studios could be what gets tripped up by regulators given that disney and fox could control more than one-third of domestic grosses in a typical year . with pixar , marvel and lucasfilm already delivering best-in-class results , disney would likely agree with leaving the fox studio behind or allowing another buyer to snatch it up , he wrote . `` the film studio is far less crucial to disney 's ott plans and does n't offer them much that they do n't already do better .
