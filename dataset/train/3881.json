        "did the reagan-era tax cuts really lead to powerful gains in total u. s. economic output ? tom scott and mary-jane foster recall the reforms of 1981 and 1986 very differently . scott was a brash , 22-year-old college student from milford , swept into the state senate as a republican in 1980 , the year ronald reagan won the white house . he had worked for the reagan campaign and was itching for tax cuts . foster was living in fairfield , commuting to new york to appear in commercials and the occasional soap opera . the democrat later became a lawyer , developer and two-time candidate for mayor in bridgeport . ",
        "`` the taxes were so high at the federal level that there 's no doubt the tax cuts unleashed economic activity , '' said scott , a real estate broker . `` i do n't remember that things got better for the middle class and poorer people , '' said foster , who co-founded the bridgeport bluefish baseball team and developed the ballpark . as the most sweeping tax reform in 31 years works its way toward through congress for president donald trump to zealously sign , the reagan tax cuts of 1981 and reform of 1986 are widely viewed as a model . ",
        "economic growth spiked to a heady 7.3 percent in 1984 -- even after adjusting for inflation -- and stayed above 3 percent a year for seven years . by contrast , the last time the united states saw growth over 3 percent for a year was 2005 . but were the tax cuts the reason ? many people say yes , and supporters of trump 's cuts -- which would blow at least a $ 1 trillion hole in the federal budget -- are banking on it . in fact , there were numerous forces at work in the economy back in the '80s that combined to drive more production of goods and services . ",
        "most had nothing to do with the tax cuts . `` it really is pretty foolish to be drawing comparisons to today , '' said uconn economist fred v. carstensen , who called the trump cuts `` the biggest single threat '' to u. s. prosperity . `` we 're in a sweet spot in terms of the global economy , '' carstensen said . when it comes to tax changes , `` you should be doing nothing right now . '' `` it was a good time for fiscal stimulus when reagan started in 1981 , '' said jeffrey frankel , a professor at the kennedy school of government at harvard and former member of the white house council of economic advisers , who was a staff economist for the council in the reagan years . ",
        "`` this is a terrible time . '' frankel has written about big differences within the reforms of 1981 , 1986 and 2017 that make the current efforts less likely to spur growth . `` the truth is just tax policy alone does n't determine the course of the economy , '' he said . with that in mind , let 's look at eight factors that drove economic growth in the '80s -- which are not here today . 1 . baby boomers coming of agescott does n't like it , but he embodies part of the argument against the reagan tax cuts as the main driver of growth . ",
        "born in 1958 , he was in the peak years of the baby boom , a time when the labor force was not just expanding , but expanding with record numbers of college graduates -- eager , like him , to make a mark . that alone was reason for optimism . an analysis by joe wiesenthal at business insider shows that in 1981 , scott 's age group -- people age 20 to 24 -- represented 4.7 percent of the population , compared with a projected 3.2 percent in 2021 . there was plenty of money to pay for health and retirements for the world war ii generation as the older boomers reached peak earning years . ",
        "today , we have a shrinking labor force barely able to pay for the boomers ' retirements . 2 . oil prices fallingfoster remembers lines for gasoline in the late '70s that could last for hours . `` i remember vividly , setting the alarm in the middle of the night and then going to get gas , '' she said . prices were high and supplies low , and that mattered greatly to the u. s. economy as a net importer of oil . the barrel price hit an average of $ 111 in 1980 , adjusted to today 's dollar value . ",
        "it fell sharply to $ 31 by 1988 . today the price has been under $ 45 for three years and it 's way more likely to go up than down . 3 . military buildupfighting the cold war was the centerpiece of reagan 's foreign policy and that meant huge spending in the '80s , nowhere more than connecticut . today 's pentagon outlays remain high and trump promises to boost spending , but the percentage gains are not likely to match reagan 's -- and that paid for massive job totals at plants and bases . 4 . ",
        "falling interest rates and the housing boommodern america has never seen interest rates and inflation as high as they were just before reagan took office . as borrowing rates fell back to normal , and as the boomers nested , we had a virtuous housing boom that drove construction and consumer spending . foster had children in 1984 and 1987 , and remembers many families with four or more kids . today we have exactly the opposite of what reagan inherited : near-historic lows in interest rates and a healthy housing market . as interest rates rise to ward off inflation -- all the more because of these cuts -- can we count on a millennial generation that 's not showing much enthusiasm for homebuying as they 're forced to spend more on mortgages with fewer tax deductions ? ",
        "um ... no. 5 . cuts to high top tax ratesthe main course of reagan 's cuts was a reduction of the highest marginal tax rates from 70 percent down to , eventually , 36 percent . that 's huge , as scott pointed out . so if the reagan tax reforms drove growth at all , it was because of that . today the highest rate is 39 percent , which most economists agree is not a big drag on activity . and even if it does unlock new investment , `` unfortunately , there is no evidence that supports cutting the taxes of the companies or the wealthy result in trickling down to the lower and middle class , '' said kathi mettler , an accounting professor at fairfield university . ",
        "6 . corporate cash crunchcoming off the brutal economy of the '70s and the 1981 recession , with high interest rates , companies were hardly in position to invest . any money that came their way through tax cuts was far more likely to see its way to more hiring and equipment purchases . today , the standard & poor 's 500 companies are sitting on record or near-record cash hordes . `` profit share of national income is way up and investment spending is down , '' frankel said , even with all that cash . `` they 're already using the cash to pay out high dividends and to increase share buybacks and executive compensation . '' ",
        "as for the trump tax cuts for corporations , the centerpiece of the 2017 plan , `` those are n't direct incentives to invest like an investment tax credit , '' frankel said . 7 . desktops and networking for his 1986 re-election , scott bought an early campaign management program called hannibal and a computer to run it . the system let him and his volunteers track voters by house and generate targeted mail . it was part of the boom in desktop computing and networked mainframes , which companies added almost universally . whether that drove economic growth in the '80s is a matter of debate , as , frankel said , the joke is that computers were showing up everywhere except the productivity numbers . ",
        "but at the least , the computer boom ignited an industry and drove a stock market run-up . today , many tech firms are maturing rather than coming of age . 8 . falling unemploymentreagan had to tackle a recession-era jobless rate of 10 percent when he took office . whether the tax cuts helped bring unemployment back to normal levels is again a matter of debate , but economic output and added jobs fed on each other . today we 're at or near full employment , so we are n't going to see an output boom from the tax cuts unless we see more workers . ",
        "unfortunately , they were n't born 20 years ago and trump 's republicans wo n't let them into the country from elsewhere -- killing the only hope for 4 percent growth . dhaar@hearstmediact . com .   "
