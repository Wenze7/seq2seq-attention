        "sacramento -- the new year is bringing a new area code to the sacramento region . and those new digits will mean more dialing . starting this year , the 279 area code will be overlayed into 916 area code territory . christine mccall has lived here for two decades . `` and it seems like its kind of crazy , '' mccall said . `` i mean , it 's kind of like dialing a long distance number , and you know , which it 's not . '' everyone calling within the sacramento region will now need to dial the area code with each call -- dial ten digits or your call will be dropped . ",
        "`` i think its kind of crazy , '' mccall said . the new ten-digit calls will also require re-programming of cell phones with stored numbers and reprogramming of services tied to phone numbers like life-safety systems , medical monitoring systems , security systems , and fire and burglar alarms . tim sproul owns and operates the 911 dispatch center for more than a hundred alarm companies at total monitoring systems and says thousands of customers will be affected . `` if their panel is n't updated or replaced , they 're going to find out they no longer have protection , '' sproul said . ",
        "the california public utilities commission announced the new area code in 2017 and began dispersing new 279 area code numbers to customers in september who requested new phone numbers . the new 10-digit dialing process will be mandatory starting in february of 2018 .   "
