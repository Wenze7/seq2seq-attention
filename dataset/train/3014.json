        "`` in many ways , we are flying blind in our discussions about artificial intelligence and lack the data we need to credibly evaluate activity . '' credit : unsplash/paul smithsince the term `` artificial intelligence '' was first used in print in 1956 , the one-time science fiction fantasy has progressed to the very real prospect of driverless cars , smartphones that recognize complex spoken commands and computers that see . in an effort to track the progress of this emerging field , a stanford-led group of leading ai thinkers called the ai100 has launched an index that will provide a comprehensive baseline on the state of artificial intelligence and measure technological progress in the same way the gross domestic product and the s&p 500 index track the u. s. economy and the broader stock market . ",
        "`` the ai100 effort realized that in order to supplement its regular review of ai , a more continuous set of collected metrics would be incredibly useful , '' said russ altman , a professor of bioengineering and the faculty director of ai100 . `` we were very happy to seed the ai index , which will inform the ai100 as we move forward . `` the ai100 was set in motion three years ago when eric horvitz , a stanford alumnus and former president of the association for the advancement of artificial intelligence , worked with his wife , mary horvitz , to define and endow the long-term study . ",
        "its first report , released in the fall of 2016 , sought to anticipate the likely effects of ai in an urban environment in the year 2030 . among the key findings in the new index are a dramatic increase in ai startups and investment as well as significant improvements in the technology 's ability to mimic human performance . baseline metricsthe ai index tracks and measures at least 18 independent vectors in academia , industry , open-source software and public interest , plus technical assessments of progress toward what the authors call `` human-level performance '' in areas such as speech recognition , question-answering and computer vision -- algorithms that can identify objects and activities in 2-d images . ",
        "specific metrics in the index include evaluations of academic papers published , course enrollment , ai-related startups , job openings , search-term frequency and media mentions , among others . `` the goal of the ai index is to provide a fact-based measuring stick against which we can chart progress and fuel a deeper conversation about the future of the field , '' shoham said . shoham conceived of the index and assembled a steering committee including ray perrault from sri international , erik brynjolfsson of the massachusetts institute of technology and jack clark from openai . the committee subsequently hired calvin legassick as project manager . ",
        "`` the ai index will succeed only if it becomes a community effort , '' shoham said . although the authors say the ai index is the first index to track either scientific or technological progress , there are many other non-financial indexes that provide valuable insight into equally hard-to-quantify fields . examples include the social progress index , the middle east peace index and the bangladesh empowerment index , which measure factors as wide-ranging as nutrition , sanitation , workload , leisure time , public sentiment and even public speaking opportunities . intriguing findingsamong the findings of this inaugural index is that the number of active ai startups has increased 14-fold since 2000 . ",
        "venture capital investment has increased six times in the same period . in academia , publishing in ai has increased a similarly impressive nine times in the last 20 years while course enrollment has soared . enrollment in the introductory ai-related machine learning course at stanford , for instance , has grown 45-fold in the last 30 years . in technical metrics , image and speech recognition are both approaching , if not surpassing , human-level performance . the authors noted that ai systems have excelled in such real-world applications as object detection , the ability to understand and answer questions and classification of photographic images of skin cancer cells . ",
        "shoham noted that the report is still very u. s.-centric and will need a greater international presence as well as a greater diversity of voices . he said he also sees opportunities to fold in government and corporate investment in addition to the venture capital funds that are currently included . in terms of human-level performance , the ai index suggests that in some ways ai has already arrived . this is true in game-playing applications including chess , the jeopardy! game show and , most recently , the game of go . nonetheless , the authors note that computers continue to lag considerably in the ability to generalize specific information into deeper meaning . ",
        "`` ai has made truly amazing strides in the past decade , '' shoham said , `` but computers still ca n't exhibit the common sense or the general intelligence of even a 5-year-old . `` provided by stanford universitythis story is republished courtesy and copyrighted by phys . org , a popular site that covers news about science research . read the original article .
