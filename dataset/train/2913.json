        "on october 31 , khun mongkol antachai found 15 black slug like worms eating a snail at the backyard of his home . he wondered what it is and posted them on facebook asking for advice . a conservationist known as khun yingyos larpeong then replied that it seemed most likely to be new guinea flatworm . he then went to the poster 's home along with another expert in biodiversity to collect sample of the worm for examination and later confirmed it is the new guinea flatworm . what is a new guinea worm ? the new guinea worm , also known as platydemus manokwari , is a species of large predatory parasites originated from papua new guinea . ",
        "this flatworm is relatively large , about 4 -- 6 cm in length and about 0.4 -- 0.7 cm wide . its body however , is quite flat , being less than 2 mm in thickness . both ends of the animal are pointedwith two eyes near the tip of the head end . it is dark brown on the upper surface , with a lighter central line . the underside is pale grey or near white . it is one of the 100 worst invasive parasites in the world . they have been known to feed on mainly land snails and various soil invertebrates , such as earthworms , slugs , and arthropods . ",
        "why is it dangerous ? it reproduces like crazy and eats not only snails but earthworms and slugs thus affecting the eco system . the worm does n't even need a mate to reproduce . a single worm can quickly turn into dozens . it will be grown into two separate individuals if cut into half . goo is highly acidic to humans and causes burning sensation so you should never touch them with your hands . the worm also carries a parasite known as rat lungworm . this parasite is easily passed onto humans whic can then cause severe meningitis -- swelling of the brain and spinal cord . ",
        "what do you do when you spot a guinea worm ? take a photo of the worm and send it to the thai organisation siamensis through facebook page of siamensis . org or to line id @sde5284v to verify and also to allow the department to keep a record on the growth and manifestation of the parasite . kill the worm by pouring hot water over it or using salt . remember ! do not smash or cut it . check around the surrounding of your home or premises if there are more . precautions to be made : watch out for contaminated water .
