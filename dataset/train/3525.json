        "these days our toothbrushes are no longer just bristles placed onto a plastic handle , and have become hi-tech devices that can tell where we 're brushing our teeth , for how long , and spots that we might have missed . if you 're looking to upgrade your toothbrush game , colgate has you covered . announced at ces this week , the company has unveiled its smart electronic toothbrush e1 which features integration with apple 's researchkit . for those unfamiliar , researchkit is a framework developed by apple that allows developers and researchers to create apps that they can then use for medical research . ",
        "by integrating researchkit into the e1 toothbrush , colgate is essentially trying to crowdsource data on toothbrushing , which in turn helps them `` get even smarter '' about oral care and for `` fast future innovation '' . other than that , the e1 will come with features that you would find on other smart toothbrushes , such as real-time feedback on your brushing habits via an accompanying smartphone app . interestingly enough colgate 's ai technology in the toothbrush was developed in partnership with kolibree , who recently launched an ar-based toothbrush of their own . for those who would like to get their hands on the e1 , it is available exclusively via apple 's online and retail stores where it is priced at $ 99.95 .
