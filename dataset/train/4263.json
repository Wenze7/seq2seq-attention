        "apple has a response of sorts to activist shareholders concerned about kids ' addiction to iphones : enhanced parental controls are coming to ios . ahead of apple 's annual shareholder meeting next month , jana partners and the california state teachers ' retirement system asked apple this week for new software to let parents limit kids ' iphone use , and to conduct a study on the effects of excessive phone use on mental health . with roughly $ 2 billion in apple stock , jana and calstrs were able to get apple 's attention , leading the company to issue a statement reproduced in full below . ",
        "in short , apple states that it has `` always looked out for kids , '' leads the industry in os-level parental controls , and thinks `` deeply about how our products are used and the impact they have . '' without providing any details or committing to the mental health study , apple says that it has `` new features and enhancements planned for the future , to add functionality and make these tools even more robust . '' the issue of iphone addiction -- and portable device addiction in general -- has been in the background for years , but recently benefitted from additional attention . ",
        "as noted in an earlier reuters report , former disney star selena gomez revealed that she 'd cancelled a tour due to depression brought on by social media addiction , and a 2016 survey suggested that half of teenagers felt addicted to their mobile phones , and were pressured to immediately respond to phone messages . the issue of how much parents should control their kids ' viewing habits -- and thus their kids -- has continued to percolate in popular media such as the tv show black mirror , without reaching a conclusive answer . enhanced parental controls are likely to offer only a partial solution to the issues raised by jana and calstrs . ",
        "present ios controls , found in the general > restrictions section of settings , include a collection of switches to disable web browsing , camera and facetime functionality , file sharing , siri , the news app , and various types of media acquisition . parents can also prevent ios devices from displaying content with explicit language , sexual content , or programs limited by age-specific ratings across movies , tv shows , and apps . what ios 's parental controls do not enable are meaningful time limits or granular oversight over specific pieces of content displayed on the device . ",
        "a guided access feature enables the device as a whole to be time limited for accessibility or gallery purposes , but not with separate times for separate apps . similarly , parents can not easily screen or approve of web content that might skirt certain rules ; they can either whitelist a narrow collection of sites one at a time , or blacklist `` adult content . '' perhaps most importantly , stronger parental controls wo n't address underlying issues such as the erosion of in-person socialization and lowering of self-esteem currently being caused in part by social media . ",
        "any major improvement to the parental controls in ios is unlikely to debut until at least june , when apple holds its annual worldwide developers conference , and could come later given the company 's standard development cycles for new features . the lag also gives apple plenty of time to undertake a mental health study for kids , should it want to . apple 's full statement is as follows : apple has always looked out for kids , and we work hard to create powerful products that inspire , entertain , and educate children while also helping parents protect them online . ",
        "we lead the industry by offering intuitive parental controls built right into the operating system . with today 's ios devices , parents have the ability to control and restrict content including apps , movies , websites , songs and books , as well as cellular data , password settings and other features . effectively anything a child could download or access online can be easily blocked or restricted by a parent . we began delivering these controls for iphone in 2008 with the introduction of the app store , building on what we 'd learned from offering similar features for the mac a few years before iphone was introduced . ",
        "we also have a long history of curating our content platforms to make sure they are free of offensive material , such as pornography , and clearly labeled so parents can determine if an app , movie or song is age-appropriate . of course , we are constantly looking for ways to make our experiences better . we have new features and enhancements planned for the future , to add functionality and make these tools even more robust . we think deeply about how our products are used and the impact they have on users and the people around them . ",
        "we take this responsibility very seriously and we are committed to meeting and exceeding our customers ' expectations , especially when it comes to protecting kids .   "
