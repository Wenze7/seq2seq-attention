        "it 's not all bad news for liverpool fans - the club have announced anyone with a philippe coutinho shirt will be eligible £ 50 compensation . liverpool and barcelona finally agreed a deal worth up to £ 142million for the player on saturday evening with the brazilian set to be unveiled officially shortly . the reds say they will give a voucher to supporters who forked out for this season 's shirt with the midfielder 's name and number printed on the back . a club statement said : `` the offer - which applies to all shirts purchased in official club outlets and via the official lfc website - follows today 's announcement that coutinho will join fc barcelona and reflects the exceptional circumstances behind the player 's departure . ",
        "`` liverpool boss jurgen klopp stressed the club had done everything possible to persuade coutinho to remain at anfield , but revealed the player had been `` desperate '' to move to barcelona since july . `` it is with great reluctance that we - as a team and club - prepare to say farewell to a good friend , a wonderful person and a fantastic player in philippe coutinho , '' he told the club 's official website . `` it is no secret that philippe has wanted this move to happen since july , when barcelona first made their interest known . ",
        "`` philippe was insistent with me , the owners and even his team-mates this was a move he was desperate to make happen . despite that , we managed to keep the player here beyond the summer window , hoping that we would be able to persuade him to stay and be part of what we are looking to do . `` i can tell the liverpool supporters that we , as a club , have done everything within our means to convince philippe that remaining part of liverpool was as attractive as moving to spain , but he is 100 per cent certain his future - and that of his family - belongs at barcelona . ",
        "coutinho will soon be confirmed as a barcelona player `` it is his dream and i am now convinced there is nothing left at our disposal to change his mind . philippe has made a fantastic contribution to this club over his five years of service and as disappointed as we are that he does n't want to extend that , the relationship we have for him means , with a heavy heart , we wish him well .
