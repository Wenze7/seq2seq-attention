        "the one glaring hole in chelsea 's squad at the moment is a viable backup and challenger for marcos alonso at left back . it 's a role that 's filled by kenedy at the moment , but he 's simply making up numbers in the most perfunctory way possible and is unlikely to play outside of cup competitions . he may or may not be off to newcastle united on loan anyway . despite his general lack of usefulness , that loan move will depend on chelsea 's ability to secure some sort of token backup for alonso at least -- just as in the summer , when kenedy 's move away fell through in the final days . ",
        "while juventus ' alex sandro remains the supposed dream , his transfer fee , whatever outrageous amount it may be right now , does n't really fit with chelsea 's general january m. o . the blues have not spent big in january since acquiring fernando torres and david luiz in 2011 , and are once again unlikely to make a big splash . a potential solution that would allow kenedy to leave on loan and save chelsea some money is to give baba rahman a second chance -- provided he 's recovered from his acl injury that he suffered almost a year ago . ",
        "while the 23-year-old has been steadily linked with a return to schake 04 on loan , a report from the mail claims that he 's actually `` pushing '' for consideration by conte at chelsea first and foremost . there are a couple details in the report that do n't quite sound right -- baba training with the first-team since october would be a new fact for us , for example -- but otherwise it sounds like a reasonable aim from the former bundesliga standout . in conte 's first summer , baba was deemed not quite good enough defensively at full back , but the system 's been changed to be able to accommodate attacking wing-back options on the left flank like baba -- or kenedy for that matter , or pedro at times , or even the rumored thomas lemar , who 's more of an attacking midfielder but can play as a winger of sorts . ",
        "if baba is healthy enough to play , we could do worse than giving him the chance to impress and make an impact .   "
