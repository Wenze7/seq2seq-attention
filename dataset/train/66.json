        "by priyale chandrafinance minister arun jaitley has recently announced the introduction of electoral bonds , in order to create transparency in electoral financing . he claims that these bonds ` will substantially cleanse the system ' . what are electoral bonds ? functioning like a promissory note , these bonds can only be availed through select state bank of india outlets for 10 days each in january , april , july , and october . valid only for 15 days , these bonds can be cashed in only by the registered political parties , through an account verified by the election commission . ",
        "the bonds will be available in multiples of ₹ 1,000 , ₹ 10,000 , ₹ 1 lakh , ₹ 10 lakh and ₹ 1 crore . the bonds will not carry the name of the bearer . while the purchaser will have to fill in the know your customer details , they will remain anonymous . eventually , the parties will cash in the bonds and submit their account details to the election commission . what is the rationale behind this move ? electoral bonds were first announced in the 2017-2018 budget speech . they are the latest in a series of moves implemented by mr jaitley to curb the incidence of black money in political funding . ",
        "earlier , he had banned cash donations over ₹ 2,000 for the purpose of political campaigning and also introduced a mechanism of online donations to political parties . presently , most of the funding to political parties is through cash donations . the move is believed to reduce dependence on cash donations and also ensure transparency in the funding of political parties . this measure is linked to the initiative of the government to fight corruption and seize black money . how effective is this measure ? reading through the fine print of this measure , it becomes clear that the move is not actually reformative . ",
        "not just individuals , but non-governmental organisations and corporate companies can also buy these bonds . there are neither checks nor a system of balances in place to verify the details of the donors . the only place where the donation will be reflected is in the bank statement of the donor . it is nearly impossible to recheck the balance sheets of individual donors or companies to detect incidences of impropriety . this loophole reflects the possibility of black money entering the system through shell companies . while arun jaitley argues that making the donor details public might force the entire arrangement once again to shift to cash , there is virtually no guarantee that anonymous donations through electoral bonds will ensure a cleaner system . ",
        "there is also a matter of corporate donors . corporate companies are believed to be one of the biggest donors to political parties . the introduction of electoral bonds does not ensure any added scrutiny to political funding . what it does provide is an obfuscation about donors in the form of a new means of political funding . featured image source : flickr .
