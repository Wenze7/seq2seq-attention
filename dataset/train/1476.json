        "new orleans -- the jets wide receiving duo of jermaine kearse and robby anderson were rolling until they ran right into a roadblock last week in denver . now , can they stop it from happening again in new orleans ? anderson and kearse each had back-to-back 100-yard receiving games against the panthers and chiefs . last week in denver , anderson had three catches for 27 yards and kearse had one catch for 4 yards as the jets ' offense fell apart . kearse credited the broncos ' scheme with taking them out of the game . `` they definitely had a plan , whether that 's bracketing , putting a safety over the top , '' kearse said . ",
        "`` they had a plan and you have to take your hat off to them . they executed well . i think the biggest thing for us is just being able to adjust , whether that 's during the game and throughout the week . we do n't know if we 're going to see the same thing , but we have to be ready if it does happen . '' you would think the jets ' opponents moving forward would copy what the broncos did to take the two wideouts away . every team does not have a duo like chris harris and aqib talib at cornerback , so it is not that easy . ",
        "but expect teams to pay a lot of attention to them . complicating matters is they will now be playing with backup quarterback bryce petty , who acknowledged his biggest issue last week was timing with the receivers . the receivers have worked this week before , during and after practice on getting the timing of their routes down with petty . if there was one bright spot in last week 's 23-0 loss to the broncos it was eric tomlinson stepping in as the backup long snapper and did not have any bad snaps in seven punts . the tight end replaced thomas hennessy , who suffered a concussion in the first quarter . ",
        "`` seven punts with a backup long snapper , i do n't know how often that 's been done , '' special teams coordinator brant boyer said . `` give tomlinson the purple heart of the week and he did a hell of a job . it was awesome to see and it 's funny because when i walked up to him i said , ` hey , man you 're up . ' and typical tomlinson , he looked up at me and said , ` i got you boyer , ' and gives me knuckles . he 's that kind of guy , though , so he was great . '' "
