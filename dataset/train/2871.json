        "a us federal judge on saturday lifted trump administration restrictions that barred some refugees from the country , the latest in a series of immigration-related legal setbacks for the president . the united states said in october that it would resume accepting refugees after a 120-day ban ordered by president donald trump expired , but some -- including those from 11 `` high-risk '' countries , most of which are muslim majority -- were still barred from entering . in his ruling on saturday , judge james robart ordered american authorities to resume processing and admitting so-called `` follow-to-join '' refugees , which would once again allow the spouse and unmarried children of a refugee already in the country to be admitted . ",
        "and he also ordered that `` follow-to-join '' refugees and `` other refugees with a bona fide relationship to a person or entity within the united states '' from the 11 `` high-risk '' countries be processed and admitted as well . the ruling is in response to motions for preliminary injunctions filed in two separate cases . `` plaintiffs in both cases are refugees , who find themselves in dire circumstances , their family members who yearn to be reunited with them , and humanitarian organizations whose fundamental mission is to help these vulnerable refugees resettle in the united states , '' robart wrote in his ruling . ",
        "`` plaintiffs in both cases present compelling circumstances of irreparable harm inflicted by the federal agencies ' action at issue here . `` trump 's attempts at banning travelers from several mainly muslim nations have been met with successive legal challenges this year . critics say the president 's measures target muslims , while the trump administration has sought to cast the restrictions as being aimed at shoring up security .
