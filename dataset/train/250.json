        "there 's a feeling i get before cliff diving . my heart pumps in volumes , my mind flutters in indecision and possible outcomes , and my toes wiggling to grip the earth in anticipation . one deep breathe and bam ! breaking the surface only lasts a moment and the immersion is beyond thrilling . you dive deep until your body just ca n't take anymore -- and then its back for air . looking back -- this is what it felt like to create the wanderjaunt logo . its easy to enough to say in words what we do -- `` we create hassle-free , inspired solutions for hospitality and property management . '' ",
        "creating a symbol to encapsulate this and our personality ? quite the ride . there really was n't much to work with as far a as a company backstory . the founders had chosen the company name with the intent of securing an original domain for a website before the good ones were taken . the thesaurus was a big player in birth of wanderjaunt . wander : walk or move in a leisurely , casual , or aimless way . jaunt : a short excursion or journey for pleasure . sure , it sounds a little quirky . however , it does communicate that we want you to get out there an another vacation , does n't it ? ",
        "we tried many things to get to where we are today . we knew we wanted to do something off the beaten path , something that would make you say , `` what is that , i want to know more '' ... deep dive # 1 : we have liftoff ! my sketches began with hot air balloons -- the thinking was that the leisure and adventure of the activity could lend itself to our purposes . we also explored traditional imagery like keys , doors , and winding paths but none spoke to us with the right voice . ",
        "deep dive # 2 : just right ? at my wit 's end by week 2 , i asked my coworker to throw me a new perspective to try on for the weekend . he brought up the story of goldilocks and the 3 bears and how she tried various things but only found one that was `` just right '' . similarly , wanderjaunt was the `` just right '' between a hotel experience and a traditional airbnb . what manifested was many sketches and vectors that looked just too similar to the starbucks mermaid . deep dive # 3 : hold the door ! ",
        "back to the drawing board , i explored abstract depictions of houses , playing with the initials , and wandering lines . it was one of these squiggles that caught a team member 's eye and led to these iterations that really felt good ... . at this point , two weeks had passed and i was coming to the end of my personal deadline for this project . i felt like we had exhausted every possibility and that my brain was mush -- but something just was n't right about this version ... our whole team was n't completely on board with the idea either . ",
        "our two guru interior designers insisted that we spend one more day exploring the logo . the problem was that this version may have been dynamic , but it felt trapped and was not strong enough to stand alone . deep dive # 4 : seeing starswhat if we focused on the asterisk from the last design ? after all , it was a recognizable symbol that related to our technology aspect and communicated a sense of here-ness and delight . to our dismay at the end of our extra day , using just the asterisk turned out to be quite unoriginal . ",
        "deep dive # 5 : never give upi gave myself one more day to work on the logo -- we had to get it right . we thought to combine imagery of the asterisk and a path from our previous iterations . the path created a sense of ease and conveyed that `` all paths led to wanderjaunt '' . together , the image looks like a zesty orange , or a mountain peak where i want to go . this finally felt right , with our slogan being `` get out there '' . the mark is also simple enough to give it dynamic movement -- imagine the pathway forming around the asterisk or the asterisk growing until it bursts ! ",
        "this is exactly what we wanted -- something simple , flexible , expressive , and bold . the road was long , but i will say that going with our guts and not settling for less paid off well during this challenge . i thought for a minute there the blue squiggle had it in the bag as our logo , but i am so happy we took the extra time because the end result is something we can all be really proud of .
