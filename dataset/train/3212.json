        "' t is the season of giving , and ' t is the season for new television series . on thursday , mediaworks announced it was making a new season of dancing with the stars . the ballroom dance competition show 's previous series have produced some iconic kiwi tv moments . who could forget rodney hide dropping his partner ? or the furore when dom harvey took a picture of chrystal chenery 's crotch when she was performing ? we 've put together a list of notable new zealanders we 'd love to see on the show . let 's hope mediaworks has embraced the giving spirit . ",
        "jason gunn jason gunn is this nation 's foster father , grandfather to some . does this mean he will be a great dancer ? no . he will probably suck . seeing him dance every few nights on television will make new zealand collectively squirm . this does n't mean he should n't be on the show . every time jason gunn disappears from the nation 's consciousness , something bad happens . he 's fallen off a wheelie bin , been treated by a vet and had a heart attack . we need to keep an eye on mr gunn . ",
        "it 's time to return him to his comfort zone of cringey reality television so he can get back to inflicting dad humour on the nation . at least then we wo n't have to worry if anyone 's checked in on jason gunn . - glenn mcconnell james rolleston he 's already shown chardonnay `` some of those michael jackson moves '' in boy , but it would be pretty cool to see james rolleston on the dancefloor for the revamp . not for a nostalgia thing , you understand . but given the actor 's had a rough time after a car crash in july 2016 in opotiki which affected both his movement and his speech , there would be something admirable about seeing him impressing on the stage - even though one suspects it would take a lot of work . ",
        "everyone loves a comeback kid and there 's no denying that everyone loves james and wants the best for him - and i ca n't think of any better spotlight or inspiring tale than this one for the nation to view . - darren bevan trevor mallard when parliament 's new speaker sits in his big sheepskin-covered chair getting increasingly excited , a bit of spittle gathers at the corner of his mouth . labour 's former attack dog trevor mallard looks like he needs a bigger yard . now imagine what happens to the feet of the former mp for hutt south when he hears a beat . ",
        "the dramatic essence of reality tv is surely lying dormant in the limbs of the long-time mp . mallard is obviously a passionate man . readers may remember that time when he got into a fight with his political rival tau henare . it was a most unparliamentary scuffle but , while a bit of biffo is certainly not to be condoned , perhaps the man from wainuiomata has just the kind of fancy footwork demanded for dancing with the stars . - caron copek luke cederman there was almost no way his first turn on kiwi telly could have gone any worse , but from mediaworks ' stable of ex-reality stars , married at first sight 's first single groom luke cederman would make a tall , handsome - and bearded - addition to the celeb line-up . ",
        "he 's a surfer , so surely there 's some co-ordination there and he 's used to working really hard in front of the cameras to get people/wives to like him , so why not prove ex lacey right ? get out there and launch your comedy career on the dancefloor while wearing a lot of lycra and sequins , luke . the cha-cha has never been so funny . added bonus : we all know dwts is often the breeding-ground for off-screen romance - so reality television might mean love for luke after all . - bridget jones gareth morgan if there 's one thing we know about old mate gareth , it 's that he just loves opportunities . ",
        "well , here 's one for ya : dancing with the stars . let 's face it , gareth : you need an image makeover . the whole curmudgeonly , cat-hating demagogue thing just is n't working . if you want to lead the opportunities party to victory in 2020 , you need to change the way the public thinks about you . what better way to introduce the nation to `` fun gareth '' than dtws ? it worked for rodney hide , right ? right ? the show is also judged by public vote and , let 's face it , you kind of need some practice at that . ",
        "if all else fails , you can instantly earn the nation 's pity by getting dom harvey to take a photo of your crotch . pity-votes are better than no votes , right ? right ? - jack van beynen melanie bracewell melanie bracewell describes herself as `` the laugh giraffe '' and if i 'm going to be forced to watch another dancing reality television show then i want to watch that , a laughing giraffe . not only is bracewell hilarious on the internet , she 's also really funny on stage and would give dancing with the stars just the sort of balance it needs . ",
        "though i 'm not entirely sure how much balance bracewell would have . she seems to have two left feet that are reminiscent of a giraffe when it 's first born - like kind of awkward so she might be a bit of a hot mess - which is cool because she has that cute dorkiness about her that would make her a crowd pleaser , much like tim shadbolt , the mayor of invercargill was in the first season . imagine bracewell slamming her foot down for the tango , then spinning herself around and giving you the look of delirious death . ",
        "that would be sensational . - dani mcdonald the mad butcher the arctic monkeys were n't thinking of mangere 's finest charcutier when they opined `` i bet you look good on the dancefloor '' . age and ailments suggest peter leitch might not be the sharpest mover on the parquet , but he can trade mobility for experience , enthusiasm and knowledge of smallgoods retail , and that sounds a winning combination for me . the audience-voting element would surely work in his favour and while he no longer owns the franchise , the prospect of him persuading the new owner , son-in-law mike morton , to throw a celebratory special on his barbecue pork sausages should he win would be a powerful incentive for the viewers to vote the right way .
