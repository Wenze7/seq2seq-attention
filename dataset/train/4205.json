        "avoid or lessen rsi , carpel tunnel syndrome and more with these ergonomically-minded gadgetsergonomic mice are the perfect investment if you 're starting to feel strain in your hand , wrist or shoulder . rsi often develops in the wrist and tendons of the hand if you 're using a standard mouse too often , but that positioning can often travel right up to your shoulder . when this happens , it 's time to give your rodent peripheral an upgrade and head into the world of vertical mice . these models differ in shape , size and design , but the general principle is the same - shift your hands , wrist and shoulder into a more natural ` handshake position ' . ",
        "this is a far more natural position , and , since these devices are designed to maintain full agency , you 'll still be able to work , surf and game just like you were before . one of the more expensive models on our list , the dxt dxt02w offers a design that 's ideal for both left and right-handed users . it 's not the most attractive of looking vertical mice we 've seen , but it makes up for it on the feature front . it has four adjustable dpi settings - from 500 all the way up to 2,000 - and comes with a rather handy rapid charge that offers two hours of juice on just 30 seconds of charge . ",
        "it 's also ideal for both small and larger handed users , so practically anyone can start benefiting from its ergonomic design . the r-go 1200 dpi oyster wireless mouse is easily the most expensive vertical mouse on our 2018 list , but being on the premium end of the spectrum means you 're getting the very best features to help reduce your risk or symptoms of rsi . the ultra-adjustable base can be moved from left to right so any user can make the most of it , while its angle can also be customised , enabling everything from a traditional position to a vertical-style ` handshake ' version . ",
        "it 's also wireless , and offers up to 30 days use on a single charge . while the wireless versions of the adesso imouse e9 will set you back around £ 70 , the wired ones are a third of the price and just as packed with features . it comes in models for either right or left-handed users , and has four dpi settings as high as 2,400 . it 's precise enough for office work , and with two buttons for dedicated internet navigation the imouse e9 also works well when surfing at home . its optical tracking can work on almost any surface , so you wo n't even need a mousepad to use it . ",
        "another mouse designed to take advantage of that unusual ` handshake ' design , this model from anker can take a little while to get used to . however , one you adapt its hard to go back to a normal mouse , especially if you suffer from one form of rsi or another . you get five buttons , all of which are easy to access , while its single dpi setting still manages to offer a precise and accurate signal . we would n't recommend it for gaming , but it 's ideal for basic office use and surfing . ",
        "one of the most affordable mice on this year 's list , the lugulake does its best to offer mid-range features into a model very much at the lower end of the vertical mouse price spectrum . it 's build can feel a little flimsy , but it 's an issue that 's well addressed by the comfortable ` handshake ' design . it only has a single dpi setting and while that does seem a little constrictive , it still performs well for both office work and home surfing . it 's a little on the large side , but that size does help with elevating your wrist . ",
        "if you 're looking to reduce rci strain on a budget , but want to avoid investing in a gimmick knock off , then you 're in the market for a 2.4 g ergonomic wireless vertical mouse from havit . it packs an impressive number of features into its sub £ 20 price tag , including a comfortable curved design , three dpi settings and six buttons . each one is ideally placed , although its finish can get a little slippy . it 's also a tad light for a vertical mouse , but at this price , these are relatively small concessions . ",
        "evoluent is one of the market leaders in vertical mice , so it only seems fitting to feature one of its most popular models in our list of ergonomic rodents . it 's a wireless setup , and it 's a strong signal too , so there 's no need to worry about it cutting out while you 're clicking away in the office . it comes with six programmable buttons , which is perfect if you do a job of a repetitive nature , while its high profile shape and curved thumb rest makes it both comfortable and less strenuous on your poor appendage . ",
        "this relatively new model from jelly comb aims to offer a gaming mouse that 's both versatile and ergonomically-minded . while not as precise as regular gaming mice , it does come with plenty of dpi settings and also works really well as an office-based peripheral or as a tool for more casual surfing . the contoured shaped is nothing revolutionary , but it 's still very comfortable , and the matte finish offers plenty of grip when you 're sweating through a long gaming session . one of the taller and heftier models on our list , this model from jtd is ideally suited to users with much larger hands . ",
        "it comes with a removable palm rest so you support the elevated position of your hand , which works well with the more natural ` handshake ' design . it comes with three adjustable dpi settings that go all the way up to 1,600 , so you 'll have plenty of precision . however , despite its looks , this vertical mouse is office and casual surfing only . if you 're looking for something game-friendly , you 'll need to look elsewhere . why not check out ... 7 ways to get a better night 's sleep and wake up feeling refreshed .
