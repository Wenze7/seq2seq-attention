        "is it too late to get a flu shot ? we know you 've been busy making plans for the holidays , scrambling to find the perfect gift for everyone on your list , spending time in airports and on road trips to see family and friends . but the holiday season is over and it 's time to get back to reality . the flu season is most certainly upon us . and you need to deal with it . during the last week of 2017 , `` influenza activity increased sharply in the united states , '' according to the centers for disease control and prevention . ",
        "outpatient visits to doctors and other medical professionals by people suffering from influenza-like illnesses were above normal baseline levels in every region of the country , the cdc reported . and among the 54 jurisdictions in the flu surveillance system , 50 reported `` regional '' or `` widespread '' flu activity at the end of last year . california is one of 26 states with `` high '' flu activity , the cdc says . california is one of 26 states with `` high '' flu activity . centers for disease control and preventionso far this flu season , at least 3,927 people have been sent to the hospital with laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza . ",
        "one child was confirmed to have died of the flu during the last week of 2017 . the most recent statistics that include adults were from the week that ended dec. . 16 , when 6.7 % of deaths reported to the national center for health statistics were attributed to influenza and pneumonia . the good news , according to health experts , is that it 's not too late to reduce your risk by getting a flu shot . the cdc recommends a flu shot for everyone over the age of 6 months , unless you have a specific medical reason to skip it . ",
        "only shots are advised this year . the flumist nasal vaccine offered in the past has not been very effective against h1n1 strains in recent years , so the cdc says it `` should not be used . '' you may have heard that the flu that 's doing the most damage this year is an h3n2 strain , and that it is less vulnerable to the vaccine . that 's true . but public health experts still say that an imperfect flu shot is better than no flu shot . and since the flu season could last well into march or april , there 's still plenty of time for it to make a difference . ",
        "the flu may not sound like a big deal , but if you 've ever had it , you know it can make you feel miserable . if you 're lucky , you may have mild symptoms like a cough and a runny nose . but you can also wind up with a bad fever , chills and more serious complications like pneumonia , bronchitis and sinus infections . if you 've heard that the flu shot might actually give you the flu , rest assured that 's impossible . the vaccine is made from an inactivated virus . it 's able to prompt your immune system to make antibodies against the flu , so it 's ready in case you encounter the real the thing . ",
        "but the shot itself ca n't infect you . it does take a couple of weeks for those antibodies to develop , so some people may get sick soon after getting the shot . but that does n't mean the shot made them sick , according to experts at harvard medical school . that just means those people waited too long to get vaccinated . the harvard folks also debunked nine other flu myths here . already got your flu shot ? there 's still more you can do . the cdc asks everyone to fight back against influenza by helping prevent the spread of germs in general . ",
        "that means washing your hands , using a hand sanitizer , and coughing or sneezing into a tissue or the inside of your arm . also , if your doctor prescribes an antiviral medication like tamiflu , relenza and rapivab , be sure to take it . those are working really well this flu season , the cdc says . please consider subscribing today to support stories like this one . get full access to our signature journalism for just 99 cents for the first four weeks . already a subscriber ? your support makes our work possible . thank you .
