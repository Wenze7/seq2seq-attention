        "renters are going to need to be a lot more careful about angering landlords after the launch of a `` tenancy risk score '' . the score , which runs from zero to a supremely trustworthy 1000 , is a parallel to the credit scores that lenders use to assess whether a prospective borrower is a good bet to repay a loan . created by tenancy information new zealand , which is a private company , the scores draw on 15 different sources of information . landlords will pay around $ 15 for each tenant check they do . the sources of information include credit scores from credit bureau illion , tenancy tribunal orders , driver 's licence information , home ownership records , and ratings of tenants given by landlords to tinz . ",
        "read more : * renters v landlords : the argument for regulation * landlords v tenants : how to live in a house it also includes the list of criminals being hunted by interpol , the international policing agency . tinz 's ian barker said the score would help landlords find tenants that posed a low risk of failing to live up to their obligations under their tenancy contracts , including paying their rent on time . but not everybody is happy about the new scoring system . landlords have to get prospective tenants ' permission to check up on them , but tenant 's advocate robert whitaker from renters united says refusing permission is n't an option . ",
        "realistically anyone who refuses to give that permission has a low likelihood of getting a rental , he said . `` everyone has to have somewhere to live . where are you going to live if you are a consciencous objector ? '' renters united objected to subjective landlords ' ratings being included in the calculation of the credit score , he said . tinz collects subjective landlord ratings of tenants , whitaker said , which could have an unfair impact on people 's ability to find a new home should their relationship with their landlord break down . `` i 'm not saying most landlords are vindictive , but there are vindictive landlords out there , '' whitaker said . ",
        "baker said a good score was 600-1000 and a poor score was 500 or below . the best way for a tenant to ruin their score was to get abusive towards their landlord , or get caught taking , or making , drugs in the house . `` the worst things are anti-social behaviour such verbal or physical abuse towards a landlord , drug use and unpaid rent . the new tenancy risk score is fairly harsh on those , '' barker said . the average score across the database was 630 , though scores would only be generated when a landlord made a check , so non-renters would not have a score . ",
        "each tenancy risk score is created using a smart algorithm designed to predict how likely a person was of being a responsible tenant . `` tinz is able to generate a tenancy risk score on any adult who authorises tinz to do so . it 's generated in the same way a credit score is generated except with a bias towards tenancy risk , '' barker said . people have the right under the privacy act to see the information tinz holds on them , and demand any inaccuracies are corrected . barker said there were around 400,000 rentals , and about 85 per cent of owners only owned one . ",
        "`` our feeling is that most property managers do reasonable checks . most private landlords seem to stop with verbal references . over the entire industry it seems less than 40 per cent use online checks , '' barker said . but a lack of demand from tenants for a `` landlord risk score '' to help them avoid landlords that pose a high risk of failing to live up to their side of the tenancy contract meant it was unlikely tinz would create one . `` there is some demand but not enough , '' barker said . `` several years ago tinz tried to help a group set this up by advertising it on tinz 's website . ",
        "`` the simple truth with any tenancy is that the landlord is at greater risk than the tenant . while the tenant may be subject to a sub-standard landlord who does not take their responsibilities seriously , tenants are able to move out or hold the landlord to account via the tenancy tribunal . '' `` this is all different for the landlord , who is exposing their dwelling , often worth hundreds of thousands , to people who generally he has no prior information about . '' what 's in the score ? tinz 's system creates tenancy risk scores by going and retrieving information from a wide range of data kept on individuals , which together forms a sophisticated private commercial surveillance system giving individuals a strong incentive to make all their payments on time , and abide by the law . ",
        "people who miss payments , or get evicted by landlords , risk finding themselves missing out on rentals , or paying more for their debt , if they can borrow at all . the data range tinz uses to contribute to the tenancy risk score includes : * payment defaults , such as failing to make loan repayments on time * court judgments and bankruptcies * how much debt a person has , and what types of debt * up to 24 months of repayment history information for commitments * tenant ratings from other landlords * tenancy tribunal decisions against them * anti-social behaviour while in a tenancy like verbal or physical abuse towards a landlord .
