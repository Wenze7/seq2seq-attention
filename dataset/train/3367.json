        "you 've probably heard and read about all the massive gains bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies had this year , and where there are money and freedom going on , politicians will soon be hot on the trail to tax it to death . it 's no different in brazil . geralt / pixabaybitcoin in brazil is boomingvictories are also coming in politics , with city councilmen being elected in five different capitals . bitcoin is in the news everywhere , and the crypto environment has grown remarkably . brazil is already the fourth biggest market in the world for cryptos , and exchanges have generated over one hundred jobs since things began to grow quickly in the ides of 2015 . ",
        "even arbitrage companies like atlas and bitcoin consulting companies like banco bitcoin are flourishing . entrepreneurs are bustling with different ideas on how to make money and generate jobs with new technology , and native icos are germinating . that 's not news for you if you have kept up with the libertarian movement in brazil . it 's the only country where there are more google searches for ludwig von mises than john maynard keynes . it has a huge involvement in students for liberty and a very successful instituto mises brasil , which is consistently ranking very well on amazon in economics , political science , and all that good stuff . ",
        "victories are also coming in politics , with city councilmen being elected in five different capitals , the most notable being bruno souza , an anarcho-capitalist elected by the brazilian socialist party . yes , that is a very , very long story , but it 's happening , and the establishment is kicking back . in 2015 , a law proposition sought to bring more control and regulation on the crypto market , with customer protection laws and the sort . scary , but relatively harmless . two years later , a special commission held many sessions with representatives of most exchanges and experts in the field like fernando ulrich , author of a moeda na era digital , a reference book on bitcoin for brazilians . ",
        "so , of course , it needs to be bannedall was going somewhat uneventfully until yesterday when a bomb dropped . one of the politicians involved , house representative expedito netto , made formal recommendations that would essentially ban bitcoin from being traded , created , held for third parties , or exchanged for fiat currency unless legal permission is granted . what that permission means , nobody really knows . the penalty he recommends is one to six months in jail or a fine . it 's understandable that politicians may be concerned about such a new and innovative technology and how customers may or may not be protected in their dealings , but the report only covers the old beaten dog that cryptocurrencies have no backing and are not guaranteed by any central bank . ",
        "it 's also understandable that they would be concerned about bitcoin and other cryptos being used to finance crimes , but also none of that is discussed , no evidence presented , no case studies , no discussion of the proportion of damage . the government has made entrepreneurship and hiring almost illegal only to spend decades wondering why the economy does n't grow and people have no jobs . simply put , regulators can not even argue that bitcoin-related crime is even a problem , much less a relevant one . that is n't to say that bitcoin can not be a problem , but banning a technology with such potential without a serious , evidence-based discussion on the matter is careless , to say the least . ",
        "in a country with over 60 thousand murders per year , holding 8 of the 20 most violent cities in the world , one has to wonder if politicians are not getting their priorities wrong . but all is not lost . congressmen áureo has stated that he wants `` ... a libertarian regulation , where the market adjusts to cryptocurrency , but creating some concepts regarding terrorism and combating money laundering , '' which is far better than a murky ban unless some so-far-undiscussed licensing is granted . but let 's be frank : brazil needs bitcoin . credit card interest can reach over 400 percent per year while loans with bitcoin are much cheaper . ",
        "with $ 317 billion in imports and exports , the country can benefit greatly from reduced costs on international money transactions . with ethereum 's power , the legal system and entrepreneurship can be revolutionized , making justice and business much easier , cheaper , and more innovative . according to a study by credit suisse , brazil 's productivity has not risen since 1981 , and it 's not going to rise if the government keeps banning everything that can make us more productive . and with an official 12.4 percent unemployment rate , anything that can generate a job should be welcomed with wide open arms . ",
        "brazil 's economic history can be summarized as follows : the government has made entrepreneurship and hiring almost illegal only to spend decades wondering why the economy does n't grow and people have no jobs . let us finally break with this model and welcome prosperity . raphaël limaraphaël lima is a popular media commentator and author in brazil . his youtube channel is one of the largest and most closely watched in the country . this article was originally published on fee . org . read the original article . the post a brazilian politician is trying to ban bitcoin appeared first on valuewalk .
