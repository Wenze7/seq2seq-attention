        "it 's being reported that millwall defender byron webster has now been given the green light to step up his rehabilitation and fitness work following his injury . londonnewsonline have reported that the 30 year old centre half saw a specialist this week and that he has now been given the all clear to step up his workload as he bids to return to full fitness . webster is in a battle to be fit again this season following the major knee damage he took that required surgery , so although we may see a cameo or two before the end of the campaign , he 's at least on the right track now after monday 's meeting to be fully ready for next season . ",
        "manager neil harris said of his progress . ` byron has got the all-clear to join in outside training with the medical department . he ` s able to work back on the grass and that is a big hurdle to get back out there and feel like a footballer outside . when the boys are doing their warm-ups he will be on the pitch next to us , which is a great sight for everyone . ` as harris says , just being back out with the squad even for light work , will be a huge boost for him after his time on the sidelines . ",
        "as for transfer speculation , millwall have been linked with a move for aston villa centre half tommy elphick . with webster still out of contention for a while , it 's believed that harris wants cover in that position and elphick has been looked at . londonnewsonline understand that a deal wo n't be done though owing to the wages the player is on following his switch from bournemouth and we 'd need villa to deal to make anything happen . complicating speculation around elphick is , despite being out of favour for large parts of the season so far , he has been back in the team of late and has impressed but he could certainly do a job for us if we could work something .
