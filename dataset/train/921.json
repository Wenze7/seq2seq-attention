        "i 've lived in new york city for almost four years now , but somehow i have n't taken part in many of the classic ` holiday ' activities that are offered around town ; ice skating in bryant park , walking through the winter village holiday shops , visiting the rockefeller christmas tree , and shopping at chelsea market . last week , i set aside an entire day and spent it with my boyfriend , michael , galavanting around manhattan and getting into the holiday spirit . we started out with a festive breakfast at home -- snowman and snowflake-shaped pancakes made in cookie cutters . ",
        "our first stop was the winter village in bryant park -- a european-inspired open air market filled with food , local crafts and more . we had just seen '' i , tonya '' and felt incredibly inspired to go iceskating , so we put on our skates and took a few laps around the rink before cooling down for lunch . next up was the rockefeller christmas tree , a 75-foot norway spruce decorated with about 50,000 multi-colored led lights and a star on top . and lastly we visited chelsea market , an indoor urban food hall and shopping mall that gets completely decked out for the holiday season . ",
