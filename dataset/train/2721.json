        "the holiday season is fast approaching and that could only mean one thing . no , not college football bowl season on the gridiron . nor is it the nearing of nfl playoffs . while those also may be true , it 's final exams week in the world of college basketball , an indication that conference play has officially begun for many programs around the country . as the amount of weekly upsets continue to pile up , this may be the most exciting and unpredictable season that we 've seen in quite some time . here is a list of this week 's potential upsets to keep your eyes open for . ",
        "portland state at californiatate 's take : while cal was caught scratching its head following a disappointing and embarrassing 24-point loss to chaminade , portland state was busy giving then-no . 1 nationally ranked duke all it could handle in the phil knight invitational . if the golden bears want to avoid a west coast upset , cal must take an approach that it has n't all season : establish inside-outside production between don coleman and marcus lee . meanwhile , it 's easy to see the vikings ' potential oozing even after a one-possession loss to butler and a convincing win over a decent stanford team . ",
        "bryce canda , michael mayhew , deontae north and holland woods make up one of the most underrated backcourts in the nation and can score at a high volume . that 's not a recipe for success for cal , one of the country 's worst defending teams , especially on the perimeter . not to mention , the vikings do n't beat themselves with mental errors or lapses . this game has upset written all over it . gonzaga at san diego statetate 's take : this is n't last year 's gonzaga team . and while the zags ' weaknesses have yet to have been exposed , this is the perfect game versus a familiar foe to create that blueprint . ",
        "sdsu rebounds the ball exceptionally well . the difference here will be keeping jonathan williams and killian tillie in check . if so and with a bit of energy help from the home crowd , san diego state could run away with the game . if not , a long night ahead playing from behind could be in store . the aztecs play stifling defense , though this will be the biggest test of the year . san diego state is as experienced as anyone , but has a reputation of giving games away late . malik pope , trey kell and devin watson can change that perception with a somewhat surprising win versus the reigning national runner-ups . ",
        "xavier at northern iowatate 's take : statistically , niu is one of the top five teams in the country in scoring defense while xavier is known to tally huge scoring numbers . that 's why this could be perhaps the most interesting game of the weekend . xavier 's defense could use some fine tuning , but northern iowa 's offense certainly is nothing to lose sleep over . xavier wo n't be rattled by the panthers ' raucous fan base after a win earlier this season at wisconsin . one bad shooting night by traevon bluiett would likely give niu all the confidence it need . ",
        "if the battle comes down to a coaching matchup , i trust ben jacobson on his home floor a little more than chris mack on the road . other potential upsets : st. bonaventure at syracusegrand canyon at louisvillestephen f. austin at missouri .   "
