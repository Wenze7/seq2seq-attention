        "the shutdown countdown feels more real this time . congress now has four days to hash out a spending deal that avoids a government shutdown . a deal could include any number of legislative priorities . daca talks were progressing last week and the contours of a deal can be envisioned . the recent cbo scores make a deal for chip a matter of time . negotiators continue to discuss defense and nondefense spending increases . these issues can be resolved this week or extended in the short-term in order to avoid a government shutdown and finalize the outstanding issues . ",
