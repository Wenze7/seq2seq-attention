        "georgia football defeated oklahoma in the rose bowl 54-48 in double-overtime to advance to the national championship game in atlanta . the game was stressful . the hearts of the bulldog nation were pounding out of our chests . tensions were high and nerves were shot . but in the end , it was georgia football taking the huge sigh of relief when sony michel turned the corner for his game winning touchdown in the second overtime . that touchdown provided a moment that fans will never forget . it 's a highlight that fans and the production crew will replay over and over again . ",
        "and it 's an immediate favorite in the minds of many in the bulldog nation . but to that point , the best word to describe how georgia fans felt about the rose bowl was doubt . the defense , which was one of the best in the nation , allowed oklahoma to score 31 points and rack up 300 yards in the first half . they just could n't stop the sooners . to the sooners credit , they came in with an excellent game plan . they banked on georgia focusing on heisman trophy winning quarterback baker mayfield . ",
        "and they were right . instead , oklahoma gave us a heavy dose of rodney anderson . their tailback carried the ball 26 times for 201 yards . besides anderson , the sooners called a lot of screens and shorter passes . georgia came in prepared to play a gunslinger . instead , they had to deal with smash-mouth running and tunnel screens . an almost sec-like approach to the offense . on the other side , georgia 's plan of conserving nick chubb and sony michel for the fourth quarter almost proved costly . besides michel 's 75-yard touchdown run and georgia 's more pass-heavy first touchdown drive , the offense was stagnant . ",
        "that allowed oklahoma to take a 31-14 lead with six seconds left in the first half . they were going to halftime with a three-score lead . and then the forgotten play of the game happened . to try to run the clock , oklahoma called up a squib kick . the kick went straight to tae crowder , one of the blockers on georgia 's front line . he stopped the ball , caught it , and gave georgia the ball right across midfield . that led to a rodrigo blankenship field goal . from 55 yards out , blankenship set a personal and rose bowl record . ",
        "but more importantly , he cut the score to 31-17 at halftime . just two scores instead of three . oh how the smallest things can turn the momentum . blankenship continued to spearhead the momentum change with his kickoff to open the second half . instead of a touchback , he kicked a high , returnable ball . the coverage team did the rest and shut down the return at the 14-yard line . the defense took over with a stop in just three plays . more from dawn of the dawg georgia football : it 's rose bowl time bulldogs fans !

",
        "that tied the game . the comeback was complete . now georgia just had to take the lead and hold it . they got the first part right . to open the fourth quarter , georgia finally forced mayfield to make a mistake . and of all the players , it was safety dominick sanders who capitalized with an interception and a return down to four-yard line . two plays later , fromm hit javon wims in the end zone for a touchdown to take a 38-31 lead . oklahoma did n't go away though . a few possessions later , mayfield finally led a drive with his legs and arm . ",
        "no anderson , no screens . the mayfield we all expected . he led the sooners to the end zone for a game tying touchdown . then disaster struck . trying to answer , michel fumbled and oklahoma 's stephen parker ran the ball 46 yards to the end zone to flip the lead again . but georgia did n't stay down . on a drive that began at the bulldog 's 41-yard line with 3:15 left on the clock , fromm completed three of is four passes to lead the dawgs downfield . the chubb took a direct snap to the end zone for a game tying touchdown . ",
        "that set up overtime with the score at 45-45 . both defenses came up strong in the first overtime to forced field goals . so going into the second overtime the game was tied 48-48 . the sooners opened the second overtime , but again , georgia 's defense dominated . oklahoma lined up for another field goal . and again , another senior stepped up . lorenzo carter got a hand up and blocked a field goal to prevent a score . all georgia needed was a field goal to win . michel , wanting to erase the memory of that fumble had other plans . ",
        "lining up in the wild dawg formation , sony ran to his left and found a gap in the defense . he cut up field as he 's done so many times . if you 've watched as much georgia football as i have , you knew what was going to happen as soon as he cut up field . michel had space , he 's always had speed . on that play , he got six . the most important six of the night . the six to win . six points to bring georgia back to atlanta and on the verge of a national championship . ",
        "no extra point necessary . georgia had done it . thanks to 222 total yards and four touchdowns by michel ; 146 yards and two touchdowns by chubb ; 210 passing yards and two touchdowns by fromm ; 73 receiving yards and a touchdown by wims ; a near pick-six by sanders ; a clutch catch on a squib kick by crowder ; great kicking by blankenship and niazalek ; a blocked field goal by carter ; and a lot of sacks by the defense . thanks to the seniors who returned , georgia defeated oklahoma in maybe the greatest game in school history . ",
        "the bulldogs are heading back to atlanta to play alabama , arguably the college football kings of atlanta . a national championship is on the line . but for now , us fans can just enjoy the football masterpiece that we just witnessed . georgia football defeated oklahoma in the rose bowl 54-48 in double-overtime to advance to the national championship game in atlanta . the game was stressful . the hearts of the bulldog nation were pounding out of our chests . tensions were high and nerves were shot . but in the end , it was georgia foo ...
