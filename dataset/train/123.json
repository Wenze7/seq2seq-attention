",
        "`` we think that this is the beginning of what could be a fairly disruptive change in a very established industry . `` varo offers an fdic-backed bank account backed by the bancorp bank . varo also applied for its own bank charter . varo provides loans as well . the business uses a `` machine learning algorithm to predict incoming income and their bills , '' said walsh . this helps them target customers for loans at just the right time . the startup believes one of its biggest selling points is that it does n't have overdraft fees , minimum balance charges or foreign transaction fees . ",
        "the only fees are for atms that are n't in-network . maya chorengel , senior partner with the rise fund , said she invested because they 're `` confident in varo 's ability to scale successfully as a business and advance the financial health of its customers in the short and long-term . `` varo would n't clarify exactly how many people use its product , but walsh says it has `` tens of thousands of customers . '' it just launched last june . he plans to use the funding for marketing and to `` lay the foundation to become a national bank . ",
