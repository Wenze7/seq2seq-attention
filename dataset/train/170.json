        "while hugh jackman 's rise to prominence was initially rather lucky , as he only got the role of wolverine in `` x-men '' after dougray scott dropped out at the start of production , he has well and truly taken advantage of this opportunity . in fact , jackman has now been a bona-fide hollywood a-lister for 17 years and counting . jackman 's latest big-screen adventure sees the actor returning to his musical roots in `` the greatest showman . '' ahead of its release i sat down to talk to `` the greatest showman 's '' composers benj pasek & justin paul , and they were able to paint a picture that explained why jackman has been at the top for so long . ",
        "`` the extraordinary thing about hugh jackman is that he is the hardest working man in the room . he is so extraordinarily gifted , and he works harder than everyone , '' explained benj pasek . `` that sets a tone where if anyone wants to give in , he 's the first one there and the last one to leave , and so everyone wants to work as hard as him . because he 's a huge movie star , and you do n't want to feel as though you 're not being 110 % if he is . '' ",
        "justin paul admitted that , at first , the duo found it intimidating that they were going to work with jackman . `` we were nervous about him hearing songs , and then saying he did n't want to sing something . because he really does have that power . '' `` but as intimidating as that was , it quickly became inspiring and helped , because we knew that hugh was singing the songs , and we had his voice in our head . we know what he can do , and what his strengths are , and what he has to his voice that no-one else has . ",
        "'' `` it gave us some parameters , and when you are being told that you can write anything , it actually helps to have a hugh filter . it only mattered that hugh sounded great . it was really helpful as writers . '' you can see and hear the songs that hugh jackman , benj pasek , and justin paul created in `` the greatest showman '' now , as the film is finally in cinemas across the country .   "
