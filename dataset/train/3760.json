        "london -- world 100-meter champion justin gatlin fired coach dennis mitchell following an undercover investigation reported tuesday that appeared to show people linked to the sprinter offering to supply performance-enhancing drugs . `` i was shocked and surprised to learn that my coach would have anything to do with even the appearance of these current accusations , '' gatlin wrote in a post on his instagram account . `` i fired him as soon as i found out about this . '' the iaaf 's athletics integrity unit said it is investigating the allegations in conjunction with the united states anti-doping agency . ",
        "the report was published in tuesday 's edition of the british newspaper the daily telegraph . `` these allegations are very serious , '' said brett clothier , head of the aiu , `` and strike at the heart of the integrity of athletics . '' iaaf president sebastian coe said the allegations are `` extremely serious . '' the telegraph reported that mitchell and a track agent , robert wagner , met undercover reporters at a training camp in florida and offered to supply and administer testosterone and human growth hormone for an actor training for a film , for a fee of $ 250,000 . ",
        "dennis mitchellreutersthe newspaper said mitchell and wagner were secretly recorded saying the use of banned substances in track was widespread . wagner called the newspaper report `` deeply flawed '' and said it was based on things he said that were not true . `` i made up the comments to impress them , led on by a make-believe scenario , '' wagner said in a statement to the associated press . `` it was just big talk . i did not actually source or supply the substances the reporters asked for but stupidly claimed i could . '' wagner also said he notified the athletics integrity unit of the situation four weeks ago . ",
        "the 35-year-old gatlin , who also won the 100 meters at the 2004 athens olympics , has served two doping bans in his career . `` i am not using and have not used peds , '' gatlin wrote in his instagram post . `` all legal options are on the table as i will not allow others to lie about me like this . i have no further comments as it is now a legal matter . they will next hear from my lawyer . '' coe said the iaaf has started to focus on the `` influences that surround athletes '' and stressed that all support personnel are bound by the governing body 's anti-doping code and integrity code of conduct .
