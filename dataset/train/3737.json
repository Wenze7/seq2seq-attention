        "welcome to our fourth annual overview of the year in news , where we summarize and visualize u. s. twitter conversation about the biggest news stories of 2017 . social media conversation is a powerful window into the world of news . using our optimized listening platform , we can track the level of public interest in a topic , understand how stories move among various audiences , and track who talked the most about what . this year , we analyzed over 2.839 billion u. s. tweets covering nearly 250 topics and issues . additionally , we looked at conversation among three key audiences : conservative activists , liberal activists , and beltway elites . ",
        "2017 was primarily a story about one man : president donald trump . he was tweeted about an estimated 901.8 million times in the united states , a doubling of last year figure and nearly ten times barack obama 's total of 91 million his last year in office . there were only 17 days in 2017 where donald trump was not the top topic of conversation , and he was the # 1 story every week for every audience . here 's how much trump and other top political figures were mentioned in 2017 : donald trump -- 901,757,332 mentionsbarack obama -- 164,156,373 hillary clinton -- 123,152,913 bernie sanders -- 48,821,611 mike pence -- 31,414,787 to paint a vivid picture of 2017 in the news , we set aside mentions of donald trump from our main visualizations . ",
        "but his impact is felt on the other stories that dominated conversation , from his inauguration in january , to the # 1 and # 2 most discussed stories of the year : the russia investigation and the attempt to repeal obamacare . the most discussed news stories of 2017 on twitterthe russia investigation -- 180,433,480 mentionshealthcare & the affordable care act -- 151,581,985 immigration -- 48,024,531 hurricanes -- 43,219,262 james comey -- 41,834,011 sexual harassment scandals -- 36,626,993 china -- 36,189,391 climate change & the paris agreement -- 31,789,203 guns -- 29,936,649 north korea -- 28,224,456 of course , knowing how much a story was talked about ca n't tell us how it was talked about , and automated sentiment analysis is notoriously unreliable . ",
        "what we 've found works better is to understand who is talking . the more one group talks about an issue , the more they feel their side is winning . this same principle applies to the overall volume of conversation as a barometer of partisan enthusiasm . the data we 've collected from the same core political twitter users we 've been tracking since well before the 2016 election offers some striking findings . the shift left that started with trump 's election has been dramatic : where conservatives and liberals were evenly matched in their share of the conversation in the run-up to the 2016 primaries , liberals today are about twice as likely to be active as conservatives . ",
        "this is reflected in the issues being discussed , including the russia investigation and the successful attempt to derail obamacare repeal . while liberals have been dominant for well over a year , the one time conservatives did overtake them is notable -- the weeks leading up to trump 's surprise victory . the online enthusiasm gap tracks with the notion of a highly engaged democratic base that is turning out at higher rates in special elections and is poised to make gains in the midterm elections . can democrats sustain this advantage , or will republicans recover ? if anything changes , the digital conversation is likely to tell us first .
