        "56 to 35 -- going darki 've decided to take this project offline . i 've continued to have success with writing , and am on track to successfully complete 56 posts by my birthday . however , i 've struggled to publish them , i now have a backlog of 10 or so posts to edit and post , and to be honest the new writing format does n't really lend itself to creating reliably publishable content . in particular , i 'm not finding i 'm creating out-of-context , medium worthy content . i 've noticed the stress of creating something minimally publishable has started to become a distraction , and i do want to preserve this space as a place i can publish with a higher level of polish than i can guarantee and still hit my milestones . ",
        "so , at this point , i 'm redefining success for this project , which is really to capture the zeitgeist of my thoughts during what has proven to be a pivotal year in my life . after , i 'd like to publish the posts , and can maybe use that as an excuse to get more familiar with publishing tools / formats . i 'm really curious to see how these read back to back in an e-book format , and i 've never published an e-book , so that is sounding like a good definition of success for this project looking forward . ",
        "i already feel myself wanting to double down on this writing habit , my intention here is not to pull back , but to rein in the scope of this project to a place where it can reasonably succeed , and free up energy to pursue other work elsewhere . to that end , i 'll publicly share here one of my 2018 intentions , which is to publish the first story in the science fiction universe i have been creating . 56 to 35in a countdown to my 35th birthday , i 'm publishing a short writing piece on self reflection and improvement as part of my morning ritual . ",
        "it is my hope that this consistent focus and attention will help make my 35th year my most healthful and enjoyable year yet .   "
