        "andy wilson of the haida first nation paints a delicate design on a traditional haida bentwood box . wilson says the repatriation of many original such boxes from museum collections helped inspire and instruct a new generation of artists in his community . other first nations groups credit repatriation with reviving spiritual traditions that sustained their ancestors for generations . ryan heavy hand had been helping first nations bring home ceremonial objects from museums for years , but this call from an institution in oregon was a first . `` the museum had a beaver bundle , '' said heavy hand , referring to one of the blackfoot people 's most sacred and ceremonially important objects . ",
        "many institutions were reluctant for such items to leave their collections , but not this one . '' actually phoned the tribe and said , ` can somebody come and pick this up ? our staff are hearing animal sounds in the storage . . where the bundle was kept . '' ` they 'd just like you to come and take it and bring it back home . '' ' first nations have been repatriating items for decades now . masks , rattles , bundles , medicine pipes , bentwood boxes and headdresses in the hundreds have left urban museum cases and collection storehouses for the lands where they were made . ",
        "and , when they arrive , they no longer sit behind glass . many have resumed their place at the heart of indigenous cultural life . they have become spiritual and artistic inspirations to the descendants of those who made them . `` it definitely gave life to a lot of people , '' said jerry potts jr. , a piikani elder from southern alberta , who was involved in many repatriations of blackfoot ceremonial items . `` there 's universities and collections all over that have given stuff back to the communities that 's back in full use right now . '' ",
        "letter writing the movement home began in the 1970s , driven by the desire of young indigenous people to revive their ceremonies and traditions before the elders who knew them died . many of those ceremonies had one-of-a-kind objects at their heart and many , if not most , were in museums , universities and private collections . getting them back was hard work , said heavy hand . in 1994 , he sat down with a fat directory of museums worldwide and sent out 4,000 form letters asking them if they had any blackfoot material . almost 200 museums wrote back saying they did . ",
        "`` there were many , many thousands of items , '' he said . `` all of the major museums in canada have really big blackfoot collections . '' remains from 145 indigenous ancestors in storage at university of winnipeg on the west coast , andy wilson , co-founder of the skidegate and haida repatriation committees , was getting summer students to look through museum catalogues and write letters . `` they had to be proactive about it , '' he said . `` now , museums are starting to contact first nations . '' sometimes negotiations took months ; sometimes they took years . ",
        "museums were reluctant to part with some artifacts or were uncertain about where they should go . first nations had to work out who was entitled to receive the material and how the transfer should be done . resuming ceremonies they were determined . bundles are considered to be living things that gain strength from use and which connect their owners to their creation myths . the objects started coming home . and , as soon as they did , the ceremonies and societies that depended on them resumed . in 1992 , a thunder medicine pipe bundle was used for the first time in 30 years . ",
        "a decade or so later , the blackfoot had possession of and were using all 25 bundles associated with the horn society . `` i do n't think has been complete since about 1923 , '' wrote the late kainai elder frank weasel head in a recent book on repatriation titled `` we are coming home . '' for wilson , repatriation involved artifacts and human remains . the haida had almost lost the art of making bentwood boxes , used , among other things , for burials . wilson and others used the returned boxes -- and totem poles , drums , masks , paddles and rattles -- to relearn how to make them . ",
        "the boxes were painted , but not just with any design . `` it 's got to be your family crest , '' said wilson . `` and if you do n't know what your crests are , then you have to go and ask your family about it . you have to open that line of communication and history . '' songs and language the return of the bentwood boxes also led people to recover the songs and language appropriate to their use . `` it 's an emotional thing , '' wilson said . `` all this stuff was beaten out of them when they 're doing it , they realize how much they 've lost , so there 's quite a bit of grief in there . '' ",
        "for the blackfoot , repatriation has meant rejuvenation . many of the traditional societies -- the brave dogs , the horns -- have bounced back . chicago museum gets ` cultural repatriation ' award for returning inuit remains to labrador potts said his reserve used to have the resources for one pipe ceremony a year , but now they can do two or three on the same day . `` there 's people that make vows to for sickness , for good luck . there 's been nothing less than miracles that have happened from some of the ceremonial protocols . '' ",
        "the ripples of repatriation , said wilson , spread wider than anyone expected . `` one of the things we did n't realize with repatriation was it said ` enough is enough . we 're not going to allow you to take away our ancestors , our sacred artifacts , our knowledge . ' `` if we had all day , i could n't explain to you what it did for us . ''   "
