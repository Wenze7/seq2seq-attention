        "harrisburg , pa. . - public schools in philadelphia , the 8th largest school district in the united states , will begin a return to local control on july 1 following approval this week by pennsylvania governor tom wolf and his education secretary . the state of pennsylvania took over the schools in philadelphia , its largest city , in 2001 following a series of financial crises , and appointed a school reform commission to run the district . philadelphia mayor james kenney asked for a return of local control , and the src approved its own dissolution last month . ",
        "wolf and education secretary pedro rivera needed to sign off for decontrol to move forward . `` local control with strong state support will make the district stronger , '' wolf said in a statement . '' will better serve the needs of the district 's students and schools . `` the district serves nearly 200,000 students , about a third of them in charter schools . it employs more than 8,600 teachers and has an annual budget of close to $ 3 billion . philadelphia city councillor helen gym , who called state control an `` experiment '' on minority children , lauded the governor 's action . ",
        "`` after 16 years , i 'm glad to see the experiment come to a decisive conclusion , '' she said . `` this is a victory for all who fought for fair funding , who demanded democratic local governance . `` the next step in the decontrol process will be the formation of a 13-member nominating committee to help decide membership of the new city school board . gym said the committee will nominate up to 27 candidates and kenney will choose nine of those . kenney could not be reached for comment on thursday . in the past , he has promised to work for tax increases if the school district needs more local revenue to stabilize its finances . ",
        "while the district is currently in the black , it faces a projected five-year deficit of $ 700 million , according to data released by the src . rivera , in a letter this week to the src , did not downplay the financial challenges still faced by the district , but said kenney 's commitment to local revenue was an important factor in his decision in favor of decontrol .
