        "washington -- the trump administration on tuesday threw the weight of the u. s. government behind the protesters taking to the streets of iran , rooting them on despite the risk of helping iranian authorities dismiss a week of major demonstrations as the product of american instigation . as iran 's supreme leader accused `` enemies of iran '' of trying to destabilize his country , the state department pressed tehran to unblock social media sites used by the protesters . it even offered advice to tech-savvy iranians on circumventing state internet controls . president donald trump declared it was `` time for change '' in iran , and other officials floated the possibility of additional sanctions . ",
        "at the united nations , ambassador nikki haley sought a security council meeting to show support for those protesting in the islamic republic . `` we want to help amplify the voices of the iranian people , '' said haley , who appeared before cameras to recite the chants of protesters across iran . she said iran 's claim that other countries were fomenting the unrest was `` complete nonsense , '' describing the dissent as homegrown . borrowing from a response playbook it has used before , iran 's government blamed the u. s. , saudi arabia and britain for the protests . ",
        "ayatollah ali khamenei , the 78-year-old supreme leader , said iran 's enemies were using money , weapons , politics and spies `` to create problems for the islamic system , the islamic republic and the islamic revolution . `` trump was undeterred , praising iranians for `` finally acting against the brutal and corrupt iranian regime . '' in an allusion to possible sanctions in response to human rights violations , trump said the united states would closely monitor the situation . `` the u. s. is watching ! '' the president tweeted . beyond rhetoric , though , it was n't clear what the trump administration could do substantively to empower the protesters , who are railing against corruption , mismanagement and economic woes including higher food prices . ",
        "his support also sets up a potential test of his presidential leadership if the protests -- already deadly -- grow more violent . at least 21 people have died and hundreds have been arrested over six days of demonstrations , the largest in iran since the `` green movement '' that erupted in 2009 following a disputed presidential election . the new outbreak started in mashhad , iran 's second-largest city , and has expanded to many others . iranian authorities have sought to suppress the protests in part by shutting down key social media sites protesters use to communicate , including instagram , facebook , twitter and the messaging app telegram . ",
        "on tuesday , undersecretary of state steve goldstein urged iran 's government to unblock the sites . `` they are legitimate avenues for communication , '' goldstein said . he said the u. s. has an `` obligation not to stand by . `` iranians seeking to evade the blocks can use virtual private networks , goldstein said . known as vpns , the services create encrypted data `` tunnels '' between computers and can be used to access overseas websites blocked by the local government . the primary u. s. goal is to ensure enough global attention to deter iranian authorities from violently cracking down on protesters with impunity , said a senior state department official involved in iran policy . ",
        "the official was n't authorized to comment by name and demanded anonymity . for trump , the protests have served as an unexpected but welcome opportunity to rally the world against iran , and u. s. officials said the administration was actively encouraging other countries to back the protests . early u. s. attempts to get european allies to coordinate their messaging with the u. s. ran into obstacles , but several countries including france and italy have joined in expressing concerns . in the u. s. , trump 's full-throated support for the protesters has renewed the debate about how best to encourage change in iran , whose government trump deems a top national security threat . ",
        "under president barack obama , the u. s. took a more cautious approach during the last major wave of anti-government protests . it was concerned about enabling iranian authorities to exploit longstanding suspicions of the u. s. , dating back to american and british support for a 1953 coup toppling iran 's elected prime minister . ben rhodes , obama 's former deputy national security adviser , said `` too much ownership '' of the protests by trump would likely be counterproductive . `` i ca n't imagine that the people marching in the streets of iran are looking to donald trump for inspiration or support , '' rhodes said . ",
        "`` i just do n't think it helps things for the white house to make this into a u. s.-versus-the-iranian-government circumstance . `` but former sen. joe lieberman , a staunch iran critic , said it 's a given tehran will portray dissent as externally provoked . `` that 's a very weak excuse for american inaction and inconsistency with our own interests and values . i 'm glad president trump is not following that advice , '' lieberman said in an interview . it was n't immediately clear what effect trump 's support was having on the protests , although iran 's state tv reported his tweets and some iranians shared them online . ",
        "when it comes to supporting the iranian aspirations , trump 's credibility may be dented by his hostility to the 2015 iran nuclear agreement and his inclusion of iranians in his travel bans . trump 's insistence in an october speech on using the term `` arabian gulf '' in place of the persian gulf also riled the iranian public . there also was criticism of secretary of state rex tillerson for saying america was working with people in iran for a `` peaceful transition of that government .
