        "you do n't need me to tell you that there is a lot of email being sent this holiday season . actually , it 's not even limited to email . there 's just a lot of marketing noise this time of year . many businesses think they can capture subscribers ' attention with increasingly desperate offers : 15 % off one week , 20 % off the next , then 25 % off , etc. . etc. . but it is possible to stand out during the holiday season without offering those kinds of discounts . you may not win the price war , but you can expect to capture your audience 's attention with relevant content , a mobile presence , and customer reviews . ",
        "and that will benefit you in the long run , not just between now and the end of the year . here are three ways to stand out : 1 . relevant content . plain and simple : if you are sending relevant content , you will stand out . you 're reading this blog post because it 's covering a topic you care about . your customers are going to read your emails and social media posts for the same reason . not only does relevant content based on your customers ' interests help you stand out , it can lead to as many sales as free or discounted shipping offers can . ",
        "delivering relevant content is easy to do ! on your social media pages , pay attention to what your fans and followers respond to and engage with . create more posts like that . for email , pay attention to what subscribers are clicking on and what they said they wanted at sign up , and send them targeted relevant mailings about those topics . just in time for the holidays , you 'll see a higher open rate and clickthrough rate when you need it most . 2 . mobile . your customers are on their mobile devices , and the businesses that are there too are the ones that stand out . ",
        "it 's not just about having a mobile-friendly website but thinking about all the places people can find your business online . you should expand your presence because , according to microsoft , 70 % of all mobile searches result in action within one hour . be there when customers are looking for you ! and do n't stop there . continue to engage them at your location . make it easy for people to join your email list with their mobile phones using text-to-join . 3 . reviews . do you trust ads ? i do n't , and apparently , the majority of consumers do n't either . ",
        "what your customers do trust is consumer reviews . they search for them online , they ask their social networks , and they rely on those before making a purchase . in fact , 71 % of consumers say online reviews are important when considering purchasing a product . reviews are important , so ask for them ! ask people to share their thoughts and opinions in an online survey , a facebook poll , or just by directing them to your yelp page . once you have the reviews , do n't stop there . promote them ! quote customer comments in your emails , link to them from your facebook page , or use a qr code to link to them in your store . ",
        "by talking to your customers about what they care about , engaging them where they are with mobile , and validating your messages with reviews , you can set your business apart this holiday season , no discounts needed . what ways do you use to stand out at holiday time ? share your thoughts with us in the comments below .
