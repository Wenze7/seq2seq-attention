        "it was a pleasure for us here at qlink , being a singapore based blockchain project , to participate in the first ever neo meet up in our country . we had a big team present , including susan zhou , co-founder and coo , allen li , chief architect , roger lim , head of investor relations , tony gu , head of strategy and toya zhang , head of pr & marketing . we were also honored that our advisor mock pak lum , who is the former cto of starhub , could join us at the meetup as well . ",
        "the meetup began with remarks from tony tao , secretary general of neo . tony introduced the x-token and spoke about some philosophical approaches on the evolution of organisations . susan zhou then took the stage and introduced the qlink project . she discussed how qlink plans to manufacture basestations that will enable users to provide lte network coverage , complementing existing mobile networks . this hardware will ultimately be a valuable solution for network black spots , whether in urban areas during peak times or rural areas where the existing coverage is simply not enough . we were asked many excellent questions by the audience during the q&a session , as well as after the event . ",
        "we are very happy to share some of these questions and answers with you . q1 : what 's the advantage of qlink 's basestation in terms of cost compared to existing base stations . a : the basestation developed by qlink is ` all-in-one ' , which means it integrates core network and gateway providing radio signals for mobile devices . the cost of the basestation is approximately $ 150 . the advantage of the qlink basestation lies in the security , flexibility and its nature as an investment , which can generate revenue for owners who share its signal . ",
        "q2 : from my understanding , qlink is building a separate public chain for the telecom industry . how is it related to the neo ecosystem ? a : qlink will develop both on neo and develop a dedicated telecom public chain . telecom assets including wi-fi , sms and data will be registered on neo , and transaction records will be recorded on the qlink chain . we chose neo because of its speed , community environment and strong development team . q3 : the project sounds very ambitious , renovating the telecom industry from the ground up . ",
        "does this mean you are encroaching on the telco incumbents territory ? a : we are more of an enhancement . for example , qlink will help to create a prosperous and secure wi-fi sharing economy and will also compliment their existing network coverage . moreover , qlink will allow them to generate more revenue by offering new business opportunities with content providers , such as advertisers , improving their roi . finally , we would like to thank the neo community for their hospitality and thank you for participating our proof-of-engagement handshake program ! qlink team in singaporesusan and tonytony taosusan zhouhandshakes with qlink team .
