        "at least one economist worries we 'll be mostly poorereditor 's note : we asked four economists to offer their thoughts and insights on what they expect to be a key theme or issue in 2018 . greg wright , assistant professor of economics , university of california , mercedincome and wealth inequality are currently at levels last seen during the gilded age -- when the top 10 percent of americans owned nearly three-fourths of overall wealth , and the bottom 40 percent had virtually no wealth -- and 2018 will see things get a whole lot worse . now , the richest 1 percent of americans own 40 percent of u. s. wealth , more than the bottom 90 percent of americans combined . ",
        "in spite of this , congress just significantly reduced taxes on capital and on high-earning individuals . other income earners got smaller , temporary cuts . meanwhile , the government has yet to renew federal funding for the children 's health insurance program , a program affecting 9 million poor families , and the tax bill repealed the affordable care act 's individual insurance mandate , which may ultimately lead to a loss of coverage for millions of low - and middle-income americans . other policies that will be enacted or pursued in 2018 that could further widen the income gap include cuts in important programs like social security and medicare and a continuing rollback of financial , environmental and other regulations that benefit a few companies at the expense of all americans ' living standards . ",
        "why does widening inequality matter ? while some argue that inequality is irrelevant as long as all incomes are rising , even that has not been true in the u. s. for decades . the average income for the bottom 50 percent of americans has been unmoved at us$ 16,000 since 1980 . in addition , recent evidence indicates that family income in childhood is a strong predictor of the likelihood that an individual will produce innovations as an adult . poverty and social inequality thus lead to `` lost einsteins . '' not long after accepting the nobel prize in economics in 2014 , robert schiller stated , `` if we wait until income inequality is much more severe , we will have a whole class of new superrich who will . ",
        ". . feel entitled to their wealth and will have the means to defend their interest . '' in 2018 we may begin to put these fears to the test . patricia smith , professor of economics , university of michiganat least one measure , however , makes the u. s. look not so rich : its poverty rate . the share of american households living on less than half of the national median income , a commonly used measure for international comparisons , is the second-highest in the developed world , at 17.5 percent . while the official u. s. poverty rate puts that lower , at 12.7 percent , even by that measure over a quarter of children under 5 lived in poverty in 2016 . ",
        "house speaker paul ryan has once again reopened the debate on how best to win the fight by declaring poverty will be a focus in 2018 . the rhetoric of the republican plan sounds promising , beginning with `` if the american dream is n't true for everyone , it is n't true for anyone . '' it would make work more rewarding in anti-poverty programs and improve education and training . but ryan has also made clear he plans to cut medicaid , medicare and other anti-poverty programs to reduce the national debt , all of which were central to reducing the official poverty rate from 22 percent in the early 1960s . ",
        "part of the argument supporting a focus on cutting debt is that it spurs growth , which in turn reduces poverty . the u. s. did experience this prior to the mid-1970s , when growth appeared correlated with less poverty . since then , however , the poverty rate has responded little to economic growth . in fact , the correlation may work the other way around because research suggests that lowering poverty rates cuts health care costs and federal spending and boosts growth . specifically , improving health and nutrition for the poor is critical to long-term growth , leading to higher productivity and incomes . ",
        "for example , economists estimate that the cost of childhood poverty in terms of lost economic productivity approaches $ 294 billion annually . economic optimism and health carechristos makridis , ph. d. candidate in labor and public economics , stanford universityfollowing last year 's tax cut , some in congress -- perhaps ironically -- are arguing that the focus now needs to be on reducing the budget deficit in the short term . but the deficit is a long-term problem that is nearly impossible to balance without figuring out a way to rein in health care spending in part because it makes up so much of the economy . ",
        "health care is one of the few items that matters to literally everyone , from small business owners and corporate executives to households of all incomes . it 's also one of the trickiest because of its life and death nature , with quality of service difficult to gauge and costs often not borne directly by patients . i believe the tax cut president trump signed into law in december will help turn the current economic optimism into tangible reality for tens of millions of families . by tackling health care next , the government could continue that momentum . ",
        "delaying reform will only make things tougher down the road . william hauk , associate professor of economics , university of south carolinapresident trump made it clear during the 2016 presidential campaign that he intended to either renegotiate or withdraw from most of the united states ' international trade agreements . in 2018 , he may finally focus his energy on these campaign promises , which would put our prosperity at risk . early on in 2017 , he announced the u. s. withdrawal from the trans-pacific partnership . we 're already beginning to see the negative impact of that decision . ",
        "our economic and political influence in asia may decline in 2018 and the years ahead . he has also set his sights on the north american free trade agreement and began renegotiating its terms . talks are likely to accelerate in 2018 , with the pact 's unraveling a real possibility . international trade deals are an often misunderstood part of u. s. economic policy . however , they can have a large impact on the economy . since the end of world war ii , the u. s. has taken the lead in setting up a multilateral , rules-based system of international trade . ",
        "central to this system was the general agreement on tariffs and trade . in 1994 , this agreement was transformed into the wto . a retreat from a multilateral rules-based system of trade brings with it many problems . domestically , it increases the probability of `` trade wars '' with our major trading partners . relatively minor disputes could easily escalate into trade sanctions and counter-sanctions , like in the aftermath of the depression-era smoot-hawley tariff , which raised tariffs on hundreds of imports . internationally , it could make it more difficult for developing countries to engage in trade relations with their much larger and wealthier counterparts . ",
        "certainly , some aspects of institutions such as nafta and the wto can be questioned . however , a general retreat from the postwar system of trade could be a dangerous path for both the u. s. and the broader world economy .   "
