        "wednesday january 17 , 2018 when an 11-year-old girl said she was attacked by a man trying to cut off her hijab with scissors , there was an outpouring of shock and disgust . the girl spoke at a hastily convened press conference at her school and the story caught international attention -- even prompting a message of support from justin trudeau . a few days later , police said the attack `` did not happen , '' but did not provide further details . the reaction online was swift and rancorous , with people attacking the girl 's `` fake hate crime '' on social media . ",
        "but hate crimes in canada are on the rise : the number of police-reported hate crimes rose last year for the third year in a row . they 've also become more violent , according to statistics canada . toronto police on hijab attack that ` did not happen ' 1:31 for bernie farber , a human rights advocate and former ceo of the canadian jewish congress , statistics like that are what made the story so believable . `` it had the ring of truth to it , '' he tells the current 's anna maria tremonti , `` especially given everything that we 've seen over the last number of years -- the attacks on the muslim community . '' ",
        "aisha sherazi also believed the story . as a teacher and teen counsellor who works with muslim families , sherazi noted a trend of young girls who want to stop wearing the hijab as they get older . `` when they speak to their daughters openly about what 's driving that change , it 's that they feel targeted , that they do n't feel comfortable anymore , '' she tells tremonti . `` they feel that people are going to look at them . they feel judged . '' hoaxes hurt real victims the hoax also poses a challenge to groups working with victims of hate crimes , which are on the rise in canada . ",
        "stories like this can be seized upon by those looking to discount the experience of marginalized or attacked communities . `` it is a very , very scary , horrible experience to be victimised for something that you have no control over , '' sherazi says . `` you ca n't control the colour of your skin . you ca n't really control who you were born as , per se , or your beliefs . '' ` this kind of consistent vilification in the media and in social media is really wearing down our youth . ' she says we live in a time when the muslim community is constantly in the news , and `` this kind of consistent vilification in the media and in social media is really wearing down our youth . '' ",
        "faber points out that false reports like this happen in all communities . `` one false report does not mean that there is n't islamophobia out there , '' he says , `` that there is n't anti-semitism out there , that there is n't racism out there . '' `` the fact of the matter is that we have to stay the course . '' ` send her to jail ' both faber and sherazi noted a complete lack of empathy or understanding in the reaction : people were calling for the 11-year-old to be put in jail , promoting conspiracy theories about her family , and decrying islam as `` a cancer on the world . '' ",
        "faber says that the posts he saw on his own facebook page `` were some of the most vitriolic vile kinds of comments that i 've ever seen . '' `` it was disgusting , '' he tells tremonti . `` i spent most of my night blocking people and getting rid of those comments . '' `` we 're dealing with an 11-year-old girl who told a lie , '' he points out . `` that 's basically what happened , and then that lie got caught up in this spiral of events that went way out of control . '' ",
        "the current : three muslim women talk about the face covering the current : hates crimes are nothing new in canada he thinks the young girl should face `` natural consequences '' for her dishonesty , but `` the problem is that so many unnatural things happened as a result of her lie that the world came down upon her head , and very unfairly in my books .
