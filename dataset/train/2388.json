        "president donald trump entered the walter reed national military medical center on friday for his first known physical checkup since his inauguration nearly one year ago . the examination is being conducted by the president 's personal physician , dr. ronny jackson . `` i think it is going to go very well . i would be surprised if it did n't , '' trump told reporters the previous day . a written statement will be released by jackson , who is a u. s. navy rear admiral , following the exam and the white house will conduct a full briefing about it next tuesday , according to press secretary sarah huckabee sanders . ",
        "since federal health privacy laws also cover the president , it will be up to trump to decide what information to release . the checkup for the 71-year-old president will not include a psychiatric evaluation , according to sanders . while there have been no known significant health events for trump since his inauguration last january , concerns have been widely expressed about possible neurological disorders . trump , who is the oldest president to take office , in public appearances has slurred words and grasped a drinking glass with both hands . sanders has brushed aside concerns expressed by reporters about the president 's health as `` ridiculous . ",
        "`` trump 's physical will be among the most closely scrutinized of any president in decades , perhaps since ronald reagan , who was wounded in a 1981 assassination attempt and also suffered from alzheimer 's disease while in office , according to his youngest son , ron reagan . file - president ronald reagan gives his weekly radio address at the voice of america studio in washington , nov. . 9 , 1985 . the elder reagan , however , was not diagnosed with the degenerative brain disease until 1994 , five years after he left office . trump 's father , fred , developed alzheimer 's in his 80s , a fact that has prompted calls for the president to undergo a significant neurological exam . ",
        "previous concernslast october , senator bob corker , who is a member of the president 's republican party , told reporters that trump 's behavior had raised issues about his `` leadership , and just his stability , and the lack of desire to be competent on issues and understand . `` following this month 's publication of a widely-discussed behind-the-scenes book about his first year in office , trump on twitter described himself as `` a very stable genius '' and earlier this week he allowed white house pool reporters and videographers to remain in the room for 55 minutes as he met with a group of senators with whom he was negotiating immigration legislation . ",
        "the most recent public medical information about trump comes from his longtime personal physician , dr. harold bornstein , who in 2015 declared that his patient would be `` the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency . `` subsequently , bornstein revealed that trump was prescribed a statin for high cholesterol , and takes a daily baby aspirin for heart health , an occasional antibiotic for the skin condition rosacea , and finasteride pills that promote hair growth .
