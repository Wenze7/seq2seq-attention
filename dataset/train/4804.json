        "whether or not you 've have kids , you 're probably aware that delivering one ai n't easy . what about the hardships that come after birth , though ? tons of new moms keep quiet about how challenging it is to care for an infant , but one woman challenged that silence when she aired her frustrations on the uk parenting site mumsnet . com last week -- and got a slew of empathetic responses . titling her post `` i hate my baby , '' the anonymous mama promised readers that her child is safe with her , but she is at a loss for how to handle his behavior . ",
        "`` he cries all day and all night he sleeps a total of around 4/24 hours all day the rest of it he is crying , '' she wrote . `` he cries when i 'm feeding him . he cries when i 'm holding him . '' the mom said she 's tried everything to help soothe her son , but nothing has worked . `` i 've tried keeping him close and i 've tried getting him used to being put down . i 've tried white noise . i 've tried a jumperoo . i 've tried swaddling , '' she continued . ",
        "`` i 'm always consistent with what i 'm trying but nothing helps . '' later in the post , the mom said the last five months with her son have been torturous : `` i honestly feel like climbing out my window and jumping , if it was n't for my other children i probably would . help me . i know other people have been through this . what can i do ? '' the callout did n't go unanswered . hundreds of responders replied with advice for the struggling mother , including the best sleep positions for babies with reflux and recommendations for allergy tests that might shed light on the cause of his ongoing discomfort . ",
        "they also pushed her to pressure her doctors for help , since the mom said they never take her complaints seriously , brushing her off with the explanation , `` babies cry . '' sweetest of all were the kind words the mama received from her fellow mumsnet users . `` i remember how soul destroying the endless nights of no sleep felt , '' wrote one commenter . `` you 're not doing anything wrong , '' wrote another . yet another replied , `` massive hugs as you need it . i 've been there . it 's sh*t but you can do this . '' ",
        "the takeaway ? feeling frustrated by your newborn does n't make you a bad mother . and if you 've ever felt less than obsessed with your kiddo , know you 're not alone .   "
