        "starry , the company founded by former aereo ceo chet kanojia , is launching its wireless internet service in parts of los angeles and washington d. c. , promising to deliver unlimited internet access with speeds of 200 mbps for $ 50 per month . starry first unveiled its plans to become a wireless internet access provider two years ago . the company has been testing its wireless internet technology in parts of boston , and plans to launch in more than a dozen markets in 2018 , including new york , cleveland , chicago , houston , dallas , denver , seattle , detroit , atlanta , indianapolis , san francisco , philadelphia , miami and minneapolis . ",
        "ultimately , it wants to compete with cable companies like comcast and telcos like at&t , and offer consumers cheaper access to fast broadband connections . starry is n't the first company to try to take on the broadband giants . google rolled out its own internet access business , dubbed google fiber , across a dozen markets . however , the company scaled back its ambitions significantly in the last two years after it struggled with slow and costly roll-outs of its fiber infrastructure . starry is trying to bypass these issues by using wireless technology for the last mile instead . ",
        "the company is using neighborhood network nodes that connect to local access points mounted to the top of residential buildings . consumers then access starry 's internet service with a dedicated router . consumers in los angeles and washington d. c. can use starry 's website to see whether their building has access to the service yet . the company did n't say how many consumers or buildings it plans to connect , but still called the launch in los angeles and d. c. part of a beta test . it said that it would grow its presence in both markets in the coming months . ",
        "it 's perhaps ironic that starry is using the capital of the entertainment industry as one of its first markets : company founder and ceo chet kanojia became infamous in hollywood when he launched the tv streaming service aereo five years ago . aereo tried to deliver a low-cost tv service to consumers by letting them rent their own personal antennas in the cloud , but was sued by broadcasters for not paying them for their programming . the supreme court ultimately sided with the tv industry , forcing aereo to shut down in 2014 .
