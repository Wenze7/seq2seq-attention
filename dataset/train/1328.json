        "president donald trump is greeted by defense secretary jim mattis , left , as he arrive at the pentagon , thursday , jan. . 18 , 2018 . vice president mike pence , is second from left , and white house chief of staff john kelly , is right , washington -- the latest on the debate over immigration and the budget : 3:15 p. m.the interior department says that if there is a government shutdown , national parks and other public lands will remain as accessible as possible . the stance is a change from previous shutdowns when most parks were closed and became high-profile symbols . ",
        "spokeswoman heather swifts says the american public -- especially veterans who come to the nation 's capital -- should find war memorials and open air parks open to visitors . swift says many national parks and wildlife refuges nationwide will also be open with limited access when possible . she says public roads that already open are likely to remain open , although services that require staffing and maintenance such as campgrounds , full-service restrooms and concessions wo n't be operating . backcountry lands and culturally sensitive sites are likely to be restricted or closed . __ 3:10 p. m.secretary of state rex tillerson says the state department is `` ready '' if the federal government shuts down . ",
        "tillerson is responding to questions about his agency 's preparations for what to do if congress fails to pass a stopgap spending measure . he says he hopes that does n't happen . but he says if it does , `` we 're ready . `` state department spokeswoman heather nauert says no decisions have been made about what services like visa processing and passports the state department could provide during a shutdown . she also says there 's been no decision about whether tillerson could proceed with a planned europe trip next week if the government shuts down . ",
        "nauert says security for american diplomats overseas wo n't be affected . she says tillerson and individual embassies have some discretion over how to handle a shutdown . 2:15 p. m.mexico is disputing president donald trump 's claim that it is the `` most dangerous country in the world . '' mexico also says , again , that it will not pay for a border wall . trump tweeted thursday , `` we need the wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from mexico , now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world . '' ",
        "he also insisted that mexico would pay for the wall . mexico 's foreign relations department concedes the country has a problem with violence but says it is `` openly false '' to call it the most dangerous . it points out the most recent global comparison by the united nations put mexico far from being one of the most dangerous countries , and the department says mexico 's murder rate is not even the highest in latin america . ___ 12:12 p. m.the white house says president donald trump supports the house effort to avert a government shutdown and fund a popular children 's health insurance program for six years . ",
        "`` the president supports the continuing resolution introduced in the house , '' white house spokesman raj shah says in a statement . `` congress needs to do its job and provide full funding of our troops and military with a two-year budget caps deal . however , as the deal is negotiated , the president wants to ensure our military and national security are funded . he will not let it be held hostage by democrats . `` trump cast his support for the measure into doubt earlier thursday with a tweet that criticized the length of the chip reauthorization . ",
        "`` chip should be part of a long term solution , not a 30 day , or short term , extension ! '' trump tweeted . ____ 12:09 p. m.house speaker paul ryan says he 's confident that the gop-controlled house will do its part and pass legislation to keep the government open for another four weeks . the wisconsin republican told reporters thursday that gop vote counters are `` doing fine . i have confidence we 'll pass this . `` the house is slated to vote thursday evening but members of the hard-right house freedom caucus are opposed to the measure . ",
        "freedom caucus chairman mark meadows said leaders are refusing to attach items such as funding to fully finance a 2.4 percent pay raise for the military . ryan said he spoke to president donald trump and said trump fully supports the house measure , despite tweeting earlier thursday that a popular children 's health insurance program should not be part of the short-term budget agreement . 11:34 a. m.president donald trump says a government shutdown `` could happen , '' saying it is `` up to the democrats . `` trump spoke as he arrived at the pentagon for a meeting thursday . ",
        "he said on his way in that he was there `` for our military '' and said if a shutdown happens , the `` worst thing is what happens to our military . `` trump said the country `` just about never needed our military more than now . `` republicans and democrats are scrambling to avert the shutdown , which could come at midnight friday . trump injected confusion into the process thursday with a tweet that a children 's health insurance program should not be part of a short-term budget agreement . 9:45 a. m.president donald trump says a children 's health insurance program should n't be part of a short-term budget deal . ",
        "trump favors making the program part of `` a long term solution , not a 30 day , or short term , extension ! `` trump is referring to the children 's health insurance program , also known as chiphouse republican leaders have included a six-year renewal in a short-term budget bill in an effort to woo democrats . but the effort faces resistance from democrats who 've been demanding protections for certain young immigrants . the white house is n't immediately responding to questions about the tweet . trump also says he does n't want to see a government shutdown -- and the shutdown deadline is fast approaching . ",
        "it 's midnight friday . he says a `` shutdown will be devastating to our military ... something the dems care very little about ! `` 6:35 a. m.president donald trump is pushing back against his own chief of staff over the border wall with mexico . trump tweets that `` the wall is the wall , it has never changed or evolved from the first day i conceived of it . `` some democrats who met with trump aide john kelly on wednesday say kelly told them there are parts of the border where a wall is n't needed and that trump did n't know that when making campaign promises . ",
        "trump is now tweeting that some of the wall will be `` see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains , wastelands or tough rivers or water ... `` he 's also saying the wall `` will be paid for , directly or indirectly , or through longer term reimbursement , by mexico , which has a ridiculous $ 71 billion dollar trade surplus with the u. s . the $ 20 billion dollar wall is ` peanuts ' compared to what mexico makes from the u. s. `` 12:40 a. m.the white house chief of staff says president donald trump 's views on immigration are evolving . ",
        "and that statement is giving some people hope for a compromise . but perplexing others . john kelly 's comments come amid a shaky effort to reach a deal to protect hundreds of thousands of young immigrants from deportation . it 's a push that the white house and republicans say they would back if it 's coupled with tough border security measures and other restrictions . kelly made the remarks wednesday at a closed-door meeting with members of the congressional hispanic caucus -- according to participants . and he made similar remarks later on fox news channel . kelly tells fox that trump has `` very definitely changed his attitude '' toward protecting the young immigrants , `` and even the wall , once we briefed him .
