        "denmark 's government is wondering how much longer the economy will be exposed to the distortions wrought by negative interest rates , and is urging european union leaders to enter a debate on the appropriateness of the current monetary policy environment . the country , which has lived with negative rates longer than any other , has been forced to keep its main monetary policy instrument below zero for half a decade to protect the krone 's peg to the euro . danish rates first went negative in mid-2012 , and most economists expect the policy to persist until 2020 . ",
        "the obvious risk is `` price pressure that can lead to bubbles , '' danish finance minister kristian jensen said in an interview in copenhagen on wednesday . `` we 're in a situation where our economic upswing has been under way for a while longer than in many other eu countries . '' `` we would definitely be positive if the ecb would ease up on the very aggressive monetary policy it has right now , '' jensen said . `` the buying of bonds is very aggressive in my view , especially looking at the condition of the european economy . ",
        "'' `` right now , i do n't think the low rates are the right medicine for a long-term positive development , '' jensen said . for denmark , the monetary climate has pushed the economy to the limits of its capacity utilization . `` we 're now facing a labor shortage , with more firms ready to hire than there are people willing to work , '' he said . `` that means we need a situation in which there 's less heat coming from monetary stimulus . '' jensen says denmark is now taking the opportunities available to it to raise these concerns with eu leaders . ",
        "`` there 's a growing number of eu countries that have emerged from the crisis , so these very low rates are n't needed any more , the upswing is stable , '' jensen said . `` france is making sweeping reforms now , and spain 's elevated itself markedly since last year . there 's a lot of countries doing a lot better and therefore we ought to see a normalization of monetary policy , '' he said . denmark ca n't exit its extreme monetary policy alone , because of the euro peg . its main deposit rate is minus 0.65 percent , compared with the ecb 's deposit rate of minus 0.4 percent . ",
        "the distortions coming from extreme negative rates include an overheated property market , with the government recently taking measures to prevent denmark 's most indebted households from borrowing more . the country 's biggest banks have warned that households are growing `` blind '' to the risk of rates ever going positive again . jensen says the era of extremely low rates , globally , is one of the reasons something like bitcoin can suddenly flourish . `` there 's no doubt that a part of bitcoin 's popularity stems from people looking for alternative investments , because the returns on other investments are so low , '' he said . ",
        "while the danish government has taken several steps to ensure consumers are protected from bubbles in the housing market , jensen signaled he has little inclination to stop people experimenting with cryptocurrencies . `` people have to decide for themselves what to make of bitcoin , '' he said .
