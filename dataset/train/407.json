        "aptiv and lyft are taking self-driving cars on the vegas strip for ces , so we took a ride . with 2018 's consumer electronics show around the corner , we prepared for the onslaught of autonomous vehicle demos by ... taking on an autonomous vehicle demo . what was different about this one , though , is that it 's something any ces attendee can experience for themselves . as reported before , ride-sharing company lyft and automotive tech company aptiv have partnered up to provide driver-free rides to 20 different locations in las vegas for the duration of the expo . ",
        "we took a ride for ourselves to see just what was in store for any attendee hoping , maybe , to avoid the usual chit-chat . the demonstration is staged in one of the las vegas convention center 's parking lots . from there , we walked through a `` garage gallery '' which was basically an art installation representing some key points lyft wants to impart : `` ride sharing good . '' it 's essentially four displays representing how parking spaces could be better utilized as something else , the costs of car components , as well as the minuscule time we spend per day with said car . ",
        "from that point on , we 're able to summon a lyft as anyone normally would from their smartphone device . the experience is the same but when at one of the 20 designated spots in the city , the additional option to hail an autonomous vehicle crops up . the car itself is a bmw 5 series kitted out with an array of sensors : lidar , cameras , and radar . all told , the system has a viewing distance equal to that of two football fields long and even utilizes the car 's adaptive cruise control to determine range . ",
        "though visible , these sensors are fairly well integrated throughout the panels of the car , not requiring a roof-rack array of gizmos to see its way around . alex kalogianni/digital trendswe chose one of the hotels in the area as our destination and climbed in the back of our lyft operated by eric , who is behind the wheel because nevada legally requires a person behind the wheel of a self-driving car which will test on public roads . just like the outside , the interior of the car had very little alterations . aptiv retrofitted the existing bmw idrive , where it rendered the different paths the car could and could not take , identified objects that could move , and those that could not . ",
        "its an important distinction when it comes to decision-making , and that certainly applies to self-driving cars . the drive was ... well , uninteresting . there was no drama or excitement or rush of fear , it was just ... normal . and i think that 's the highest praise one could give to any autonomous vehicle . perhaps its because eric occupied the driver 's seat , but its clear to see he 's not operating things merely by looking at him . in fact , even if you were n't the only way to really tell is by a tablet-like display that faces the rear passengers which indicates when the car is in `` auto '' or `` manual . '' ",
        "for instance , as we moved to make a left turn at in intersection , we human occupants could hear sirens rapidly approaching . we all saw it coming down the lane we were about to cross , but so did the car . i eyed the screen , curious to see if eric would intervene , but he did n't and we remained in auto the whole time . speaking to the aptiv spokesperson who joined us , she cleared up that the car did n't recognize that an emergency vehicle was on its way , but that a car was coming our way and fast , so it 'd better stop . ",
        "aptiv and lyft hope that these demonstrations go a long way in normalizing the idea of hopping into a self-driving car for consumers . it was surprisingly easy for us to accept the situation and trust the car 's abilities , certainly helped along by the fact that we saw what the car saw . that normalization is likely the biggest obstacle autonomous vehicle advancement has , but once it 's overcome , eric-less rides will be commonplace . sorry , eric .
