        "calgary -- the national energy board is setting up a process to resolve future permitting issues between kinder morgan canada ltd. . and provincial and municipal authorities on the trans mountain expansion project . the neb said thursday that under the process , it will take about three to five weeks to reach a decision on future permitting disputes . the regulator said that it still expects all sides to go through the permitting process in good faith , but the board will step in when necessary on permitting issues that affect neb conditions on the project . `` this generic process will provide a measure of certainty regarding the regulatory tools available to resolve permitting disputes or disagreements in limited circumstances where trans mountain and provincial and municipal authorities are unable to do so , '' the neb said in a release . ",
        "kinder morgan canada had asked for a way to resolve future disputes after encountering what it called significant delays on securing permits from burnaby , b. c. b. c. municipalities had made submissions against the proposal , with chilliwack expressing concern that the company may use it as a pressure mechanism or as leverage against the city . surrey said the motion is an attempt to unlawfully fetter , circumvent , and undermine the legislative scheme to the detriment of municipalities . outside supporters of the trans mountain project , including the alberta and federal governments , supported the proposal as a way to address compliance oversight . ",
        "the neb said it expects the process to be rarely used , and it would only step in for limited reasons such as when there 's lack of clarity as to whether trans mountain has achieved condition compliance . kinder morgan canada had asked that a standing panel be set up to hear the potential disputes , but the neb said it would decide who would hear issues as they arise . the neb also gave itself roughly double the time the company had requested for decisions to be made in the process . the company said wednesday that it estimated the trans mountain expansion project was a year behind schedule after encountering regulatory and permitting delays . ",
        "the project , which would nearly triple oil-shipping capacity from alberta to the west coast , faces significant opposition from numerous indigenous groups , environmentalists and municipalities in british columbia . the canadian press .   "
