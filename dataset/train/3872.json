        "the swiss government has apparently considered the lobster , and decided the crustaceans must now be `` stunned '' before going into boiling water . as part of a big overhaul of switzerland 's animal-rights laws , legislators in bern have issued a ruling that says , as of march 1 , `` the practice of plunging live lobsters into boiling water , which is common in restaurants , is no longer permitted , '' according to the agence france-presse . citizens looking to skip the fondue and enjoy lobster thermidor instead will have to humanely zonk them out somehow first . ",
        "animal-rights advocates argue lobsters know they 're being boiled alive . but it 's actually a long-standing debate about whether invertebrates can feel pain , and if so , how much . researchers often point out `` pain '' is sort of subjective , but that the lobster 's nervous system -- roughly 100,000 neurons in size , compared to 100 billion in humans -- probably is n't advanced enough to do more than twitch instinctively at the stimulus of heat . maybe not , but critics will quickly note the creatures can still look super upset when it happens : they 'll flail around , or even jab a claw into the air . ",
        "the swiss government has not made solving this quandary easy . it wants citizens to , in some form or fashion , numb their dinner before killing it . great , you may think -- i 'll put my lobster on ice . but not so fast : switzerland 's new ruling also forbids putting live marine animals on ice or in icy water , saying they must `` always be held in their natural environment . '' which you could argue is ironic , considering nothing about landlocked switzerland is `` natural '' for lobsters -- but it 's the new law either way . ",
        "the government does offer two acceptable ways to prepare your crustacean for its final demise : electric shock of some kind , or the `` mechanical destruction '' of its brain .   "
