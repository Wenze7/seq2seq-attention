        "animal collective 's reputation precedes them . in fact , the memes that have arisen from the band 's 2009 release `` merriweather post pavilion '' might be more famous than the band itself . i wo n't try to bore you with a lengthy history of the group . they 're a baltimore ensemble consisting of musicians daniel michael portner , noah benjamin lennox , and brian ross weitz , a. k.a. avey tare , panda bear , and geologist , respectively . over their almost 20 years as a group they 've covered a lot of musical ground , ranging from field recordings , to noise , to now releasing some of the most colorful experimental pop in the genre . ",
        "i do n't really want to talk about `` merriweather '' and their most recent experimental pop output since so much has already been said about it . but here i wouldin their early years , animal collective was part of the growing group of artists making `` freak folk '' , a sub-genre that called back to the progressive folk bands of the late 60 's like the fugs and comus , but put a more modern spin on those psychedelic ideas with avant-garde elements like samples and loops coming into play . `` sung tongs '' stands out as one of the more forward thinking albums of freak folk , and is a high point both for animal collective , and modern folk in general . ",
        "for those who know ac from mpp and are expecting the same from this album , you 'll most likely be disappointed . from a first time listen , a lot of this album feels very , well , unpolished . but in a sense , that 's kind of the appeal to me -- the energy just seems so off the cuff and unbridled . the true genius of this album comes from the complexity that is hidden behind these deceptively simple 12 tracks . this lp is like a culmination of all of the band 's previous efforts . ",
        "much of the psych-y eeriness of their unofficial debut , `` spirit they 've gone , spirit they 've vanished '' , can be heard throughout this album , like the skeletal guitar and vocals of `` leaf house '' , or with the strange seagull-like caws of `` good lovin ' outside '' . these songs keep the stark uniqueness of their early work , something the group is incredibly good at doing , but with upped production and more mature songwriting . each song changes something up from the last , and there are a lot of very infectious hooks scattered all over . ",
        "`` who could win a rabbit '' may be the closest the group would get to making a pop song at the time , with its brightly strummed guitars , tribal drum patterns and avey 's manically childish voice carrying the track along cheerfully . this carefree tone comes up on a lot of tracks here , on `` winters love '' with its beautiful descending vocal arpeggios , or `` we tigers '' with the climax of avey screaming at the top of his lungs . but the true excitement is found in the risks the album takes . ",
        "the experimentation that lines almost every animal collective album is found in plenty here . as an example , the ensemble 's heavy reliance on loops and mastery of the art shows up on almost every single track to some degree . the atmospheres and landscapes they develop through echoes and field recordings are . animal collective has always been skilled at blending experimentation with humanity , creating music that sounds very foreign , almost extraterrestrial , yet at its core , it is undoubtedly impossibly human , from the lo-fi recording flaws , to the improvisation , to the overall lightheartedness of it all . ",
        "really the only track that does n't match up to the quality of the others is the 12 minute centerpiece `` visiting friends '' . although i enjoy the personal lyrics and windy guitar tone , there 's not enough song to justify the 12 minutes , and you 're left pushing it to the background of your mind when listening . there is so much to talk about in this album that i will inevitably forget to mention due to the sheer complexity and layers of the music , like the abstract lyricism and the quieter moments like `` the softest voice '' that provide intriguing contrast to the more lively moments . ",
        "i truly believe that simply recommending this album wo n't do it enough justice , so do yourself a favor and make some time in the future to really sit down and listen to this thing . you 'll definitely find something unlike much you 've ever heard . and if you have listened to this album , what do you think of it ? leave a response , and be civil . please share this blog on social media and tell your friends , and leave any suggestions in the response section . listen here .
