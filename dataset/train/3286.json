        "there is a stigma rampant in the psyche of young people that in order to be smart and successful , you must study stem , or business . that other fields like the liberal arts are soft fields , made for lazy people , that teach useless information , and lead to unemployment . this type of thinking is problematic - there is more to learning and gathering knowledge than just natural science and engineering - it is important to have a well rounded knowledge of different schools of thought , including the liberal arts . i studied one of the so-called `` useful '' majors and can tell you that the liberal arts are an integral part of a well-rounded education . ",
        "when i studied at smu , all students were required to take a core curriculum of liberal arts courses . i got the chance to dabble in a variety of subjects - religious studies , history , sociology , and economics in addition to my more `` rigorous '' finance major . i loved studying religious studies , art history , sociology , and music production because they gave me new lenses to study the world around me , and helped me create things . many people including my co-founder at apollo tutors would ask me why i even cared about aesthetics , history , or philosophy . ",
        "if you showed one of these critics a painting by mark rothko , they 'd see a big red dot . or would ask me why i bother producing music when you can listen to a ted talk of some guy beatboxing - these critics miss the point of why we should appreciate the arts , and other social sciences . looking back , i learned more about critical thinking and formulating ideas from my liberal arts classes than i did in most of my business classes which mainly involved memorization , group projects , and creativity was often seen as `` extra '' or `` out of scope '' of the course . ",
        "many times in conversation you might hear someone dog on an english major , or art history major or hear their discipline as the butt of a joke . if you 've been on any university meme page , you 've probably seen something like these memes . i am going to show some of these claims , and then refute them with 4 reasons that everyone should study the liberal arts .   ",
        "historically , liberal arts / natural sciences were one and the samemy uncle is a aeronautic engineer who specializes in fluid dynamics and aerodynamics and the other day we got into a discussion about mary shelly 's frankenstein , the pivotal 1818 gothic horror novel we started talking about how dr. frankenstein 's tale was written in an age where mathematics , calculus , and biology were at an early stage of formalization-isaac newton died in 1727 , and even in the novel they do n't refer to science , or biology , or chemistry - they actually call the discipline natural philosophy or natural history .",
        ". this baffled me because i had n't really connected those two dots together but it made a lot of sense that in an age of curiosity and minimal quantitative data , that science and philosophy are related . if you look at what motivated scientific revolutions over time , and analyze some of the thinkers - aristotle , descartes , bertrand russell , von neumann , all of these thinkers had also studied , or had a fascination with the liberal arts as well as within stem and it was their creativity that led them to make groundbreaking discoveries in thought we still admire today . ",
        "2 . studying the liberal arts reinforces critical thinkingin a more concrete basis , studying the liberal arts reinforces critical thinking by teaching students the concept of using frameworks , thinking logically , and critically analyzing facts , sources and viewpoints . communication is also essential - if you look back at the same university meme pages i mentioned before , you will also see the stem majors complain about writing a lap report , working on a essay , or trying to express a viewpoint . every year i interview candidates for smu 's alternative asset management program , which is meant to be the school 's finance honors program . ",
        "the applicant pool is intense - you have people majoring in engineering and finance , computer science and finance , math and finance , or other crazy combinations with perfect gpa 's . a lot of finance interviews require memorizing generic answers to a common set of questions - to account for this , i test students ' critical thinking skills by giving them a brainteaser , or by slightly changing the questions to where studying wallstreetoasis will not provide the answer . this helped me determine who is a memorizer , and who understands the different moving pieces in a question - many times it was the heavily technical students who struggled with thinking outside the box . ",
        "understanding rhetoric , logic , and piecing ideas together in frameworks are skills that you learn from analyzing texts and viewpoints , and studying history . these skills are transferable to other disciplines and to many different types of projects and a reason to value studying the liberal arts. 3 . studying the liberal arts teaches empathyi love studying history because it is more than a discipline of memorizing facts and dates . history is the study of events , yes , but also the people behind them , their motivations , and the records they left behind which we use to get an understanding of the past . ",
        "by understanding the different components of history and how events are framed , we can study and learn from it by empathizing with the motivations of the people who came before us , and using those lessons to avoid the same mistakes in the future . empathy is one of those qualities that is extremely powerful , but hard to put into practice . there is an episode of the cartoon adventure time where the main character , finn , tries to teach a monster called donny the jerk how to be a better person by teaching him the empathy song - `` you have to think about how your actions make other people feel . ",
        "empathy , empathy , put yourself in the place of me '' -- finn 's empathy songif there is anything that we have learned from the recent cases of extremism across the world , or from tone-deaf comments from our leaders is that people often care about maximizing their priorities without considering the effects on other people . by solely focusing on the quantitative and not the qualitative , we end up with sub-optimal outcomes - corporations that profit at the expense of other people or the environment , toxic financial climates that cripple the economy , repressive policies , or other problems . ",
        "studying history , psychology , sociology , and other liberal arts disciplines provide a lens to better understand people , the problems they have , and to help design solutions . 4 . creative thinking ca n't be automated many repetitive tasks can be automated to be performed by a computer or computer assisted machine , and many jobs that are both cognitive and non-cognitive run the risk of computerization . according to the economist , `` previous technological innovation has always delivered more long-run employment , not less . but things can change . '' among the list of jobs that will be automated include accountants and auditors , attorneys , pilots , real-estate agents , economists , machinists , surgeons , anesthesiologists , financial analysts and other white-collar jobs . ",
        "however firms today are recognizing that creativity ca n't be programmed . slack technologies , the creator of one of my favorite apps , has recently crossed a valuation upwards of $ 2.8 billion and one of their greatest ffeatures is something called the slackbot , a chatbot that provides tips , cracks jokes , and acts a bit like siri but on your chat app . slack prides itself in hiring employees with a liberal arts background , including their editorial director for slackbot who comes from a theater background , to their ceo stewart butterfield , who has a bachelors and master 's degree in philosophy and the history of science . ",
        "according to butterfield , `` studying philosophy taught me two things , i learned how to write really clearly . i learned how to follow an argument all the way down , which is invaluable in running meetings . and when i studied the history of science , i learned about the ways that everyone believes something is true -- like the old notion of some kind of ether in the air propagating gravitational forces -- until they realized that it was n't true . '' forbes , mit quotes an argument from professors erik brynjolfsson and andrew mcafee and their book , the second machine age , that today 's tech wave will inspire a new style of work in which tech takes care of routine tasks so that people can concentrate on what mortals do best : generating creative ideas and actions in a data-rich world . ",
        "tldr : the key is not that one discipline is better or worse than another , but that understanding different disciplines adds value to one 's knowledge and to their organization . i respect stem experts for their technicality and ability to create and debug systems the same way a stem person ought to value a nontechnical person 's ability to connect with people or think outside of the box . when one side starts questioning the legitimacy of another field , they miss the point of what makes different disciplines great . so let 's stop demonizing the liberal arts and learn to expand our horizons . ",
        "at the end of the day robots are going to take all of our jobs so we might as well be friendly as the ai revolution creates the lazy world from the pixar film wall-e . a student pokes fun at a liberal arts finalanother perspective about liberal arts students ' sleep habitsliberal arts students are slackersour future .
