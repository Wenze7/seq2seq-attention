        "washington -- multiple american citizens were killed and injured in the taliban 's 13-hour siege of an upscale hotel in kabul , afghanistan , the state department said tuesday . no exact figures were immediately available for either the u. s. fatalities or injuries . in total , 22 people were killed in the attack including 14 foreigners , afghan officials have said . eleven of the 14 foreigners had been previously identified as working for the private afghan airline kamair . `` we offer our deepest condolences to the families and friends of those who were killed and wish for the speedy recovery of those wounded , '' the state department said . ",
        "`` out of respect for the families of the deceased , we have no further comment . ? '' the american deaths were the latest reminder of the continuing toll paid by the united states in afghanistan , where local forces have struggled to fight the taliban since the u. s. and nato formally ended their combat mission in 2014 . president donald trump has pursued a plan that involves sending thousands more u. s. troops to afghanistan and envisions shifting away from a `` time-based '' approach to one that more explicitly links u. s. assistance to concrete results from the afghan government . ",
        "trump 's u. n. envoy , nikki haley , said after a recent visit to afghanistan that trump 's policy was working and that peace talks between the government and the taliban are closer than ever before . the six taliban militants who stormed kabul 's intercontinental hotel on saturday in suicide vests were looking for foreigners and afghan officials to kill . afghan security forces have said the standoff ended sunday when they killed the last of the militants . more than 150 people were rescued or escaped during the siege , including 41 foreigners . some hid in bathtubs or under mattresses as the attackers roamed the hotel 's hallways killing people . ",
        "it was unclear how seriously the injured americans were wounded . in addition to the americans killed in the attack , six ukrainians , two venezuelan pilots for kamair and a citizen of kazakhstan and a citizen of germany were also killed , officials have said . word of the american deaths came as afghan 's interior ministry said an investigation is underway to find out how the attackers got into the building so easily . najib danish , spokesman for the interior ministry , said tuesday that security forces also defused a vehicle full of explosives near the hotel after the siege ended .
