        "it was finders keepers for some fossil-hunting kids at kawhia back in 2006 . and what a find - the remains of a giant penguin worth a cool couple of million . but they did the right thing - the hamilton junior naturalist club gave it to the waikato museum . and in return , on thursday , the friends of the waikato museum gave the club a life-size 3d-printed model made by massey university palaeontologist daniel thomas . read more : when the club spotted something poking out of the ground at kawhia harbour all those years ago , they thought it was an old boat anchor , maybe a rusty propeller . ",
        "but it was an almost-complete ancient remains of a giant penguin . the fossilised remains were hailed as one of the most significant fossil findings for the country . junats mentor dave matthews said while he does n't believe fossils can be owned , the club 's most prized treasure was always better studied and protected in the museum . the penguin - much larger than modern-day emperor penguins - probably lived during the oligocene epoch between 27 and 34 million years ago . it stood around 1.5 m tall and weighed about 100 kg . when the fossil was found , chris templer , another mentor to the club , was the first to realise it was a penguin . ",
        "it was left for three weeks while the junats figured out whether extracting it was legal . `` it was just on the perimeter of a scenic reserve , '' templer said . but it was buried in rock between high and low tide so , technically , it was `` finders keepers '' . he was impressed with the replica . `` i think they have done an absolutely fantastic job . '' studying the fossil will teach researchers a lot about the era , matthews said . `` there was no way we could store it here because of its worth . ",
        "`` it would get stolen and end up overseas . '' the junats were once offered over $ 2 million by an overseas collector . but there was no way such a treasure could leave new zealand soil , matthews said . '' wanted ownership of it ... we said only if you give us a model that 's representative of it . so that 's what has happened . '' `` in our mind , this fossil belongs in this kawhia area . `` the replica brings it back closer to its home . ''   "
