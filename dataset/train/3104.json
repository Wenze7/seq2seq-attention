        "a turkish banker was convicted in new york on wednesday in connection with a massive scheme to help iran evade us sanctions , in a case that strained ties between ankara and washington . a jury found mehmet hakan atilla , deputy chief executive of turkish lender halkbank , guilty of five counts of bank fraud and conspiracy . the federal trial hinged on the testimony of well-connected turkish-iranian businessman reza zarrab , who became a government witness after admitting his involvement in the multi-billion-dollar gold-for-oil scheme to subvert us economic sanctions against iran . his testimony implicated former turkish ministers and even president recep tayyip erdogan in the scheme , and identified 47-year-old atilla as a key organizerzarrab , a prominent gold trader , agreed to testify after striking a deal to plead guilty to violating us sanctions . ",
        "before the trial , erdogan reportedly pressed us president donald trump to quell the investigation and strongly criticized washington , calling the case a `` plot '' aimed at hurting turkey . acting us attorney joon kim said the case was a warning to anyone who would violate us sanctions . `` foreign banks and bankers have a choice : you can choose willfully to help iran and other sanctioned nations evade us law , or you can choose to be part of the international banking community transacting in us dollars . but you ca n't do both , '' kim said in a statement . ",
        "`` if you lie repeatedly to us treasury officials and fabricate documents -- all as part of a secret scheme to smuggle billions of dollars in iranian oil money past the us sanctions net -- as atilla did , then you should be prepared for the consequences . ''   "
