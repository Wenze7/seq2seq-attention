        "it goes without saying that megyn kelly is no stranger to causing controversy . back in june , kelly received a lot of backlash when she invited sandy hook denier alex jones on her former show , sunday night with megyn kelly . a few months after the interview with jones , kelly enraged people when she asked jane fonda about her supposed plastic surgeries on megyn kelly today . and just when you think things could n't get any more offensive , megyn kelly is now claiming that some women want to be fat-shamed . yep , kelly is kicking off 2018 with another scandal . ",
        "in conversation with `` fit mom '' maria kang on thursday , kelly made a very uncomfortable and awkward comment about how she dealt with `` gaining weight '' during her law school days . apparently , kelly encouraged her stepfather to poke fun at her weight gain so she 'd stave off the pounds . kelly revealed , according to the cut : some of us want to be shamed . when i was in law school , i was gaining weight , i said to my stepfather , ` if you see me going into that kitchen one more time , you say , ` where you going , fat ass ? ' ",
        "and it works ! ok , so before i dive deeper into kelly 's unbelievable remark , it 's important to first know who kang is if you 're not familiar with her already . kang , a mom of three and the founder of `` no excuse mom movement , '' caused a bit of controversy in 2013 for sharing a facebook photo that man felt fat-shamed moms , according to people . the post , which showed kang posing in revealing workout gear next to her sons , boasted the caption : `` what 's your excuse ? '' ",
        "naturally , many parents felt the picture 's intent was to body shame and perpetuate the incorrect notion that you 're unhealthy if you 're fat or plus size . to make matters even worse , kang was unapologetic about offending her followers . kang defended the viral picture , according to facebook : what you interpret is not my fault . it 's yours . the first step in owning your life , your body and your destiny is to own the thoughts that come out of your own head . i did n't create them . you created them . ",
        "so if you want to continue ` hating ' this image , get used to hating many other things for the rest of your life . you can either blame , complain or obtain a new level of thought by challenging the negative words that come out of your own brain . so , yeah . i ca n't say i 'm surprised that kelly made her controversial comments in the presence of someone who has been accused of fat-shaming herself . what a shocker . and i also ca n't say that i 'm blown away by kang 's response to kelly 's problematic anecdote . ",
        "kang chimed in , according to the wrap : my husband does that to me all the time . i tell him my goals and if it 's early in the morning and he sees me still in bed , he 's like ` what are you doing in here . ' or if i 'm doing something like eating something , like chips , he 'll take the bag and he 'll hide it . and i do n't feel ashamed of that because i told him what my goal was . of course , there 's nothing wrong with receiving positive and healthy support from your loved ones while you strive to achieve a personal fitness goal . ",
        "everyone needs to hear words of encouragement now and then , right ? what is troubling , however , is kang and kelly 's normalization of fat-shaming . if kelly did feel uncomfortable with her body during college , i bet she could have lost the weight without her stepfather calling her a hurtful moniker like `` fat a * s. '' and in kang 's case , i bet her husband could have found another way to champion her dietary goals without hiding her food , which seems a bit patronizing to me . plus , it 's no secret that fat-shaming can lead to serious consequences like eating disorders and other forms of self-harm . ",
        "the centre for advancing health found that `` high school students who believed themselves to be overweight were much more likely than their classmates to suffer from depression or commit suicide , '' according to psychology today , and about `` 65 percent of people with eating disorders say bullying contributed to their condition , '' according to national eating disorders . so , for kelly to be so glib about such a topic that can do so much damage is super offensive , to say the last . unsurprisingly , many people agree with my assessment : . unfortunately , i do n't think kelly will take the time to listen to her critics . ",
        "kelly has a long history of pissing people off and i think she gets a kick out of offending viewers , no matter how sad that might seem . of course , i hope that i 'm wrong . i hope that kelly will go on to educate her viewers on the dangers of fat-shaming , because it 's never ok in any capacity , especially when it comes from someone you love . check out romper 's new video series , romper 's doula diaries : watch full episodes of romper 's doula diaries on facebook watch .
