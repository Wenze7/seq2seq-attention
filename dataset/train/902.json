        "athens , greece -- lawmakers in greece are set to limit the powers of islamic courts operating in a border region that is home to a 100,000-strong muslim minority . backed by parliament 's largest political parties , the draft law is set to be voted on later tuesday . the proposal aims to scrap rules dating back more than 90 years ago and which refer many civil cases involving members of the muslim community to sharia law courts . the new legislation will give greek courts priority in all cases . the changes -- considered long overdue by many greek legal experts -- follow a complaint to the council of europe 's court of human rights over an inheritance dispute by a muslim woman who lives in the northeastern greek city of komotini . ",
        "legislation concerning minority rights was based on international treaties following wars in the aftermath of the ottoman empire 's collapse . the muslim minority in greece is largely turkish speaking . minority areas were visited last month by turkish president recep tayyip erdogan . greek governments in the past have been reluctant to amend minority rights , as many disputes between greece and turkey remain unresolved . currently , islamic court hearings are presided over by a single official , a state-appointed muslim cleric . in parliament tuesday , constantine gavroglou , minister of education and religious affairs , praised opposition party support for the bill .

        "`` this is not just a technical adjustment , it 's a very important day for parliament ... because of the broad support that is key when addressing issues of democracy and people 's rights , '' he told lawmakers . '' stem from policies that were hostile toward the minority and sought to create second class citizens . `` the extreme right golden dawn party opposed the bill , arguing that it failed to adequately outline what powers would be retained by islamic courts , and did not address the issue of locally-elected clerics who operate in an unofficial but influential capacity .
