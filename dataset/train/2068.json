        "foxborough , mass. . -- give 'em a hand : tom brady and the new england patriots are heading back to the super bowl . brady shook off a hand injury and threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to danny amendola with 2:48 remaining , rallying the patriots to a 24-20 comeback victory over the jacksonville jaguars in the afc championship sunday . brady , wearing a black bandage on his right hand after needing stitches to close a cut that happened on a play during practice earlier in the week , showed no signs of being hampered . and , with the game -- and the season -- possibly on the line , the patriots star came up big again . ",
        "`` i 've had a lot worse , '' brady said . `` i did n't know that on wednesday . it was a crazy injury . wednesday , thursday , friday was a little scary . then i started getting some confidence and today we did just enough to win . `` brady finished 26 of 38 for 290 yards and two touchdowns to amendola for the patriots , who 'll play philadelphia in minneapolis on feb. . 4 . it 's the eighth super bowl appearance for brady and coach bill belichick , who have won five times -- including last year 's 34-28 overtime rally against the atlanta falcons . ",
        "`` it 's pretty amazing . just to be on a team that wins these kinds of games , it 's just a great accomplishment , '' brady said . `` i 'm just so proud of everyone on our team , we made so many great plays . defense played so great when they needed to . `` blake bortles and the jaguars led 20-10 early in the fourth quarter , but could n't hold against the defending champions . the nfl 's second-ranked defense kept brady and the patriots at bay for most of the game , but lost linebacker myles jack and defensive tackle marcell dareus on consecutive plays on new england 's winning drive . ",
        "`` it 's a locker room obviously with a lot of pain , '' jaguars coach doug marrone said . `` i 'm sure they 're hurting inside . i 'm hurting . the players are hurting . `` with new england trailing 20-17 , amendola returned a punt 20 yards to put the ball at the jaguars 30 . brady hit james white for 15 yards , amendola for 8 and then the quarterback ran up the middle for 2 yards and a first down . on first-and-goal from the 5 , white ran for a yard to set up the go-ahead score from brady to amendola . ",
        "jacksonville -- looking to reach the super bowl for the first time in franchise history -- had one more shot , but bortles ' throw on fourth-and-15 to dede westbrook was knocked away by stephon gilmore . `` guys are upset , '' bortles said . `` it 's not what anybody expects -- contrary to popular belief . those guys fully expected to win that game . `` the patriots ran out the clock , with dion lewis ' 18-yard scamper with 90 seconds remaining sealing the victory . and they played most of the game without tight end rob gronkowski , who left late in the first half and did n't return . ",
        "brady 's hand was the most-scrutinized body part in boston since his ankle before the 2008 super bowl , and red sox pitcher curt schilling 's right ankle tendon -- the bloody sock -- in the 2004 playoffs . brady hurt his right hand during practice earlier in the week . `` of all the plays , my season was n't going to end on a handoff in practice , '' brady said . `` mentally , it probably stressed him out a bit , '' amendola said . `` it 's hard to throw a football with stitches in your thumb . ",
        "everybody knows how tough he is . `` some patriots fans were worried , but not belichick . `` he 's a tough guy , we all know that , '' belichick said . `` but we 're not talking about open heart surgery here . `` brady warmed up without a glove on his hand , and he came out throwing . he completed his first six passes for 57 yards to march the patriots down the field . the drive stalled when brady was sacked by dante fowler jr. , and new england settled for stephen gostkowski 's 31-yard field goal . ",
        "a wide-open marcedes lewis gave the jaguars a 7-3 lead 45 seconds into the second quarter with a 4-yard touchdown catch from bortles . leonard fournette gave jacksonville a 14-3 lead midway through the second quarter with a 4-yard td run , hushing the crowd at gillette stadium . the jaguars made some big mistakes just before halftime . bortles completed a 12-yard pass to lewis on third-and-7 from the patriots 44 , but jacksonville was called for delay of game . that wiped out a first down , and bortles was sacked by adam butler on the next play to force a punt . ",
        "jacksonville was called for six penalties that cost the jaguars 98 yards , while new england was penalized just once . with just over two minutes left before halftime , new england 's offense took over and the fans chanted `` braa-dy ! braa-dy ! `` and their quarterback delivered -- with some help from two big penalties . on first-and-10 from the patriots 40 , brady threw a long pass for gronkowski , who was injured when he got popped by barry church . church was called for unnecessary roughness , putting the ball at jacksonville 's 45 . ",
        "`` it was a tough call , '' church said , `` but you 've got to go with what they call . `` a. j. bouye was called for pass interference on the next play . the 32-yard penalty gave the patriots the ball at the jaguars 13 . after a 12-yard catch by cooks , white ran it in from the 1 to make it 14-10 . josh lambo gave jacksonville a 17-10 lead 4:37 into the third quarter with a 54-yard field goal . he added a 43-yarder 8 seconds into the fourth quarter to make it a 10-point game . ",
        "but brady & co. . were just getting started . after jacksonville went three-and-out following jack 's fumble recovery of lewis , brady and the patriots offense came out with a sense of urgency . they marched 85 yards on eight plays to cut it to a three-point deficit on amendola 's 9-yard td catch with 8:44 left . amendola had a 21-yard catch on third-and-18 from the patriots 25 early in the drive . `` big play in the game , '' brady said . `` ended up being a huge drive for us . `` few flags : the patriots ' one penalty against the jaguars is the fewest called on one team in a playoff game since the 2011 afc championship -- when the patriots were called for just one in a win over baltimore . ",
        "brady 's bounceback : brady 's passer rating during the first three quarters : 87.5 . in the fourth quarter , it was 136.3 . solid jaguars : bortles finished 23 of 36 for 293 yards and a touchdown in his first afc title game . fournette had 76 yards rushing on 24 carries . ___ more ap nfl : and .
