        "hong kong - a chinese aircraft leasing company said on thursday it will buy 50 airbus a320neo jets for $ 5.42 billion as part of a drive to capitalise on ever-growing demand for air travel in china . hong kong-listed china aircraft leasing group will take delivery of the airliners in stages through to 2023 , it said in a statement . the move comes as airlines in china benefit from a boom in domestic and international air trips as the country 's middle class spends more on travel and leisure . it will also come as a boost to european giant airbus , which is competing heavily with us rival boeing in china , the world 's second aircraft market .
