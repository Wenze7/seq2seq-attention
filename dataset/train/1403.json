        "authored by jeff thomas via internationalman . com , over the years , i 've often been asked to explain the political party system in a simple , easy-to-grasp way . several years ago , i came up with the following explanation , and , for some people , it 's helped to remove the complexity and smoke and mirrors created by the political world . let 's see if you agree . picture this : you live in a relatively small town . it 's a good place to live , with most townspeople being mutually supportive and often quite helpful . ",
        "there are just a few local restaurants , each owned and operated by your fellow townsmen . you go out to eat often , to support your community . then , one day , in an old brick commercial building in the centre of town , with two vacant storefronts , you see signs announcing the opening of a new pizza shop in one of the vacant spaces . it will be called `` blue pizza . '' when it opens , the manager advises customers that the owner is a staunch blue party supporter , and , each month , the owner plans to dedicate much of the profits from the shop to blue candidates . ",
        "you vote blue in each election , so , you make a point of frequenting the shop and feel good that your meals are benefitting the blue party . soon , many of the other blue supporters in town flock to the shop , regularly buying pizza . red supporters , however , are a bit disgruntled and rarely go in for a pizza . then , one day , signs appear in the other vacant storefront , announcing the opening of `` red pizza . '' it 's immediately popular with red party voters , as the manager advises customers that the owner intends to donate a major portion of the profits to red party candidates . ",
        "although the owners never seem to be present , the two managers are quite vocal regarding the political support by their respective shops . soon , business increases dramatically for both pizza shops . half the town frequents blue pizza ; the other half frequents red pizza . townspeople go as often as possible , wanting to lend as much support as they can . over time , the pre-existing local restaurants are having a hard time making ends meet , as they 're seeing far fewer customers . one by one , they fold . townspeople regret the closures , but , with each closure , they increase their commitment to their chosen pizza shop . ",
        "each group of patrons insists that its shop 's pizza is better pizza , and rumours begin to circulate that the other shop serves pizza with substandard ingredients that are unhealthy . the other pizza is not only less desirable , but a danger to the community . as each election time approaches , townspeople go all out , ordering pizza as often as they can , in order to help their chosen candidates to get elected . altercations often break out between younger customers , on the street in front of the shops . the townspeople become divided like never before . ",
        "a resident , who once got on fairly well with his neighbour , now looks at him with resentment and even anger , when he sees him enter the opposing shop . the townspeople become highly polarized and begin to see each other as the enemy . although actual violence is minimal , the former sense of community , in which neighbours looked after one another , deteriorates . people in the workplace find that they 're taking up sides far more than they once did , and , in the same place of work , blue and red groupings often define whether co-workers can work together effectively . ",
        "one day , someone from out of town is visiting for a few days . he 's intrigued by the considerable business being done by the two pizza shops and the polarization that 's developed in the once-harmonious town . out of curiosity , he goes to each shop and orders a slice of pizza . he 's surprised to find that they look and taste exactly the same . he then visits the real estate office that handles the building and asks the realtor if any other space has been rented in the building recently . the realtor mentions that the office space above the two shops was rented at about the same time as the shops themselves . ",
        "that night , at closing time for the two pizza shops , the visitor sits on a bench across the street from the shops , staring at the building . a local notices him and asks , `` what are you looking at ? '' the visitor says , `` i 'm waiting to see what happens . have a seat . '' the local sits down and they both stare at the front of the brick building . eventually , they see the manager of blue pizza shut off the lights , lock up the front door , and enter the door that leads to the upstairs office . ",
        "moments later , the manager of red pizza does the same . the two people on the bench stare into the lighted office above the pizza shops , where a man , presumably the owner , sits at a desk . as the managers arrive upstairs , they place their proceeds from the day into one pile . the three men count out the money , and the owner makes a record of the total take for the day . they then sit back , have a beer , and joke together . the owner places the proceeds into his valise and the three men exit the building , driving away in separate directions . ",
        "and that 's essentially the system of democracy . in bygone eras , kings ruled vast areas of countryside . they fed off the people and were understandably resented and even hated by them . then , along came democracy . it was often created from the bottom up , by a people who were fed up at having their lives ruled by usurpers who allowed them few choices and limited opportunity . but , in virtually every country , the system was co-opted by those who sought power . not surprisingly , they sought power for their own gain , not the benefit of the people . ",
        "ironically , the democratic system has been far more effective for the rulers than the monarchic system . by creating the illusion that the people have a choice , the rulers and their flunkies can extract far more from the people , without inciting revolt , than was previously possible in the monarchic system . political leaders are therefore far more loyal to the system than they are to those who voted for them . a thousand years ago , in the `` dark '' ages , a worker paid his tithe to the feudal lord . the standard tithe was `` one day 's labour in ten , '' or ten percent of his earnings . ",
        "today , although the average serf has modern distractions , such as smart phones and flat-screen tvs , he pays a far higher percentage of the fruits of his labour in an endless plethora of federal , state , and local taxes and government departmental fees . for both blue pizza and red pizza , revenue has never been better , and the cost of a slice is certain to rise further . hopefully the lesson to be learned is to avoid being distracted by the colour of the pizza shop , but to focus instead on the fellow in the office above .
