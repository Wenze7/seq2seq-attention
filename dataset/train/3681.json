        "america 's internal revenue service has gone fishing . its target ? every single coinbase user who ever placed a $ 20,000 trade . the huge dragnet exercise , spanning 2013 -- 2015 and incorporating over 14,000 users , was awarded by a court yesterday , november 29 . this is despite the best efforts of america 's largest bitcoin broker , which has fought back against what it sees as a shameless data grab and privacy violation . in a bid to save face , coinbase has claimed a `` partial victory '' in its running battle with the irs . ",
        "deep sea fishing on a taxpayer missionthere 's no such thing as a quiet day in bitcoin . the last 24 hours has witnessed record-breaking trading volume , widespread exchange outages , all-time-highs , the largest red candle ever witnessed on a btc chart and the fastest recovery in dollar terms ever seen . much of that drama circled around coinbase , a broker which dominates the bitcoin market , both in the u. s. and abroad . whilst dealing with unprecedented demand , with traffic levels hitting 8x their peak from june , the platform -- whose ios app has surged into the top ten , passing netflix and spotify -- has had its hands full fighting an ongoing dispute with the irs . ",
        "coinbase has been pushing back against what it believes to be an unjustified investigation into the actions of hundreds of thousands of its users . a pyrrhic victory for coinbasein a blogpost filed november 29 , coinbase claimed a `` partial victory '' over the irs , though many commenters would be less charitable , and award the latest round to the taxman . coinbase was nevertheless keen to stress reasons to be happy , noting : thanks to coinbase 's efforts , more than 480,000 customers ' records were preserved from disclosure . this is a 97 % reduction in the number of customers impacted by this summons . ",
        "second , the quantity of data we must produce for the approximately 14,000 customers who remain in scope has been significantly reduced . in what could be interpreted as sarcasm , ceo brian armstrong tweeted the following : the coinbase case stems from tax authorities realizing there was a woefully low number of tax returns being filed that included gains due on virtual currencies , despite their soaring popularity . to atone for this reporting black hole , the irs took it upon itself to do some digging , and by digging read : investigate the finances of half a million coinbase customers . ",
        "in defense of the exchange and its customers , cryptocurrencies , as an emerging asset class , were vaguely defined at the time , and it would be unrealistic to have expected americans to include them in their tax returns en masse . the latest narrow summons request now pertains to 14,355 account holders who bought , sold , sent , or received more than $ 20,000 between 2013 and 2015 . the irs filing specifies `` far fewer , but still more than 10,000 , coinbase account holders . '' gross governmental overreachyesterday , a california court ruled in the irs ' favor , almost a year after the case was first filed . ",
        "while coinbase has tried to spin the ruling as a victory , it may prove to be a pyrrhic one that will leave the bitcoin broker licking its wounds and counting the cost . financially coinbase is fine , with record customer numbers , trading volume , traffic , and every other metric that constitutes a thriving business . the greatest loss the company faces however is one of trust . despite coinbase struggling valiantly against the irs , it will now be forced to hand over a swathe of customer data . had a similar request been granted spanning the present day , it would have effectively included every single customer who ever bought or sold more than 2 btc at a time . ",
        "despite being accused of gross overreach , the irs has remained undaunted . the court ruling sends out a clear warning to u. s. customers : buy or sell even moderate quantities of cryptocurrency , and the authorities will be watching . court ruling grants the irs personal data of 14,000 coinbase users - bitcoin newsamerica 's internal revenue service has gone fishing . its target ? every single coinbase user who ever placed a $ 20,000 ... news . bitcoin . com #crowdsalenetwork #crowdsale #networking #blockchain #bitcoin #ethereum #litecoin #neo #waves #enecuum #cryptocurrency #cryptobusiness #smarttech #business #franchise #bitnews #coins #tokens #ico #projects #startups #newlife #profit #vq #vqeducation #smarteye #trading #bittrex #poloniex #csn .
