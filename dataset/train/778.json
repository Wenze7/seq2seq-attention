        "tunis - hundreds of tunisians took to the streets of the capital and the coastal city of sfax on friday , waving yellow cards and demanding that the government reverse austerity measures . more than 200 young people rallied in tunis following a call from the fech nestannew campaign for a major protest against the measures imposed at the start of the year . they held up yellow cards and chanted slogans amid a major deployment of riot police as they marched on administrative offices in the capital . `` the people want the finance act repealed '' and `` the people are fed up with the new trabelsi '' , they shouted , referring to the graft-tainted in-laws of ousted president zine el abidine ben ali . ",
        "`` we believe that dialogue and reforms are still possible , '' said henda chennaoui of the fech nestannew campaign . `` we 've got the same demands we 've been seeking for years -- to tackle real problems like the economic crisis and the high cost of living , '' she told afp . friday 's demonstrations came ahead of the seventh anniversary of ben ali 's ouster on january 14 , 2011 . in sfax , some 200 kilometres south of tunis , around 200 people vented their anger over rising prices , an afp correspondent reported . ",
        "`` the people 's money is in the palaces , and the children of the people are in the prisons , '' read one placard . authorities said friday the number of people detained in the wave of violent protests had risen to nearly 800 , after a provincial town was hit by a night of unrest over the austerity measures . an afp correspondent in the northern town of siliana said police fired tear gas at dozens of youths who pelted them with stones during skirmishes that lasted around three hours overnight . interior ministry spokesman khalifa chibani said 151 people were arrested thursday , taking the number detained for alleged involvement in the violence to 778 after several nights of unrest . ",
        "- ` heavy-handed methods ' - chibani said clashes between youths and police were `` limited '' and `` not serious '' , and insisted no acts of violence , theft or looting were recorded thursday evening . friday 's demonstrations were reported to be peaceful . rights group amnesty international accused the authorities of using `` increasingly heavy-handed methods to disperse rallies and subsequently arrest protesters '' during the unrest . `` tunisian security forces must refrain from using excessive force and end their use of intimidation tactics against peaceful demonstrators , '' the watchdog said . the united nations expressed concern at the number of arrests , and urged the authorities to ensure people can protest peacefully . ",
        "one man died in the unrest on monday night , but the authorities have insisted the police were not responsible for this . a number of left-wing activists have been arrested by the authorities after officials accused them of fuelling the violence . several dozen members of the popular front party demonstrated friday in front of a court in the town of gafsa after the arrest of several local activists , an afp correspondent said . tunisia is considered a rare success story of the arab spring uprisings that began in the north african country in 2011 and spread across the region , toppling autocrats . ",
        "but the authorities have failed to resolve the issues of poverty and unemployment . a spokesman for the prime minister in a statement said the protesters were `` thugs aged between 17 and 21 who are not affected by the impact of the finance law '' . political scientist hamza meddeb said there was `` very strong social anger '' over a `` political class increasingly cut off from the population '' and because protests had not yet resulted in any concrete improvement . protests are common in tunisia in january , when people mark the anniversary of the revolution that ousted long-time dictator ben ali . ",
        "the authorities on friday said four people had been arrested after a petrol bomb attack on wednesday damaged the entrances of two talmudic schools in a jewish district of djerba . the interior ministry said the aim of the perpetrators was to `` sow chaos like that recorded in some parts of the country '' .
