        "it 's incredible that it has come to this , but the world may now be in jack dorsey 's hands . that is not hyperbole . president donald trump is using twitter to lob threats of nuclear war at north korean leader kim jong un . those within trump 's own orbit reportedly worry about the start of an accidental war . twitter 's role here is undeniable . the president now rarely speaks publicly . twitter is his only outlet . and when trump tweets , the world responds . twitter and dorsey are the only ones who can do much about this , but they 've declined to do so , saying that trump has not violated the terms of service of the company . ",
        "well , screw your terms of service , mr. dorsey . and that goes for youtube , facebook , and every other tech company that has written their own `` rules '' for what can and ca n't happen on their platforms . `` tos , '' as these rules are now commonly known , have always been the go-to excuse for platforms struggling to police all the terrible stuff that ends up on their network . whatever happens , companies can just point to their tos as if it were some sacred text handed down from on high . ",
        "not that the terms ca n't be revised to address any situation . in the past few years , companies have started to crack down on acts that were previously allowed . twitter finally addressed some of the constant abuse hurled at women and minorities on its platform . reddit , once a fount of particularly vile racism and misogyny , shut down some of its worst subreddits . facebook is starting to address fake news . these acts were almost always preceded by changes to the tos that justified the companies ' actions . companies rewrite the rules in order to punish the people who fall on the wrong side of the new way of things . ",
        "they are the definition of arbitrary . and then there 's logan paul . platforms also use tos rules as a way to absolve themselves of responsibility , excusing them from having hosted particularly terrible stuff . youtube is still under fire after one of its biggest stars , logan paul , posted a video that included graphic footage of a person who had committed suicide . the video remained up for around 24 hours and received millions of likes before being taken down -- apparently by paul . youtube 's response was to basically say that paul broke the rules , so it 's not their fault . ",
        "this has become something of a pattern in the past year , with youtube first being notified by the media of particularly disturbing content -- usually targeted at young people -- and then taking it down with the justification that it violated its tos . youtube hosted dark cartoons on its kids app and thousands of videos depicting what most reasonable people would call child abuse . step back here for a moment . youtube had thousands of videos of child abuse on its platform and has faced little , if any , blowback . why ? the company has argued that such videos violate its tos , so the people who made and uploaded those videos bear responsibility . ",
        "youtube 's aim is to have the rules , not necessarily enforce them . all the loopholes . making matters worse , the tos rules are gameable . twitter 's are particularly so , noted john herrman in a recent column for the new york times magazine . `` a service like twitter all but demands bad faith : it 's a place where fresh identities can be created and performed , often anonymously , and the stakes are only as high as the value you ascribe to not being banned , '' he wrote . twitter has been tying itself in knots to justify its actions , many of which come off as illogical or contradictory to its past efforts and explanations . ",
        "to wit : in the wake of the trump 's tweet , many observed that `` violent '' speech is n't policed on consistent terms . jessi hempel 's question , asked by many people in the last 24 hours , gets to the absurdity of twitter 's use of tos . twitter changed the rules so that it can better justify banning people who abuse other users . how then could it be ok with what could arguably be the single greatest piece of abuse in human history : the president threatening to nuke someone . if terms of service do n't already seem entirely arbitrary , just look at twitter 's new rules , which have been almost entirely written in the past year . ",
        "they appear to have been built with trump in mind . government accounts are n't subject to the rules , and there 's a hefty berth given to `` newsworthiness . '' aside from a rule explicitly saying that the president is not allowed to threaten nuclear war , there 's just not a good way to address the insanity of what we 're witnessing . donald trump can do this , but is there any legitimate argument that he should be able to do this ? maybe there is , but it 's not going to be found in a tos . ",
        "it 's a judgement call that should be made by the people who are running the company . it should be made by jack dorsey . but trump and paul are outliers . they command huge audiences and have a penchant for getting attention from fans and haters alike . people like them are inevitably going to be difficult for companies to handle regardless of whatever terms are in place . heck , tos work just fine for most users in creating some sort of reasonably agreed upon playing field . this is not to say that tos should be entirely eliminated -- they give us a general idea of what 's considered fair play . ",
        "the major folly here is acting as if every single user on a platform is the same . they 're not , and people like trump and paul are clearly in a different class from the rest of us . they demand special consideration in response to their actions . anybody can threaten nuclear war . it 's only a legitimate threat when it comes from the president . should youtube ban paul ? who 's to say ? tos are not enforced in a court of law . they 're applied by companies that are legally obligated to shareholders to make money . ",
        "not only is it not in the interest of youtube to push paul off its platform , it 's not even in their interest to try to put in place a legitimate system of checks to ensure he ca n't put horrendous content in front of millions of children . and when that does happen , there 's the tos to absolve the company of any wrongdoing . he broke the rules . turns out , there 's not a tos rule against allowing this to happen in the first place . the trump clause . at this point , trump might just be untouchable based on the tos , which is maybe the most refreshing version of twitter 's rules yet . ",
        "let 's just call it what it is . twitter can do whatever they want with their platform . there 's your tos . it wants trump . you might not agree , but that 's fine . in reality , the tos are whatever twitter decides to do at that moment . if trump calls for an individual journalist to be killed , maybe twitter/dorsey says that 's over the line . it 's really not that hard to imagine this scenario at this point or twitter taking that step . and if they want to ban him after something like that , they can ban him . ",
        "just do n't pretend like it 's a tos thing . screw your tos , jack . it 's your choice to make .   "
