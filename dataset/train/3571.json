        "here we are , a week after new year 's , and let 's be honest : you 're a failure . this was the year you were going to join the gym , change your diet and lose some weight . by now , though , many people -- probably you included -- have failed at their resolutions and soon , like all the years before , most of the other resolution-makers will join them in that failure . a study out of the university of scranton found that the great majority of people , around 80 percent , ultimately break their new year 's vows . ",
        "but is it your fault you ca n't lose weight ? let 's review . two days after you resolved to house green shakes and vegetables with every meal , something called a `` bomb cyclone '' hit your area . you diligently went to the store before the storm and stocked up on the bread , eggs and milk everyone else seemed to be buying . what were you supposed to do but make french toast with that for every meal of the snow-in ? and then follow that up by eating all the food in your refrigerator . ",
        "it 's cold ; food keeps you warm . ruling : not your fault . you 've also continued to knock back the alcohol well past the holidays . celebrity trainer jillian michaels says , `` when you 're trying to lose weight , alcohol is the no . 1 enemy . '' look , it 's hard to get back into the swing of things after the holidays . one minute you 're wearing glitter eyeshadow and dancing under a mistletoe , the next everyone 's christmas tree is in a pile on the curb and all the twinkly lights on your block have been replaced by the usual blinking street lamp . ",
        "it 's depressing ! you actually need a drink now more than you did when everyone was joyously exchanging gifts . maybe we as a society need to rethink when we do the majority of our yearly boozing , but it 's still time to put down that manhattan . ruling : somewhat your fault . you have children and even though you 're eating salad for every meal they continue to demand that you feed them non-lettuce items . so you make the mac-n-cheese , the grilled cheese , the spaghetti with butter -- and then when they do n't finish it all , you do . ",
        "you have no time to go to the gym because there are these little people demanding all of your time and attention . you feel guilty when you leave them to go work out and guilty when you do n't . you 're not alone . about 50 percent of gym-goers give up by end of january . ruling : a little bit your fault . lisa reisner , a registered dietitian in long island who runs the instagram account @therealisticdietitian , actually agrees that our inability to lose weight is not entirely our fault . while she does say that `` the only way to get healthy and lose weight is to change your lifestyle , '' she also acknowledges that `` people 's lives are incredibly busy . ",
        "`` we 're working full-time , have kids , laundry , food shopping , a million errands and stressors . it 's really hard to change your lifestyle . '' she tells me that the problem comes down to time . `` it takes time to cook and prepare healthy food , it takes time and energy to exercise , and no one has that time . '' denver-based nutritionist ellie kempton tells me that expectations matter . `` if you ca n't imagine doing something for at least five years or the rules of the diet make socialization complicated , it 's going to go down in the books as one more diet instead of your newfound lifestyle that breeds permanent and deep transformation . '' ",
        "of course , most people are n't thinking that far ahead when they make their farfetched pledges to lose 10 pounds in the first two weeks of the new year . setting better expectations would go a long way . but do n't stop making the resolutions altogether . the university of scranton study that found people do n't keep their resolutions also found that just making the resolutions is a positive experience . as psychology today put it , `` the study found that people who made resolutions were 10 times more likely to make a positive change after six months compared to people who wanted to change but did not make a new year 's resolution . ",
        "so there is some evidence that making a resolution is worthwhile . '' so maybe it 's not entirely your fault that you ca n't lose weight , and the fact that you 're trying is to be celebrated . just do n't celebrate it with a doughnut and a glass of wine .   "
