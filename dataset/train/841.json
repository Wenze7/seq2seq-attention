        "antonio conte has confirmed michy batshuayi will be free to leave chelsea on loan this month if they sign a new striker . chelsea are currently locked in talks with roma about the signing of edin dzeko and his arrival would only push batshuayi further down the pecking order . batshuayi has been heavily linked with a loan move away this month and for the first time conte has confirmed the 24-year-old will be allowed to find regular playing time elsewhere . `` it 's the same as kenedy , '' the london evening standard quote conte as saying . ",
        "`` if arrives another striker , then batshuayi will go on loan . `` i think he wants to have the opportunity to play with regularity . i think this is right . `` if we stay with the same players from the start of the season , it does n't change . one player goes out , one player comes in . one player comes in , one player goes out . `` but , in this case , i do n't want to send away any player . but a lot of time it 's the player saying he prefers to go away to have the possibility to play regularly . ",
        "then you have to show you deserve to play every game . '' batshuayi has failed to win over conte 's trust since joining from marseille in a deal worth more than Â£ 30m in 2016 and on saturday made just his fourth league start of the season . the belgium international is the only chelsea player that has scored in all four competitions this season , netting eight goals in the process .
