        "now that 2018 has arrived , it wo n't be long before the giants send their equipment truck to arizona , the faithful gather at at&t park for fanfest , and pitchers and catchers report to scottsdale stadiumone teensy detail needs to be worked out : who is going to man their outfield ? with less than six weeks before the giants open spring training , the five outfielders on their 40-man roster are hunter pence , jarrett parker , mac williamson , gorkys hernandez and austin slater . the giants still want to add a corner outfielder , a center fielder or both , but the front office is operating in trade and free-agent markets that have been gridlocked all winter . ",
        "while fans are antsy to get the roster filled , general manager bobby evans is not . `` all of us want to make sure that we 're getting the best possible options out there , and we 're not really focused on the calendar , '' evans said thursday . evans has little reason to grab the phone and make a panic trade or signing because the outfielders he wants have not been signed or traded . `` i think our options are still very satisfying , '' evans said . player movement has been nearly nonexistent mostly because the usual big-spending teams , including the giants , hope to slide under the $ 197 million payroll threshold for the 2018 luxury tax . ",
        "demand for players also has been stifled by a growing number of teams taking a step back in 2018 to compete in 2019 and beyond , bigger penalties for signing one of the nine free agents who got qualifying offers , and more teams attempting to get younger by trying out their own prospects . free agents and teams with players to trade continue to ask for more money and prospects than the buyers want to lay out , with the luxury-tax issue adding complications . take outfielder andrew mccutchen , whom the giants have discussed acquiring from the pirates . ",
        "mccutchen has one year at $ 14.5 million left on his contract . in past years that would be considered a bargain , but to get him the giants would have to surrender at least one high-level prospect and leap a lot closer to the tax threshold . the giants gained wiggle room by trading matt moore to the rangers and including denard span in the evan longoria deal with tampa bay . the giants have had on-and-off talks with the reds for center fielder billy hamilton , while the brewers have let teams know they would move young , potent right fielder domingo santana or center fielder keon broxton . ",
        "sources say other outfielders who have not been mentioned in offseason rumors are available , too . the giants have looked into free-agent outfielders jay bruce and j. d. martinez , among others . evans said the club remains committed to improving outfield defense , which could be achieved by giving the center-field job to prospect steven duggar , a long shot . without introducing prospects into the mix , the giants might have get better without getting younger . every projected opening day position player on the current roster , besides joe panik , will be at least 30 next year . ",
        "in their quest to compete rather than rebuild , they might have be able to pick and choose outfielders in their 20s . `` getting younger for the sake of getting younger has never been the goal , '' evans said . `` the goal for us is to get better and stronger and have sustained success . `` henry schulman is a san francisco chronicle staff writer . email : hschulman@sfchronicle . com twitter : @hankschulmanarlington , tx - september 09 : andrew mccutchen # 22 of the pittsburgh pirates at rangers ballpark in arlington on september 9 , 2013 in arlington , texas .
