        "the ninth , 10th and 11th spare the air alerts of the season were issued thursday by the bay area air quality management district for friday , december 22 through christmas eve . oakland -- the ninth , 10th and 11th spare the air alerts of the season were issued thursday by the bay area air quality management district for friday , december 22 through christmas eve . representatives from the district say that dry , stagnant weather has created a high-pressure system over the bay area and is forecast to trap smoke near the ground and wood smoke is expected to build up in the region . ",
        "wood smoke is the major source of air pollution in the bay area in the wintertime and is especially harmful to children , the elderly and people with respiratory conditions , the district said . these alerts ban the burning of wood , manufactured logs or any other solid fuel . this means wood burning both indoors and outdoors is illegal during this multi-day alert . the only exception is for homes without permanently installed heating where woodstoves or fireplaces are the only source of heat . open-hearth fireplaces are no longer an exemption . air levels will range from moderate to unhealthy for sensitive groups from today until tuesday .
