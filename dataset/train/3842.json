        "telstra 's digital transformation is more about enabling its teams to continually make changes to improve customer experience by using the agile methodology than it is about a single it project , telstra cio john romano has told zdnet . according to romano , there are three key elements underpinning telstra 's digitisation : improving customer experience or the experience of those providing customer service ; building this on a digital platform ; and delivering these in an agile way . `` this is not about it transformation , this is not about a project ... this is about how we continually deliver innovations , improvements , making things better , all those sort of things on those digital platforms for customers , '' he said . ",
        "`` it 's not one project in this , it 's lots of innovations , and the beauty of establishing an environment where we have proper agile ways of working is that it 's this constant innovation . `` the emphasis is therefore currently on building out the digital platforms telstra is using , but this is being done in order to fundamentally shift the way its people work , romano explained . according to the cio , salesforce and servicenow are the most important parts of its architectural stack , but it is also working with cloudsense and provisioning engines like amdocs . ",
        "this involves flying in and out experts from those companies to work alongside telstra 's teams to help coach them on using these technologies . `` we have to get the right architecture and platforms in place , and it has to be something that 's led by the customer or the people , '' he said . `` the key is they 're cloud-based , they 're modern , and they allow our digital ways of working to work on the digital platform quickly , reliance and performance is strong on those platforms , and the interfaces into other platforms is much simpler . ",
        "`` we 're building it but utilising expertise from around the world . `` telstra 's teams then have the authority to immediately make changes without needing to go up the hierarchy for approval , with the goal of constant improvement . `` it 's not about an individual coming up with an idea ; it 's about the team having the authority to implement something that makes a big difference , '' romano told zdnet . `` the ability for teams to implement immediately and not to be controlled by managers on what they can and ca n't do makes a big difference . ",
        "`` getting tech , business , and product teams to work together has also been a major emphasis during the project , he said , which the telco ensures by collocating such teams together . romano spoke to five initiatives that have been delivered so far under telstra 's au$ 3 billion investment in transformation , around au$ 2 billion of which was allocated to digitisation . get help , which provides an automated national broadband network fault restoration process , has reduced call times and field technician visits by 55 percent due to improved diagnostic capabilities , with romano calling it `` a big change '' . ",
        "it has also enabled customers to use a single online service to report and solve issues . notify , which has replaced around 100 customer messaging platforms with one , and service status , a page that has been updated with more accurate information on network outages , were `` small innovations that have made a big impact '' , the cio said . `` it 's not about one big bang that 's going to change the experience ; it 's about lots of things that are going to change the experience , '' he explained . telstra connect and expert finder , meanwhile , are more focused at enterprise customers . ",
        "the former is a native business app combining 50 online portals for customer service , while the latter provides business customers with the ability to contact experts through a tool on telstra . com to solve technical issues . `` connect is that front-line ability for an enterprise customer to be served from one single look and feel , '' he said . `` the expert finder again is a little initiative that makes a big difference , the ability to find expertise simply online . `` romano also labelled the use of artificial intelligence as an `` enabler '' of improving certain aspects of customer experience rather than as a be-all and end-all in technology . ",
        "`` it 's an enabler , it 's not the solution . the solution is the right process , the right experience for the customer , and ai is a capability that we have today that can enable that , '' he said . for instance , telstra is currently using ai and machine learning to predict what 's going to happen in the network , examine events that are affecting customers , and forecast the time to restore services in the event of an outage . for the future , romano said telstra is continuing to work on transformation projects , including how to better utilise salesforce as its crn to improve customer experience . ",
        "`` there 's a whole range of initiatives , many , many things are under way at the moment , but the emphasis i think is the digitisation team , '' he said . `` giving the authority , the trust , the power , the ability to make decisions at the front end for a customer is powerful . `` related coveragetelstra ceo : 2018 will be big for 5gthe rollout of commercial 5g networks could begin in 2019 if standardisation and technologies are set during 2018 , telstra ceo andy penn has said , adding that telstra is a world leader in the space .
