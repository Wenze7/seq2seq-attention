        "rsk labs has finally mined its genesis block and formally launched its long-awaited bitcoin-based smart contract platform and sidechain on the mainnet . while still in beta with limited distribution , the new rsk sidechain is expected to offer significant scaling benefits to the bitcoin network . news . bitcoin . com caught up with ceo diego gutierrez zaldivar to find out more details . rsk mined its genesis blockafter nearly 3 years of preparation , rsk labs has finally mined its genesis block at 1:41 am cst on january 4 , 2018 . `` we 're very excited to share the rsk mainnet network with the global community , '' commented rsk labs ceo diego gutierrez zaldivar . ",
        "`` it 's a great milestone for the company after years of hard work , but this is not only ours , it 's a community success . '' the first bitcoin-powered smart contract platform is now live on the mainnet . the source code for rsk 's first mainnet version , codenamed bamboo , was released for peer review in early december , as news . bitcoin . com previously reported . along with the mining of the genesis block , the company re-promoted on thursday its `` bug bounty program to reward security experts and work with the global developer community feedback , and a full getting started guide for business partners and dapp developers . '' ",
        "in an exclusive interview with news . bitcoin . com , zaldivar shared : we expect a big milestone to happen four months after the beta release when the security bounty programs are concluded . how the platform worksthe rsk network node and wallet client is available for download on github . the developers also offer a blockchain explorer and stats panel to observe the rsk network in real-time . other wallets for rsk , including versions by jaxx and myetherwallet , are being worked on . sergio lerner , rsk labs ' chief scientist , told news . bitcoin . ",
        "com in a previous interview , `` we think that rsk will be integrated into most bitcoin wallets in the future . '' zaldivar explained that there are currently no contract limits on the amount of bitcoin transacted over the bamboo sidechain . `` the only limit imposed is to the value held in the network as a whole , '' he noted , but added that `` in the future , when the network value is unrestricted we might impose per contract limits and progressively raise those limits as the technology matures . '' the ceo elaborated : initially only 21 smartbitcoins will circulate in the rsk mainnet beta and they will be allocated to the first 100 companies participating on the rsk incentive program . ",
        "although the peg between bitcoin and rsk will be fully functional , only white-listed addresses will be able to send bitcoins and get smartbitcoins in return . all funds from transactions originated on non-white listed addresses will be returned . `` we will incrementally add value at stake as the platform gets hardened until it is fully decentralized , '' he emphasized . scaling benefitsrsk could add scaling benefits to the bitcoin network , according to the developers . lerner told news . bitcoin . com that `` rsk can outperform bitcoin in transactions per second while still maintaining a high degree of decentralization . '' ",
        "the transactions are faster because `` standard rsk payments are much shorter than bitcoin payments , '' he elaborated . according to zaldivar , the speed of rsk 's sidechain allows for transactions many times faster than bitcoin 's current rate . `` rsk bamboo will , out of the gates , support around 100 transactions per second providing significant scalability vs. bitcoin , lowering transaction costs as a byproduct of this , '' he detailed . lerner concurred , noting : it will be a real boost to scaling bitcoin . however , this is not the same as scaling bitcoin because the security guarantees of smartbitcoins stored in rsk are different than of bitcoin . ",
        "eventually , the developers plan to scale rsk orders of magnitude further . `` as part of rsk roadmap , parallel processing of smart contracts , full node incentives and transaction compression will provide an additional increase of up to 2,000 transactions per second , '' zaldivar explained . `` those improvements combined with lumino off-chain technology built by the rsk team will enable processing of more than 20,000 transactions per second .
