        "positive train control -- the technology that can slow or stop a speeding train -- was n't in use on this stretch of track , according to amtrak 's president and co-chief executive , richard anderson . in 2015 , an amtrak train in philadelphia was travelling at twice the 80 km/h speed limit as it entered a sharp curve and derailed . eight people were killed and more than 200 were injured when the locomotive and four of the train 's seven passenger cars jumped the tracks . several cars overturned and ripped apart . stretch of track under scrutiny a track chart prepared by the washington state department of transportation shows the maximum speed drops from 128 km/h to 48 km/h for passenger trains just before the tracks curve to cross interstate 5 , which is where the train went off the tracks .

",
        "`` once we were coming up on that curve , the train slowed down considerably , '' he said , adding that `` in no way did it make me feel like we were going too fast . '' ` failing ' safety culture just last month , the ntsb chairman issued a scathing critique of amtrak 's culture , saying a future breakdown was likely , and the board made nine safety recommendations . `` amtrak 's safety culture is failing and is primed to fail again , until and unless amtrak changes the way it practises safety management , '' robert sumwalt said on nov. . ",
        "14 . sumwalt 's statement was made in conjunction with the ntsb 's findings into a fatal amtrak accident in april 2016 in pennsylvania that it said was caused by `` deficient safety management across many levels of amtrak and the resultant lack of a clear , consistent and accepted vision for safety . '' an amtrak train struck a backhoe tractor on railroad tracks in chester , penn. , killing two maintenance workers and injuring 41 . anderson also told reporters on monday that amtrak took ntsb recommendations from investigations `` very seriously '' and was continuing to make investments that the board recommended .

        "amtrak said in a memo to employees in november that was seen by reuters that it had been `` transforming our safety culture '' since the pennsylvania incident and had made numerous reforms , including to communication , training , safety efforts and creating a team that conducts safety audits . it also expanded drug and alcohol testing . legal challenge a community along the new rail line had tried to stop the project on grounds higher-speed passenger trains would endanger pedestrians and motorists . the city of lakewood , just north of the crash site , went to court in 2013 to stop the project . ",
        "opponents said the route would expose car and pedestrian traffic to faster trains at more than a half-dozen street-level crossings in lakewood . city officials asserted the state transportation department 's environmental review of the new route was inadequate and failed to consider traffic , neighbourhood and other impacts . in march 2014 , a judge dismissed the lawsuit and the track upgrade moved forward .
