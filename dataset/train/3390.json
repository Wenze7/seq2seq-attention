        "i have 48 unpublished , `` draft '' stories on medium . my ios notes app holds 17 additional drafts , 63 story ideas , and 97 article titles , most of which no longer mean anything to me . i have a pile of paper notebooks at home , chock-full of inspired sparks that never have , and never will , see the light of day . meanwhile , i published three articles or medium posts last year . at wax interactive , my teammates have the same problem . they 're a collection of talented , smart and witty individuals , with deep expertise in their fields and a broad range of interests , and each has thought-provoking stories to tell and ideas to share . ",
        "but we 're all too busy to write . writing matterswe all know that we need to write . communicating out to the world is an important part of our success as an agency . it can help our clients better understand who we are , how we think , and what we stand for . in this sense , our words can help differentiate us from our competitors , and attract more of the clients we want ... and less of those who are looking for something else . our articles and blog posts help us attract more of the clients we want , and less of those we do n't . ",
        "it works the same way for candidates : the more we reveal ourselves , the more we can hope to attract the kind of passionate , generous nonconformists that contribute so much to our clients ' success , and to ours . communicating outwards is key to all of this ... yet we 're all too busy . thankfully , we 're resourceful people , so we applied our own user-centered design approaches to fixing this problem . i had a conversation with pete , my most senior ux consultant last year , and we dug deep into his reasons for not writing . ",
        "`` too busy '' is an excuseit turns out that `` too busy '' is the story we tell ourselves ... but it 's not the real reason why we do n't write . pete was plagued with a series of unvoiced , uncomfortable obstacles : he was held back by perfectionism , weighed down by the expectations learned from higher education , overwhelmed by a mental concept of an `` article '' as a huge , comprehensive , perfect product that would be judged severely . he also was worried about his ability to write well , based on that same mental image of an article as formal writing . ",
        "he was also timid about writing in english . because of the confluence of these constraints , he 'd let all the urgent work take precedence over the important work of communicating out to the world . he was stuck , which caused shame , and the problem deepened over time . the conversationclearly , we needed to approach the writing effort differently . to begin with , we needed to stop thinking about it as `` writing '' . `` writing '' is the task , the scary , daunting , uncomfortable task that was standing in the way of accomplishing our goal , which is to communicate . ",
        "so pete and i tried something new and simple . i took him to lunch , and we had a chat about what he 's been up to . i turned on my phone 's audio recorder , and asked about what he 'd enjoyed the most in the last few months ... and it all came pouring out . pete is passionate about user research . he had fascinating `` war stories '' to tell about embedding himself with varied people in various jobs , to learn about how and why they perform , and about the psychology , diplomacy , and love that it takes to bear true witness to the struggles and dignity of people at work . ",
        "i was speechless . pete , who usually speaks in humble , simple words , was eloquent and passionate when it came to the work he loves . i just sat back and listened , and felt lifted and energized . after he was done , i told him : `` there 's your article . you just wrote it . i 'll email you the recording , and you can transcribe it . do n't worry about changing anything , it 's perfect like this . '' i did n't even have to bother emailing the recording . a few hours later , pete had written his article . ",
        "a few weeks later , it was published in a national magazine . radiance daysafter this resounding success , three other colleagues of mine . decided to take the plan further . since everybody was having the same problems around writing , perhaps we should all have conversations together , on the same day , and help each other write them down . those of us who are designers could help find visuals and draw up illustrations . the more bilingual of us could proofread the others ' english prose . our social media experts could help us with better titles , headlines , summaries and hashtags . ",
        "so we put together radiance days . once a month , we all get together , at a coffeehouse outside the office , for a half-day . in groups of two , we have twenty-minute conversations about what fascinates us , and we turn these conversations into articles , listicles , tweetstorms , videos , podcast episodes ... we edit each others ' work , we add value to each others ' work , and we push the final results into our publication schedule . no matter what , after three hours , we 've produced about fifteen pieces of content , ready to go out and tell our story to the world . ",
        "the wax team , radiating away . how 's it working ? i ca n't tell you yet , because i 'm writing this during our very first radiance day . but that 's the point of it all : this article is n't perfect , it is n't complete ... but it 's out . i 'll come back and update it next month , and make it better , but in the meantime it 's not stuck in my drafts , or on my notes app , or gathering dust in an old notebook . it 's out there in the world , where it may , as is my hope , provide some value to you , dear reader .
