        "but there 's less agreement amongst researchers about what can be done about it . `` loneliness is a major social , educational , economic , and health issue that will reach epidemic proportions by 2030 , '' says prof. stephen houghton of the university of western australia . `` at the moment there are no interventions . where are they ? i ca n't find any . `` loneliness is physically bad for youaccording to a feature in a recent issue of the journal of the american medical association , loneliness -- `` defined as a distressing discrepancy between desired and actual levels of social contact '' -- appears to be a serious health risk for issues like cardiovascular disease , alzheimer disease , stroke , and insomnia .

        "one study claims that the health impact of loneliness is the equivalent of smoking 15 cigarettes a day . nearly all the research indicates that loneliness can be devastating . it is believed , however , that the incidence of loneliness among the elderly has remained constant over the last 50 years at about 10 percent . but with the greying of the population , that percentile is due to change . `` one of the issues that we need to pay attention to is that loneliness and social isolation are different , '' says julianne holt-lunstad , of brigham young university in provo , utah .

'' so , what 's to be done ? and the issue lies not only quality of life , but in the health system , too . in the uk helen stokes-lampard , chair of the royal college of general practitioners , has warned that loneliness threatens to overwhelm the government health system . `` social isolation and loneliness are akin to a chronic long-term condition in terms of the impact they have on our patients ' health and wellbeing . gps see patients , many of whom are widowed , who have multiple health problems like diabetes , hypertension and depression , but often their main problem is n't medical , they 're lonely ... if nothing is done , loneliness will , inevitably , take its toll on the entire healthcare system .
