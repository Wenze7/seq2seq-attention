        "hb25 largely targets unions that lean left , exempting the few worker organizations that typically back the gopthis article originally appeared in in these times . florida republicans are pushing a bill designed to deal the state 's unions a death blow . house bill 25 , which was introduced by longwood state rep. scott plakon , would decertify any union in which 50 percent of the workers do n't pay dues , thus preventing them from being able to collectively bargain . despite the fact that unions negotiate for the benefit of all their workers , no employee is forced to pay dues in florida , because it 's a `` right to work '' state . ",
        "right to work policies are purposely constructed to reduce the resources of organized labor , as many workers realize they can benefit from their union 's collective bargaining efforts without giving them any money . in practice , hb25 largely targets unions that lean left , exempting the few worker organizations that typically back the gop : firefighter , police and corrections unions . this same exact move was just attempted by state republicans . hb11 was the effectively the same bill , but it died during the 2017 legislative session in may . `` this is divide and conquer ... it 's an outright attack on labor unions , '' democratic rep. wengay newton said at the time . ",
        "`` the right to bargain should be upheld and should n't be interfered with . '' not only has the failed legislation been resurrected as hb25 , but it 's been fast-tracked for a floor vote when the 2018 legislative session begins next month . typically , bills need approval from multiple committees , but hb25 was assigned to just one panel : the republican-controlled government accountability committee . the bill easily passed 14-9 , despite one republican voting with the democrats and activists protesting the action outside . members of the committee received letters from americans for prosperity , the koch-funded conservative advocacy group , urging them to vote for the bill . ",
        "hb25 would disproportionately impact women employees , who make up the majority at the unions that would be targeted , while the previously mentioned male-dominated organizations would remain protected . this fact was brought up was brought up during the government accountability committee by democratic rep. kristen jacobs . `` i know you said that was not your intent , '' jacobs said to plakon . `` but when you look at the workers affected by this bill -- over 80 percent are women . now if you look at the unions exempted ... they are largely made up of men . '' ",
        "the legislation could end collective bargaining for most teachers in the state , and florida 's conservative lawmakers have n't exactly concealed their disdain for the organizations . `` the teachers ' union is fixated on halting innovation and competition in education , '' said house speaker richard corcoran during his swearing-in ceremony in 2016 . `` they are literally trying to destroy the lives of a hundred thousand children . `` united teachers of dade , miami 's public teachers union , has between 13,000 and 14,000 members . but if stripped of their collective bargaining rights , they 'd be unable to fight for the 30,000 teachers who work in the district . ",
        "`` hb25 is an unnecessary and destructive bill that targets women-dominated industries by seeking to eradicate their labor rights , '' utd president karla hernandez-mats told in these times . `` there is a blatant disparate treatment being applied by the legislature between majority male and female professions and their unions , and it is unfortunate to see that our state lawmakers are attempting to move our country backwards instead of forward . '' florida 's unions are already up against the odds without hb25 . not only is florida a right to work state , its constitution prohibits public employees from striking . ",
        "just how devastating could this bill be for labor ? its potential impact can be gleaned from florida 's last annual workforce report . only 2.8 percent of afscme state employees and 7.9 percent of florida nurses association members pay dues . even the police benevolent association , the strongest union in the state , would be decertified if the legislation applied to them . only 45.7 percent of their members pay dues , just below the bill 's 50 percent threshold . the trump administration has successfully stacked the national labor relations board with pro-business forces , intervened against public employee unions in a landmark supreme court case , and moved to overturn the few labor victories that occurred under obama . ",
        "but what 's happening at a national level is taking place at an accelerated rate within various states . hb25 is reminiscent of a sweeping anti-union bill that was passed in iowa at the beginning of 2017 . that legislation stripped more than 100,000 workers of their collective bargaining rights and , just like florida , the bill was fast-tracked and police unions were exempt . nearly all of these bills are similar to scott walker 's infamous act 10 , the vast attack on organized labor in wisconsin in 2011 . if hb25 is successful , it could provide yet another blueprint for state lawmakers looking to crush organized labor in 2018 .
