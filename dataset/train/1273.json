        "it 's a tired cliche : the customer service rep sitting in a cubicle with a blank face and dim eyes , their mind wandering about something else he or she would rather be doing . that archaic perception of customer service agents is no longer fitting : today 's agents need to be dynamic problem solvers who are constantly on their toes . it can be enthralling at times , but like at any job , agents may fall victim to dissatisfaction in the workplace . satisfied customer service agents need what all employees deserve : a positive internal culture , great coworkers , and the potential for career growth .

        "as they work diligently in the weeds of customer support , it may not always be easy to tell if they 're happy or not . conducting an agent satisfaction surveya simple way to get to the bottom of how happy your agents are is to conduct an agent satisfaction survey . it can be something as easy as asking support agents how much they like or dislike their jobs , but you 're likely to learn more by digging deeper into the complexities of their duties . the process for conducting an asat survey is as follows : survey agents , leads , and managerssurvey everyone , every quarterhave someone outside the support team conduct the survey to evaluate and summarize the dataact on survey feedbackevaluating agent performancesit 's no secret that happy agents make for successful ones .

        "making sure your agents stay happyestablishing a good cadence with your asat surveys , like the previously mentioned `` every quarter '' approach , will emphasize areas that need improvement . more often than not , unsatisfied agents are victims of company culture that see customer service as a micromanaged cost center . this leads to uninspired workers feeling like they 're stuck at a dead-end job . the happiest customer service agents are the ones that feel empowered to challenge themselves and each other . provide them with opportunities for growth and development , like taking on more complex requests and working with their ever-changing customer base .
