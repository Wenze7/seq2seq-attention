        "dubai , united arab emirates -- the protesters rallied for days in iran , chanting against government corruption and demanding justice . that was last year , when depositors who lost their savings in the collapse of major government-run credit union took to the streets , shouting `` death to seif , '' iran 's central bank governor . in the past 10 days , there were new protests , the largest in iran since its 2009 disputed presidential election , fueled by young people angry over their bleak prospects . this time , they shouted slogans against president hassan rouhani and supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , a figure seen as subordinate only to god by hard-liners . ",
        "the new unrest appears to be waning , but anger over the economy persists . the protests in dozens of towns and cities also showed that a sector of the public was willing to openly call for the removal of iran 's system of rule by clerics -- frustrated not just by the economy but also by concern over iran 's foreign wars and general direction . that sentiment likely extends beyond those who took to the streets . but the protests also showed the constraints on discontent . fear of reprisals probably kept some people away from the protests , but so did worry over chaos that might result from unrest and hope that gains could still be made within the system . ",
        "without drastic change in people 's livelihoods , unrest over the economy will only intensify , becoming perhaps the greatest challenge for the islamic republic as it nears its fourth decade of existence and a new era of leadership looms . economic woesthe collapse last year of the caspian credit institute , which promised depositors returns often seen in ponzi schemes , showed the economic desperation faced by many in iran . retirees unable to make ends meet on their pensions can be found driving many of the taxis crowding tehran 's roads . universities turn out students with no hope of employment in their fields , while those lucky enough to have work often have a second or even a third job . ",
        "banks remain saddled with bad loans , a warning repeatedly sounded by the international monetary fund . some of this stretches back to the days of nuclear sanctions , while others find themselves mired in the murky finances of the paramilitary revolutionary guard , which is estimated to control a third of the total economy . inflation , initially brought under control by rouhani , has slipped back into double digits , according to recent figures . he cut some subsidies offered by his hard-line predecessor , the holocaust-questioning populist mahmoud ahmadinejad . those subsidies benefited rural and poor voters in the provinces , the same people who appear to have taken to the streets in the recent protests , initially sparked by food prices . ",
        "the government likely will offer either subsidized food prices or new cash handouts to soothe anger in the provinces , although how that comes about remains to be seen . but the unrest has had one benefit : it has helped boost global oil prices to over $ 60 a barrel , providing desperately needed hard currency to the opec-member nation . battlefield successthe recent protests saw some marchers chant against iran 's foreign wars , demanding the government focus first on those at home . since the u. s.-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , iran has expanded its presence across the middle east as a counter to the american bases that dot the arab gulf countries surrounding it . ",
        "the u. s. military accused iran of training insurgents in iraq who targeted its troops with roadside bombs , and tehran has powerful influence over iraq 's shiite-led government . the rise of the islamic state group , as well as the syrian civil war , threatened iran 's allies , and it responded by sending the revolutionary guard 's elite quds expeditionary force into both iraq and syria . in iraq , iranian advisers turned shiite militias into a powerful ground force against is extremists . in syria , president bashar assad appeared to be on the ropes until iran fully entered the conflict . ",
        "he held onto his presidency with quds force generals leading foreign fighters from afghanistan and pakistan , as well iranian-supported hezbollah guerrillas from lebanon . in yemen , the u. s. and other western powers accused tehran of supplying shiite rebels with ballistic missile technology . protesters denounced the money going to support these groups rather than helping people in iran . but the success abroad also is used by the state to drum up support . revolutionary guard gen. qassem soleimani has been elevated to a folk hero among some iranians . an assault in june by the islamic state group targeting tehran -- a rare terrorist attack in the iranian capital -- also galvanized support by the public , which fears a return of the bombings and unrest that immediately followed the 1979 islamic revolution . ",
        "iranians also see the aftermath of wars in the region as serving to protect the islamic republic 's shiite-dominated government . new era loomsapproaching the 40th anniversary of the revolution , iran increasingly will consider who follows the 78-year-old khamenei , who underwent prostate surgery in 2014 . among those under consideration is rouhani , himself a cleric . both the u. s. and analysts studying iran say hard-liners initially fomented the economic protests to put pressure on rouhani but quickly lost control of them . iranian law bars rouhani from seeking a third term , so iran 's 2021 presidential election will see a wide-open field . ",
        "hard-liners at one point called for an earlier presidential election , saying rouhani 's policies had failed , although that bid went nowhere . the economic resentment seen in recent days could prompt the rise of another ahmadinejad-style hard-line populist -- if iran 's clerical leadership allows such a candidacy . it 's hard to tell right now who emerged stronger after the protests -- rouhani or his hard-line opponents . each tried to wield anger over the economy against the other . weeks before the protests , rouhani publicly complained that large parts of the government budget went to religious institutions , largely seen as power bases of the hard-liners , seeking to deflect blame over the economy . ",
        "from the other side , it is widely believed that the hard-liners were the ones who initially stoked the protests to embarrass rouhani , only to see the demonstrations turn against the entire ruling establishment . protests wane , anger remainsauthorities managed to stifle the protests in part by blocking access to the messaging app telegram , through which demonstrators organized the rallies and shared images from the streets . the revolutionary guard 's volunteer basiji force also was deployed and police have arrested hundreds ; more than 20 protesters were killed , although security forces did not engage in the level of bloodshed that followed the 2009 protests . ",
        "both u. s. president donald trump and israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said they supported the protesters , without apparently providing any aid . the protests quickly raised the hopes of those abroad who want to see an end to the islamic republic . but for now , that wo n't be happening . instead , iran 's ruling system faces a future of grappling with the effects of economic woes that have proven to be unpredictable and potentially volatile . ___ editor 's note -- jon gambrell , an associated press reporter since 2006 , has covered the middle east from cairo and dubai , united arab emirates , since 2013 .
