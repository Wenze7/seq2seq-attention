        "the prominent british campaign group war on want has been listed as one of 20 foreign ngos whose representatives are banned from visiting israel over their support of the pro-palestinian boycott , sanctions and divestment movement . the publication of the list , which also includes a well-known jewish anti-occupation group and a nobel peace prize-winning us quaker group , had been threatened for months by israel . the organisations were singled out by israel 's rightwing strategic affairs and public security minister , gilad erdan , for advocating boycotts of israel over its treatment of palestinians . erdan said on sunday that the groups `` operate consistently and continuously '' against israel using a `` campaign of incitement and lies '' . ",
        "human rights groups condemned the move as an assault on free speech . a number of individuals have been refused entry into israel in recent months , including a prominent african theologian and official of the world council of churches . while most of the organisations listed by erdan are local branches of the bds movement around the world , others include jewish voice for peace , which has 13,000 members , the us group code pink and the american friends service committee , which won the peace prize in 1947 . as well as war on want , the list names a second british group , the palestine solidarity campaign , of which jeremy corbyn is a patron . ",
        "erdan said israel had `` shifted from defence to offence '' with the publication of the list . `` the boycott organisations need to know that the state of israel will act against them and not allow to enter its territory to harm its citizens , '' he said . `` no country would have allowed critics coming to harm the country to enter it . '' the interior minister , arye dery , whose ministry is responsible for barring those listed , said : `` these people are trying to exploit the law and our hospitality to act against israel and to defame the country . ",
        "i will act against this by every means . '' the travel ban is the latest in a series of populist moves by the israeli government , the most rightwing coalition in the country 's history . the prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , has said he intends to remove 40,000 african migrants from israel and expressed support for making it easier to hang people convicted of terrorism . rebecca vilkomerson , the executive director of jewish voice for peace , criticised the publication of the list , saying it was `` disconcerting but not surprising given the further erosion of democratic norms and rising anxiety about the power of bds as a tool to demand freedom . '' ",
        "she wrote on facebook : `` as someone with considerable family in israel , this policy will be a personal hardship . but i am also heartened by this indicator of the bds movement 's growing strength , and hope that it will bring the day closer when just as i go to visit my friends and family in israel , so will palestinian friends and colleagues be able to return home . '' hassan jabareen , of the legal centre for arab minority rights in israel , said the travel ban was draconian and arbitrary . `` this ban is an overt violation of the constitutional rights of israeli citizens and the rights guaranteed to palestinian residents of the opt under international humanitarian and human rights law . ",
        "this move is reminiscent of south africa 's apartheid regime which also prepared blacklists in order to punish people and prevent the entry of those opposed to its racist policies . '' in november israel denied entry to a us employee of amnesty international as part of its anti-boycott offensive under the same rules . amnesty is not on the list of 20 groups published on sunday . this article originally appeared on the guardian .
