        "complete nhl all-star game rosters were announced amid little fanfare wednesday , giving us three weeks to debate which of the four divisions is most loaded with talent when we could be dreaming about all the tantalizing line combinations headed to pyeongchang . it 's not the olympics , sure , but there 's still something cool about auston matthews setting up nikita kucherov on a one-timer or sidney crosby skating alongside alex ovechkin . this year 's rosters are a little bizarre , though . we 've got marc-andre fleury , he of 12 starts in an injury-shortened season , over john gibson and martin jones in the pacific net , a metro defense that does n't include washington 's john carlson , philadelphia 's shayne gostisbehere or columbus ' zach werenski , and an atlantic team that 's almost literally half lightning , an obvious ode to the host of this year 's festivities . ",
        "and while there 's no reason to get up in arms about snubbed players who could n't care less about playing in an all-star game anyway , the absence of phil kessel , the east 's biggest omission , and vladimir tarasenko , his counterpart in the west , feels all wrong . look , it 's a gimmick event . if nothing else , the nhl 's three-on-three all-star game tournament allows for maximum creativity , showmanship and personality , a rare combination in today 's nhl , so we might as well make the most of it . ",
        "and the skills competition is always appointment viewing , even if neither jaromir jagr nor john scott will be there . here 's a refresher on the format : for the third year , the nhl will continue under its familiar four-team tournament . the atlantic and metropolitan teams will play each other to determine the finals representative from the eastern conference , and the central and pacific teams will face off to decide the western conference winner . each game will be played in two 10-minute halves , with the winners facing off in a championship game that night . ",
        "the nhl has a dumb mandate that each team must be represented , rather than take the 11 best players for each team , which is why mike green exists on an otherwise juggernaut atlantic squad . there 's going to be a lot of open space out there , so the speedy , shifty styles will thrive . without further ado , let 's take a look at which team can put together the scariest three-on-three combinations . be warned : this is not an exercise for a faint-of-heart goalie . atlantic divisionforwardssteven stamkos , lightningaleksander barkov , panthersjack eichel , sabresnikita kucherov , lightningbrad marchand , bruinsauston matthews , maple leafsdefensemike green , red wingsvictor hedman , lightningerik karlsson , senatorsgoaliesandrei vasilevskiy , lightningcarey price , canadiens the skinny : as likely as it is lightning teammates nikita kucherov and steven stamkos will play alongside one another in front of the home crowd it 'll be a missed opportunity to showcase auston matthews with arguably the nhl 's best goal scorer and best defenseman . ",
        "it 's pretty much assumed stamkos , kucherov , victor hedman and andrei vasilevskiy take the ice first . jack eichel , making his first all-star game appearance , and brad marchand trained together in the offseason and are obvious partners . in any event , this team is stacked . as long as it takes down the metro in the semis , it should be the favorite for the $ 1 million prize the nhl throws in as incentive to bring players together . it almost makes us forget mike green is an all-star for the first time since 2010 .

",
        "but ... wait , what 's up with the defense ? seth jones is fantastic , but kris letang ranks 13th in scoring among nhl defensemen and noah hanifin is n't even the best blueliner on his own team . sidney crosby got in over phil kessel , who actually leads the penguins with 47 points , because he 's sidney crosby . and what 's an all-star game without sidney crosby ? even crosby himself said he preferred if kessel would go ahead of him , but alas . `` i mean ... phil 's had a really good first half , '' crosby said before the announcement , via the pittsburgh post-gazette . ",
        "`` there 's been a lot of guys within our division that have had some great first halves here so far : tavares , bailey and ovechkin . these guys are all right at the top of the scoring race . i have n't given it any thought , only because of that . i just do n't expect to be going . `` we digress . central divisionforwardspatrick kane , blackhawksnathan mackinnon , avalanchebrayden schenn , bluestyler seguin , starseric staal , wildblake wheeler , jetsdefensep . k. subban , predatorsjohn klingberg , starsalex pietrangelo , bluesconnor hellebuyck , jetspekka rinne , predatorspacific divisionforwardsconnor mcdavid , oilersbrock boeser , canucksjohnny gaudreau , flamesanze kopitar , kingsjames neal , golden knightsrickard rakell , ducksdefensebrent burns , sharksdrew doughty , kingsoliver ekman-larsson , coyotesmarc-andre fleury , golden knightsjonathan quick , kings .
