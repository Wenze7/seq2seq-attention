        "baabda - lebanese prime minister saad hariri said on tuesday that he had withdrawn his resignation , a month after his shock announcement that he was quitting sparked political upheaval . the announcement brought some respite to lebanon , which had been gripped by fears of new political and economic instability in a country riven by deep divisions and caught up in regional rivalries . minutes after hariri 's announcement , paris said the lebanese premier would attend talks friday in france on the situation in lebanon , which us secretary of state rex tillerson will also attend . `` the council of ministers thanks the prime minister for rescinding his resignation , '' hariri said , reading from a cabinet statement issued after its first meeting since his return two weeks ago . ",
        "hariri announced he was stepping down on november 4 in a televised address from saudi arabia , a move widely seen as part of the boiling tensions between the saudi kingdom -- a long-time hariri backer -- and its regional rival iran . in his resignation , hariri lambasted tehran and its lebanese ally , the powerful armed movement hezbollah , for destabilising his country and the middle east . he later said he would consider coming back as premier if hezbollah stopped intervening in regional conflicts , including the wars in syria and yemen . in recent days , consultations across the political spectrum have sought to find a compromise between the saudi-backed camp led by hariri , and hezbollah 's iran-backed bloc . ",
        "on tuesday , lebanon 's cabinet , which includes both blocs , reaffirmed its official policy of `` disassociation '' , or remaining neutral in regional conflicts . - ` disassociation ' - `` the lebanese government , in all its political components , has committed to distance itself from all conflicts , wars , and internal affairs of arab states , '' according to the cabinet statement read out by hariri . this `` disassociation '' is intended to `` preserve lebanon 's political and economic relations with its arab brothers '' , the statement added . the policy had already been adopted by hariri 's cabinet , formed in 2016 after a settlement across political divides that saw michel aoun appointed president and the creation of a government including hezbollah deputies . ",
        "hezbollah has been accused of violating the policy , however , by fighting in neighbouring syria to support the damascus regime as well as by dispatching military commanders to iraq and allegedly backing shiite rebels in yemen . `` a reaffirmation of lebanese ` disassociation ' , notwithstanding its manifest hypocrisy and the impossibility of it being translated concretely , makes it possible to save face and win a little time , '' said karim bitar , an expert at the paris-based institute of international and strategic affairs . during the cabinet meeting , according to a statement obtained by afp , hariri expressed the hope for `` a new chance to defend the country together '' . ",
        "`` we see how the region is boiling and we must be aware that any misstep could bring the country to a dangerous precipice , '' he told his cabinet . lebanon has been buffeted by regional instability in recent years , particularly by the war in neighbouring syria which has sent more than one million refugees into its tiny neighbour , seeking safety . the conflict in syria has also deepened existing tensions , with hariri 's bloc backing the uprising against president bashar al-assad while hezbollah 's fighters battled alongside the regime 's troops . hariri 's resignation raised fears that lebanon could be plunged into chaos , and provoked widespread speculation about whether riyadh had forced him to step down . ",
        "he delivered his resignation announcement from saudi arabia and spent the next two weeks there amid rumours that riyadh was holding him `` hostage '' . he denied those claims , and after top-level french intervention returned to beirut where he announced he had `` paused '' his resignation to hold consultations across the political spectrum . france 's foreign ministry said friday 's meeting was intended to `` support the political process at a crucial moment '' . by colin bertier .
