        "today we introduce a well established unagi shop in tokyo called kanda kikuwa . this shop specializes in edomae unagi , a style of eel preparation unique to the kanto area , and one that differs ... unagi , is a food that has come to be widely eaten in japan since the edo period . even today , during the period that runs from the latter part of july until the early part of august , on a day called doyo no ushi no hi , the custom of eating unagi continues . along with edomae sushi , this is a flavor that has been loved by the common people in japan since those early days . ",
        "* 1 doyo no ushi no hi : in japanese , doyo refers to the 18-19 day period preceding the change of seasons , and ushi meaning ox , is one of 12 zodiac signs in chinese astrology . so ushi no hi essentially means day of the ox , a day on which people are encouraged to eat unagi in order to combat summer fatigue and a lack of appetite . kanda kikuwa - a superb flavor that never changeskanda kikuwa , a long standing edo style eel restaurant that first opened in 1947 , is located right near exit 5 of kanda station . ",
        "the owners added `` edomae '' to their shop 's name in order to distinguish between the different methods of grilling unagi in the kansai region and the kanto region . for starters , in the kansai region , unagi are first cut open from the stomach area , whereas in the kanto region , unagi are cut open starting from the back area . historically , many samurai living in the former edo area had a strong dislike for the word seppuku , hence unagi were prepared by first making an incision in the back instead of the stomach area . ",
        "the edo-style of unagi has two different kinds of preparation . in one method , the unagi is grilled as is , with no seasoning , after it 's cut and cleaned . in the other method , the unagi is first steamed , then allowed to sit for a short while before being dipped in a sauce and grilled , resulting in a characteristically soft texture . with the kansai-style however , the unagi is not steamed but only grilled , resulting in a crispy outside texture . the inside of kanda kikuwa exudes a confident , established kind of atmosphere . ",
        "though reservations are n't taken here , there 's a first and second floor , and during the week if your timing is right , you can usually get a seat fairly soon . * 2 seppuku : was a form of japanese ritual suicide by disembowelment , originally reserved for samurai . the unagiju set meal also comes with clear japanese soup , pickles , and even dessert . when you lift open the lid of the box , there 's so much eel on top that you can barely see the rice below it , apparently something that kanda kikukawa is famous for . ",
        "the shop has been adamant about maintaining this trademark ever since they first opened for business many years ago . with a superb taste that even exceeds its beautiful appearance and eel that 's so soft and plump that it can be cut with chopsticks , it 's no wonder that customers never get tired of this dish and can finish off the meal completely . in addition to unagiju , the shop menu allows customers to fully enjoy eel by also serving eel liver , deep-fried eel bones , and even unagi ham . the time to eat unagi is when you feel like eating it .
