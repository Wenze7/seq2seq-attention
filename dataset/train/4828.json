        "amidst the criticism against pakistan 's treatment of kulbhushan jadhav by the opposition , samajwadi party leader naresh kumar raised a few eyebrows for what appeared to be a statement justifying jadhav 's treatment . when asked to comment on the ill treatment of jadhav 's mother and wife , naresh kumar told ani , `` agar unhone kulbhushan jadhav ko aatankwadi apne desh mein mana hai , to wo uss hisaab se vyavhaar karenge , humare desh mein bhi aatankwadiyon ke saath aisa hi vyavhaar karna chahiye , kada vyavhar karna chahiye . '' he also wondered why everyone was talking only about jadhav as there are many more indians in pakistani prisons . ",
        "the government will make a statement in the lok sabha on thursday , 28 december , on the treatment meted out by pakistan to the family members of kulbhushan jadhav , external affairs minister sushma swaraj said . jadhav , who was arrested in march , was sentenced to death by a pakistani military court for alleged spying , an accusation that india has dismissed as concocted . on tuesday , india accused pakistan of violating mutual understanding on jadhav 's meeting with his family , and said the indian national appeared coerced and under considerable stress during the tightly-controlled interaction . ",
        "the external affairs ministry said in a statement on tuesday that pakistan went so far as to have the mangal sutra , bangles and bindi of jadhav 's mother and wife removed before they could meet him . india also accused pakistan of disregarding cultural and religious sensibilities of family members under the pretext of security . ministry of external affairsthis included removal of mangal sutra , bangles and bindi , as well as a change in attire that was not warranted by security . the pakistani foreign office said that pakistan does not wish to indulge in a `` meaningless battle of words '' and categorically rejects india 's baseless `` allegations and twists '' about attitude of authorities during jadhav 's meeting with his wife and mother . ",
        "pakistan foreign officethe indian baseless allegations and twists , that come 24 hours later , about the visit of the wife and mother of commander jadhav , a convicted terrorist and spy , who has confessed to his crimes , are categorically rejected . during the 25 december meeting , the pictures of which were released by pakistan , jadhav was seen sitting behind a glass screen while his mother and wife sat on the other side . they spoke through intercom and the entire 40-minute proceedings appeared to have been recorded on video . jadhav , who was captured in march last year , was sentenced to death by a pakistani military court for alleged spying , an accusation that india has dismissed as concocted . ",
        "new delhi says jadhav was kidnapped in iran where he had legitimate business interests , and brought to pakistan . to save jadhav , india moved the international court of justice , which ordered pakistan in may to stay his execution .   "
