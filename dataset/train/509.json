        "bangkok - thailand 's junta number two has been snapped with 25 different luxury watches worth $ 1.2 million since a 2014 coup , social media sleuths said wednesday , a day after the ex-general vowed to resign if a graft panel finds him guilty of wrongdoing . prawit wongsuwan has been under pressure since december when the ` csi la ' facebook page began to catalogue luxury timepieces worn by the deputy prime minister from photos and internet news reports . the concerted social media campaign is urging the kingdom 's anti-graft body to probe how the luxury watches came into prawit 's possession -- and is hugely embarrassing to thailand 's military government . ",
        "it toppled the government of yingluck shinwatra in 2014 vowing to purge the country of graft , a scourge it blamed on thailand 's civilian rulers . prawit was one of the architects of the coup . on wednesday the thai-language ` csi la ' page raised the watch tally after finding a fresh photo of him wearing a patek phillipe model at a temple ceremony in 2014 . `` we have found 25 luxury watches worth more than $ 1.24 million , including 11 rolexes , eight patek philippes and three richard millies , '' a post said , urging its near-750,000 followers to unearth more photos . ",
        "prawit has so far not disputed the number of watches . but on tuesday he told reporters his `` friends lent '' him watches which he duly returned . thailand 's national anti-coruption commission has let a deadline for prawit to issue a formal explanation over the watches slip several times . the nacc is headed by one of the junta top brass ' former subordinates , raising fears of a whitewash . if the nacc rules `` that i am wrong , i will quit , '' prawit told reporters . the slew of bad headlines engulfing prawit comes as his main ally , prime minister prayut chan-o-cha remodels himself from a strongman general into a politician ahead of elections slated for the end of this year . ",
        "but the watch issue has angered both junta critics and erstwhile supporters in a divided country where politics is usually a strictly partisan affair . observers say that outrage represents fatigue with junta rule , which is widely seen as top-heavy and ineffective , and a wider yearning for a return to elections . `` the watch issue is a sign that a new political proposition is emerging , '' sirote klampaiboon , a political commentator told afp . `` this is the first time since the junta took over in 2014 that political groups of different sides have come together , leaving their conflicts in the past .
