        "apple 's high-end imac pro has finally hit the market . and for those willing to pay , it 's a pretty great computer . but let 's talk about that cost , shall we ? the base model imac pro will set you back a mere £ 4,899 . and if you want to upgrade to the top specifications , you 'll be paying ... wait for it ... £ 12,428 . let 's have some fun , here are five things you can get for roughly the same cost as a maxed-out imac pro . 1 . a brand new ford caryes , not just a second-hand car , you can actually buy a brand new ford for less than the imac pro . ",
        "a ford ka + starts at £ 9,795 . hell , you could buy it and have enough money left over to buy a mid-range macbook pro . 2 . a studio apartment in london for a yearaccording to expatistan . com , the average cost of monthly rent for a studio apartment in london is £ 1069 . a quick bit of maths will tell you that equates to £ 12,828 . sure it 's a bit over , but chuck in final cut pro x and logic pro x for the imac pro and you 'd be paying more than your rent for a year . ",
        "3 . seven round-the-world plane ticketsvirgin atlantic offers an round-the-world ticket for £ 1,595 that takes you to asia , australia and the usa . you could be making that voyage seven times instead of buying an imac pro . and if you really want to treat yourself on the holiday , maybe just go four times and save the rest for nice hotels . 4 . 12 iphone xs that 's right , the widely sought iphone x - which retails for £ 999 - could be bought 12 times before you could afford an imac pro . and just for laughs , why not chuck in an iphone se for £ 349 . ",
        "mind you . , that still would n't reach the computer 's cost . 5 . lunch for three yearsassuming you spend £ 11 a day on lunch , you could have your lunches covered for the next three years . based on expatistan . com , londoners getting a basic lunchtime meal in the business district pay £ 11 . shave that down to a £ 3.50 lunch deal from m&s and you 've got lunch for almost 10 years .
