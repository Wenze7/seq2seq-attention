        "months ago , after my last breakup , i decided to focus my energy into making my self useful . i had initially been looking for shea butter because i had been told it was in abundance in my present location . but i was unable to get any because the merchants were not ready to extract it yet . i visited google and found the procedure for extracting the butter from the nuts and i made a large quantity of it . i sold some and used the rest . fast forward to last month , i had exhausted my supply and then began the search for where to buy some . ",
        "so i heard from reliable sources that i could get it in zuru , another lga . i had been planning the trip for weeks . i contacted a platoon mate and she offered to accommodate me till i got what i came for . and i pulled certain strings and got a merchant 's phone number . saturdays are market days in zuru so i had to be there by friday . day of the trip ... i got to zuru before 6 pm on friday and met with shola , my platoon mate . i spent the night at her place . ",
        "she had to attend a vigil and i thought she had a lot of trust in someone she barely knew to stay in her place while she attended a vigil . . i slept early and woke up freezing . the weather in zuru is something else really , although i wore a sweater and socks to bed . i managed to have my bath and get dressed despite the cold . shola came back earlier and gave me directions before going to bed . i left her place and got a bike to sabo kassua . the bike stopped me in front of a local spices and soup ingredients shop , whose owner was an old lady . ",
        "i called the merchant but her phone was switched off so i asked the old lady where i could get shea butter and she pointed at the market and said i should ask around . i decided to tour the market from there . the market had only just opened and most of the traders were just setting up . i walked around aimlessly and found myself back where i started . there was a restaurant , `` calabar kitchen '' beside the local ingredients shop and i decided to have breakfast there . the owner was not around so i waited a bit and she came through . ",
        "she was a very pleasant person , she kept talking and i found her talking very amusing . i asked a lot of questions and she was more than willing to answer me and even take me to get the shea butter . our initial conversation started with talking about the cold and i told her i wanted to get a thicker pair of socks and she promised to show me where to get them . she spoke to me about her sisters , herself and her `` baby '' . she spoke to me like she had known me for ages . ",
        "at one point she started calling me sweetheart . i did not ask her name at first but later she told me it was blessing . she took me to get the shea butter and got me a good bargain and helped me get the socks and the rest of the things on my list . i met some of her customers and her easy banter with them was just beautiful . meeting blessing at zuru sabo kassua was the highlight of my visit to zuru . i got what i wanted and i am on my way back to the place i call home at the moment . ",
        "i 'm looking forward to being the road again . ðŸ˜‰ ðŸ˜€ .   "
