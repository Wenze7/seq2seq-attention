        "with the holiday season in full swing , it 's totally natural to have a calendar full of parties , late nights , and drawn-out dinners with family and friends . it 's also natural to want to fill out your usual sweetgreen and soulcycle routine with some extra snacking and sipping . one more natural thing : a category of wines made with as little human intervention as possible -- and which may be better for your health than your other options for liquid holiday cheer . `` eating or drinking any product that has a low level of human manipulation is healthier overall for the body , '' says stephen webber , winemaker for montinore estate in oregon 's willamette valley . ",
        "you 've likely also heard the terms `` organic '' and `` biodynamic '' kicked around in relation to wine : these are legally regulated distinctions that fall under the `` natural '' umbrella . instead of adding extra yeast to jump-start the fermentation process , natural wines are usually made by what 's called spontaneous fermentation , wherein producers let the yeast found naturally in the grapes ' skins ferment on its own schedule . other additives , like citric acid , gelatin , silica gel , and copper sulfate , are also largely kept away from natural wines . ",
        "according to jia shen , md , assistant professor of medicine at the university of california , san diego , the long-term health outcomes of choosing natural and organic products over the alternative are as yet unknown . but she agrees that `` organic produce contains less pesticide residue '' -- always a win . so if you 're choosing to go local and organic in the produce aisle , it makes sense that you 'd want to do so at the liquor store , too . unsure where to start ? here are 5 low-intervention natural wines to add some `` cheers ! '' ",
        "to your holiday season . pence estate 2017 gamay . `` this is the first release from this 100-percent organic estate in the extreme northeast corner of the santa rita hills american viticultural area in santa barbara county , california , '' says pat ballow , a broker for the distributor revel wine . to make this wine , the grapes are sealed into a carbon-dioxide-filled tank to ferment while they 're still whole and on the stem . this allows the grapes to release their own enzymes to turn the natural sugars into alcohol without adding yeast . the result ? ",
        "a light , fresh gamay that 's a real crowd-pleaser on the party circuit . denavolo catavela 2016 . are you the type to choose white wine over red even when there 's a blanket of snow on the ground ? unlike traditional white wines , the denavola catavela is fermented with the grapes ' skins and seeds still intact , giving it its signature copper-orange hue . `` the perfect cold weather white wine , it 's really good with holiday grub , '' recommends brett pallesen , owner of the natural wine supplier soil expedition co. . also a plus : this particular wine , made with grapes organically farmed in the emilie romagne region of italy , has no added sulfites . ",
        "known the world over for high-acid wines with strong earthy and cranberry flavors , oregon 's willamette valley 's cool , dank weather is an ideal home for the notoriously finicky pinot noir grape . `` pinot noir is so infinitely versatile , pairing beautifully with a variety of dishes , from turkey to ham and beef , '' webber says . bodega y viñedos 2014 inteus graciano . `` i like bodegas inteus , the hottest young project in rioja , spain , for its stellar fruit and minimal intervention , '' says andrew yandell of trumpet wines , a wine importer focusing on natural wines from spain . ",
        "not only were they the first-ever certified organic grape growers in rioja , each of their gorgeous green vineyards produce soulful wines that pair well with holiday meals . ` they have subtle structure to stand up to a variety of foods , with brightness to keep the bottle tipping and refresh your palate even through the richest cheeses , roasts , and stews , '' says yandell , who favors the graciano , in particular . channing daughters 2016 sylvanus . no holiday celebration is complete without a side of bubbles . channing daughters , a winery in bridgehampton , new york , is known for using a variety of less common grapes to make its suite of wines -- including a lightly effervescent pétillant-naturel , which is produced from a single fermentation in the bottle without anything else added .

        "the sylvanus is a white sparkler made from 50 percent pinot grigio grapes , 40 percent muscat , and 10 percent pinot bianco .   "
