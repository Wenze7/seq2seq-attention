        "if you feel like you do little else but talk about bitcoin , cryptos and blockchains , spare a thought for the good people of the new york state assembly in albany , who are going to spend the next year debating them . assemblyman clyde vanel has introduced four separate bills in an effort to formalise the state 's legal relationship with blockchains , and by extension cryptocurrencies . some of these bills are fairly mundane , adding language to already existing legislation to recognise signatures and contracts on blockchains to be legally recognised , or committing the state to exploring how blockchains can be used to make for secure elections . ",
        "the bill which is most interesting , however , is the one to create a task force to find out : `` information on the potential effects of the widespread implementation of digital currencies on financial markets in the state '' now , this would be significant in any state , but wall street is , of course , in new york . delving deeper into the bill , we find two key clauses that announce plans to : a bitlicense , you 'll recall , is the permission slip for doing business with virtual currencies whose architect , ben lawsky , recently joined the board of ripple . ",
        "bitlicenses have been controversial since their launch in 2014 , with the scheme 's detractors arguing that their strictures have been responsible for crypto businesses avoiding new york in favour of more welcoming environments . few have been awarded , and a legal challenge to the programme is ongoing . could the task force this bill sets up be part of a move to lessen these restrictions , especially with wall street waking up to cryptos in 2017 ? we 'll know by january 1 2019 , the deadline for the task force to make its report . either way , this is a small but significant move by one of the few legislative bodies to engage in real debate over the crypto space .
