        "creative choices are multiple from the very beginning of the filmmaking process . sure , your choice of camera and lenses will say a lot about how you shoot . but what about the choices we take before then ? how do we really start shaping the way in which we are going to tell a story ? in this article i would like to share a `` test '' we have developed at mind the film . we like to start each new project with the mario testino meets national geographic test . it is an exercise we have ideated to set the grounds of each film , and to take an opportunity to reflect on the main features of our filmmaking style . ",
        "the test is based on the comparison of these two images -- the first one is afghan girl , a 1984 photograph by the journalist steve mccurry , which became a world-famous cover of national geographic in 1985 . the second one is a portrait by photographer mario testino , which was taken for the 10th anniversary special issue of vogue china . apparently , two portraits of similar composition and outstanding quality . additionally , two clear examples of different production styles . start thinking about the production requirements behind each image and then you will be wearing a producer 's hat . ",
        "this is what steve mccurry said about taking his photograph afghan girl : `` i spent maybe two minutes with her , i photographed her . i made 15 pictures i would say . '' and now compare that approach to the amount of staff , stylists , models , lighting equipment and producers involved in the production of a photo-shoot for vogue . what we like about the mario testino meets national geographic test is that the comparison helps us differentiate two important production approaches . the national geographic way would focus on the idea of `` capturing something '' . ",
        "navigating through reality and being able to capture the best moments of it . following the testino way would mean that we first work on the idea and create the conditions for the image to be produced . and that involves the studio set-up , props , casting etc. . at mind the film we favour a documentary-style , and the philosophy of capturing the most meaningful images out of reality -- whilst we also welcome the freedom to create and catalyse cinematic situations . no one better than mario testino himself to sum it up : `` i divide my work into two sides . ",
        "one is to photograph what already exists . but then there is photographing things that we create . we have an idea and we decide that we are going to interpret this idea . '' the `` mario testino meets national geographic '' test is based in the comparison of these two images .   "
