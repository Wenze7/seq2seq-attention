        "gifchelsea fans entered today 's game against brighton and hove albion in panic mode . sitting tied for third in the premier league but with no shot at winning the title , the team had appeared to have given up . they had scored one goal in their last four games , and had yet to win a match in regulation in 2018 . off the field , the assumption was that the club was a messy clash of personalities , as the media linked the team to every striker in england and predicted the impending departure of manager antonio conte . ",
        "chelsea 's first half against brighton obviously could n't be a total transformation into functionality , but it was pretty dang good . eden hazard took just three minutes to calm some fears with an almost immediate goal . then , in the sixth minute , three chelsea attackers combined for the kind of beautiful team goal you only see from clubs in perfect form . brighton is no powerhouse , chelsea 's defense looked shaky later on in the half , and the team could very well still not give a shit about this season . but for a symbolic argument that everyone in the squad does n't hate each other , you could n't do much better than this goal .
