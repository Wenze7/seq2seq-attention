        "a kind-hearted londoner is leaving handwritten notes for lucky strangers in a bid to `` remind people they are extraordinary . '' the mystery person has been leaving motivational letters and bunches of flowers in hackney , east london , in a bid to spread the love . twitter / @ruthclark91ruth clark , 26 , said it had `` made her year '' after she stumbled across one handwritten note at a bus stop , and shared her amazement on twitter with a snap of the random act of kindness . twitter / @ruthclark91ruth , who is originally from scotland , said the surprise left her emotional as it was a short distance from where she had been involved in a bike accident several months earlier . ",
        "the kindness of the strangers who had come to her aid at the time of the accident was something she still remembered . she said : `` and just a few hundred metres from where , six months ago , a dozen or more complete strangers mopped me up , gave me blankets , stroked my hair and made me laugh as i lay broken and bleeding on the road waiting for an ambulance . `` not forgetting the guy who gave me his yoga mat to lie on , in what was possibly the most hackney hipster response ever ! ",
        "southgate road , what a road . '' ruth is back cycling , despite her accident , having made a resolution to save money by cycling to work . she hoped by sharing the post she would be sharing the goodwill . the note asked ruth to write to the mystery do-gooder about `` someone you think is extraordinary , someone who to you is magic '' on a post card with a return address , which they had provided . the post was popular on the social media site , garnering close to 1000 likes , and followers commented that is was `` a wonderful thing for someone to do . '' ",
        "but some twitter used were more than sceptical about the do-gooders motivation . one user commented : `` slightly concerned by the postcard request , they are not free a service has been requested . looks a bit `` serial killerish '' to me ... . here 's some flowers , looking for victims , any recommendations ? '' another commented : `` you 've obviously not watched enough crime drama on tv . hmm , flowers left by strangers collected by the unsuspecting . i 'd be very careful if i were you . ''   "
