        "fiercely competitive smartphone market shifts focus from hardware features to virtual brainpower . zhao ming , president of huawei 's honor brand , delivers a speech at the launch ceremony for their ai phone honor v10 . many commentators have deemed 2017 to be year one for the artificial intelligence smartphone as iphone x and honor v10 launched into the highly competitive but uniform cellphone market . so will an intelligent phone be the next great breakthrough ? the smartphone competition battlefield has shifted from pursuit of super-slimness , dual-cameras , fast-charging to full screen , yet none of these hardware features lies at the core of phone manufacturers ' competitiveness , explained zhao ming , president of honor -- a phone brand of huawei . ",
        "according to a china academy of information and communications technology report , cellphone shipments by domestic brands reached 3.19 million in october , down 15.4 percent year on year . similar features and designs make domestic smartphone players swim in the highly competitive , margin-eroding `` red ocean '' . the smartphone market 's future lies in the prospect that an intelligent handset can serve as a personal assistant for users ' daily lives , taking care of their needs and letting amateurs become masters , empowered by state-of-the-art ai technology . last month honor launched its full-screen v10 smartphone with ai-enabled chipset in beijing . ",
        "the new handset promises fresh , exciting ai features ; it supports face-unlock technology -- the screen will light up automatically when the owner gazes at it . the phone can identify 13 kinds of scene and improve parameters in photo shooting and video recording . the more consumers use the ai-empowered phone , the more data it collects . the handset in your pocket will know you better and function in a more nuanced way to make your life easier . younger appeal . honor , launched four years ago in 2013 , has thrived by taking advantage of its parent company huawei 's well-established name . ",
        "the brand , which sells its products primarily online , has issued several flagship phones which have been well-received by the market ; it has become a pioneer in the intelligent phone field . `` we give unique identities to huawei and honor . huawei mate are our flagship phones that boast upscale business style , while many of the functions we put in honor are appealing to young people , '' noted zhao . highlights of the latest model include 30 sets of mobile phone wlan co-broadcast music and optimizing performance when the users play the smash-hit game king of glory . ",
        "the cost-effective internet business model has let the brand sell models to younger consumers at 1,000 yuan to 3,000 yuan . honor v10 is priced at 2,699 yuan for the 4 gb ram/64gb internal storage variant and 3,499 yuan for 6 gb ram/128gb internal storage variant . ai speed revolution . the ai smartphone became a buzzword when iphone launched its latest gadget , iphone x . the iphone x 's `` original deep camera '' achieves facial recognition by sensing the depth of the user 's face and modeling it with 300,000-point clouds to achieve high precision . there is at present no consensus on defining an ai smartphone . ",
        "but the growing consensus among researchers is that ai smartphones should have end-to-end capability from ai chips that can conduct ai processing on the mobile devices ; an ai algorithm that enables deep learning ; cloud services and an ai system . honor v10 's kirin 970 ai chip is designed to be used in smartphones . the kirin 970 is custom-made to conduct such tasks as sorting images , translating text and understanding speech . `` it 's a game with very few players , '' zhao said . in 2012 , honor began its ai research . last year it released the first ai cellphone , honor magic .

",
        "`` for the past years , when we talk about the speed of smartphones , we are thinking about hardware . yet the improvement in hardware has reached a bottleneck ; even when the processing speed doubled , it brought negligible differences of fractions of seconds to users . `` the moment we had an idea in mind , we are already operating our phone , if we respond to such a request from the users ' minds we can streamline the process significantly , '' zhao said . taking the parameter camera setting as an example -- using ai , people who have no knowledge of photo-shooting can snap pictures that mirror those taken by professional photographers . ",
        "`` i think that is the beauty of ai smartphone , that you can be more engaged in many facets of life effortlessly , '' zhao said .   "
