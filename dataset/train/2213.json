        "the overwatch league 's inaugural season is in full swing . favorite teams have already been chosen and the special skins have been purchased . but there are no women among the all-star lineups and the flashy team colors . overwatch has a huge , diverse fanbase with a ton of non-male players , so where is the official representation ? if women were in the world cup , they should also be in the pro league . but they are n't . we 've seen a few women compete in the overwatch world cup before , so what happened ? ",
        "the reasons we 're given , whether by team managers or the players themselves , are symptomatic of larger problems . professionals are turning a blind eye to a very specific opportunity to challenge the current esports climate . a growing industry like esports has room to stretch its legs -- but right now , it 's a boys ' club . and the solution is n't creating a similar , separate girls ' club to level the playing field . the solution is to get women in the same arena , right alongside the men . but you have to begin work at the bottom before you can fix what 's going on at the top . ",
        "`` if women really wanted to compete , no one would stop them `` we should be focusing less on what the norm is now and more on why the pool of professional women players is so small . the easy and short-sighted response is that there just are n't any women who are that good at the game or that they 're simply not interested in playing on the competitive level . that idea is absolute bullshit . consider the case of ysabell m√ºller , who has played the game since the overwatch beta launched . wired reports : she says she had designs on going pro herself but found that getting useful feedback from her teammates was difficult . ",
        "`` they treated her , she says , like she could n't endure criticism -- that if criticized she would be offended and accuse her teammates of sexism and get them kicked out of the game . `` it 's not about whether women are even interested in going pro . it 's about if they can even endure participating in today 's climate . most talented female players stop short of considering themselves professional competition , knowing the kinds of harassment they 're likely to endure . women face the toxicity of male players as soon as they turn on their mic . ",
        "comments quickly devolve into criticism , accusations of being a `` fake gamer girl , '' sexist comments , and then rape threats and death threats . the challenge becomes one of endurance of abuse , not skill . even geguri , one of overwatch 's top players in the world , even considered buying a program to change the sound of her voice . with a toxic culture firmly place , it 's misguided to think that women have `` absolutely no reason not to compete . `` no one is immune to the verbal , gendered abuse people receive on a regular basis , and expecting someone to be that hardened is unrealistic . ",
        "whether you identify as a man , woman or non-binary -- enduring both online and offline abuse should n't be a prerequisite for competing at all , much less at the higher levels . yet we 're repeatedly told that `` if you ca n't take it , leave . '' putting up with toxicity like it should be another thing on our checklist of errands is not a feasible option , nor is it a sustainable one . if you want more female players to compete , you have to make the game itself more hospitable for everyone . ",
        "right now , the abuse is tolerated , if not ignored . men are the norm , where women have to prove they can take the abuse that everyone knows they 're going to get . we have to stop taking that abuse for granted . the first team with the `` token '' femalekotaku 's nathan grayson asked members of the overwatch league about the lack of female players during its opening weekend . their answers were disappointing , to say the least . `` you have to go through all these hurdles , like if you pick up a player , is the press gon na call it a pr stunt , or is it because she was the best ? '' ",
        "said outlaws general manager matt rodriguez . a `` pr stunt '' is an appalling first suggestion to describe a non-male hire . a `` stunt '' implies that the new hire is solely for media attention , as opposed to the team being a vanguard for long-term change -- and that the woman does n't deserve her spot on the team . there 's no reason to add a token female to the roster if she does n't have the skills to earn it . when grayson asked one of outlaws ' dps players about geguri , he said : `` people would always be doubting , always be judging . ",
        "so it has to be the right person , the right player , and those things have to come together at the right moment -- which makes it especially hard for women in the scene right now . `` but there is no `` right '' moment . waiting around for the first female player to magically join the league is , at least for now , another way of saying that these teams do n't want to be the ones to do it . teams must begin putting in the work now , not just to change the demographics of professional esports , but to course correct the toxic culture inherent to them . ",
        "and the more we normalize teams that are n't all-male , the less of an anomaly they will become in the long run . `` sure it can happen , but later , '' is a phrase that 's all too familiar , and it 's a crutch that wo n't hold up forever . everyone who comments on the problem just repeats the fear of taking a leadership role in real change . they take turns saying they 're too scared to do it . yet no one says they should n't be welcome because they ca n't take the heat . ",
        "it 's weird how that works , is n't it ? a well-oiled team is n't just skilled , they 're social `` we were trying to find someone who already meshed well with their team , '' scott tester , who had a large part in putting together new york excelsior 's team , told kotaku . `` so i do n't think it was really about her specific level of skill ; she 's a really talented player . `` it 's true that the dynamic of each team is invaluable . personal chemistry , mutual understanding and trust all have to be there . ",
        "but the term `` mesh well '' is thrown around a lot regarding team rosters . we keep hearing about skill , but never about what 's really the big fear factor here : socialization . and what we have to consider is , at least in geguri 's specific case , that the social climate may have played a large part of her absence in the league . in an interview with geguri , espn reported : in korea , it 's considered taboo for unmarried women and men to live together , which makes it hard for female gamers to move into team houses . ",
        "this stigma applies in other countries too ; north american coaches have expressed concerns that coed players might develop romantic ties . there are some valid practical and financial concerns . what will diverse teams do about shared housing ? while more and more teams are moving away from the idea of living in the same quarters , the communal construct still exists today . but we wo n't know how that changes the social structure until we try to challenge it . this argument is almost always a backdoor way of saying that the team itself would n't know how to act around a woman , not that the woman would n't fit in or would make problems for the team . ",
        "once again , the issue becomes what men are willing to endure , not whether the player has the skill necessary to play . managers and players telling kotaku that they `` absolutely see no reason why ca n't compete , '' if anything , is indicative of willful ignorance and demonstrative of how esports culture glosses over gender equality . in order to dismantle this , male players need to start speaking out . everyone needs to hold themselves accountable for the culture of toxicity . it 's the work we all need to put in to shift that perspective and make it a mainstream concern . ",
        "growing pains are inevitableif there is any game that can shatter esports ' glass ceiling , it 's overwatch . blizzard prides itself on overwatch 's rich , inclusive cast of characters . with a world full of people from such different backgrounds , it would only be natural for us to see more diversity among the pros too . that is to say , it 's not all on blizzard , the athletes , or the owl itself . it 's an entire culture that needs to shift . but the overwatch league is still new , and i believe it has a great potential to change things for the entire competitive space . ",
        "i do n't doubt that its teams and players can do it -- the sentiment is there . the fans definitely want to see women in the arena . it 's just a matter of who will take the first step .   "
