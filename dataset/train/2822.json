        "sacked catalan president carles puigdemont , in copenhagen to muster international support for an independent catalonia , has cited denmark 's autonomous territories greenland and the faroe islands as models for a peaceful bid for independence . but the model may be difficult to export , experts say . `` it 's not easy i know but you 're proof that it 's possible , '' puigdemont said monday during a seminar on the catalan crisis at the university of copenhagen . on tuesday , puigdemont was to meet with danish mps at the invitation of magni arge , a representative of the faroese separatist party tjodveld . ",
        "no representatives from the parties that make up denmark 's centre-right government will be present . arge , who served as an observer for the banned catalan independence referendum in october that saw a brutal police crackdown , said the purpose of the meeting was to take stock of relations between regional capital barcelona and the central government in madrid . and for puigdemont , the aim was to learn more about the road to independence being pursued by denmark 's former colonies . the scandinavian country -- a small parliamentary monarchy that has built its prosperity on reform , dialogue and consensus rather than social uprisings -- has since the 1950s gradually granted its former possessions increasing sovereignty . ",
        "negotiations have occasionally been thorny , such as those on control of natural resources , but for the most part disputes are resolved through compromise . `` it 's not a criminal act in denmark to be in favour of the independence of the faroe islands , '' arge told afp . - ` legitimate ' independence - in the case of greenland , it may be difficult for puigdemont to draw any parallels at all . the largest island on the planet , snow-covered and plagued by financial and social woes , has little in common with tourist magnet , wealthy catalonia . ",
        "its 55,000 inhabitants are for the most part indigenous inuits . in 2009 , the danish parliament adopted a law granting greenland self-rule , though copenhagen retains control of foreign affairs and defence . for the faroese people -- most of whom are fishermen and sheep farmers -- their status as islanders , coupled with copenhagen 's rather distant interest in the archipelago , means their independence drive is not much of a concern for most danes . the faroe islands , which receive sizeable government subsidies , will hold a referendum in april on a new constitution which would give the archipelago the right to self-determination . ",
        "`` full independence for these two parts of the kingdom is broadly seen as legitimate , should those parts of the kingdom so desire , '' says henrik larsen , a social sciences professor at the university of copenhagen . that said , `` the political elite would not like to see this . `` the danish government has made several concessions to avoid any unilateral declarations of independence like the one made in catalonia on october 27 , said marku suksi , a professor of international law at the university of turku in finland . spain has appeared less flexible or willing to make concessions on the question of independence . ",
        "`` denmark has shown once again that it understands democracy , '' puigdemont said on monday . but in catalonia , the reality is far more complex . the region , one of spain 's wealthiest , has its own language and culture . but of its 7.5 million inhabitants , more than half come from elsewhere or were born to parents from other parts of spain . and as far as independence goes , views among the catalans are evenly split . polls suggest , however , that more than 70 percent of catalans want the issue decided by a legal referendum . ",
        "- polar opposites - spain and denmark are polar opposites when it comes to their recent histories . spain emerged from four decades of dictatorship in 1977 . in 2011 , a violent four-decade drive for basque independence that claimed more than 800 lives came to an end . denmark has meanwhile flourished in peacetime to become one of the most prosperous and egalitarian countries in the world . within the european union , denmark is however seen as a fierce defender of its autonomy and sovereignty . it has negotiated several opt-outs on defence , justice and the single currency , and is occasionally perceived as overly indulgent of danes ' reluctance to deepen european integration . ",
        "`` it depends which government coalition is in power in copenhagen , '' says maria ackren , a political science professor in nuuk , the capital of greenland . `` and right now , it 's very conservative . `` danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen -- whose liberal party belongs to the same european parliament group as puigdemont 's party -- has refrained from all comment on the catalan crisis .
