        "-- romania 's political leaders quickly agreed on a new prime minister after this week 's shock government collapse , picking one who may last longer than her predecessors as the black sea nation gears up for the rotating european union presidency and navigates a slowdown in its booming economy . viorica dancila is set to become the black sea nation 's third premier in a year , and the first woman to take the job , after winning the president 's backing wednesday . the 54-year-old european parliament lawmaker , an ally of ruling-party boss liviu dragnea , must now select a cabinet and win a confidence vote scheduled for jan. . ",
        "29 , though that should be a formality . the leu , which had been under pressure , gained after the announcement . the ex-communist country of 20 million people is seeking stability after squabbles with social democrat leader dragnea sealed the fate of two prime ministers in less than a year . the latest feud saw mihai tudose resign suddenly after crisis talks late monday over his plans to reshuffle the cabinet . the turmoil has jeopardized one of the continent 's fastest-growing economies . romania takes over the eu presidency , which carries prestige and focuses the bloc 's attention on the host , in january 2019 . ",
        "`` the fact that dancila does n't seem to have any political ambitions will mean that this will be a more stable government -- she 's no threat to dragnea , '' andrei taranu , deputy dean at the bucharest political science university , said by phone . `` unfortunately , a stable government does n't necessarily mean a good government . '' wednesday 's news gave a small boost to the leu , which was eastern europe 's star performer until tudose 's surprise departure . the currency has gained 0.4 percent this year against the euro . romania is no stranger to political upheaval : dancila will be its 15th prime minister since 1990 , with only two completing their full term . ",
        "she 'll take over an economy that surged an annual 8.8 percent in the third quarter , though the european commission has questioned the sustainability of growth and the budgetary dangers of tax cuts and public-sector wage hikes . the commission sees gross domestic product rising 4.4 percent in 2018 . `` the economy seems to be on a very strong path and we continue to believe it has a very good outlook , '' matjaz schroll , head of private equity for central and eastern europe at franklin templeton investments , said in an interview at the euromoney conference in vienna . ",
        "president klaus iohannis 's decision to support dancila represents a concession after he earlier criticized the social democrats for the political turbulence that 's dogged national politics since their 2016 election victory . still , he 's been criticized by the opposition parties and supporters on his facebook page who wanted him to push for early elections . the appointment leaves dragnea as romania 's dominant politician , despite being prevented from taking the premier 's job himself because of a criminal conviction and other pending trials . he praised dancila 's `` peaceful attitude '' when asked about her suitability for office . ",
        "`` it 's very important that we move ahead with implementing the governing program and prepare for romania taking over '' the eu presidency , dancila said . -- with assistance from james m. gomez to contact the reporter on this story : andra timu in bucharest at atimu@bloomberg . net . to contact the editors responsible for this story : andrea dudik at adudik@bloomberg . net , andrew langley Â© 2018 bloomberg l. p.
