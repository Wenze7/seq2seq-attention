        "jan 19 -- kristoffer ajer says bulking up in the gym and training with other good defenders are helping him become a better centre-half . the norwegian teenager arrived at parkhead 18 months ago as a lanky central midfielder , but is now playing regularly at the heart of brendan rodgers ' backline . `` when i came here i was a midfielder , but i feel more secure as a centre-half now , '' he told the scottish sun . `` i needed time to get into the new role and understand how the gaffer wants central defenders to play . ",
        "`` a year ago , he was sent on loan to kilmarnock and the 16 league and one cup matches he appeared in for the rugby park club have aided his development . `` the loan out to kilmarnock also helped because i played there every single week as a centre-half , '' added ajer . `` i 've been in the gym after every training session since day one here . it 's been beneficial for me to bulk up a bit . `` i 've got a really good programme to follow in terms of bulking up , explosiveness and technical stuff on the pitch . ",
        "`` we have really good central defenders here and we are training hard every single day , really pushing ourselves . `` for me , as a young guy i 've learned so much from all the central defenders , including the latest , marvin compper . `` it 's something different to play for celtic . `` when you go out and hear 60,000 fans screaming and hoping you win , then you put everything you can into the game . i 'm sacrificing my body for this team . when you play for celtic every game is big . ",
        "now it 's brechin and we 're looking forward to it . ''   "
