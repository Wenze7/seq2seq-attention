",
        "the dog was returned to the shelter . tub tub has been found safe after being stolen . when tub tub was stolen , dominique searight of neptune had already signed the papers to adopt him for her 5-year-old twins , lana and alani . she went over to the monmouth county society for the prevention of cruelty to animals in eatontown around 3 p. m. christmas eve to pick him up . `` i came in i did all the paperwork , and i adopted the dog -- and got the collar , got the leash , i got everything -- and i literally was just waiting for dog to come out , '' said searight , of neptune . ",
        "but the shelter could not find the 9-year-old dog . `` at first , you know , we thought maybe the dog might have been out with a volunteer being walked , or maybe in back being bathed . you know , we searched high and low for the dog and could n't find him -- and came to realization that someone stole him , '' said ross licitra , chief executive director of the monmouth county spca . there was no trace of the 7-pound dog -- just an empty kennel near an unlocked exit used for walking dogs . ",
        "late tuesday , the shelter was considering putting locks on all the doors so that only employees could freely go in and out .   "
