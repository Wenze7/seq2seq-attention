        "cleveland -- it only took two plays for isaiah thomas to wind up planted on his right hip , the same hip that caused him to miss nearly seven months of action . just like the consecutive knockdowns the 28-year-old suffered last spring , thomas popped right back to his feet . it comes as no surprise that the second-team all-nba point guard bounced back from a hit to a vulnerable area only to turn in a fine 17 point performance in 19 minutes almost a year removed from his last game . it is that same trait that the 5-foot-8 all-star 's mvp teammate cherishes about him . ",
        "`` what i like most about him is he has a chip on his shoulder for life , '' lebron james said . `` that 's just who he is . when a guy has a chip on his shoulder for life , he he 's never not going to give his all , he 's not going to disappoint you . '' what was really just insult to injury following the death of his sister , chyna , in april of 2017 , the torn labrum in his right hip became thomas 's full-time focus . what was originally his escape from tragedy became its own emotionally taxing grind . ",
        "thomas even said that part of why tuesday night was special was because the light at the end of that tunnel was so hard to see for so long . yet sure enough , just as life does , thomas got another bump , being sent to the floor on his first drive to the hoop . he landed on his right hip , which was actually welcomed by james post-game and forecasted by lue pre-game . speaking about his comeback from a 10-month microfracture recovery during his playing career , lue said thomas 's first bump would be an important one . ",
        "post-game lue was talking about how good it was that his miniscule guard was mowed over by a portland big only to pop up again . by now , for thomas , it has just become part of the plan . `` i was like , ` well , that 's not going to change , ' '' he laughed . `` i just have to figure out ways to fall , but it felt good and i popped right back up . i knew that was going to happen . we 've just got to figure out ways to hit the ground , i guess . '' ",
        "every athlete endures injuries , though most are not as serious as what thomas has dealt with . fears have arisen from the time the cavaliers dealt for thomas right up until the tip of his team debut about how much maintenance his hip will take . one journey has led to another with thomas 's injury , and by all accounts , there will be more pain ahead for him . though if there has been anything that has come to light about `` mighty it '' since last april , it is that he can play through that pain . ",
        "his teammates see it , and now the world should too . for now , that pain is gone more or less , and nothing but good things lie immediately ahead . `` it was a long journey for me , '' thomas said . `` for that day to come in the first couple days , 2018 is going to be a special year .
