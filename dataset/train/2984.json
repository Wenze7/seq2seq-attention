        "a few months ago , i warned that passive investing -- long a worthwhile , admirable trend fueling the growth of exchange-traded funds -- was in danger of becoming a mania . get our activist investing case study ! until now , few on wall street have really cared . i mean , if the main thing is to keep increasing `` assets under management '' -- hopefully in etfs owned and managed by your investment bank -- then you want this trend to go on and on . but that 's starting to change . passive investing presents a `` frightening '' risk to the markets , said a top morgan stanley strategist on cnbc in recent days . ",
        "hans redeker , the bank 's global head of foreign exchange strategy , put it plainly : `` when you have people getting more involved with passive investment strategies , the market will be less able to react to minor distortions or minor declines on the fundamentals side . '' translated , he means that a big decline in the stock market is going to come seemingly out of nowhere . never in the relatively short history of passive investing has that danger been higher than now . blackrock -- the world 's largest asset management firm -- said it saw record inflows of $ 74 billion . ",
        "bank of america merrill lynch said $ 4 billion flowed into growth stock etfs last week -- the highest amount on record . among investors ' allocations of stocks , bonds and cash , most are choosing to keep only 10 % of their money in cash -- near a record low -- while devoting 60 % to stocks . the point i made back in may , when i last wrote about the danger of passive investing when it becomes a `` ca n't miss '' strategy , was that etfs are akin to a weekly art auction where the biggest buyer sweeps in and `` buys the entire lot of paintings , the good and the bad , without a question about price . ",
        "you can see the problem . without an active bidding system , price becomes irrelevant . there 's no rational way to determine the good from the bad . '' the danger alluded to by the morgan stanley strategist is that price stays irrelevant -- until it 's not . on that day , investors will wake up and realize that it 's very relevant indeed , as they 've let themselves be bamboozled , flimflammed and conned into buying stocks at sky-high record prices ... for the third time in 20 years . kind regards , . jeff l. yastine .
