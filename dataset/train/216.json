        "i somehow managed to miss out on capcom 's action-rpg masterpiece , okami , when it came out on the playstation 2 in 2006 . then i missed it again when it came out for the wii in 2008 . then i missed it again when it came out for the playstation 3 in 2012 . i finally nabbed the wolf by the tail this week with okami for the playstation 4 . you 'll likely be unsurprised to learn i think it 's a great game . it 's a gorgeous romp inspired in equal parts by zelda and japan 's shinto religion and traditions . ",
        "also , i generally enjoy playing as bestial protagonists . lunging at my enemies ' throats with my teeth bared makes for a nice change from swinging a sword or shooting a gun . `` four legs good , two legs bad , '' and all that . er , orwell was stating his preferred rpg hero archetype when he penned that line , right ... ? i did n't pay much attention in grade 10 literature . but i appreciate okami for reasons beyond its graphics , gameplay , and themes . i just appreciate the fact it and games like it exist . ",
        "that is , i 'm glad there are games thoroughly steeped in japan 's culture and traditions , and i 'm glad follow-up questions about said traditions are easily answered with the internet . whatever goes upon four legs is a friend . video games were n't just considered kids ' stuff through the '80s and most of the '90s . once games started coming from nintendo , they also took on an air of mystery -- and , in the united states , an air of foreignness that came under scrutiny . in the '80s and '90s , it was hard to find news about video games from the country that specialized in them . ",
        "game magazines sometimes dedicated a page or two to japanese releases that rarely stood half a chance of getting localized . when i first heard super mario bros 3 existed in japan , it was like learning unicorns lived in some far-off corner of earth . i accepted the game as something that was probably real , but i could n't confirm for myself one way or another . game magazines barely had the space necessary to tell us about the state of the industry in japan ; they sure as heck did n't have the real estate to talk about how the country 's traditions influence games ' stories and symbolism . ",
        "thus , a trope we consider standard in games today -- say , a leaf being the basis for shape-shifting magic -- was laughed off as bizarre . eventually , the advent of the internet gave scholars endless space to educate us about shinto . moreover , people who were generally more learned about japanese culture than the rest of us cackling schlubs took to message boards to educate us on why a leaf made mario grow a racoon tail . gradually , we learned -- but not before we made reams of flash videos and sprite comics about how the nintendo games we grew up with were `` sooo weird '' because their developers `` probably did sooo many drugs , lol . '' ",
        "ok but to be fair , having the sun drop out of the sky to kill you * is * the stuff of bad acid trips . of course , sometimes we just unknowingly appropriated japanese folklore , albeit in good faith . i still have a multi-page fantasy `` novel '' i wrote in '92 that lifts monsters straight from dragon quest iii , including the multi-headed dragon orochi -- a creature directly out of japanese myth , though i had no idea . i just thought the evil serpent was dreamed up for a video game . so , i 'm glad younger generations can get instant answers when they play a game like okami . ",
        "i 'm glad i can tell them `` well , it 's because -- '' when they ask why mario changes when he grabs a leaf , or why so many games from japan have temples , arches , and multi-tailed foxes . heck , i 'm just glad a game like okami is readily available for anyone who wants to play it . it was n't too long ago when games were kept away from english-speaking audiences because they were `` too weird '' or `` too japanese . '' even those that squeaked through were subject to alteration , e. g. bandai 's dragon ball game for the famicom became `` dragon power '' and was given box art that 's a perfect visual representation of how asian culture was regarded at the time . ",
        "at least dragon warrior iii 's orochi did n't become `` smaug '' or something . now that games like okami are actually encouraged to dart across the gaming landscape as freely as a wolf tearing through fields of flowers , i hope kids skip cheap jokes about how unfamiliar inspirations probably all came `` from drugs , ha ha ha . '' i hope they proceed directly to the stuff that kindles inspiration and imagination .   "
