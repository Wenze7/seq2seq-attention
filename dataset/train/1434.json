        "live manitoba more streams a plan to build an addictions treatment centre on the site of a st. charles hockey arena has cleared its first hurdle at city hall . council 's property committee voted monday to approve the sale of vimy arena , a vacant recreation facility in the crestview neighbourhood , to the province for a loonie as a prelude to the construction of a 50-bed addictions-treatment centre called the bruce oake recovery centre . city real-estate managers recommended the land be sold to the province to lease the land to the bruce oake memorial foundation for a loonie a year for 99 years . ",
        "the province , however , only offered the city of winnipeg $ 1 for the site . council 's property committee voted to amend the deal to forgo revenue from the sale . over the course of a day-long meeting , two dozen delegates addressed the committee , including broadcaster scott oake , whose son bruce died of an opioid overdose . he urged councillors to forgo $ 1.43 million and accept the province 's offer of a loonie . `` i implore you to not let this become a dealbreaker . i ask you to find a mechanism for which the city can find a way honour the province 's request to have this land change hands for one dollar , '' oake said . ",
        "councillors john orlikow , jenny gerbasi and matt allard voted in favour of the plan . `` this is a derelict building we ca n't salvage that 's full of needles and drug deals right now , '' gerbasi said . st. charles coun . shawn dobson opposed the sale of the land in his ward because he wants it reserved for green space . he accused the city of rushing through the deal without consulting residents or himself . assiniboia mla steven fletcher , who also opposes the project , appeared before property committee to express similar views . ",
        "`` urban green space is extraordinarily rare and once it 's gone , it 's gone , '' said fletcher , an independent mla . oake said the treatment centre would rise only on the existing arena footprint and said no green space along sturgeon creek would be lost . recovered cocaine and alcohol addict jonathan parker said concerns about green space are a smokescreen for people who simply do n't want an addictions-treatment centre in their neighbourhood . `` what would happen if one of their children needed treatment ? would they have $ 35,000 to $ 50,000 to send them to a privately owned facility , or would they be knocking on the door of the fist facility , like the proposed facility , they could find ? ",
        "i think i know the answer , '' said parker , who received treatment at a facility in nanaimo , b. c. `` treatment taught me how to live . it taught me how to be sober and how to be a contributing member of society , '' parker said . `` residential treatment saved my life . '' he also ridiculed the notion drug dealers will gravitate to the addictions treatment centre in hope of making a sale . people who sell illicit pharmaceuticals are out to make money , not hoping to sell their wares to someone undergoing a relapse , he said . ",
        "the vimy arena also faces approval at executive policy committee and then council as a whole on jan. . 25 , where it must be approved by a two-thirds majority of elected officials . the sale is also subject to a successful rezoning , a process that requires a public hearing .   "
