        "jan 11 -- serena williams says he remains as focussed as ever on winning grand slams , although she insists she does not need success . the american has pulled out of her australian open defence due to fears over her fitness , having only given birth to her first child in september . it has been a whirlwind 12 months for williams since beating sister venus at last year 's australian open , as not only has she become a mother , she has also got married . serena had planned to return to the court in melbourne and despite being fit , said she did not feel at the level required to compete . ",
        "inevitably , the move has also led to suggestions that the 23-time grand slam champion has understandably become distracted by her new responsibilities and no longer has the desire to compete . however , the 36-year-old insists this is not the case , as although she no longer feels vindicated by success , she remains as determined as ever . `` i do n't need the money or the titles or the prestige , '' williams told vogue . `` i think having a baby might help . when i 'm too anxious i lose matches , and i feel like a lot of that anxiety disappeared when olympia was born . ",
        "`` maybe this goes without saying , but it needs to be said in a powerful way : i absolutely want more grand slams . ''   "
