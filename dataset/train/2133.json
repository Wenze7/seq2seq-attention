        "the post-dol world is here . despite delays , certain elements of the fiduciary rule are already in place . with full implementation scheduled for july 2019 , figuring out how to deal with the fiduciary rule is the top priority for many firms and advisors . here 's how you turn this regulatory bombshell to your advantage . do n't fight the inevitable . many of the largest investment managers have already made changes to comply with the fiduciary rule . for example , bank of america merrill lynch moved clients from commission-based accounts to fee-based ones . fidelity has been aggressive in positioning itself as a fiduciary to retirement plan participants . ",
        "the industry is moving towards a fiduciary standard , and soon a fiduciary level of service will be required to acquire and retain clients . win more assets and keep them longer . most everyone is familiar with the duty of loyalty portion of the fiduciary rule , while few understand the duty of care . stand out versus your competition by showing expertise on the most important part of the fiduciary rule . show clients that , despite the ambiguity surrounding the duty of care , you understand how to take care of them properly when it comes to investment advice . ",
        "avoid regulators ' scrutiny . in our meetings with wealth management executives and advisors across the country , the biggest concern we hear is : . `` when i/we get pulled in front of an arbitration panel , how will i/we justify my recommendations . '' this concern is understandable given the conflicts endemic to sell-side research and the lack of rigor in technical research . now is the time to upgrade your practice to leverage research that can stand up to regulators ' scrutiny and impress clients with your diligence . impress clients with thought leadership on the duty of care . ",
        "despite the lack of regulatory guidance for fulfillment of the duty of care , there is plenty of common-sense guidance from thought leaders such as wealthmanagement . com , marketwatch , michael kitces and kim o'brien , ceo of americans for annuity protection . they all agree that research that fulfills the duty of care should be : . comprehensive : incorporate all relevant publicly available data from 10-ks and 10-qs , including the footnotes and md&a . un-conflicted : provide unbiased research . transparent : show how the analysis was performed and the data behind it . relevant : show a tangible , quantifiable connection to fundamentals . ",
        "it 's hard to find fault in providing clients with research that meets these standards . in fact , most average investors probably think today 's research meets these standards , but it does not . impress clients with the latest in technology . research that meets these four standards can be hard to find . not long ago , it did not exist with scale and consistency . frankly , it 's not been in the best interest of most wall street firms to make this kind of research available to the masses . fortunately , recent advances in technology make it possible to deliver research that meets the four standards in a cost-effective manner and at scale . ",
        "advisors now have access to the research they need to fulfill the duty of care without raising costs for their clients . accordingly , the advisors who delay embracing fulfilment of the fiduciary duty of care risk losing market share to those that do . studies already show that advisors who embrace technology have higher aum , serve more clients , and have greater job satisfaction . some of the largest wealth managers are already reaping rewards from investment in technology . for example , morgan stanley 's wealth management division achieved record performance and propelled the stock to a $ 48 billion gain in market cap this year , which was driven , in part , by heavy investment in technology . ",
        "swiss bank ubs has also made technology and wealth management a focus . as a result , it has established itself as the top choice for high net worth individuals and ranks as the most valuable brand in the wealth management industry . in july 2016 , we estimated morgan stanley could enjoy a $ 28 billion boost to market cap from investing in wealth management technology , and we were too conservative by $ 20 billion . in our recent report on ubs , we estimate the firm could enjoy a $ 40 billion market cap boost from investing in wealth management technology . ",
        "here 's why regulators like this approach to the duty of care . for those that remain skeptical , we provide further explanation of each of the standards to underscore the self-evident nature of their importance to fulfillment of the duty of care . comprehensive . it 's no secret that corporate managers often exploit a large number of accounting loopholes to manipulate earnings per share . as a result , advisors have a fiduciary responsibility to analyze more than eps . only by reading through the financial footnotes and management discussion and analysis can advisors close accounting loopholes and assess the true profitability of a company . ",
        "despite the importance of reading 10-k 's and 10-q 's , many traditional research providers do n't do this work . one sell-side analyst even recently admitted he had n't realized that a bank he covered stopped filing reports with the sec two months before . this lack of diligence is how you end up with 21 out of 23 sell-side analysts telling investors to buy or hold valeant pharmaceuticals the day before it drops by 50 % . do n't clients deserve research that accounts for the entire financial picture of a company , not just a portion of it ? ",
        "why settle for anything less than analysis of all financial information ? warren buffett says he reads 500 pages of 10-k 's every day . jim chanos was able to spot the enron fraud by looking at its 10-k 's and 10-q 's . the most successful investors know that diligence matters . un-conflicted . not all sell-side research is conflicted , but how does one know what is or is not conflicted because of the disclaimers warning of a multitude of potential conflicts in every report . the same concerns apply to fund research , where the research providers are often paid largely by the funds they cover . ",
        "investors deserve truly unbiased research that is not influenced by relationships with the companies and funds under coverage . transparent . advisors need to prove to clients and regulators that they 're fulfilling fiduciary duties . clients are in need of convincing since roughly two-thirds of investors do n't trust the financial services industry to act in their best interest . client education is the key for advisors to overcome this mistrust . advisors who help clients understand their decision-making process and are open about the data and analysis behind their recommendations can reap long-term rewards . by getting clients more engaged in the process , advisors increase the probability of keeping clients committed to their investment plan through good times and bad . ",
        "fiduciaries need to be transparent enough to back up their investment research and recommendations with key details and the assumptions that drive them in real-time , not just when a regulator asks about them . relevant . take a hypothetical advisor that reads every 10-k and 10-q and then only buys stock in the companies with the highest proportion of the letter `` e '' in their filings . this process would be comprehensive , objective , and transparent , but it would not be relevant to long or short-term performance of the investment . without a tangible , relevant link to long and short-term performance , an investment process is incomplete . ",
        "with all the focus on sentiment , technical research , macro themes and other pure trading strategies , fundamentals can be overlooked . advisors and investors that ignore fundamental research are doing themselves a disservice , as research has found that even technical-based strategies can improve with the use of fundamental analysis . though fundamentals need not represent 100 % of the driver for investment decisions , they should not be 0 % . fundamentals matter , and investing without proper fundamental analysis puts clients at undue risk . advisors that can back up their recommendations with relevant fundamental research will take clients from those that do n't .
