        "old and new markets for meat and other ray products such as gill plates -- the tight-knit , feathery structures they use to strain plankton and small fish -- threaten the survival of all rays . bargara ray xpa has been created to draw attention to the plight of manta rays . courtesy bargarathe newest venture of bargara brewing company -- along with lady elliot island eco resort and research group project manta to spread the word about manta rays . lady elliot island is known as the `` home of the manta ray '' and has been recognized by padi as one of the top five places in the world to scuba dive with rays .
