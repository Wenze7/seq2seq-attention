",
        ". . and more women die , '' the authors wrote . `` despite measurement issues , it is clear that the united states maternal mortality rate is considerably higher than in most industrialized countries , and that most of these deaths are preventable , '' said dr. marian macdorman , lead author of both the study and the commentary . `` the problem is in generating the political will to both improve reporting and to improve health care around the time of birth , to save women 's lives . `` more information : marian f. macdorman et al , trends in texas maternal mortality by maternal age , race/ethnicity , and cause of death , 2006-2015 , birth .
