        "south korea has banned securities firms from handling bitcoin futures . exchange operator cboe launched first bitcoin futures on sunday night . huge demand for the product crashed cboe 's website and sent prices jumping . london -- south korean officials have reportedly banned local finance firms from handling bitcoin futures , one of the hottest new financial products to launch in years . business korea reported that the financial services commission of korea issued a directive banning securities firms from taking part in bitcoin futures transactions , citing sources . south korea has taken a tough stance on digital currencies , banning initial coin offerings earlier this year . ",
        "icos involve startups issuing their own digital currencies to raise funds . bitcoin is hugely popular in south korea . mati greenspan , an analyst with trading platform etoro , said in an email last week : `` recent estimates state that 21 % of all global btc volume are done in korean won . `` greenspan said proximity to north korea might help explain the higher risk appetite of south koreans . he added : `` after recently going through a political meltdown and ousting the former president park geun-hye , and after watching the ceo of the samsung go to prison on corruption charges , their faith in the system is currently at a justifiable all-time low . ",
        "`` bitcoin was originally created as an anti-establishment currency meant to be above the control of governments . bitcoin futures start with a bangthe ban on bitcoin futures was made ahead of the launch of the new products on sunday evening . chicago-based exchange operator cboe began offering bitcoin future contracts on sunday and was met with huge demand . cboe 's website briefly crashed and the price of both bitcoin and futures contracts leapt higher . hussein sayed , chief market strategist at fxtm , said in an email : `` the initial reaction was beyond expectations with the futures contract climbing more than 20 % and triggering two trading halts . ",
        "cboe 's website experienced unprecedented traffic which may well have sent a new benchmark ; the frenetic activity led to delays and outages . `` cboe 's product is the first that gives institutional investors such as hedge funds and asset managers exposure to bitcoin . the market allows them to speculate on the future price of bitcoin without having to directly buy and hold the digital currency . this skirts any regulatory and custodian issues that might be presented by bitcoin . institutional investors have grown increasingly interested in bitcoin as the cryptocurrency 's price has continued to rise . ",
        "bitcoin is up over 1,000 % against the dollar so far this year and rose as much as 40 % in the last week alone . sayed said : `` so far , it seems professional investors are n't willing to bet against the bitcoin , despite the many warnings of a bubble that will burst soon . many traders are n't even interested in the price direction , but the listing of the futures contract on cboe and later next week on the cme will provide them an arbitrage trading opportunity due to the vast pricing differences . `` futures fearssouth korea 's regulators are n't the only people worried about bitcoin futures . ",
        "the digital currency is subject to huge amounts of volatility -- swings of 20 % on the day are not unusual -- and some market participants fear futures contracts could add a large degree of unquantified risk to the financial system . the futures industry association wrote to the commodity futures trading commission last week to complain that there had not been `` proper public transparency and input '' from industry over the products . banks such as jpmorgan and citi are also reportedly not clearing bitcoin futures for clients , at least for now . sayed said : `` the arbitrage trading will lead to improved price efficiency and probably less volatility . ",
        "after volatility settles down , the focus will return to the price direction . ''   "
