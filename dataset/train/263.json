        "la rochelle won their top-of-the-table duel with montpellier 26-14 at home on saturday to depose the visitors at the head of the french top 14 . the hosts , aggressive in defence and stronger in the scrums , were not going to pass up a chance to unseat montpellier who again struggled on the road , though not as badly as in their humiliating 26-0 loss at racing 92 the week before la rochelle , who have won all their home games this season , dominated but was unusually strangely uncertain and wasted several scoring chances in the second half when they could have built on a 16-6 lead . ",
        "instead , montpellier scored a try to close to within five points with 10 minutes left . la rochelle responded by bending their backs and pushed towards victory through the scrums they took each time they were awarded a penalty in the closing stages . the home team put the seal on victory after winning a scrum in the 79th minute . brock james side stepped three times as he went through to score the try which stripped montpellier of a defensive bonus point . `` there are lots of things to look at and to work on , '' said la rochelle head coach patrice collazo . ",
        "`` montpellier wanted to improve after their display at racing , they succeeded in stopping us playing and pushing us out of our game plan . `` in the first half , montpellier paid for their errors and indiscipline . home fullback vincent rattez pounced on a dropped montpellier ball after 16 minutes to launch a 70-metre counter attack with a kick downfield . paul jordaan gave chase and kicked on again before touching down . montpellier also conceded four penalties in range of their goal posts and alexi bales converted all of them `` we are disappointed to leave la rochelle without a point '' said fulgence ouedraogo , the montpellier captain . ",
        "`` we made a huge effort but were n't precise enough and were too indisciplined . `` later saturday , toulouse have home advantage as they take on castres who are one place and three points behind them . third-place lyon travel to the wounded giants , toulon . on sunday , clermont host agen with racing making the short trip through the western paris to visit near neighbours stade francais in the final game of the weekend .
