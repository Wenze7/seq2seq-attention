        "auburn 's run to the sec championship came up short saturday . now , attention turns to gus malzahn , and whether he 'll long for the plains or back home in arkansas . gus malzahn 's job status has been one of the burning questions this sec season . with auburn 's ad departing , it 's a wonder if malzahn will be on the sidelines win orange and blue next year . the lone vacancy that could open up this opportunity is in fayetteville . the arkansas razorbacks , of course , let go of both ad jeff long and more importantly bret bielema at the end of the year . ",
        "malzahn 's arkansas roots have led many to link him to the job opening . would malzahn consider such a move ? he has n't necessarily denied moving on , but he has n't , of course , said he would move there outright , either . the differences between the jobs in auburn and fayetteville are pretty stark and noticeable . still , the athletic director opening at auburn will likely dictate whether or not the gus bus will still barrel through its current residence . his relationship with the staff had been tense , which is why these rumors were percolating so muchyou can conceivably craft cases for gus to either stay at auburn or flee the coop to go to arkansas . ",
        "we decided to do that , and here are the results . the case to stay at auburnpros : the case for staying at auburn lies with continuity and talent . malzahn has helped build a pretty stable program in the past few years , even with the weird years of 2015 and 2016 in mind . he has shown the capability that the tigers have at their absolute best , and it resulted in a national championship trip and two sec west titles . the talent that he has at auburn is also pretty stellar . he has a top 10 recruiting class coming in for 2018 . ",
        "he also has jarrett stidham , who more than proved his worth in his first year in malzahn 's offense . he can only get better with more polish , and he 'd have the opportunity to do so with gus still around . cons : the lack of a strong relationship with the higher-ups could lead to more division . a new ad would likely want `` his '' own guy , so any kind of rockiness could result in gus losing his job , anyway . he has n't worn out his welcome , obviously , but that 's typically the trend with athletic directors when they arrive in a new town . ",
        "gus has also arguably done everything possible while at auburn , besides win a national championship . and with rival alabama nearby , it 's always going to be difficult for the tigers to usurp the crimson tide as the state 's best program . gus could conceivably jump over to arkansas if he sees his cupboard as full enough . the case to go to arkansaspros : a fresh start and a change of scenery have never hurt anyone . it would n't hurt for malzahn to begin anew with a clean slate , either . gus has done everything at auburn , shy of winning a title as a head coach . ",
        "a new challenge and opportunity at arkansas would be a fascinating watch for gus . plus , he 'll earn a pay raise in fayetteville , too . there 's also another factor . gus would be going home to arkansas if he were to accept the razorbacks job . while he was born in irving , texas , gus made arkansas his home . he spent two years at the university as a wide receiver before going to henderson state in arkadelphia . there 's nothing wrong with going home , and if malzahn found comfort in heading back to arkansas , you could n't blame him for it . ",
        "cons : there is an obvious difference between the quality of rosters at arkansas and auburn right now . the razorbacks did n't recruit particularly well over the past few years under bielema . that showed in their futile 1-7 record in sec play in 2017 . even with malzahn 's coaching prowess , he 'd have a hard time in his first few years in fayetteville . arkansas certainly has a want to be good at football , but its location makes the job all the more difficult . plus , we 've seen what the razorbacks ' ceiling is already . ",
        "under former head coach bobby petrino , the hogs went to the sugar bowl and had two 10 + win seasons . gus moving to arkansas would probably be a downgrade as far as jobs go , even with the home factor in play for him . the verdictin the end , gus should ... probably stay at auburn . the prospect of going home is certainly a cozy one . and it 's one that 's hard to ignore , too . gus already has a year of success under his belt in the state , taking the arkansas state red wolves to a 9-3 season , a sun belt title and a bowl win . ",
        "but let 's be honest : the state of both programs are so starkly contrasting . auburn was one game away from the college football playoff this year and will still have a bevy of talent at its disposal next year . they also made a new year 's six bowl game just last year , and will be playing on new year 's day again this year , too . compare that to how things are going at arkansas , and the two jobs could n't be more different right now . the razorbacks had one of their worst seasons in recent memory . ",
        "the talent is n't there right now , and it would take an incredible effort to get them back up to the level they were at the beginning of the 2010s . time will tell to see what happens , though . as we 've learned in this silly season , just about anything is possible . more from fansided ufc 218 : yancy medeiros strikes down alex oliveira in instant classic21m ago brian cashman got his man in new yankees manager aaron boone22m ago ufc 218 : david teymur scores decision win over drakkar klose45m ago ufc 218 : felice herrig edges casey via split decision1 h ago scott frost and staff set to coach ucf in bowl game1 h ago auburn 's run to the sec championship came up short saturday .
