        "president donald trump is taking credit for the safety of the u. s. aviation system even though it is being run by a holdover from the previous administration and has avoided any commercial passenger fatalities for several years before he took office . `` since taking office i have been very strict on commercial aviation , '' trump said in a tweet tuesday morning . `` good news -- it was just reported that there were zero deaths in 2017 , the best and safest year on record . `` if by `` commercial aviation '' he means scheduled passenger airline flights , the record actually stretches back to july , 2013 , when an asiana airlines plane struck a seawall as it was about to land in san francisco , killing three people . ",
        "the last death on a u. s.-registered airline was in 2009 near buffalo , new york . commercial aviation generally refers to paying customers on planes of all sorts . the national transportation safety board reported at least 13 deaths last year in seven crashes involving commercial charter flights in the u. s.last year was unusual in one regard : there were no fatalities involving scheduled passenger jet airliners anywhere in the world , according to the aviation safety network . but there were 10 airliner accidents resulting in 44 occupant fatalities and 35 deaths of people on the ground worldwide last year when charter and cargo planes were included . ",
        "this makes 2017 the safest year ever , both by the number of fatal accidents as well as in terms of deaths . in 2016 , asn recorded 16 accidents and 303 lives lost . `` i 'm unaware that the president has had any impact on aviation oversight policy or practice , '' said bob mann , president of aviation consultancy r. w. mann & co. . `` social media is not ` oversight . ' '' `` in fact , his stated preferences -- less ` red tape , ' fewer regulations -- would suggest a preference for less oversight , not strictness . ",
        "`` earlier : trump backs air-traffic spinoff to fix ` broken ' systemthe trend toward safer flying has been building for years as u. s. regulators , the airlines and safety investigators brought on board new safety technologies , better monitoring of potential hazards and improved training . indeed , the head of the federal aviation administration during the first year of the trump administration michael huerta was appointed by former president barack obama . huerta 's five-year term expires on jan. . 6 . last year 's aviation safety record is the culmination of decades of work by industry and governments worldwide and should be applauded as a success story , said john cox , chief executive officer of consultant safety operating systems and a former commercial airline pilot . ",
        "`` it 's a great thing but i do n't think any one individual can take credit for it , '' cox said . `` as the head of the federal government , i suppose you can take credit for the very good work the faa has done over the years , but it 's the work the people in the trenches have done that has led to this result . `` the faa referred all questions to the white house . `` president trump has raised the bar for our nation 's aviation safety and security , '' raj shah , a white house spokesman , said . ",
        "he cited anti-terrorism efforts and a plan to privatize air-traffic control that has languished in congress . `` the president is pleased there were no commercial airline deaths in 2017 , and hopes this remains consistent in 2018 and beyond , '' shah said . trump had harsh words for the faa 's air-traffic control system last year during the debate over whether it should be privatized and spun off to a non-profit . he cited a technology modernization program he said was not progressing fast enough . `` they did n't know what they were doing , '' he said of previous efforts to modernize the system . ",
        "`` a total waste of money . ''   "
