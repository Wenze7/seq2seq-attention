        "a waikato dhb member was the subject of three complaints in the space of two months . all the complaints relate to the board member 's behaviour toward staff . but the dhb is refusing to name the member in question , citing privacy concerns . and its stance is being back by the board 's acting chair , who says nothing would be achieved by naming the offending board member . read more : material released to stuff under the official information act reveals three complaints have been made against board members this term . all the complaints relate to a single board member and were filed in january and february 2017 . ",
        "each complaint was forwarded to then waikato dhb chairman bob simcock , who sought legal advice . the outcomes of the complaints have not been disclosed and health board staff have declined to discuss the matter . waikato dhb acting chair sally webb said it was appropriate not to name board members who were the subject of complaints . `` i think people are entitled to have their privacy respected and i do n't see any public good in naming the person , '' webb said . her focus was getting board members working together as a team `` rather than looking back '' . ",
        "the waikato dhb came under fire in 2017 over the handling of its investigation into disgraced health boss nigel murray , with its own board members saying the dhb needed to be more transparent . murray resigned as waikato dhb chief executive on october 5 following a two-and-a-half-month investigation which found evidence he had misspent health dollars . health board data shows 161 complaints were made against staff by colleagues between january 2016 and september 2017 . the complaints include allegations of bullying and harassment , assault , uncivil or unprofessional behaviour , and unauthorised contact with patients . in 2017 , the waikato dhb launched an urgent probe into claims of bullying of young doctors by senior colleagues . ",
        "the allegations were contained in a damning report by the medical council of new zealand , with claims bullying and harassment were under-reported by intern doctors . the report said instances of bullying may not be reported by young doctors because of concerns about confidentiality and potential repercussions . in response , the dhb launched an independent review into bullying in its general medicine department . the findings of the dhb 's probe are expected to be released in january , but board member clyde wade said the allegations contained in the medical council 's report were short on specifics . ",
        "`` unless somebody is prepared to identify who it is that 's doing the bullying , then it 's hopeless , '' wade said . `` we 've got 7000 employees , so some sort of nonspecific complaint about bullying , from the point of view of the organisation being able to do anything about it , is completely useless . '' the waikato dhb 's director of people and performance , greg peploe , said the health board had robust processes in place if a staffer wanted to make a complaint against a co-worker . peploe said the dhb provided a safe working environment , but acknowledged some staff might not report bullying because of concerns over the consequences . ",
        "`` i would accept there is a likelihood of people not reporting issues due to concerns about victimisation . are those concerns legitimate ? probably not , but that does n't mean that person does n't genuinely believe that . '' between january 2016 and september 2017 , the health board received 297 complaints about staff from members of the public . of that total , 183 were lodged in 2016 . complaints included concerns about staff attitude and behaviour , treatment provided , staff competency and communication . peploe said it was heartening to note the rate of complaints had declined in 2017 . ",
        "`` we also have to put that figure in context , with the total number of interactions between waikato dhb staff and patients and members of the public in the hundreds of thousands each year , '' he said . `` 2017 has been a difficult year , not just in terms of obviously the publicity , but the hospital has been running at close to capacity . it 's pleasing to see in an organisation under stress , which we have been , we have n't seen complaints go up .
