",
        "we laughed , we cried , we picked out our favourites , including these very annoyed cats and one very disgruntled chug . these cats do not want to save the day . these little jaws will end your summer . ollie does not want to participate in any fiesta , anywhere , anytime . midnight will likely use an unforgivable curse for this . this little kitty just ca n't wait to be king so it can seriously banish its owner . this little feline does not choose you . this miffed cat wishes a plague of skulltulas on your house . ",
        "and ... this dear thing . someone help . ah , for good measure , look at this very good dog : . watch : watch the transformation of chick beauty in 60 captivating seconds .   "
