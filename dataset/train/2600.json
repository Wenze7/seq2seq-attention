        "bitcoin 's rally took a pause wednesday , suggesting it is n't about to make another run at its record reached last week . the fervour that propelled the digital currency past $ 19,000 , prompted in part by regulated us derivatives exchanges starting to trade contracts based on the unit this month , has yet to return . bitcoin traded around $ 15,947 as of 10:31 am tokyo time wednesday , according to composite prices on bloomberg , up 0.1 % from late tuesday though below that day 's high . `` nobody knows the ultimate value of this underlying asset , '' edward stringham , president of the american institute for economic research , a massachusetts-based research group , said on bloomberg television . ",
        "`` we can not predict whether it 's going to be zero or one million dollars or anything in between . '' for sceptics doubting whether individuals and businesses will truly start using bitcoin as a medium of exchange -- as opposed to some officially backed digital currency -- the short-lived rebound from the past week 's selloff portends further declines . `` it 's much more likely once you 've made a big downward movement like the one we made last week that you have a bigger and more complex correction , '' ric spooner , a sydney-based analyst at cmc markets , told bloomberg television . ",
        "`` once a market like this one locks into those patterns it becomes pretty good '' to follow via chart-based analysis , he said . spooner said it 's possible bitcoin could drop to $ 5,700 or $ 8,700 in coming months . bloombergpage 2home / stock optionoriginally published at ways2capital-review . blogspot . com on december 27 , 2017 .
