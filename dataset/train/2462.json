        "there are lots of things we want from the htc u12 , and other things we expect to see . update : a full specs list for the htc u12 plus has leaked and there 's suggestion that this might be the only flagship we get from htc this year , with no standard htc u12 set to launch . the htc u11 is an enormously impressive phone , but one with a headline feature that does n't quite convince , especially in the face of the flashy samsung galaxy s8 and now the likes of the samsung galaxy s9.so there 's room for improvement , and we 've got a whole list of ways the htc u12 could be the improvement we want to see . ",
        "if htc implements all of our suggestions it could well have a five-star phone on its hands . but before we get to that there 's the important matter of when the htc u12 is likely to launch , what it 's likely to cost , and what specs and features it might include . we do n't have definitive answers to any of those questions just yet , but rumors are rolling in . cut to the chase what is it ? htc 's next flagship phonewhen is it out ? probably early-mid 2018what will it cost ? a lot , expect upwards of $ 649 / £ 649/au $ 999 htc u12 release date and pricethe latest release date rumor points to a launch sometime in april , with no more specific date given . ",
        "that tallies with an `` inside source '' , who has said to expect the phone at an event in march or april . failing that , we might see the htc u12 in may , as it was only in may 2017 that the htc u11 was announced and june that it hit stores , and the htc 10 also launched in the month of may . a more recent leak has also stated that while an april launch was planned the phone may have been delayed until may . whenever it launches it 's sure to cost a lot . ",
        "the htc u11 launched for $ 649 / £ 649/au $ 999 , so you 'll probably have to pay at least around that much for the htc u12.htc u12 news and rumorsone of the latest htc u12 leaks includes a comprehensive list of specs , and comes from llabtoofer , who 's a fairly reliable leaker in matters of htc , so it could be accurate . they claim that the phone will have a 5.99-inch qhd + screen , a dual-lens camera with 12mp and 16mp lenses , a snapdragon 845 chipset and up to 6 gb of ram . ",
        "the u12 also apparently has an 8mp front-facing camera , a 3,420 mah battery , up to 256 gb of storage , a microsd card slot and ip68 certification , meaning it can be submerged up to 1.5 meters deep in water for up to 30 minutes . apparently though it wo n't have a 3.5 mm headphone port . they also shed some light on software and other features , saying the phone runs android oreo with htc 's sense 10 interface , sports ` htc face unlock ' and has edge sense 2.0 - which is a new version of the squeezable sides found on previous htc handsets . ",
        "the htc u12 plus has also been leaked , with the phone said to have a 6-inch wqhd + screen , two 8mp front-facing cameras , a snapdragon 845 chipset , 6 gb of ram , a 3,420 mah battery , 16mp and 12mp rear cameras , a microsd card slot , 64 gb or 128 gb of storage and htc 's edge sense feature . that sounds very similar to the specs of the standard htc u12 but there could be a reason for that , as another source says there wo n't be a standard htc u12 , with the htc u12 plus being the company 's only flagship of the year . ",
        "we 've also seen photos seemingly showing the htc u12 in the flesh , albeit partially obscured by stickers . taken at a 5g industry alliance event , the photos show an unannounced htc handset with a likely 18:9 screen and no fingerprint scanner visible on the front . the shots match up with an earlier leaked image supposedly showing the front of the phone . the image is very plain and it 's hard to make out many details , but it looks as though the u12 may have smaller bezels than most htc handset and with no visible fingerprint scanner it may be on the back , built into the screen or ditched altogether in favor of facial recognition . ",
        "this could be our first glimpse of the htc u12 . credit : suggestphonethe images somewhat line up with a recent leak , with a source claiming that the htc u12 will have a metal frame and a curved glass back , with a fingerprint scanner on the rear and a design that 's similar to the htc u11 plus . however , they add that the u12 will have a dual-lens camera and come in a new matt white finish , which could change the look and feel of the handset . additionally , htc has revealed that it will start making dual-lens phones again in 2018 , so the htc u12 may well be one of them - especially as other rumors talk of a dual-lens camera and the company is supposedly only launching two phones this year . ",
        "we can also take some educated guesses about the upcoming phone . the design of the htc u11 and htc u11 plus is new and generally impressive , so we 'd think a similar , though probably refined , design will be used for the htc u12 . that means a rounded glass shell with a two-tone color that changes depending on the angle you look at it . we 'd also expect htc will keep the water resistance from the htc u11 , while the company 's impressive boomsound audio is likely to make a return in some form . ",
        "what we want to seethe htc u11 is a four and a half star phone , but for the htc u12 to get five stars the following changes would help . 1 . improvements to edge sensehtc largely sold the u11 on the strength of edge sense , yet while being able to do a short or long squeeze of the phone to launch apps , turn on the torch and take photos is a nice idea , it feels a bit half-baked . it 's not sensitive enough for one and while you can choose what you want it to open or activate it does n't go deep enough right now . ",
        "it 's set to get better , with more customization coming , but we hope it 's a truly essential feature by the time the htc u12 launches . 2 . better batterywe do n't want to be too hard on the htc u11 's battery , it 's actually quite decent . but it 's one of the many phones that requires a daily charge , rather than one of the very few that can last two days or more . it also did n't do brilliantly in our video test , where we play a looped video for 90 minutes and record the battery drop . ",
        "so hopefully the htc u12 will last longer , either through a bigger battery or via clever tweaks and optimizations . 3 . a snappier snapperthe htc u11 has a generally great camera , but there 's noticeable shutter lag . this is surprising from such a powerful phone , but it 's a problem that 's long plagued htc 's handsets and can be frustrating , even leading to missing the perfect shot . overall , the htc u11 is one of htc 's best camera phones ever , but we 'd like to see a higher shutter speed for the htc u12 . ",
        "in fact , we do n't want to see any noticeable pause at all when we take a photo , it should be instant . 4 . smarter sense companionalthough not hyped as much as edge sense , htc 's sense companion is just as useful -- and shows just as much room for improvement . this ai app monitors the weather , your location , your calendar , your battery level and how much you 're using your phone and gives you alerts accordingly . that could mean reminding you to charge your phone before you head off to a meeting , or telling you when you 're using your phone too much . ",
        "it also gives you suggestions of places you might want to go for lunch nearby , but these never feel as useful as turning to google , while telling you you 're using your phone a lot is n't that helpful either if the app is n't going to motivate you to use it less . so developing these features more for sense companion 's inevitable htc u12 outing would make it a far more useful app . 5 . fewer fingerprintsas great as the design of the htc u11 is , it picks up more fingerprints than almost any other phone we 've come across . ",
        "so while we 'd be fine with seeing the same shiny glass finish on the htc u12 , hopefully the company will have found a way to repel prints , as well as making other small refinements to what 's generally a stunning look . 6 . front-facing speakershtc 's phones are known for great audio , whether listening through headphones or the built-in speakers , and the htc u11 is no exception , but we miss the front-facing boomsound speakers of old . in the htc u11 one fires from the earpiece and the other from the bottom edge , which both makes them easy to cover and means audio is less impressive when the phone is facing you -- as it will be when watching videos or playing games . ",
        "we doubt htc will move back to front-facing speakers for the u12 , but we would n't complain if it did . 7 . a brighter screenthe htc u11 has a flagship-class screen . it 's big , sharp and generally looks great , but it 's not quite as bright as the screens on some phones , and that , coupled with it being quite reflective , can mean it 's tricky to use comfortably in bright sunlight . its auto-brightness needs some tuning too , so that it 's less likely to either blind you or need manually turning up . ",
        "they 're small complaints , but ones that we hope are addressed by the htc u12 .2018 will also bring the samsung galaxy s9 .   "
