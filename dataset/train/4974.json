        "charming charlie has proposed a plan to ease its debt load and secure new financing as it executes a strategy to boost profits after months of inventory problems and declining sales . the plan would allow the houston-based jewelry and accessories retailer to wipe about $ 69 million from its balance sheet after filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in delaware last month . lenders would assume control of the company and provide additional loans to help it emerge from bankruptcy and overhaul operations . if the plan is approved in court , charlie chanaratsopon , the houston millionaire who founded charming charlie in 2004 , will relinquish his majority stake in the company . ",
        "chanaratsopon , who now serves as non-executive chairman of the board , stepped down as ceo in october amid a cash flow crisis that ultimately left as much as $ 45 million in inventory tied up in ports and distribution centers . the plan swaps about $ 132 million in debt for new equity issued to the company 's lenders . it cancels all existing stock , which is also held by private equity firm hancock park associates , chanaratsopon 's family members and other investors . `` they 'll be effectively wiped out , '' said john bringardner , global legal editor at debtwire , a spokesman said neither chanaratsopon nor other company executives were available for comment . ",
        "the plan is expected to mark a turning point for charming charlie , which saw its debt mount as sales fell across the chain of about 390 stores . joshua sussberg , one of the company 's attorneys , said at a court hearing last month that the retailer took the unusual step of seeking bankruptcy protection during the holiday rush because it had too little cash to stock its stores . `` this is a company that has been flying the plane way too close to the ground , '' he said . the problems began in mid-2016 , when same-store sales began to decline after an unsuccessful effort to remake the brand , per court documents . ",
        "the company attempted to amend its debt obligations and cut costs , but by the end of last year , it had only $ 700,000 in cash , and suppliers held up inventory for lack of payment . charming charlie is one of more than 20 u. s. retailers that sought bankruptcy protection last year as shoppers increasingly went online and demanded more specialized offerings in stores . clothing and accessories stores , particularly those that operate in malls and shopping centers , saw particularly sharp declines in foot traffic . by the end of last year , charming charlie brought its store count to about 274 by closing 97 locations , primarily in texas , arkansas , california , oklahoma , maine and rhode island . ",
        "in the houston area , the closures included a store at citycentre and one in conroe . like many other retailers , the company is also negotiating more favorable rent terms with its current landlords to improve cash flow going forward , per court documents . `` when the retail carnage was n't so extreme , you had landlords who were n't willing to cut these deals , '' bringardner said . `` but they see what 's going on . `` charming charlie said in court filings that it needs new financing in order to buy enough inventory for the upcoming spring season , when shoppers seek colorful accessories and gifts for easter , mother 's day and other events . ",
        "the company 's lenders have agreed to provide $ 20 million in new financing , as well as $ 50 million to help it emerge from bankruptcy and a $ 35 million line of credit . much of that will be invested in company 's plan to expand its e-commerce operations and revamp remaining stores with new layouts and narrower product assortments . the company also plans to cut its vendor base by nearly half and utilize u. s. manufacturers to speed fulfillment . it 's now working with its current suppliers , which operate mainly in china , india and vietnam , to stock spring inventory . ",
        "`` they 'll come out a leaner company that 's better positioned to survive , '' bringardner said .   "
