        "with each new revelation of sexual misconduct by a powerful man , i ask myself , `` when will this end ? '' how is it that so many men have behaved piggishly -- illegally -- and the women they abused remained silent for fear that the humiliation they endured would only be worse if they came forward ? how is it that powerful organizations , including those media companies we trust to uncover stories of such wrongdoing , turned a blind eye ? and that question is the one that stops me dead in my tracks . am i part of the problem , too ? ",
        "for years , i 've said that i 've never faced sexual harassment . but it may be no accident that i 've been spared such an ordeal . i grew up at a time when it was assumed that men were sexually aggressive and it was up to the woman to apply the brakes . my father was very protective of me ; he once chased two teenage boys halfway across denver because they whistled at me when he picked me up at the public swimming pool . i learned early not to make eye contact with strangers of the opposite sex , to dress modestly and to be reserved .

        "it was no accident that after being chosen by my class to be prom princess , no boy asked me to the dance and i ended up going with a classmate whom the nuns assigned to take me . i 've always worked in male-dominated environments -- on capitol hill in the early 1970s , in the white house in the mid-1980s , in the corporate world since the late 1990s and in the media for the past 30 years . several of the high-profile men who 've been accused of harassment are men i 've worked for , alongside of or been interviewed by , some on multiple occasions . ",
        "when their names became public , i was n't surprised . in each instance , my antennae were up when i was around them . these were not guys i 'd allow myself to be alone with , certainly not in a social setting and especially not in their hotel room . but of course , many of the women who 've been attacked were confronted in the office . matt lauer is accused of summoning young women to his office and locking the door -- in broad daylight , with staff nearby ! the same was true of roger ailes . ",
        "their victims could not have avoided the situations that put them at risk . i 've been lucky , but maybe not so lucky as i 'd like to think . my husband reminded me of two situations i had told him about years ago when powerful media figures made advances with the implicit promise of advancing my career . i 'd brushed them off , never thinking of the behavior as harassment , but in both instances , i was never invited back on their shows . i was insulted at the very idea that i would need help from such cads -- but in both instances , i was already a well-established figure who could afford to walk away . ",
        "most women are n't in that position . they 're vulnerable , or they believe they are . we may never be able entirely to stop powerful men from attempting to use their power to take what they want . power and sex are a toxic combination . but we can support the women whose tremendous courage allowed them to come forward with these sordid tales . and those women who have some measure of power ourselves need to stand with them , even if we 've avoided the worst ordeals ourselves . we can also help by letting women know that they , too , have power -- the power to set up barriers to protect themselves . ",
        "walk away when you feel uncomfortable . say no to the first hint of improper behavior . say it loud and clear and let the man know that what he is doing not only is unacceptable but may cost him his job . do n't get into a car at night if you do n't know the man well . and never ever go to a man 's hotel room . these rules wo n't protect you in every situation , but they will send a powerful signal . and remember that no job , no promotion is worth losing your dignity or risking your safety .
