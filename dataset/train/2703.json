        "aston villa have confirmed via their official website that defender ritchie de laet has joined belgian side antwerp on a loan deal until the end of the season . the 29-year-old returns to the club where it all began , with the former stoke city and manchester united man graduating from the club 's academy in 2006 before heading to english football with the potters . de laet has struggled for game time this season , starting just once in the league for villa this season , and manager steve bruce has made the decision to allow the experienced pro to leave the club in search of first-team opportunities . ",
        "the former belgian international has a further eighteen months remaining on his contract at villa park , but with his loan move to antwerp confirmed , it is highly unlikely the player will pull on a villa shirt again . the verdictde laet is a model professional who has been an important part of the squad at villa park , but bruce has made the sensible decision to allow the player to head home to belgium in search of regular football . at only 29 , de laet still has a lot to offer , and antwerp will surely benefit from his presence as they go in search of european qualification this season . ",
        "the player is unlikely to play for villa again having not been in bruce 's plans this year , and is likely to be playing for a contract at antwerp over the next six months . villa fans , let us know your thoughts !   "
