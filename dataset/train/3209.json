        "dallas -- the dallas mavericks and phoenix suns , two teams struggling to gain some positive traction this season , enter monday night 's matchup on opposite ends of the emotional spectrum . the mavs were minutes away from a road victory saturday at san antonio before the spurs went on a 13-0 run to steal a game dallas controlled throughout . at the same time , the suns earned a rare come-from-behind road win at minnesota . now , dallas needs a win over the suns to avoid already a fifth losing streak of at least five games this season , while phoenix looks to notch consecutive victories for the first time since mid-november . ",
        "after the mavs ' gut-punch loss saturday , coach rick carlisle gave the team sunday off to reflect and recuperate on a loss in which kawhi leonard , tony parker and danny green sat out for the spurs . dallas has been playing better of late -- including a win over the spurs last tuesday -- but just ca n't shake making critical crunch-time mistakes that have turned a handful of would-be wins into a lump of frustrating losses . mavs coach rick carlisle called the end of the 98-96 defeat at san antonio , in which dallas turned it over trying to get the ball inbounds that led to a manu ginobili game-winning drive and layup , `` unforgivable . '' ",
        "`` we did everything right to lose , '' nowitzki told reporters after the game . `` we missed shots offensively , bad turnover , gave them some offensive rebounds , letting ginobili go left down the stretch to lay it in . we literally had to do everything perfect to lose this one and we did . `` dallas played a fifth consecutive game without rookie point guard dennis smith jr. . because of a strained left hip . smith , who is averaging 14.4 points , 4.0 rebounds and 4.0 assists a game , is questionable for monday 's game . ",
        "the injury-depleted suns got a much-needed boost from their newly acquired point guard , isaiah canaan , to squeak out the win on the road , where phoenix is 6-9 , two more wins than they have at home . canaan made three free throws with six seconds left to take the lead against the timberwolves . it was part of a 15-point , seven-assist , five-rebound effort in his first game since joining the team wednesday , and it helped the suns snap a five-game losing skid . `` moments like that at the end of the game , having playoff experience definitely helps , '' canaan told reporters after the game about his three pressure free throws he calmly made . ",
        "`` just to be able to calm down and know it 's like a regular free throw in a regular part of the game . so when i got fouled i knew i was going to step up to make them . `` canaan , who was playing in his just his second game of this season , the first of which came with the houston rockets , called his performance probably the second-best game of this career . the suns will need similar contributions from canaan because devin booker , out with a groin injury , is n't expected to return to the lineup until at least dec. .
