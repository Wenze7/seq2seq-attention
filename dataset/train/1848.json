        "jose mourinho has rubbished reports he could leave manchester united at the end of the season as ` garbage ' and is determined to stay at old trafford beyond his three-year contract . a report on thursday morning claimed united staff were concerned the portuguese could resign at the end of his second season and mourinho was described as a ` detached figure ' at the club . mourinho has resided at the lowry hotel since he arrived in manchester and complained the Â£ 286.2 million he has invested in the united squad is ` not enough ' . despite mourinho 's recent grumblings , he clarified he is determined to stay at united beyond his three-year contract . ",
        "`` look , it depends on what you want to know and what you want to speak about , '' mourinho said . `` if you want to speak about some news , i say garbage . i do n't find a better word to define the talk . `` if you want to ask me directly , which i suppose you want , if i see myself next season in manchester united , i say i see myself . and , as i told when i arrived , i 'm going to leave when the club wants me to leave , because i have no intention to leave at all . ",
        "`` my intention is to stay , and to work and to improve and to bring the club where to where the club belongs and i want to stay . and i do n't see any reason not to stay . yes , i still have a contract , in fact i am in the middle of my contract , i am not in the last couple of months , and my desire is to stay until the owners and the board is happy with my work . `` speaking about my work and connecting my work to the garbage news is to say that the worst thing anyone can do to myself , is not to say that i am a bad manager , is not to say that i am under-performing or that i made a mistake in this game or that game , the worst thing someone can do is put one inch of doubt into my professionalism , in my dedication to my club , to my job , to my players . ",
        "`` so yes , the garbage news affected me just on this aspect because it 's something i do n't admit . but again , i repeat i am in the middle of my contract , if i am going to sign a new one or no , of course it depends on the club but my commitment with the club is total and i want to stay . `` yes , i see myself here . i repeat , it is just a question of the club , the board , the owners , mr woodward , they all want , they all are happy with my contribution and they want me to stay beyond the end of this contract .
