        "google has now made available a new ` google maps go ' android app on the google play store . as the name suggests , this is an app which is related to the standard google maps app , although the go references how this is more of a lightweight version of the main app . as is the case with all things ` go ' labelled from google at the moment . as maps go is part of the wider go initiative first announced by google earlier in 2017 . in spite of being announced much earlier in the year , it was only in december when google first made available its go os through the release of a go edition of android 8.0 . ",
        "android go in itself is designed to provide owners of less capable phones with a version of android which is by definition less capable . or in other words , less resource demanding and therefore more suitable to run on devices that are not as capable of handling more demanding applications . which is where apps like maps go comes in . as part of that initiative google is readying multiple versions of its apps which are also designed to work with go os and be less taxing on hardware . the app is a free to download app , although the chances are good that a majority of users will not be able to download the app in the first place . ",
        "as the availability of the app is largely dependent on the hardware associated with a smartphone . while it is still unclear how this will be defined , it is probably a safe assumption to make that only phones running the new go edition of android go will be able to download the app . which is in contrast to the likes of files go which was also released by google recently . as while files go is built around the same premise as android go and maps go , it is available to download on other select devices . ",
        "in either case , more details on google maps go and the option to download on compatible devices through the google play store link below . google playthe post maps go android app now live on the google play store appeared first on androidheadlines . com | .   "
