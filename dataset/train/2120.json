        "honor has announced today , that it will be bringing its portfolio of smartphones into a new market in 2018 , and that new market is latin america . honor was a bit tight-lipped on what honor devices will be available in latin america , but it is promoting the newly announced honor 7x , which is being sold in the us for $ 199 . so it appears the honor 7x will debut in latin america soon , but honor has not mentioned exactly when that 'll be , in 2018 . the honor brand is actually a subsidiary of huawei , but it does like to be treated as a separate company . ",
        "honor is also a brand made for `` millennials '' , and that is because honor sells its smartphones online exclusively , and not through carrier partners -- only retail partners . making it easier to get its smartphones and also keeping costs low . as mentioned , the honor 7x is priced at $ 199 , and even the higher-end honor v10 is slated to be around $ 500 in the us when that launches in the near future . so honor is doing a good job of getting its smartphones out into the market , and at a low price point . ",
        "really driving competition in the market . honor takes great hardware , along with its great software and fuse them together in its smartphones , creating a smartphone for everyone . whether you are wanting something that 's on the cheaper end of the scale , or something more high-end . it does n't mean that you have to spend a ton of money for that phone , and that 's exactly what honor has been doing . and now it 's making its way into latin america . holiday gift guide 2017 - 2018 : the ultimate smartphone & tech gift guidewhile there are no specific announcements from honor just yet , about its smartphones in latin america , it is still an exciting time . ",
        "seeing another smartphone maker enter the region is definitely exciting and should bring even tougher competition , which is always a win for consumers . on top of that , consumers will also have another choice , when they go to upgrade their current smartphone . the honor portfolio is able to compete with that of samsung , lg , motorola and the other big names . there should be some smartphone-specific announcements coming out of honor in the very near future .
