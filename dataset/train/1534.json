        "i met this girl at work like a year ago , we never spoke really at all , but i 've always noticed her as she would come in . she 's really cute . a month ago i was on tinder and found her , and we both matched . i mentioned when we first were talking , i said that i never got to talk to her , and `` that cute girls are pretty rare '' at my work , to which she responded `` haha thanks '' and some weird emoji at the end we have been talking basically casually about stuff . ",
        "we 've been kind of just talking about college , and work , and how she hated it at my job . i 've been making a lot of jokes to which she 'll respond with a long `` hahahaha '' she 'll like add on a bit , sometimes she dead ends the convo with it . she lives on campus like a while away from me , and she is coming home soon . i 've i mentioned to her maybe we could get dinner and see a movie , and she responded with `` dinner and movies ? ",
        "damnnn . but yeah that 'd be cool . '' - i responded with `` hahaha yeah i thought it would be nice to get to know each other ; -rrb- '' and she responds with `` yeah `` i have tried a bit of light flirting like winky faces , and making jokes . for example we were talking about an old manager she hated at our work before she quit . and i said `` i heard she was bad but hey look you survived ; -rrb- haha '' to which she kinda rubbed it off and said '' but yes i survived and thats what matters lol `` we 've been talking a lot more frequently , she 'll respond fairly quickly for someone at college , i try to make her laugh as much as i can . ",
        "i 'm naturally funny as i 've been told . basically no flirting of any form . my friend said she might be a bad texter . i really do n't use tinder or online dating apps much , so i 'm really not experienced with it that much . i really ca n't tell if i 'm just like her buddy , or an actual potential date .
