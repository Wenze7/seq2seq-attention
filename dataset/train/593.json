        "we seem to find ourselves increasingly fearing and hating the big four , and scott galloway seems to be one of the more prominent names within this growing trend . i personally think there are some very legitimate reasons to carefully consider the role these ultra-wealthy , incredibly powerful giants play in our society . scott 's post which sparked this response focuses on the weaponization of information , by russia , in an effort to influence the us elections . scott further focuses on the roles and responsibilities of facebook , google and twitter . the whole post is worth a glance , but here i 'm focusing on only one of the points - one which i consider to be fallacious , and which also conveniently allows me to expand on something i consider central to the issue . ",
        "`` 7 . if the new york times can prevent weaponization with $ 100m in free cash flow , why ca n't facebook with $ 16b ? '' this is false equivalence . the tool we are wielding today is a democratized medium allowing free flow of information from anyone , anywhere , to anyone , anywhere , instantly . vetting this flow of information is a vastly different task from anointing a small number of arbiters of truth . important sidenote -- entities like nyt never prevented the weaponization of information -- they just provided better control over whose hands the weapon was in : the us power structures , aimed at the brains of the us populace . ",
        "i do n't want us to regress to the `` nyt '' solution galloway uses for comparison -- i agree that there is a problem , but something new , and more aligned with the nature of the internet is needed . something like wikipedia , but informed by almost 2 decades of experience and powered by vastly upgraded technologies . rather than handing the weapons back , i think we need to create new tools which shield us from weaponized misinformation and new critical-thinking brains which are inoculated against it .
