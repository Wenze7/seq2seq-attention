        "two maidenhead and windsor councillors have quit in protest amid a row over rough sleepers and the royal wedding . the tory-run council was criticised after leader simon dudley suggested homeless people should be cleared from windsor before the marriage of prince harry and meghan markle in may . mr dudley sparked a wave of outrage with his comments , but managed to survive a no-confidence vote held by the council 's conservative group on monday night . following the vote , paul brimacombe and asghar masheed immediately resigned as conservative councillors . they will continue as independents . couple : harry and meghan will marry in windsor in may in a joint statement , the councillors said : `` immediately following the announcement of the result of the no-confidence vote , councillor majeed and councillor brimacombe resigned from the conservative group and departed the meeting . ",
        "`` it was not considered appropriate by them to wholeheartedly disagree with the will of the group on this fundamental issue and yet to remain within the group . `` with the departure of the last of the few dissenting voices within the conservative group , possibly an even more cohesive and purposeful conservative group will emerge . row : he made the comments about homeless people outside windsor castle `` councillors majeed and brimacombe will continue to represent the residents of oldfield and cox green respectively as independent conservative councillors , with the same core values upon which they were elected . ",
        "`` it is expected that the opposition group within the council will attempt to oust the council leader with a no-confidence vote on january 29 . controversy erupted when mr dudley said beggars could present the town in a `` sadly unfavourable light '' when the royal wedding goes ahead in the spring . in a letter to police , he complained about `` aggressive begging and intimidation '' , and `` bags and detritus '' on the streets . a petition to stop rough sleepers being taken off the streets attracted tens of thousands of signatures , while comedian russell brand urged neighbouring slough council to donate an existing building to help the homeless in the windsor area . ",
        "mr dudley later apologised for his comments and said he was not referring to genuine homeless people , and that he regretted referring to harry and ms markle 's wedding at the time .   "
