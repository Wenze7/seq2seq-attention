        "the trump administration accelerated its timetable for moving the u. s. embassy to jerusalem , weighing a plan to retrofit the existing consulate there by the end of 2019 in order to fulfill a key campaign pledge by the president . building a new embassy would have taken too long and is `` cost-prohibitive '' so `` we 're going to retrofit an existing facility , '' steve goldstein , the undersecretary of state for public diplomacy , said in a phone interview . he said president donald trump was briefed on the plan thursday . but after initially describing the plan as final , goldstein later said `` the decision memo has not been signed , and until it is there wo n't be a final determination . '' ",
        "the president announced in december that the u. s. would move its embassy to jerusalem from tel aviv . at the same time , he recognized jerusalem as israel 's capital . that provoked protests from across the middle east and beyond . palestinian leaders said trump 's declaration disqualified washington as a mediator in the long-running peace process . recognizing jerusalem as israel 's capital is provocative because the eastern part of the city -- home to some of the holiest ancient sites in judaism , christianity and islam -- is also claimed by palestinians as the capital of a future state . ",
        "the united nations general assembly voted overwhelmingly to condemn the decision soon after trump made the announcement . campaign promisesthe embassy decision allows trump to carry out a campaign vow made by a generation of presidential candidates but set aside after they took office , worried it would disrupt a fragile peace process . congress passed a law in 1995 recognizing jerusalem as israel 's capital and requiring the president to move the american embassy to the city , but previous u. s. leaders have invoked waivers permitted under the law to avoid starting that process . white house and state department officials had previously warned it would take well beyond trump 's first term to identify a site for the new embassy and construct the building . ",
        "an administration official , who asked not to be identified discussing internal deliberations , said trump 's senior adviser and son-in-law , jared kushner , who has been working on a proposed peace deal , was impatient with the longer timeline . the official said that the idea of enhancing security at the existing facility to make it the embassy was a compromise . ambassador david friedman would then move to jerusalem with his staff . canceling or putting off construction of a costly new embassy might have appeal to trump : last week he tweeted his disapproval of the new $ 1 billion u. s. embassy in london , writing , `` bad deal .
