        "i never expected to make money on medium , but here i am a world-famous writer after a only handful of articles . i was 15 , and it was a little over a fortnight after starting my inaugural job , front-of-house at a bakery , with lovely pleated beige pants and a maroon floral shirt -- but hey , it was me and 19 girls . i 'd just been paid for the first time , and i lived with my parents . it dawned on me : i had disposable income . it was probably a little over $ 300 , but i had no bills . ",
        "i was a baller ! this memory came to me as my eyes flicked over an email i 'd just received from medium entitled `` your payment summary '' . anyway , here 's the email : i was excited because i 'd thought it would n't happen , that there was no way that enough paying members of medium would clap for my articles that i 'd be able to raise more than a few cents , let alone more than the $ 5 a month i pay for medium membership . so that in itself was exciting . ",
        "but also , it was so easy . i was doing what i wanted : writing stuff , for myself really , and it made money . more than that , maybe i 'd made people think , and change something they did ever so slightly . i was butterfly wings . so i crave influence . who does n't ? but more than that , the au$ 7.73 that was the first step toward independence ; it was my side hustle that was really just a formalisation of what i did anyway , the way a job should be . ",
        "i 'd signed up , given my bank details , used the incentive to write and publish more than i 'd bothered to for awhile , and then an international payment had come through . as far as i was concerned , i was basically an international bestseller , from zero expectation . it was my passion was providing a hint that it had the potential to provide a living , nudging me . and let me tell you , if that twinkle of hope can turn into a project that can turn into me writing from the beaches of my tasmanian holiday house whenever inspiration strikes and hanging out with friends and family when it does n't , well , that pocket change could be the catalyst of a life i 've only dared dream . ",
        "and sure , that might not happen . but it might . one word at a time . thanks for reading ! love to hear your thoughts , too , if you care to comment .   "
