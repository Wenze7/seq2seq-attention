",
        "george made big money , but nothing like what his son would go on to do once his dad gave him a loan to invest in wells when he was 21 . the oxford graduate then set up his own oil company and by 1916 , aged 23 , he had made his first million us dollars -- £ 17million in today 's money . getty - contributorcorbis - gettyover the next decade , the money kept piling up -- but the millionaire 's personal life was already turbulent . he had married three times during the 1920s alone , and quickly had a reputation for falling for women far younger than him .

        "and even when the youngest of his five children , timothy , was diagnosed with a brain tumour at six years old , getty kept his eye on his purse . he insisted the pony that teddy had bought to comfort their son came out of her own money , and ticked her off for the cost of the boy 's medical bills . timothy died aged 12 in 1958 , and his parents divorced soon after . hulton archive - gettybut the curse had been ignited . next to suffer was third son john paul getty ii , born in 1932 .

        "ten days later , the kidnappers issued a demand for £ 12.6 million , and john paul getty ii approached his father to help pay . even though the global oil crisis had pushed prices up to the extent that just one day 's profits for the senior getty would have covered the price , the old man refused to pay . according to john pearson , whose book the film is based on , getty had `` heard enough about paul to believe that he was like his father , and he wanted nothing to do with either '' .
