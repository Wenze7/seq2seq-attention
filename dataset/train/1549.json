        "people work their entire careers expecting to receive retirement benefits from social security . once they 've retired , they need every dollar they can get from the program to help make ends meet . what shocks many new retirees is that in some cases , the irs steps in to take away a chunk of their social security by forcing them to include some of their benefits as taxable income . the rules governing taxation of social security benefits suggest that having substantial income above and beyond what the program pays you is a requirement for any of your hard-earned benefits to get taxed . ",
        "yet the fact remains that nearly 20 million taxpayers include taxable social security income on their tax returns , and the amount of total benefits that get taxed make up a sizable fraction of the entire amount the social security administration pays out every year . let 's look more closely at how social security taxation came to be and just how the situation turned into a $ 277 billion issue for americans . alarm clock on wood table behind piles of coins and refrigerator letter magnets spelling tax . image source : getty images . a short history of social security taxationsocial security was n't always taxable , but lawmakers implemented provisions making a portion of benefits subject to tax in the early 1980s as part of a broader reform package of the program . ",
        "in order to raise additional revenue to fund a system that was at that time showing signs of financial strain , congress implemented new rules that set income limits above which a portion of benefits would be taxable . initially , the intent among lawmakers was for the tax to be paid by relatively few retirees . the initial income thresholds were $ 25,000 for single filers and $ 32,000 for joint filers . if the sum of all of taxable income from sources other than social security plus to one-half of your social security benefits was greater than those thresholds , then you might have to include as much as 50 % of your benefits in your taxable income . ",
        "the way in which the calculation gets done is complicated , but in many cases , the actual taxable amount was less than 50 % . the problem is that lawmakers did n't build any inflation adjustments into those threshold figures . as a result , the same thresholds still apply , even as actual income levels have risen dramatically over that span of more than 30 years . in addition , subsequent changes to the law in the early 1990s added a second set of higher thresholds of $ 34,000 for singles and $ 44,000 for joint filers , above which as much as 85 % of benefits could be subject to tax . ",
        "how much do today 's taxpayers have to include in social security benefits ? as a result of those omissions , social security income taxes have hit a rising number of people . more than 28 million taxpayers listed social security benefits on their tax returns in 2015 , the most recent year for which irs data is available . of those , almost 19.7 million , or 70 % , had to include at least a portion of their benefits as taxable income . both figures are up by about 700,000 from the previous year . the amounts involved are truly staggering . ",
        "taxpayers included $ 277 billion as taxable income , which is more than 30 % of the roughly $ 886 billion in total benefits the social security program paid out during 2015 . admittedly , many of the retirees who have to pay tax on benefits are already in relatively low tax brackets , so that $ 277 billion in income generated only about $ 31 billion in actual tax that year , according to figures from the ssa . nevertheless , the average of $ 14,110 in included benefits among those returns that reported a non-zero number is far greater than lawmakers likely anticipated way back in the 1980s . ",
        "how to avoid social security income taxthere are a few strategies you can use to reduce or eliminate tax on social security benefits . the key is managing taxable income when you 're receiving benefits . many who take early benefits while they 're still working fall into the taxation trap , but even after you retire , pension income or 401 distributions can push your taxable income high enough to trigger the tax . if you have access to roth-style retirement accounts , you can tap them without realizing income that would push you over the thresholds for social security tax . ",
        "if not , being smart about timing taxable distributions from retirement savings , taking capital gains and losses on investments , and coordinating with your spouse can be instrumental in reducing your tax . with social security still under financial strain , taxes on social security benefits are n't likely to go away . it 's up to you to do what you can to avoid their impact during your retirement . the motley fool has a disclosure policy .
