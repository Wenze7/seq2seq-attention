        "an iranian official said friday that 52 people had been arrested in the previous day 's protests against high prices that highlighted deep-rooted economic problems in the second city of mashhad . hundreds took to the streets of mashhad , a site of holy pilgrimage in the northeast of the country , on thursday with slogans mostly directed at president hassan rouhani 's government for failing to tackle a range of economic problems . the head of mashhad 's revolutionary court , hossein heidari , said people were arrested for chanting `` harsh slogans '' , the fars news agency reported . ",
        "`` we consider protest to be the people 's right but if some people want to abuse these emotions and ride this wave , we wo n't wait and will confront them , '' heidari said . videos published by a small reformist media group , nazar , showed people in mashhad chanting `` death to rouhani '' . more provocatively , there were also chants of `` death to the dictator '' and `` not gaza , not lebanon , my life for iran '' -- a reference to anger in some circles that the government is focusing on the wider region rather than improving conditions at home . ",
        "similar yet smaller protests reportedly took place in a few other cities , responding to calls on the telegram messaging service for a day of demonstrations to say `` no to high prices '' . egg prices have doubled since last week due to the government 's culling of millions of chickens diagnosed with avian flu , government spokesman mohammad bagher nobakht told reporters on tuesday . but the reasons behind the protests were more deeply rooted , according to one local lawmaker . `` there is a major crisis in mashhad caused by illegal financial institutions , '' hamid garmabi , who represents the city of neyshabour near mashhad , told fars . ",
        "he was referring to the mushrooming of unauthorised lending institutions under former president mahmoud ahmadinejad between 2005 and 2013 . a poorly regulated banking sector combined with a construction boom left many credit companies stuck with toxic debts and unable to repay investors . since coming to power in 2013 , rouhani 's government has sought to clean up the financial sector , shutting down three of the biggest new credit institutions -- mizan , fereshtegan and samen al-hojaj . he has tasked the central bank with reimbursing lost deposits , but progress has reportedly been slow . mashhad was one of the worst-hit areas by the closure of mizan , which had around one million accounts , leading to several protests in the city since 2015 according to the official irna news agency . ",
        "other financial scams have also hit the region , notably the collapse in 2015 of a mega project to a build the new town of padideh next to mashhad , which left more than 100,000 investors out of pocket . `` the shadow of stagnation in mashhad and khorasan razavi province is more than other places in the country due to the unfortunate investment events in companies such as padideh , mizan financial institution and other credit funds , '' a senior housing official in the province told irna last year .
