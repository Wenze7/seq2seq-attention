",
        "police forces and fire brigades were already on site , patrolling flooded streets on small boats . altman told france info radio that water levels were expected to keep rising until friday . `` we should get military trucks to help us evacuate and make people move along , '' she said . west of paris , the seine river burst its banks in some spots and spread to almost twice its usual breadth between the towns of saint-germain-en-laye and le pecq . the area is well downstream from paris . forecasters said wednesday that the seine levels should keep rising until the weekend . ",
        "the river is expected to reach a peak last reached in june 2016 , when authorities were forced to close several parisian monuments including the louvre museum . roads along the shores of the seine remained closed on wednesday as well as seven train stations alongside the river .   "
