        "five drivers who may have been involved in multiple suspected hit-and-runs in which a woman died have been traced , police said . the 29-year-old victim , who was originally from poland but had been living in wandsworth , south london , was hit by a lorry as she used a pedestrian crossing while the traffic lights were green . it is thought she was then struck by another lorry and up to three cars , and officers said none of the drivers stopped at the scene in tulse hill , south london , on monday morning . a 49-year-old man , who was driving the first lorry , was interviewed under caution earlier this week , while a 52-year-old driver of the second car was released under investigation following his arrest on tuesday evening on suspicion of causing death by careless driving . ",
        "the drivers of the first car and second lorry have now also been traced and spoken to , as has the driver of a third car which police believe may also have struck the woman . none of these three people -- for whom the police did not give ages or genders -- have been arrested . cctv released earlier by police showed a white lorry and a black car which are thought to be the second and third vehicles involved in the collision . scotland yard said further analysis of footage established that a third car may also have hit the woman , whose family arrived in london on friday to formally identify her . ",
        "a post-mortem examination revealed her provisional cause of death was multiple injuries . despite tracing the five drivers , officers are continuing to appeal for information from witnesses . acting detective sergeant alastair middleton said : `` even though we have traced all the vehicles that we believe were involved , i continue to appeal for anyone who witnessed the collision and the moments afterwards to contact us immediately . `` we want to hear from anyone who travelled from the south circular junctions of norwood road going towards the junction of brixton hill between the hours of 06:30 hrs and 07:00 hrs on the day of the collision . ",
        "we are particularly interested in any dashcam footage that may have captured some of the incident before or after the collision . `` anyone with information or footage has been asked to call 020 8543 5157 or contact the met through the metcc twitter account . additional reporting by pa .
