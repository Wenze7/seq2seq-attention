        "bangladesh is getting tough with the nation 's bankers as it attempts to avert a looming crisis caused by rising bad loans and weak capital ratios . the central bank on tuesday said it ousted the chief executive officer of farmers bank , a small private-sector lender , accusing him of `` gross irregularities in lending . '' that followed the removal earlier in the month of the ceo of another small lender , nrb commercial bank , accused by bangladesh bank of `` gross irregularities including reckless lending and forgery . '' though the ousters could signal that financial regulators are finally waking up to risks in the banking system , more steps are required , bankers said . ",
        "`` immediate measures need to be taken to ensure that the governance around the banks is strengthened , '' said abrar a anwar , who headed standard chartered plc 's bangladesh operation until november , when he transferred to malaysia . `` otherwise this may create a systemic risk in the sector , which will have a long-term negative impact on the bangladesh economy .

",
        "some 50 of the country 's 57 banks currently meet the basel iii capital adequacy ratios , bmi estimated . however , recent stress tests showed that only 37 of the banks would meet those standards in the event of a 15 percent rise in non-performing loans , bmi noted . `` it 's true that the npl has slightly increased in recent times , and we are taking a hard look at the entire banking sector , '' said subhankar saha , an executive director at bangladesh bank . `` we will take action against any errant bank if and when necessary .

        "the central bank stepped in at farmers bank after a prolonged liquidity crisis threatened to undermine depositor confidence in the entire banking system , according to a report from the finance ministry 's bank and financial institutions division . the bank disbursed loans in excess of the central bank 's single borrower exposure limit and breached the maximum loan-to-deposit ratio of 85 percent , the report showed . on tuesday , the central bank ousted farmers bank ceo and managing director a. k.m. shameem . shameem did n't respond to an email and calls to his mobile phone seeking comment . ",
        "despite the latest moves , the central bank still needs to take additional steps to improve lending standards , some analysts say . `` there is a culture of impunity and lack of accountability for borrowers who default due to the poor legal framework and lengthy insolvency processes , '' said chua han teng , singapore-based head of asia country risk at bmi research . `` as a result , many of these soured loans are caused by habitual defaulters .
