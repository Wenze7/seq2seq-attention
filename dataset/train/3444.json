        "or the story about how i have been able to thrive in as a woman in tech . it all started in june 2012 . i was working at a call center at the time because it was the only job that paid well enough for me to sustain my mother and sister . i was still in college and i had applied to an internship position at microsoft that my father was n't supportive about . i was interviewed four times by four different people for that role , and each time i was asked the same question : `` why do you want to work at microsoft ? '' ",
        "how was i supposed to answer that question ? truthfully , i needed the money but i also dreaded going to that call center every day knowing i had potential that was being wasted , so i said it was my dream . i failed my first interview . i got so nervous that i asked to switch from english to spanish , and i was n't able to answer more than half of the questions , but i still got hired , why ? because i was hungry . i was driven . my initial contract was for 1 year , extendable for up to 6 additional months . ",
        "i took the plunge . i was earning little money but i decided to move closer to the office and live on my own . things were getting pretty rough at home . i made the move with zero support and no guarantee of a full time position at the company . was it scary ? oh yes . it drove me to work as hard as i could , working late night shifts and early mornings , and i did that to demonstrate to others , but mostly to myself , that this was my dream and that i wanted it , bad . ",
        "it got lonely . it got scary , but i did it , and i succeeded . my internship got extended , then i got hired , again . i graduated college . i became independent , and i did it all by myself , and i 'm proud . fast forward five years and i 'm now a digital marketing manager , at 25 . i 'm living the dream that i 've crafted , but i 've had to pay a high price for it . consider that if you want to be successful , it gets lonely at the top .
