        "president nicolas maduro on friday said venezuela in the coming days will issue 100 million units of an oil-backed cryptocurrency known as the petro , which will be worth the price of one barrel in venezuela 's oil basket . speaking at a meeting of his ministers broadcast on state television , maduro said that the petro will be backed by 5 billion barrels in the ayacucho block of the orinoco oil belt . based on the latest price of the country 's oil basket , the total issue would be worth about $ 5.9 billion . `` i have ordered the issuance of 100 million petros with the legal support of venezuela 's oil wealth , '' maduro said . ",
        "he said the cryptocurrency will help the south american country challenge the `` tyranny of the dollar , '' economic war and u. s.-led financial persecution . over the past year , the u. s. treasury department has blacklisted numerous top-ranking officials , including maduro and many of his ministers . years of government mismanagement have left venezuela beset by quadruple-digit inflation , severe shortages of food and medicine as well as four straight years of recession , forcing the government to restructure or refinance its foreign debt . home to the world 's largest crude reserves , venezuelan oil output fell to a 14-year low last july . ",
        "maduro did n't comment on whether venezuela bondholders would be paid with petros . he said yesterday that a commission to restructure or refinance foreign debt is `` working very well . '' at the start , the petro will be obtained through auctions or direct allocation by the country 's cryptocurrency superintendent , maduro said . virtual cryptocurrency exchanges are still in a trial stage , he said . the vice president and economy vice president will meet with the central bank jan. . 8 to relaunch the dicom foreign exchange system , maduro said . the renewed system will include `` new mechanisms '' and will seek to the capture `` growing '' remittances from venezuelans abroad , he said .
