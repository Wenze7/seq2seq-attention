        "manchester united manager jose mourinho has continued his war of words with chelsea counterpart antonio conte by referencing past match-fixing allegations against the italian . conte responded to an apparent jibe from mourinho over his touchline antics by suggesting that the united boss suffers from `` senile dementia '' , although mourinho claims that he was not referring to conte with his comments . however , the portuguese went on to bring up the match-fixing scandal involving conte eight years ago , which saw the italian eventually acquitted over accusations from his time in charge of serie b side siena . ",
        "`` the question that comes to him is completely wrong and because of that he had that out of control reaction . but i do n't blame him at all , '' mourinho told reporters . `` i was asked about my passion and you know i was speaking about myself and then the question to the chelsea manager was that i said he behaved like a clown . `` the only way i want to end the story is yes i made mistakes in the past on the touchline and yes i will make less but i 'll still make a few . ",
        "what has never happened to me and will never happen is to be suspended for match fixing . that never happened to me and it will never happen . `` conte was initially suspended for 10 months for failing to report match-fixing , although the ban was later reduced to four months before conte was cleared of any wrongdoing in may 2016 .
