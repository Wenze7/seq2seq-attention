        "washington -- the united states is developing an expanded training program for local kurdish and arab border guards in syria , the top u. s. commander for the middle east said , to help head off the `` significant risk '' of islamic state fighters regrouping in the country . it 's an effort that could entail a longer term american and allied commitment . army gen. joseph votel , head of u. s. central command , said in a recent telephone interview with the associated press that the border control training would reflect major combat operations in syria ending and the u. s.-led coalition shifting focus to stabilizing areas seized from is . ",
        "washington also wants to root out the remaining insurgents in syria . votel would n't say exactly how many u. s. forces will remain in syria or for how long , but said the american military campaign in syria will remain consistent . he suggested no imminent decrease in the u. s. troop level on the ground in syria , which currently exceeds 2,000 . the border security forces `` will help prevent resurgence of isis and will help bring control , '' votel said , adding that training will take place inside syria . `` we do it right where it 's needed . ",
        "`` the training will include instruction in interrogation , screening , biometric scanning and other skills to help u. s.-backed syrian forces identify insurgents who may be trying to cross into syria from neighboring countries . the u. s. is discussing possible contributions from its coalition partners in europe and the arab world . they may be more willing to contribute troops now that the emphasis is on stabilization and peacekeeping , not fighting . the increased training could prove critical to restoring civil order in areas where is was ousted , and to protecting syria 's troubled and porous frontiers with iraq , turkey , lebanon and jordan . ",
        "pockets of militants are entrenched throughout syria 's border areas , so any campaign to eliminate them will be difficult . the u. s.-led coalition only controls part of the syrian border . it also may raise questions about a shifting u. s. mission in syria . president donald trump has made clear his priority is defeating foreign terrorist organizations , and not more amorphous efforts to build nations or settle internal disputes in foreign lands . propping up a bigger border force could mean a longer u. s. campaign in syria at a time the trump administration has no practical relationship with the nation 's government and still talks about a political transition that might end syrian president bashar assad 's rule . ",
        "assad 's government and its partners -- including russia and iran -- have been separately trying to re-impose security in parts of the country they control . they 've fought is , al-qaida-linked militants and other more moderate rebel groups on the battlefield over the last year or so , but the sustainability of their successes is unclear . votel pointed to russian president vladimir putin 's declaration this month that is was defeated in eastern syria . just days later , is took over six villages in the area . `` you just ca n't go in and have a fight and drop a bunch of bombs and then step away from it and think that the problem is solved , '' said votel . ",
        "`` this is a reminder of just how resilient and capable this organization is , and how we have to really make sure , as we complete these operations , that we 've done it very thoroughly . `` such thinking appears to be coloring u. s. decisions about keeping troops in syria . the military does n't want to `` keep unnecessary capabilities , unnecessary presence on the ground where we do n't need it , '' votel said . but he said changes will only occur when conditions in syria improve and local security forces can secure and retain control over their own towns and cities . ",
        "no one in the trump administration has made a similar declaration of victory in syria . not only do national security and military leaders believe celebrations may be premature , but a claim of victory also would raise legal questions about the american military 's continued presence in syria , without the assad government 's consent . by emphasizing the persistent threat posed by islamic state fighters , the u. s.-led coalition can justify staying in syria to give troops more time to improve local forces , including those opposing assad . they could , in theory , end up serving as a deterrent to any assad campaign to defeat all his internal opponents and advance the u. s. ' preferred outcome : peace talks between syria 's government and `` moderate '' rebels . ",
        "votel said no one in the u. s. government has tried to force such a victory declaration . `` i do n't feel any pressure on this , '' he said .   "
