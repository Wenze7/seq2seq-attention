        "bbc iplayer enjoyed a record week between christmas and new year as viewers turned away from traditional television channels in favour of on-demand and streaming services . viewers streamed more programmes and spent more time on iplayer between monday 25 december and sunday 31 december than any other week . there were 69.2 m requests to watch programmes on iplayer during the week and viewers spent 25.6 m hours on the service . this compares with 58.6 m requests and 22.5 m hours between 25 december and 31 december last year . watching television at christmas is a long-standing tradition but viewing figures on the main channels such as bbc and itv have fallen to a record low in recent years , as increasing numbers of people have turned to on-demand services such as netflix or dvd boxsets instead . ",
        "the bbc adapted to the change in viewing habits for christmas 2017 by making popular programmes from its archive available on iplayer , including peaky blinders , line of duty , planet earth and blue planet . charlotte moore , the bbc director of content , said : `` it 's hugely exciting to see such unprecedented numbers come to bbc iplayer this christmas . the public have responded in their millions to the amazing range of content we 've offered - and for those who are loving our special christmas box-set collection there are still a few days to go . ",
        "`` the extra programmes have been requested 29.4 m times since they were made available - an average of more than 1.5 m a day . the most popular box sets include peaky blinders , which has been requested more than 8m times . the most popular individual show on iplayer during the festive period was the christmas day episode of eastenders , which was requested 1.6 m times . six of the top 10 shows on iplayer were episodes of eastenders , with other popular programmes including the series four finale of peaky blinders and the christmas specials of doctor who and mrs brown 's boys . ",
        "mrs brown 's boys was also one of the most watched shows on bbc1 on christmas day . the top christmas day programme was call the midwife , which attracted 9.6 million viewers , while mrs brown 's boys was watched by 9 million , and strictly come dancing and eastenders were watched by more than 8 million viewers . although the bbc said its christmas performance was `` strong '' , the christmas day viewing figures compare unfavourably with the 16 million who watched wallace and gromit : a matter of loaf and death in 2008 .
