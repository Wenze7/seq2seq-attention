        "for me , making any basketball shot is an achievement . asking me to pull off a shot from the three-point line is laughable . not so for the folks at how ridiculous , who just made a super-super-long-distance bucket from the top of a 660-foot waterfall . behold the world 's highest basketball shot : . the shot was made from the top of maletsunyane falls , located in the country of lesotho . the team had to carry dozens of basketballs up the trails to the top of the falls multiple times a day , only to throw them to the bottom in what must have been hundreds of failed attempts . ",
        "their persistence eventually paid off , as they finally made a single basket after over six days of trying . the how ridiculous guys are no stranger to making world record basketball shots . last year , they accomplished the same feat from the top of a 593-foot dam . that shot was much easier , as it took only three tries and the team had access to cars . maybe if i had six days worth of attempts , i could finally land that three-pointer .
