        "image credit : tinh te photo/flickrcongratulations , proud owner of a new ipad ! you no doubt want to get started swiping , tapping , consuming , and creating whatever your heart desires , especially if you 've got your hands on an apple pencil . but before you jump into the app store and fill your tablet , you 'll want to change a few settings beforehand , if only to keep your cellular data from running dry , your battery from running low , and your privacy from being violated . setting up is easyfirst , ensure your ipad is charged , and that you have any secondary ios or macos devices nearby . ",
        "if your apple id has two-factor authentication enabled , you may need to enter your two-factor code generated by your iphone or macos computer . you 'll be asked to connect to wi-fi , set up touch id , create a passcode , and decide whether you want to restore your ipad from an icloud or itunes backup , start from scratch , or import data from an android device . enter your apple id , enable siri , add your bank card to apple pay , choose whether or not you 'd like to share data with app developers . ",
        "once you pick these settings , your ipad will be ready for use . importing from another ios 11 deviceyou can import your data from another ios 11 device to speed up the setup process . it 'll take a few minutes , and both devices should be charged , so be sure you do n't need either device for anything mission critical . bring the devices close together , ensure bluetooth is enabled , and hit `` continue '' on your current ios device . you 'll be asked to scan the screen with your ipad 's camera . ",
        "then , enter your passcode , enable touch id , and choose your restoration option . you can restore from the latest icloud backup or back up your current device and restore from that . you can also transfer your siri , location , and privacy settings already configured on your current ios device to your new one . i 'm personally a fan of setting up ios devices from scratch -- it gives me more control over which settings i 'd like to keep and which i 'd like to change , especially since my iphone and ipad are used quite differently in my day-to-day life . ",
        "the nitty gritty settingsnow that your ipad is set up and ready to party , you might be tempted to go about downloading apps and drawing sketches of your dog as he wolfs down some breakfast . hold your horses ! there are a few more settings you should go about modifying , both to keep advertisers off your tail as well as make your experience on the ipad as enjoyable as possible . notificationsyou can set notification previews to always show , never show , or only show when the ipad is unlocked . i 'd opt for the `` when unlocked '' option . ",
        "take a trip through your notifications list to disable the ones you know you 'll never use . it 'll spare you from uninteresting banners and useless updates . it 'll also boost your battery life , since every app is n't constantly pinging the web to update you on what 's changed . control centeryou can add extra controls to your control center page , and customize how they appear . for example , if you use your ipad while on the couch , you can add the apple tv remote control to have quick access to your streaming box 's controls -- no dinky apple tv remote required . ",
        "do not disturbthe do not disturb feature silences your ipad when it receives facetime calls or other alerts . you can set it to alert you if someone calls more than once within three minutes , or pick and choose who gets through your do not disturb setting by creating particular groups in your contacts app . modify these general settingsthe general tab in your settings app is where you can modify features like airdrop , background app refreshing , and other aspects of your ipad that you 'll deal with on a daily basis . you can restrict airdrop requests to only your contacts , modify accessibility settings so you can reduce the brightness of your ipad display at night , and add restrictions to your new device if it 's for someone who ca n't be trusted with in-app purchases . ",
        "restrict background apps to save battery life background app refresh is great for services you depend on for updated information . email apps , task managers , news apps , and even podcasting apps are perfect examples of apps that take advantage of background refreshing . of course , pulling data in behind the scenes will cost you , battery-wise . if you do n't need ibooks or maps to keep updating while you 're hanging around at home or playing ftl , turn them off and reclaim a bit of battery life . add a vpn if you sign up for a vpn service with a corresponding app , you can configure your ipad to always connect to it . ",
        "download the vpn app , sign in , connect , and allow the app to add its vpn configuration to your list of available vpn services in settings . display & brightnessyou should enable night shift to reduce the strain on your eyeballs when using your ipad at night . select night shift in the display & brightness tab , toggle on scheduled , and select the `` from/to '' box . you can set the time you 'd like your ipad to adjust to the warmer color spectrum , or choose to adjust based on your location 's sunrise and sunset time . ",
        "siri & searchif you love talking to voice assistants , you can enable `` hey siri '' support to your ipad by enabling `` listen for ` hey siri ' '' and providing a voice print . touch id & passcodeyou 've probably got one fingerprint in your touch id database but you should add a few more . you can add up to five fingerprints , and rename them so you 're aware which finger is which . to keep snoops out of your device , scroll down to the bottom of the touch id & passcode page and enable erase data , which will wipe your ipad after 10 failed passcode attempts . ",
        "privacybesides disabling location services for apps like the app store , you can restrict location data from individual system services . if your ipad is n't doing much traveling , or lacks cellular data support , you should disable the cell network search and compass calibration options , as well as the list of product improvement options that use your location data . you can also restrict the number of targeted ads sent by advertisers by selecting limit ad tracking in the advertising tab . 1 / 2itunes & app storeby default , your ipad will automatically download updates , but you can configure it to download music , books , and apps installed on other ios devices by toggling the automatic downloads option for each .

        "mail , calendar , notes , and remindersyou may have signed in with your apple id , but you probably have an extra account or two you 're using instead of icloud for things like managing your email or calendar . after you add your extra accounts to your list of online identities , you should go through these apps and select the default location for new reminders , notes , calendar appointments , or sent mail . soundsplease turn off your keyboard clicks and lock noises . no one wants to hear them .
