        "playerunknown 's battlegrounds is listed as the best game of 2017 , and it is n't even fully completed yet but is expected to enter phase `` 1.0 '' on dec. . 20 . the game just got released for xbox one but is not available on the playstation 4 . if your a playstation lover , then you will have to stick to playing the game on the computer . as of right now , there does not appear to be any plans to release it on the playstation 4 , making it xbox console exclusive . pubg is like any other unfinished game on the xbox though , so be warned about that . ",
        "when you load the game you will receive a prompt and your warning that the game is unfinished . there is also a warning that the game may not even be released as a `` full product . '' though they tell you this , it is very unlikely that they wo n't release the game as a full release , so you could probably expect it to get released fully . do n't take our word for it though , as that is the only speculation . everyone should be aware of what they are getting when purchasing the game on xbox . ",
        "the game is not finished and will more than likely feel incomplete . as such , there may even be some problems with the game . the game is rough around the edges , and there could be many changes to fix the `` roughness '' of the game as the progression goes .   "
