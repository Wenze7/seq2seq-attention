        "there are two ways a stock 's dividend yield can rise . the company can raise its dividend , or the stock can tumble . international business machines , general motors , and target have been punished this year , but the market 's pessimism seems to have gotten out of hand in each case . all three of these hated stocks offer exceptional dividend yields , along with substantial dividend safety . if you 're a dividend investor looking for yield and value in an expensive market , look no further . international business machinesshares of ibm are down about 8 % year to date and 16 % since peaking earlier this year , vastly underperforming the broader market . ",
        "despite signs that ibm 's multi-year transformation is on the cusp of producing revenue growth after a half-decade of declines , the market is still valuing the company at pessimistic levels . this is great news for dividend investors looking to lock in a high yield at a discounted valuation . ibm 's $ 1.50 per share quarterly dividend is good for a yield of about 3.9 % , and that dividend only eats up 43.5 % of the company 's guidance for full-year adjusted earnings . even absent much earnings growth , ibm would have no problem keeping its 22-year streak of dividend increases going . ",
        "ibm trades for just 11 times adjusted earnings guidance and 12.75 times gaap earnings guidance , while the s&p 500 goes for around 25 times trailing-12-month earnings . revenue is expected to grow during the fourth quarter , driven by a newly released mainframe system and the continued growth of ibm 's cloud business . the mainframe will continue to be a tailwind in 2018 , and the rollout of ai-focused power9 systems should help the cause . ibm deserves more credit than the market is willing to give it . for dividend investors looking for yield and value , now 's the time to buy . ",
        "general motorsgm has shown this year that it 's a lot more than a legacy automaker unable to keep up with the times . the company announced in october that it will launch 20 new all-electric vehicles by 2023 , with two due in the next 18 months . gm 's chevrolet bolt , its first all-electric car , outsold all three tesla models in the u. s. last month , moving nearly 3,000 units . and the company announced just a few weeks ago that it planned to commercially launch fleets of self-driving cars in dense urban environments in 2019 . ",
        "as gm is doing all of this , its core business is still producing solid profits . the company expects to generate adjusted earnings of roughly $ 6.25 per share this year , putting the price-to-earnings ratio at about 6.5 . to be fair , earnings will almost certainly decline going forward if demand in north america weakens . but with such a low valuation , investors are getting a sizable margin of safety . gm stock yields about 3.7 % . because the dividend represents just 25 % of the company 's adjusted earnings guidance , it 's safe under a wide variety of scenarios . ",
        "unless there 's another financial crisis-level event , gm should be able to maintain its dividend without any trouble . gm stock has surged this year , up about 18 % year to date , but it 's tumbled 11 % from its recent high . the market is assuming the worst , valuing it at a rock-bottom valuation . dividend investors looking for a safe , high-yield dividend stock should seriously consider gm . targetretailer target is n't messing around anymore . the company announced this month that it would acquire shipt , an online grocery delivery service , for $ 550 million . ",
        "target will use the acquisition to provide customers with same-day delivery at half of its stores by early next year , and at most stores in all major markets by the 2018 holiday season . amazon . com 's relentless focus on providing convenience for its customers is forcing the hand of all traditional retailers . this is the biggest move target has made so far , and it probably wo n't be the last . as target invests in e-commerce , performance at its store has improved . comparable sales jumped 0.9 % in the third quarter , with comparable traffic rising 1.4 % . ",
        "the company 's bet on exclusive brands appears to be paying off . target stock is down about 13 % this year , pushing the dividend yield up to 3.9 % . it wo n't be smooth sailing for target over the next few years , as pressure from amazon continues to transform the industry . but with a 50-year record of raising its dividend , there 's a lot to like about this traditional retailer .
