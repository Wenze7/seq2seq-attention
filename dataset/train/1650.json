        "as the dumpster fire that is 2017 comes to a close , it 's time to look back at everything that went down over the last 12 months . that includes examining those pieces of legislation that may have made life better or worse for parents in the united states . to start , let 's take a look at the five best laws that passed in 2017 that affected mothers . on the federal level , president donald trump has yet to sign into law a bill that protect the parental rights . quite the contrary , as detailed by newsweek , trump and the republican-controlled legislature have supported policies dismantling access to preventive and prenatal care , relaxing gun control to the detriment of abuse survivors , and cutting taxes that favor the wealthy . ",
        "but where the trump administration failed to protect mothers and their families , states have swooped in to fill in the gap . from protecting birth control to strengthening gun control , states from massachusetts to rhode island have shown mothers this year what it means to care about the families that live within your borders . and if these laws are any indication , families across the country could look forward to more states taking a stand against the trump administration in 2018 . massachusetts ' free birth control lawthere are many reasons why someone would use birth control . ",
        "you may want to prevent pregnancy or clear up acne . or you may want to treat symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome . whatever the case , birth control is necessary preventive medicine for millions of people in the united states , including mothers . under the affordable care act , everyone with insurance has access to contraception as preventive care at no cost . in october , after republicans failed to dismantle the aca , the u. s. department of health and human services rolled back the aca 's birth control mandate , according to mashable . residents of massachusetts , though , have nothing to worry about . ",
        "last month , gov. charlie baker signed into law a bill that guarantees access to birth control without a copay , according to masslive . that means moms of the new england state can continue to plan their family as they see fit . california 's child care subsidy lawif you 're a parent , you 're unlikely to be able to afford child care in the united states . the costs are so astronomical that most families spend nearly one-quarter of their income on child care . other parents are forced to quit their jobs because they ca n't afford the expense in the first place . ",
        "that 's why state-subsidized child care programs are so vital to working families . but lawmakers continue to chip away at the benefit : the center for law and social policy reported that spending on child care assistance dropped to a 12-year low of $ 11.3 billion . and , the number of children who received child care subsidies reached a 16-year low in 2014 , according to the pew charitable trusts . california decided to take the opposite approach : assembly bill 273 , a new law signed by gov. jerry brown in october , will expand eligibility requirements for subsidized child care to low-income parents pursing a ged or taking esl class , according to the los angeles daily news . ",
        "that means immigrant mothers or teen parents will be able to focus on their studies without the financial stress . the law goes into effect in january . nebraska 's legislative bill 427teen parents face a number of challenges , including barriers to pursuing an education . only 40 percent of teenage moms graduate from high school , while 35 percent of community college students who have kids during their studies complete their degree , according to the national conference of state legislatures . many of the challenges pregnant and parent students face stem from a lack of supportive policies . ",
        "although title ix protects students from sex discrimination -- including on the basis of pregnancy and parental status -- that does n't mean schools actively ensure the rights of teen moms and dads . that 's why nebraskan lawmakers recently passed legislative bill 427 in a 31-7 vote , according to the omaha world-herald . the law requires schools to outline how they plan to address the challenges pregnant and parenting teens face , including breastfeeding policies and child care access . of course , a written policy does not guarantee a school will follow through . but the nebraska legislature has , at least , forced school administrators to reckon with the way they treat teen parents , which will hopefully lead to better practices that support learning and parenthood . ",
        "rhode island 's protect ri families act each year , at least 2,000 people are killed because of domestic violence , according to the u. s. bureau of justice statistics . the u. s. centers for disease control and prevention estimates that 70 percent of those victims are women , including mothers . and weapon used in more than half of intimate partner homicides ? a gun , according to the trace . since there is a strong connection between deadly domestic violence and firearms , some states are passing laws restricting an abuser 's access to guns . rhode island added its name to the list this year when state lawmakers passed the protect ri families act in october , according to ri future . ",
        "the legislation will ban anyone convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes from owning a firearm . the law also includes a provision that requires offenders to surrender physical possession of all firearms if their victim has filed a protective order against them . three other states passed similar laws this year , according to moms demand action for gun sense in america : north dakota , utah , nevada . despite studies showing that the rate of domestic violence homicide drops with stricter firearm laws , conservative lawmakers continue to rally against gun control . but state laws that buck the gop line of thinking , like the one in rhode island , show mothers that their lives are being put first . ",
        "massachusetts ' workplace accommodations for pregnant workers lawfederal law protects pregnant and parenting workers from being denied employment , fired , retaliated against , or refused accommodations -- rights affirmed by the u. s. equal employment opportunity commission in a 2014 guidance for employers . yet , despite these protections , pregnancy discrimination persists . the eeoc and state labor practice agencies received nearly 31,000 pregnancy discrimination complaints between fiscal years 2011 and 2015 , according to the national partnership for women & families . the advocacy group also reported that , in 2014 , employers denied accommodation requests from more than one-quarter million pregnant workers . ",
        "to address this pervasive discrimination , the massachusetts legislature passed a bipartisan bill in july that guarantee pregnant employees reasonable on-the-job accommodations when needed . with this law , which goes into effect april 1 , massachusetts joins 21 other states , plus the district of columbia , that have reinforced pregnant workers ' rights . bonus : paid sick days lawsresearch from the center for law and social policy has shown that offering paid sick days keeps workers in their jobs and businesses earning a profit . yet , employers and lawmakers continue to push back against the paid sick leave , despite it making good economic sense . ",
        "nevertheless , states and cities have taken it upon themselves to legislate the benefit : this year , rhode island , vermont , and washington state have all passed laws requiring all companies to offer workers paid sick days , according to the national partnership for women & families . as republican lawmakers continue to push laws that hurt parents and restrict reproductive rights , the more state lawmakers will have to fight back to protect families in their state . let 's hope they can follow through next year . check out romper 's new video series , romper 's doula diaries : watch full episodes of romper 's doula diaries on facebook watch .
