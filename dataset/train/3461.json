        "the star wars galaxy differs from our own in some pretty significant ways -- they have porgs and we do n't , we have marvel movies and they do n't -- but apparently some truths are just universal . like the fact that poe dameron is a total dreamboat . that 's confirmed in star wars propaganda : a history of persuasive art in the galaxy , which explores propaganda from both sides of the war throughout all seven movies . although the book was published back in 2016 , one particular passage has been making its way all over the internet today : . ",
        "according to the book , resistance pilots liked to joke that `` if black leader poe dameron posed for a poster , their numbers would skyrocket . '' one particular resistance pilot , yolo ziff , went as far as designing this poster as a prank . despite its not-at-all serious intentions , the poster somehow got out to the rest of the galaxy ... and `` prompted actual interest from would-be resistance pilots , '' notes the book . in other words , it 's officially star wars canon that poe dameron is so ridiculously good-looking , he actually attracted people to the resistance . ",
