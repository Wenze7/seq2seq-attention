        "the piece : `` i looked over jordan and what did i see ; a band of angels coming after me `` the artist : nathaniel donnettwhere : art league houston , through jan. . 20why : the most evocative piece of nathaniel donnett 's show `` in one form or another ; verse one , '' suggests the facade of a ramshackle frame house that is emitting a violet-blue glow from inside , an effect that seems both elegaic and ominous . two windows are cut into the siding . one is half boarded up . from a distance , an object suspended in the other window appears to be a man 's necktie . ",
        "surprise : the hanging thing is an old , slim machete , the kind of tool a slave might have used to cut sugarcane in the 19th century . this potent visual language seems to say so much , so efficiently , about what it means to be a black male in america , at least from donnett 's perspective . does he think about the weight of the past every time he puts on a tie to go out ? and is a tie , in its own way , a kind of noose ? in the center of the gallery , leading toward the facade sculpture like a sidewalk , the artist has placed a line of t-shirts he printed several years ago with the message `` am i the only black person here . '' ",
        "it 's a statement , not a question . donnett fills out the show with several large and intricate collaged portraits , projected videos and signage . donnett , who showcases contemporary culture by people of color through his webzine-blog not that but this , also has produced an eight-page tabloid newspaper for the show , with unevenly written content about art , culture and politics . drumming sounds pervade the space , which looks deceptively spare . he explained that the show 's various layers investigate moments of protest in the history of black society , art and music - `` the spirit and energy that happens in these moments that come from slavery , up to current times . ",
        "`` all worth investigating , but the wordless , glowing wall is the piece that haunts .   "
