        "india tuesday accused pakistan of harassing the family members of convicted indian spy shri kulbhushan jadhav when they were permitted to visit him a day earlier . pakistani authorities allowed jadhav 's wife and mother to visit him monday , reiterating the step was taken `` purely on humanitarian grounds . `` india 's ministry of external affairs said that the meeting was held in an `` atmosphere of coercion . '' `` it appears that shri jadhav was under considerable stress and speaking in an atmosphere of coercion , '' the ministry said in a statement . `` most of his remarks were clearly tutored and designed to perpetuate the false narrative of his alleged activities in pakistan . ",
        "his appearance also raises questions of his health and well being . `` new delhi also said jadhav 's mother was prevented from speaking to her son in their native tongue and that the family was harassed by the media , despite a `` clear agreement '' that press would not be allowed near the family . pakistani officials released a pre-recorded video message of jadhav in which he thanked authorities for treating him well and for arranging the meeting . convicted indian spy kulbhushan jadhav met his wife and mother in islamabad , pakistan , dec. . 25 , 2017 . ",
        "this was jadhav 's first meeting with his family since he was arrested in march 2016 for entering pakistan from neighboring iran with fake travel documents . a military court later tried and sentenced him to death in april of this year , ruling `` the serving indian navy officer '' was found guilty of espionage and running a deadly terrorist network in pakistan . india says jadhav is a former naval officer but rejects the charges against him as baseless , saying he has no connection with the government . pakistani officials maintain that jadhav has confessed before the country 's military court that he was tasked by the indian intelligence agency to `` plan , coordinate and organize espionage , terrorist and sabotage activities '' against pakistan .
