        "deathstroke is off-limits to the arrowverse again , thanks to the dceuwhomp whomp . the revolution will not be televised . it 'll be sent to your inbox by us . warner bros. , which is behind the big screen dc comics adaptations , has delivered the biggest nerf yet to the cw 's arrowverse by taking away one of its best characters : deathstroke . now that joe manganiello has officially appeared as the deadly assassin slade wilson in the post-credits scene of justice league , that apparently bars his arrowverse counterpart on the cw from seeing any action . ",
        "so despite manu bennett 's version of the character having a prominent role in season 6 of arrow , it 'll soon be time to say goodbye . in an interview during ace comic con published by heroic hollywood , arrow executive producer marc guggenheim revealed the murky process that determines which characters they get to play with over in the arrowverse : `` these are dc 's characters , we 're just renting them ya know , so we use the characters that they tell us we can use when we can use them , and we work around whatever limitations that places us . '' ",
        "those limitations unfortunately include not allowing us to see cool team-ups like this : `` for a time they were saying ` you ca n't use deathstroke , ' '' guggenheim explained , `` and that changed and we were able to have slade wilson back on the show , and now we 're back to ` you ca n't use him . ' '' now that there are plans in motion for the film version of slade wilson to appear in the dceu , it appears that him being on arrow is off the table -- for now . ",
        "guggenheim did mention , `` there 's these intervals , and we try and take advantage of our opportunities when we have them , '' which means we might see manu bennet pick up the orange and black mask again should there be a wide enough gap in dc 's cinematic universe . it 's tough to when or in what capacity manganiello 's take on the character will return to the big screen , but based on the scene he appears in with lex luthor , chances are there 's some sort of an injustice league villainous team-up bound to happen . ",
        "since the exact future of the dceu is somewhat in flux at the moment , though , it 's unclear when that will be . you 've read that , now watch this : '' `` crisis on earth-x '' team-up against metallo - arrowverse crossover clip ''   "
