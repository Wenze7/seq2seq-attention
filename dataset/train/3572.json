        "procter & gamble reported lower quarterly earnings tuesday due in part to costs from us tax reform , and said it was amplifying efforts to counter teen abuse of its tide detergent . the consumer goods conglomerate said net income in the second quarter ending december 31 dropped 68 percent to $ 2.5 billion , but that was in part because it faced comparison against the year-ago period which boasted a large-one time gain from a divestiture . revenues rose three percent to $ 17.4 billion in the latest quarter . p&g suffered another weak quarter in grooming , due to continued weakness in shaving products after the gillette brand cut prices to compete with other companies . ",
        "although volumes rose , the value of sales in this category fell one percent from the prior year . there was broad-based strength in p&g 's beauty category , with pantene and head & shoulders among the brands that sold well , along with premium skin-care offerings under ski-ii . fabric care , which includes tide , was another strong category , although sales trends have lately been upstaged by a disturbing trend of teens daring each other to eat or chew on single-load packets of the laundry soap and posting videos that have gone viral and led to a surge in poison center visits . ",
        "- dangerous teen fad - p&g is working with social media companies to remove the videos showing these activities , and has joined with other organizations to spread the word about the dangers of the trend , said chief financial officer jon moeller . `` our standards and protocols for safety are stringent , our labels and warnings are clear , but they ca n't prevent intentional abuse fueled by poor judgment and the desire for popularity among peers , '' moeller said on a conference call with reporters . `` we 're going to have to work with the broader part of society to address that . ",
        "`` there were 86 `` intentional exposures '' by teens of the tide product through the first three weeks of 2017 at us poison centers , the american association of poison control centers said monday . `` we can not stress enough how dangerous this is to the health of individuals -- it can lead to seizure , pulmonary edema , respiratory arrest , coma , and even death , '' said stephen kaminski , executive director of the association . tide recently posted a video on twitter with super bowl-bound new england patriots player rob gronkowski stressing that the pods are to be used only for washing clothes . ",
        "`` no , no , no , no , no , no , no , '' the finger-wagging american football player said . `` what the heck is going on people ? use tide pods for washing , not eating . `` p&g also said the just-completed quarter was boosted by a net $ 135 million due to the lower us tax rate as a result of the recently-passed tax reform . but other provisions on deferred taxes and tax repatriation forced a negative charge of $ 628 million during the quarter . despite the hit in the just-completed quarter , moeller characterized the tax cut as `` a very positive change '' that would benefit p&g long-term . ",
        "the earnings are the first since p&g appointed activist investor nelson peltz to the board after a long and bruising proxy battle . moeller said peltz , who joins the board on march 1 , had yet to be assigned specific board committees . p&g shares fell 1.4 percent to $ 90.60 in pre-market trading .
