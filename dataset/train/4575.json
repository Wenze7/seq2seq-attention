        "if you ask me , there was only one good thing to come out of social media in 2017 and it came with three weeks to spare . it was n't the tide pod craze , it was n't chrissy teigen and john legend 's strange flight , and it was n't the drama involving the royal wedding 's guest list either -- it was willard carroll `` will '' smith jr. . and his brand new , fresh out the box instagram account . it 's perfect in every way , and if 2018 keeps going the way it is , it might just be the best thing about this year too . ",
        "the beloved smith has always discussed why he 's grateful he did n't come up in the time of timelines and avatars . `` fortunately , most of my career , i was shielded from that level of scrutiny . there actually was privacy . there was actually the ability to create mystery , '' he told the hollywood reporter in 2015 . that level of mystery dissipates when you 've reached the god-like status of the smith and his family , and either transforms into a well-oiled , pr-fueled life or nothing at all , a l√† leonardo dicaprio or brad pitt . ",
        "but sometimes , famous faces bless us all with very good celebrity instagram accounts . thank goodness smith falls into the second category . there are a few key things that make a celebrity instagram account good : self-deprecation , behind-the-scenes access , and quality throwbacks -- and the fresh prince passes all of these tests with flying colors . exhibit a : the ugly holiday sweaters , worn with pride and disbelief at the audacity of jada for making the family be festive . then there 's the reading glasses . your beloved favorite actor is getting old , folks , but he is n't afraid to show it off . ",
        "weak eyes but make it fashion . in the brief time he 's been at this , he 's managed to let us in on some wholesome family fun . still ca n't believe we ever lived without knowing the lengths the smith family goes to manifest the holiday spirit . his behind-the-scenes work is what debuted on the ` gram first , thanks to ellen degeneres , who filled the void in our heart by instigating the birth of his account . the only thing better than pre-cut interview previews that tease us is pictures with the queen of celebrity selfies . ",
        "all of this is fun and games , but there 's something that smith does that even the greatest of them , like the rock , ca n't do . as a man who has been in the spotlight for so long , smith has racked up a thrilling rolodex of friends and lucky for us , he is n't shy about shouting them out for their birthdays or just because . so far we 've got some quality throwbacks of jaime foxx and denzel washington . that 's two heavyweights in less than a month . who knows what other ageless face we 'll witness next . ",
        "is n't this thrilling ? ! despite the seemingly authentic nature of it all , smith 's pr people would probably be mad if a couple plugs were n't thrown in the feed , even if bright is n't that great of a film . the best of them , however , do it with grace and humor instead of pumping out well airbrushed film stills and clips from talk shows to their followers who are bound to see those things elsewhere , regardless . but really , it 's not just me who feels this way . everyone is in love with will smith 's instagram account . ",
        "3 weeks in and will smith has the best instagram already . -- robin january 3 , 2018 . all that to say , thank you ellen . thank you @kevin . and thank you , will , for letting us into your life one double-tap-heart at a time .   "
