        "new york -- the dow jones industrial average burst through the 25,000 point mark thursday , just five weeks after its first close above 24,000 . the dow passed five 1,000-point barriers in 2017 on its way to a 25 percent gain for the year , as an eight-year rally since the great recession continued to confound skeptics . strong global economic growth and good prospects for higher company earnings have analysts predicting more gains , although the market may not stay as calm as it has been recently . the dow has made a rapid trip from 24,000 points on november 30 , partly on enthusiasm over passage of the republican-backed tax package , which could boost company profits this year with across-the-board cuts to corporate taxes . ",
        "`` for a long while in 2017 i would say the biggest driver was excitement and anticipation over tax reform , but at a certain point i think there was a handover to global economic growth really helping to carry the stock market , '' said invesco chief global markets strategist kristina hooper . big gains in u. s. blue chip companies have powered the dow 's relentless rise to new heights over the past year , including an 87 percent gain in aerospace giant boeing , a 70 percent rise in construction equipment maker caterpillar and a 49 percent increase in apple . ",
        "the dow , which was founded in 1896 and is the oldest barometer of the u. s. stock market , has nearly quadrupled in value from its low during the financial crisis in early 2009 . but the global economy and spending by people and businesses and governments were much slower to recover than stocks were . `` instead of fiscal stimulus , we relied on monetary policy stimulus , which inflates asset prices as opposed to the overall economy , '' hooper said . stocks have continued to climb as investors saw signs economic growth was finally improving . ",
        "technology companies , which put up some of the biggest gains in the last year , continued to lead the market higher . and there was more good economic news thursday : a report showed private u. s. businesses added 250,000 jobs last month , with smaller businesses adding 94,000 . the dow , which tracks 30 big u. s. companies , rose 152.45 points , or 0.6 percent , to 25,075.13 . the standard & poor 's 500 , a much broader index that professional investors prefer to use as their benchmark for large u. s. stocks , rose 10.93 points , or 0.4 percent , to 2,723.99 . ",
        "the nasdaq composite , which is heavily weighted with technology and biotech companies , added 12.38 points , or 0.2 percent , to 7,077.91 . all three indexes set record highs a day earlier . the nasdaq reached a milestone of its own this week , closing above 7,000 points for the first time tuesday . indexes in some developing countries have done even better than those in europe and the u. s over the past year . brazil 's benchmark bovespa is up 28 percent over the past year and the hang seng index in hong kong is up 39 percent . ",
        "bond prices fell , sending yields higher . the yield on the 10-year treasury note rose to 2.45 percent from 2.44 percent . higher bond yields are good news for banks because they can charge higher interest rates on mortgages and other kinds of loans . president donald trump said thursday that the dow could reach 30,000 , which would take another 20-percent jump . few on wall street expect stocks to climb that much any time soon . stocks already did far better than most observers expected last year , and corporate earnings are n't rising fast enough to justify that kind of climb .
