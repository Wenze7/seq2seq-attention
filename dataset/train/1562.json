        "the college football season ended on monday with alabama 's national championship win over sec-rival georgia . that win gave the crimson tide their fifth title in the past nine years , and it also added to the conference 's ridiculous number of nine wins over the past 12 . and if you thought the talk of sec dominance would be quieted until the season kicks off again in august , you 'd be wrong . the nfl playoffs are now hitting their stride , and the best conference in college football is well represented in the pros . in fact , lsu and florida each have 11 former players on rosters of the teams still standing , tied for most of any university in the country . ",
        "the crazier stat may be who 's been eliminated thus far . entering wild card weekend , lsu 's representation was overwhelming . with the players from the chiefs , rams , bills , and panthers added in , lsu had a whopping 20 former athletes on active rosters . so what 's the takeaway here ? the sec has dominated the ncaa and the nfl . raise your hand if you 're excited about that . put your hand down , liar .
