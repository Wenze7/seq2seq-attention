        "this is a topic has been on my mind for a while , and i 'm mad i have n't acted on it sooner . everyone should act like a media company does nowadays . the internet , social media and our phones has made it easier than ever to produce content and distribute it to customers . back in the day , you would have to spend a crazy amount of money to create a campaign to promote your brand . now , you can use your phone and few apps and run ads for a couple of bucks . ",
        "it 's really just getting started . to me , it 's all about participation . if you focus on content , and attempt to build brand , you 'll be on the right path . there 's no excuse not to create content around your brand , product , service or business . out can be starting a blog , vlogging on youtube , creating a podcast , it does n't matter what it is . the thing is just getting started . creating new content may be time consuming . if that 's the cast , document . ",
        "show your process , interview your employees , show a few shots of your office or studio . give your opinion on your industry . you can even start by sharing other people 's post that relate to your brand . if you think like a media company , you 'll start prioritizing your brand . brand is everything if you are trying to create a business of value . we grew up in a world where every business has been selling to us constantly . the reason for that is because they only had one right hook . it costs a lot to produce a commercial , to put up a billboard and make a radio ad . ",
        "but now , you can produce much more content for far less money . this has created an entirely new way of marketing . instead of selling to people , now you can create entertaining content as the gateway to the long term sale . this is the difference between building a brand and being in sales . the content you produce does n't even have to relate to your product . you can things you 're interested in , the news , sports , the weather and even yourself . as long as you are focused on bringing substance to your followers , you are going to build a reputation and a relationship . ",
        "for example , a restaurant talking about the miami heat in a facebook post is n't going to make their customers think that they sell basketball jerseys . but what it can do is attract a miami heat can who wants to go to a restaurant they think supports their team . it can also get them a gig with the miami heat themselves . it also a piece of content that humanizes your brand and build relationships . so not do n't be afraid to talk about things that do n't relate to your brand from time to time . ",
        "people often underestimate distribution . content is not always enough . anybody can create something interesting , but if no one ever sees it , it becomes what 's the point ? there are two ways that you can get your content in front of people . one is backing into the culture and the other is buying ads on social media . the latter is the easier route to take . save up $ 100 and buy ads on your social content and you will gain reach . there 's no guarantee that people will follow you or buy your product , but it 's guaranteed that someone will see it . ",
        "with ads , you can target a specific audience by age , geography , likes , and more . facebook targeting is where it 's at . you can list your business address , set a radius , and everybody in that radius will see it in their feed . the other way is much more difficult , hacking into culture . what i mean by that is , you should be dissecting the the people in that culture and understanding what is relevant in it . this is something that can create a tremendous opportunity . if you do n't start thinking like a media company and prioritizing your brand and creating content , you 're going to be left behind . ",
        "this is the way things are now . content is what 's going to create opportunities for you .   "
