        "i 'm attempting a non-lethal playthrough of fallout 4 with the knockout framework mod , which lets me punch npcs unconscious and carry them around in a sack on my back . part 1 | part 2 | part 3 after getting punched by a bandit wearing power armor in part 3 of my diary , i 've decided i want my own set of armor , and so i 'm headed to concord where the settlement-obsessed preston garvey awaits . as i approach the museum of freedom , i bonk a few raiders unconscious with my cane , and after heading inside i bonk several more . ",
        "i 'm actually starting to feel pretty confident with my non-lethal head-bashing . my biggest problem is that having put my focus on strength to be a decent melee fighter , i ca n't sneak worth a damn . surprise attacks are impossible -- raiders always hear me coming and turn around -- and i tend to get shot a lot . still , all the raiders i 've encountered have been pretty easy to knock out , taking three hits at the most . what 's a bit harder is convincing preston garvey to open the door to his crummy little office for me . ",
        "he insists that he 'll only let me in once i 've dealt with the raiders , and despite all the raiders lying concussed on the floor of the museum , the game does n't consider them officially dealt with since they 're still breathing . which sort of sucks . preston could easily just shoot their unconscious bodies dead himself , if only he 'd open the door . but he wo n't . well , i 've still got a big sack in my bag of tricks . i decide to try carrying a raider outside the building , and as i dump the first one in the street , i notice the quest log updates . ",
        "now it tells me i only have six raiders to `` kill '' instead of seven . i guess if they 're out of the building , that counts as a kill to dear preston . out of sight , out of mind . i sigh , then get to work . it 's a pain , gathering up all the raiders , one by one , putting them in my sack , carrying them back downstairs , leaving the building , and dumping them in the street . but i repeat it until they 're all slumbering unconscious on the pavement . ",
        "except for the one who suddenly wakes up and punches me as i go back inside . but the point is , as you can see above , the quest decides i have killed all seven raiders , and i have n't actually killed any of them . i head upstairs for the eighth time , chat with preston and his pals , and then reach the roof to acquire my very own power armor . i leave the minigun where it is and leap into the street , landing directly on two of the unconscious raiders , instantly killing them . ",
        "whoops ! i have to reload and do it again -- no killing allowed , even by accident . i jump more carefully this time , land safely , and run down the street brandishing only my armored fists . i punch my way through a few more raiders until it 's time for the main event : the deathclaw . it , uh , does n't go so well . the deathclaw punches me a lot harder than i punch it . also , it 's got the slick move of picking me up and body-slamming me into the pavement . ",
        "thankfully , i 've got a few stimpacks and a backpack full of food , and i manage a quick retreat to heal before i start wading in again . i 've got something else , too . with all the raiders going down so easily underneath my mighty cane , i 've banked a full-ass critical meter . i dash over to the deathclaw , target it in vats , and unleash a might critical wallop . the deathclaw goes down . it folds like a house of cards . i drop it like a bad habit . i have punched a deathclaw unconscious . ",
        "i 'm also excited to see that the enormous sleeping deathclaw does indeed fit into my body sack . hooray ! i 'm so thrilled i even jump up and down in the street , even though there 's still a raider on a nearby roof taking shots at me . let him shoot , i 'll punch him to sleep after i 've celebrated a bit . preston , unfortunately , is n't impressed with my unconscious deathclaw : the quest does n't update to say i 've completed it . in the meantime , though , i 've got the power armor i was after and my own personal unconscious deathclaw that i suddenly realize i do n't know what to do with . ",
        "i even take it out of the sack back at sanctuary hills to have a look at it . yup , thats a big unconscious deathclaw i 'm not allowed to kill ! well , maybe it 'll come in handy somehow . i 'll just carry it around with me until i figure out what to do with it . next week : i figure out what to do with it .
