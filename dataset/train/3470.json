        "keep your phone across the room from where you 're sitting . turn off all notifications . choose an end point for every web surfing session . do n't check your phone while in line . do n't check your phone for first and last 30 minutes of each day . turn phone off immediately after posting something on social media . 2 . design your day using anti-goalsinvert your goals . instead of thinking about what your perfect day would look like , make a list of things that would be on the schedule of your worst possible day . ",
        "then , work backwards and create a set of rules to help you avoid your worst day . if your worst day would feature a packed calendar , then create a rule that you can have no more than two hours of scheduled time per day . if your worst day would feature long meetings , then make it a rule to never in-person meetings for things that can be accomplished via phone or email . 3 . how to get better at one thing in one monthfollow these eight steps : choose one thing . multitasking does n't accelerate improvement , it impedes it .

        "clarify your motivation . the better you understand your why , the more likely you are to succeed . define `` better . '' you ca n't achieve what you ca n't define . do your thing at least three time a week . improvement comes from action , not intention . measure your results . develop a hypothesis about how you can improve . test your hypothesis . there 's as much to learn from being wrong as there is from being right . recognize that `` better '' is n't necessarily `` great . '' the way to get great is to keep getting better . ",
        "4 . the best auto-reply email i 've ever seenhere 's an auto-reply email i received from a successful lawyer that 's a perfect example of how you can make your inbox work for you instead of the other way around . let me apologize -- if you do n't get an immediate response . my phone may be turned off . i may be walking , and looking up , instead of down . if you are curious -- and this is a workday -- feel free to call my office . i may be in a meeting , or my `` device '' is on a `` time out . '' ",
        "in any event , i am trying to be less distractible , more deliberative , and more mindful . i am hoping this will make us all more productive . if you need me -- and this is urgent , or timely -- please call my office or my cell . if this is a weekend , or an evening , and this is not urgent , let 's talk during the week . if this is personal , call me , find me , see me -- let 's talk not text . let 's try this . 5 . ",
        "prioritize your work using warren buffett 's `` two list '' strategywrite a list of your top 25 goals . then , review the list and circle your top 5 goals . separate them into two lists -- one with your top 5 goals and another with the other 20 goals . the list of five become your top priority . but here 's the twist -- the other list becomes your `` avoid at all costs list '' because those goals are of secondary importance and yet will be the ones that tempt you the most . they 're the ones you have to fight hardest to prevent from distracting you from the five that matter most .
