        "cbs local -- while adulthood usually signals a certain amount of independence , a new study has found that more adults are living with roommates or parents than at any point in the last three decades . online real estate database zillow says that 30 percent of adults between ages 23 and 65 were living in `` doubled-up households '' in 2017 . the government defines a `` doubled-up '' home as two or more adults who live in the same house . zillow 's researchers say it 's the largest number of adults co-habitating since 1990 . much of the blame for the growing number of roommates was pointed at the rise in rent costs across the united states . ",
        "`` as rents have outpaced incomes , living alone is no longer an option for many working-aged adults , '' zillow senior economist aaron terrazas said in a press release . `` by sharing a home with roommates -- or in some cases , with adult parents -- working adults are able to afford to live in more desirable neighborhoods without shouldering the full cost alone . '' zillow 's study also found that adults who live with roommates were paid less ; earning 67 cents for every dollar an adult living on their own was making in 2017 . ",
        "only 23 percent of adults were found to be doubling up in 1990 and 22 percent in 2000 . while smaller cities have been less affected by the trend , the country 's biggest population centers have seen more and more people being forced to live together . in new york and los angeles , where the average rent exceeded $ 2,300 a month , more than 40 percent of adults were living with roommates this year . new york and california were also found to be two of the least affordable states to live in , with nearly half of a person 's income going to the rent each month .
