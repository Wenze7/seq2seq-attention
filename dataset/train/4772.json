        "nashville , tenn. . -- mike vrabel says nobody 's ever really ready to be a head coach for the first time in the nfl . the tennessee titans ' newest coach feels like he is as ready as possible thanks to the men he 's worked with in the league . `` i 'm lucky basically to go through basically a doctorate degree of coaching with the people that i 've been around , '' vrabel said . the titans introduced vrabel as their new coach monday . they agreed to terms with vrabel on saturday , just five days after firing mike mularkey coming off the franchise 's first playoff win in 14 years . ",
        "`` there will be things that i take from new england , from pittsburgh , from ohio state , from houston , '' vrabel said . `` i mean there will be things that i take from everywhere . you draw on these experiences just like everybody else would in life ... the nice thing is now there 's things that i did n't like that billy did , i get to change them . so there 's things i like that he did , i get to use them . `` this is the first head coaching job for vrabel , 42 , who won three super bowl rings with new england during his 14-year nfl career as a linebacker . ",
        "vrabel is coming off his first season as defensive coordinator for the texans . vrabel 's 14-year career as a player included stints with pittsburgh under coach bill cowher and new england under coach bill belichick , along with kansas city . in 2011 , he joined the staff at his alma mater , ohio state , coaching linebackers and defensive linemen . `` i 'm not going to make the same mistake twice , '' vrabel said . vrabel went to houston in 2014 and coached linebackers with the texans for three seasons before becoming coordinator . the texans won the afc south in 2015 and 2016 thanks in part to strong defenses . ",
        "the unit slipped this season amid injuries to players including j. j. watt and whitney mercilus . this was the first head coaching search since robinson was hired in january 2016 , two days before the titans took the interim tag off mularkey . he went 21-22 in taking a team that had the nfl 's worst record at 5-27 combined over 2014 and 2015 to a team that lost in the afc divisional round to new england . mularkey was fired less than 48 hours after that loss . the titans interviewed only three people with vrabel first to meet with them thursday . ",
        "the titans also interviewed carolina defensive coordinator steve wilks and los angeles rams offensive coordinator matt lafleur . `` he had a great presence about him , '' robinson said . `` in the interview , his football intelligence showed quickly . and at the end of the day , we felt like this is the next head coach of the tennessee titans .
