        "grammarly 's virtual keyboard for android is here to help make you a better writer . if you find yourself doing any extensive amount of writing on your computer , chances are you 've used grammarly before . grammarly is a tool that works with your web browser and word-processing app of choice to help catch any grammatical or spelling errors your built-in spell-checker might miss , and as the news editor for android central , it 's something that i use every single day to keep me from looking like a buffoon when quickly pounding away on my keyboard . ",
        "on december 13 , grammarly announced that it 's officially bringing its virtual keyboard over to android after having first launched it on ios at the beginning of november . grammarly 's keyboard looks a lot like gboard at first glance , but as you can see , there 's something special happening near the top of it . as you type , grammarly will continually look at what you 're writing and make suggestions for any spelling or grammatical errors that it finds . if you want to make the correction , just tap on the suggestion and it 'll automatically be added . ",
        "once the correction has been added , you can tap on it to get an explanation of where you went wrong . grammarly encrypts what you type to ensure maximum protection , and any sensitive data that 's inputted is n't saved by grammarly at all -- something that ai . type failed to do . there 's support from american and british english , and grammarly says that it 's working on adding swipe input in the near future . gboard 's been my go-to android keyboard of choice for a while now , but considering how much i use grammarly on my laptop and desktop , you can be sure i 'll be giving it a shot .
