        "from : an ordinary citizento : the governmentcc : anti-terrorism squad , niabcc : * lol * date : 31 march 2017subject : regarding contents of my tiffin boxdear sir/madam , i am writing this letter in regards to the recent government regulations of sharing the contents of your tiffin to help the government in reducing instances of terrorism and ensure that the food meets the community standards without hurting any religious sentiments . my dabbawala is going to arrive anytime and then i may give you an elaborate description of my tiffin box . oh here he is . ",
        "so , let 's see . i have a 5 storey steel tiffin box inside the red plastic bag that my wife got when she went shopping for sarees in lower parel . she had bought the tiffin box around the same time when i had complained that the chapatti and the pickle get mixed up when put together in the same container . she was kind enough to oblige . the tiffin is made out of stainless steel and has 5 equally sized cylindrical containers and on the topmost container my initials are inscribed by shazia , shazia is my wife . ",
        "she is very particular about these things and inscribes my name on everything . she insists that i keep forgetting things and this way things do n't get lost . i mean , there are millions of r. ks in mumbai how would anybody know i am the one who has lost his tiffin box or his cotton handkerchief . anyway , let 's get back to the tiffin box as you may have some other important work also . so , i 'm opening the first box let 's see what it contains . doodhi . shazia does this on purpose . ",
        "she knows that i hate doodhi . and all because of a fight which she started . i told her that it is not possible for me to come for ejaz 's parent-teacher meet after all week in the office . she does not know the struggle of a nine to five job . do n't i deserve a day off at least ? this city is already killing me and add to that your wife nagging you all the time . i 'm sick of her complaining about every little thing . she thinks that i do n't give enough time to ejaz and complains that i am a bad parent . ",
        "chapati . although i do n't like doodhi but shazia makes good chapatis . they are all perfectly round in shape and cooked to perfection with that little brownish tint . this is one of the things that i love about her , the perfection with which she does tasks is simply amazing . i know we have our fights but she is a good partner and sometimes i feel that i do not appreciate her contribution to the family . my job has made me selfish and i feel that i should devote more time to my family . ",
        "also , there 's a note `` call the plumber on your way back home '' oh god ! i should tell you that apart from the commute the other major problem in this city is finding domestic help . the labour strikes have increased the price of daily wage . as if getting an apartment was not a struggle in the first place now you have to pay to get it repaired too . then also you have to handle the thak-tik of labour at your house . if i wanted to listen to loud noises after coming back tired from the office i may as well tune in to a news channel . ",
        "raita . no meal is complete without raita . also it is great in the summers . it is impossible to gulp morsels down your throat these days , mumbai summers are the worst . and add to that the roads broken during monsoon yet to be fixed by the bmc . the commute in this city is a job in itself . a little refreshment in this congestion is a relief . ok , what else do we have -- achaar and modaks . that 's all a man needs in his life , something sweet . you get the best modaks when the ganpati festival arrives in mumbai . ",
        "that is one of the reasons that i love this city despite all the chaos that happens at your job and at home . there are events like these that you look forward to . although the commute is bad but you still enjoy the occasional misal pav at churchgate . the achaar is made out of lemon , just what you need to get you back to the reality you live in . it is never sweet and it gives you a kick when you lick it . every life on the commute is like this pickle just waiting for someone to just touch it and spread all over his tongue and to shock the person 's gut . ",
        "but you kind of like it . i hope that you will find this letter helpful . we strive every day to keep the food according to the various community standards set listed in the official list of prohibited and permitted foods . we are sorry we did not specify the type of meat used for my tiffin last time and we would appreciate if you could remove the strike that you put up against our name on the official website . we already have a low social governmental rate . i will await the response to this letter and i hope that there is no mistake in the contents this time . ",
        "will write to you about the contents of my tiffin tomorrow . sincerely yours , r. k.   "
