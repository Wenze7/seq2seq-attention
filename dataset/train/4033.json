        "do you know what the definition of the word radical is ? neither did i. i mean i kinda knew , synonyms that come to mind are crazy , extreme , against the grain , or like super cool dude . raaaadical . well google tells me the definition is : `` relating to or affecting the fundamental nature of something ; far-reaching or thorough . '' for a long time the word radical was strictly used by : surfer dudes , church ladies , and doctors . i 'm here to tell you that the user base has grown much larger , and for no apparent reason . ",
        "a quick search on amazon revels the following book titles : radical candorradical focusradical acceptanceradical resilianceradical remissionradical brillianceradical self-loveradical brewingradical dharmaradical forgivnessradical hoperadical beautyradical reproductive justice ... i mean really ? is beauty really affecting the fundamental nature of something ? what about self-love ? can brewing beer in your basement actually affect the fundamental nature of something . that 's absurd . so can we all just agree to move on from this cheeky copywriting trend and just call things what they are . borrowing from the california surfer dude lexicon is n't totally radical . it 's just kinda weird .
