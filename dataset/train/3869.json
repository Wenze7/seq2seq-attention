        "in the lead-up to star wars : the last jedi , we look back at the first jedi with a series of stories about the much-beloved and never-disparaged prequel trilogy . aside from the star wars holiday special , the prequels are easily the wildest installments in the star wars franchise . but they were almost even wilder : as is probably unsurprising , given just how sprawling the far , far away galaxy is , there were a lot of ideas that did n't make it into the final cut . compiled here for your perusing pleasure are 11 of those scrapped plans : 1 . ",
        "`` i am your father , '' is now an indelible part of pop culture , and the prequels almost had their own equivalent . as per how star wars conquered the universe : the past , present , and future of a multibillion dollar franchise , though anakin was a virgin birth , it was supposed to have been revealed that emperor palpatine manipulated his birth by using the force . `` i used the power of the force to will the midi-chlorians to start the cell divisions that created you , '' the book quotes him saying . ",
        "`` you might say i 'm your father . '' 2 . speaking of familial relations , george lucas had ambitions of revealing anakin and boba fett as biological brothers . eventually , however , he abandoned the idea on the grounds that it felt a little too contrived . 3 . still , boba fett appears as a young boy in attack of the clones , and was originally also slated to appear in revenge of the sith . though lucas promised publicly that we 'd see fett again , if you 've seen the movies , you know that did n't happen . ",
        "early concept art for the third prequel includes the teenage boba fett , but he was ultimately cut in order to narrow down the scope of the film . if he had remained in the movie , he was intended to have joined with the separatists under count dooku , and tracked down mace windu to avenge the death of his father . 4 . a young lando calrissian was also considered to appear in prequels as an expansion of lucas 's original vision that lando had been alive during the clone wars . this idea was scrapped as the timelines ultimately did n't really match up in a way that would allow this to make sense . ",
        "5 . the same goes for the young han solo , who was almost to be glimpsed in revenge of the sith . han was going to show up as an orphan living on kashyyyk , being raised by chewbacca . the cameo was eventually cut , leaving the relationship between chewie and han as one of friends instead of a father-son bond . 6 . another possible entry in the cavalcade of prequel cameos was greedo , who picks a fight with the young anakin in a deleted scene in the phantom menace . the scuffle occurs when greedo accuses anakin of cheating in the podrace . ",
        "greedo comes off worse in the fight , as his friends tease him by saying he might come to a `` bad end '' one day , which is probably the kindest way of describing becoming a meme . 7 . qui-gon jinn 's role in the prequels was also somewhat curtailed . the jedi was originally supposed to play a much larger part in the films , returning as a force ghost to try to prevent anakin 's eventual embrace of the sith . an iteration of this idea still appears in the clone wars animated series , where qui-gon appears to obi-wan to speak about anakin 's path . ",
        "qui-gon was also notably closer in age to obi-wan in the original plans for the phantom menace , with anakin a teenager instead of a child . 8 . of course , there 's no mentioning the star wars prequels without mentioning jar jar binks . despite being such an outsize personality on his own , jar jar was at one point meant to have a sidekick as well , in the form of a doglike creature called a blarth . though the creature obviously did n't make it into the series , the wildlife of star wars : a field guide still has a record of it , describing it as having a `` constant desire for attention . '' ",
        "9 . jar jar was also meant to be even more comical . his bones were to be made of elastic , which would alter his body shape in different levels of gravity and under different levels of pressure to maximize his potential for expression . luckily , his final design was n't quite so extreme . 10 . on the other end of the tragicomedy spectrum , the gungans almost met with a much darker fate . instead of winning their battle in the phantom menace , early storyboards had the entire underwater city wiped out before obi-wan and qui-gon could ever seek the gungans ' help . ",
        "unsurprisingly , genocide was judged to be too dark for the movie , and the story was adjusted accordingly . 11 . all that said , the coolest scrapped idea by far is that darth maul could have been a female character . lucas had apparently considered the idea , with a photo of actress maggie cheung hung on the casting wall for inspiration . in the mood for sith , anyone ?
