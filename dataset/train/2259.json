        "this afternoon , the toronto maple leafs will take on the carolina hurricanes at the air canada centre at 2 pm . the toronto maple leafs look to rebound after a tough 3-1 loss against the detroit red wings on friday night . the toronto maple leafs looked extremely depleted on offence on friday night and it certainly did n't help that the leafs ' fearless leader , auston matthews sat out again . unfortunately , matthews wo n't be in the lineup today against carolina . but have no fear , the toronto maple leafs certainly have the offensive skill-set to get over the offensive drought . ",
        "yesterday , mike babcock moved william nylander back to centre and i believe that the switch will light a fire under the toronto maple leafs . willy at centreas my buddy , james tanner mentioned in his post yesterday , nylander has been given another chance at centre . #tmltalk lines this morning : - matthews is not expected to return tuesday vs. carolina . - nylander moved to centre , marleau to wing again for home game . - kapanen in , leivo out . - carrick skating with gardiner , has n't played since nov. . 24 . ",
        "pic . twitter . com/tavsjpxshj -- daily faceoff december 18 , 2017 . his last go-around at centre this season was rather shaky . nylander was at centre for one game and was able to set up a goal . however , babcock was n't comfortable with nylander remaining at centre so he was switched back to wing . but , nylander is a centre by trade . he is a great play-making forward and not someone who you 'd rely on for being a sniper . if you take a look at this highlight video on youtube , you can tell that nylander is n't a natural born sniper . ",
        "he gets most of his goals when he 's right in front of the net . there are a few goals that he 'll score off one-timers . but , it 's pretty rare for him to snipe him a goal . nylander is ten times betting at setting up goals . just take a look at this video from his 2016 campaign where he set up a sweet power-play goal for nazem kadri against the montreal canadiens . i 'm looking forward to watching the game today and seeing willy shine at centre ! carolina 's offenseunfortunately for the leafs , the hurricanes have a three-game winning streak and are looking to continue their streak today in toronto . ",
        "over the last three games , the hurricanes have scored ten goals . jordan staal , justin williams and jeff skinner have helped pave the way for the hurricanes ' offensive surge . the three forwards have totalled 3 goals and 5 assists in the last few games against the vegas golden knights , the buffalo sabres and the columbus blue jackets . to ensure a maple leafs ' victory , morgan rielly and ron hainsey will need to pay special attention to these forwards . moving aside from staal , williams and skinner , the hurricanes have plenty of offensive threats including sebastian aho and elias lindholm . ",
        "yes , aho is on a cold streak . he did have two assists against the sabres on friday and is looking to potent to break out of his cold streak . this season , aho has 7 goals and 16 assists and has been a dependable playmaker for carolina . on the other side of the fence , lindholm had a tough start to the season . so far , he has 9 goals and 9 assists in 32 games . but in the last five games , he has 2 goals and an assist . lindholm and aho might look rather sluggish as of late , but the leafs certainly should n't ignore them on the ice . ",
        "faulk 's offensive skillset decliningaside from the offence , the hurricanes have a strong depth of young defensemen including justin faulk . faulk consistently has been a solid defenseman . do n't look at his plus/minus statistic . yes , it might be a -6 . but , the plus/minus statistic is n't really an indicator of his strong defensive play . let 's look at his cf percentage instead . in 32 games this season , faulk 's cf percentage is at 53.9 % . faulk is a strong two-way defenseman . fortunately for the leafs , faulk has n't been great offensively this year . ",
        "he 's underperforming in comparison to the past four seasons . in his 2014-15 season , he had 49 points . but in the past two season , his offensive play has dropped and ttotalled37 points in each of the last two seasons . if the hurricanes are n't in the playoff hunt in late february , faulk could be dealt . lou lamoriello will likely be keeping a keen eye on faulk during today 's game to see if faulk 's defensive play might mesh well with the leafs . predictionif nylander can provide the playmaking punch that i think he can provide , i think the leafs might be able to squeak out a win today . ",
        "but this also rides on the leafs ' defence focusing on shutting down the hurricanes offence . i predict that the leafs will win the game by a slim margin of 2-1 . more from editor in leaf toronto maple leafs : nylander back at centre14h ago toronto maple leafs : thoughts on being critical of mike babcock1 d ago toronto maple leafs : auston matthews update1 d ago toronto maple leafs : jvr is going to get paid1 d ago maple leafs zaitsev to i. r : what 's it mean ? 2d ago this afternoon , the toronto maple leafs will take on the carolina hurricanes at the air canada centre at 2 pm .
