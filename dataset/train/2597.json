        "we 've all done it . it 's the holiday season and a last-minute party invite has left you scrambling for hostess gift ideas . then it hits you : your local grocery store most likely has a large display of poinsettia plants , conveniently located near the entrance . the bright leaves say `` christmas ! '' the tinselly foil on the pots says , `` festive ! '' so , because southerners just do n't show up at someone 's house empty-handed , you scoop up a plant and present it proudly to mrs. whatever-her-name-is . that 's great . ",
        "you 've done your guestly duty . but as the daughter of a mother with the blackest of thumbs , i remember one year when we ended up with an astounding six poinsettia plants . do n't get me wrong -- i 'm not trying to discourage you from giving them as gifts -- but in order to avoid what my mom did , we 've rounded up some tips on how to care for that plant that your son 's girlfriend/co-worker/dogwalker gave you . poinsettias are part of a huge family of plants known collectively as euphorbia . poinsettia are euphorbia pulcherrima , which translates roughly to ` the fairest , ' and it 's easy to see why . ",
        "the large , often crimson leaves that surround the small , yellow flowers are some of the most attractive seasonal foliage . related : in order to make sure that your bright plants do n't die , there are just a few simple things to remember : first , take the foil off of the plant so that it can drain . place it on a saucer or plate . then , you 'll want to keep the soil moist . but do n't overwater ! you do n't want standing water in your plant saucer . next , make sure you keep your new plant in a steadily cool but well-lit room . ",
        "most modern poinsettia selections will keep their bright foliage until spring if they are given enough light . selections with lighter leaves tend to last the longest . though we often do n't think of them as such , poinsettias do make pretty cut flowers . if you do decide to cut your blooms , sear the ends with a candle after cutting ; this prevents the sap from escaping -- the sap is what keeps the flower from drooping . once cut , you 'll want to make sure to check the water level frequently as poinsettias are quite thirsty in the vase . ",
        "a floral preservative can help prolong the life of your arrangement . after the last frost , cut the plant back to two buds and set out in your garden beds . alternatively , you can keep them in pots or containers in a sunny spot on the patio . whichever you decide to do , make sure that the plants get well-drained soil and full sun . if you live in the tropical south , this makes a great informal shrub , as it needs no special care . in the coastal south , the plant is likely to die down in the winter . ",
        "when the leaves start to show color , feed the plant every two weeks with a nitrogen-rich fertilizer ; this will help to improve the color . chances are , your plant will grow too tall to use next year , but you can start new plants by taking late summer cuttings . use stems with four or five joints or eyes . finally , if you do make new poinsettia plants , and you want them to bloom for christmas , they need to experience a long night . starting in october , put plants in a closet or other place with no light for fourteen hours per day . ",
        "move them into light in the morning , but make sure that they do n't get any more than ten hours . continue this for ten weeks , and you 'll have very merry poinsettias by christmas -- maybe you 'd like to give one as a gift ?   "
