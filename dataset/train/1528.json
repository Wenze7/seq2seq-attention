        "sydney - leg-spinner mason crane 's experience playing in sydney may prove the clincher to earn him a debut as england try to salvage their ashes series with a win over australia in thursday 's final test . trailing 3-0 and the ashes lost , england are considering a possible team change for the fifth sydney test with moeen ali 's place under threat and crane pushing for his first cap . moeen has played 48 tests and came to australia as an accomplished all-rounder but he has under-performed , taking only three wickets and averaging 19 with the bat . ",
        "the sydney cricket ground has a reputation as a turning wicket , enhancing crane 's chances of playing . the 20-year-old hampshire leggie also boasts a five-wicket haul playing at the famous ground for new south wales last year . crane , who was impressing in sydney club cricket , was called up by nsw and took five wickets in the sheffield shield victory against south australia . `` with the series lost it gives us the opportunity to look at some different people , '' england 's australian coach trevor bayliss said this week . asked if crane was ready for test cricket , bayliss added : `` there 's maybe no time like the present to find out . ",
        "`` we think he 's a guy that has got the goods and the more he plays at this level the better he will get . you have got to start somewhere . `` england outplayed australia for large tracts of last week 's fourth test in melbourne only for steve smith to bat out the entire last day with an unbeaten century for a draw . - a better team - prior to melbourne , experienced pair alastair cook and stuart broad were having lean series and under pressure for their spots . but cook carried his bat with an unbeaten 244 in the highest test score at the melbourne cricket ground by an overseas player , while broad bounced back to form with five wickets in the match . ",
        "`` we are a better team than what we 've played on this trip and that is a benchmark for our side moving forward , '' captain joe root said after the melbourne draw . `` we will try to make sure that we go one better in sydney and get the win that we want . `` but to break through in sydney , where they have won twice in the last four ashes tests , england must find a way of shackling the freescoring smith . smith has enjoyed a phenomenal series , scoring three centuries -- including a test best 239 in perth -- to amass 604 runs in six innings at an astonishing average of 151 . ",
        "the australia skipper , who averages 63.55 in his 60 tests , is now in outright second place for the highest-ever icc ranking points behind don bradman . `` i 'm adapting to each of the bowlers , i 'm changing my plans to them and how they 're trying to get me out , '' smith said . `` hopefully , i can just keep working and keep getting better as well . `` root said his team had to keep believing they can get smith out . `` we just have to keep trying every option if he does get in and if it is a good surface to bat on , and keep trusting and believing in what we do , '' root said . ",
        "pace spearhead mitchell starc , who missed the melbourne test with a bruised heel , is vying with recalled off-spinner ashton agar to likely replace jackson bird in the final australia xi . teams : australia - david warner , cameron bancroft , usman khawaja , steve smith , shaun marsh , mitchell marsh , tim paine , mitchell starc/ashton agar , pat cummins , josh hazlewood , nathan lyon . england - alastair cook , mark stoneman , james vince , joe root , dawid malan , jonny bairstow , moeen ali/mason crane , chris woakes , tom curran , stuart broad , james anderson .
