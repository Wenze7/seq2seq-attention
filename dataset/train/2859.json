        "in a surprising leak on the indycar mobile app , select race telecasts for 2018 were inadvertently announced ahead of the full release . indycar fans are avidly awaiting the release of the 2018 television schedule for the series , in the final year of their current deals with abc and nbcsn . however , it appears select race telecasts have been inadvertently leaked on the verizon indycar mobile app . while they have been taken down since , it has still allowed some insights into the coming year . as reported by open-wheels . com , nine races had their television network for coverage in 2018 leaked before the entire schedule was unveiled . ",
        "it is still not known when indycar will confirm their television schedule for the upcoming season . however , it appears based on the information from the app that much will remain the same as in 2017 . leaked images of the schedule show that abc will carry once again the firestone grand prix of st. petersburg , the grand prix of indianapolis , indianapolis 500 qualifying , and the 102nd indianapolis 500 . this would represent three out of their contractual minimum of five races for the final year of their contract . the two other races could be filled by the chevrolet detroit grand prix , as they have been frequently in recent years . ",
        "for nbcsn , it appears they will get the bulk of the remaining races once again . races suggested from the app already are those at long beach , barber motorsports park , toronto , mid-ohio , portland , and sonoma . this is also consistent with the 2017 schedule , with one addition in portland , replacing the departing watkins glen race . all the other unconfirmed races other than detroit would be expected to run on nbcsn or cnbc in case of nascar conflicts . perhaps the biggest unknown for indycar on the television front will be how the series handles their telecasts on abc . ",
        "it is expected that allen bestwick , dr. jerry punch , and eddie cheever will not be back on the indycar on abc broadcasts after being laid off by espn . who will the company and ims productions bring in to cover the race , in what could be only a one-year deal ? however , rumors suggest that corporate owner disney could still make a play in 2018 for the rights to at least the indy 500 going forward , potentially thwarting nbc 's plans to snatch up all of the rights to indycar . after all , abc has been the only home to the greatest spectacle in racing in its television history . ",
        "we will continue to await the official announcement of the verizon indycar series television schedule for 2018 , and additional news from the paddock during the offseason . you can be sure to stay tuned to beyond the flag for the latest news , rumors , and analysis throughout the winter months . more from beyond the flag nascar : rick ware racing acquires cup series charter2h ago formula one : charles leclerc is ferrari 's best option for 20192h ago alex zanardi to drive for bmw in 2019 rolex 244h ago formula one : williams delay driver announcement to 20186h ago nascar : concerns over monster energy 's future in sport ?
