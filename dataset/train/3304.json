        "when it comes to giving and receiving love , how affectionate you are can be told by your zodiac sign . while some enjoy date nights , hand holding , and cuddling for hours on end , some that tend to hold back a little . since we 're talking about astrological signs , this has everything to do with personality , as well as inherent strengths and weaknesses . `` different signs have ... different gifts and struggles , '' juliana mccarthy , author of the forthcoming book , the stars within you , a modern guide to astrology , tells bustle . ",
        "and the ones that really seem to have the affection thing down tend to be that way due to their ruling planet . `` libra and taurus are naturally affectionate because they are ruled by venus -- planet of love , '' she says . while the zodiac signs listed below are natural born lovers , that does n't mean other signs ca n't get in on the action . `` in fact , every sign can love beautifully and give and receive ample affection depending on who they are with and how their partner 's style blends with their own , '' mccarthy says . ",
        "`` but while libra and pisces could be with just about anyone , other signs may have to try harder to find a suitable mate who can skillfully draw out their affections . `` once you find a partner who jives with you romantically , the two of you can share the love in a way that suits you both . but if you happen to be someone who craves affection , in every sense of the word , these are the four signs to look out for since they 'll likely be all about it , too . 1taurus out of all the signs , taurus is often described as the most sensual . ",
        "`` they love to give and receive affection and to connect through the five senses , particularly touch , '' says mccarthy . so really , if anyone 's going to sprinkle rose petals on a bed while pouring you a glass of champagne , it 'll be a taurus . their high level of sensuality can come in particular handy if you want to score some prime cuddling time . but it can make for quite the spicy sex life , too . `` they will explore their partner 's bodies and get to know every tangible part , slowly and carefully , '' mccarthy says . ",
        "`` this is taurus ' love language -- touch . '' 2leo the sign that takes the cake when it comes to affection , however , is leo . they 're affectionate in every sense of the word . `` this is the most heart-centered sign , '' says mccarthy . and they 'll definitely show it by holding your hand , doling out hugs , and snuggling every chance they get . but remember , leo likes to receive affection , too . `` they want to bask in love , and in the adoration of others , '' mccarthy says . ",
        "so if you 're dating a leo , or want to win one over , give them all the attention they crave . they 'll really appreciate it . 3libra libra may take a minute to choose a partner , but once they do , they 'll be super affectionate . `` they love love and bask in romance and sweet nothings , '' mccarthy says . `` their affection is light , beautiful , and inspired -- writing you love letters , songs , and poetry , and spoiling you with gifts , flowers , and luxuries . '' ",
        "so if that 's your thing , get on board with a libra . they also tend to make a great partner , in the sense that they 'll allow you to be you , and will always appreciate who you are . but be forewarned ... that does n't always mean they 'll stick around , or want to be in a monogamous relationship . `` their only issue is staying power and commitment -- they tend to love multiple people equally . '' and tend to show affection to 'em all . 4pisces if you 're a pisces , or happen to be dating one , then you already know this sign is all about compassion . ",
        "`` pisces is the most compassionate sign , understanding all of the other signs completely while moving fluidly , like water , to adjust to whoever is in front of them , '' mccarthy says . so if anyone is going to `` get '' you , it 'll be a pisces . they 're also all about reciprocity , when it comes to love . and that can make for a very equal and loving relationship . `` if you give them affection , they will readily return it , '' mccarthy says . this is a sign that will truly love you unconditionally . ",
        "keep in mind , though , that love can happen for anyone , regardless of their sign being one that 's known for affection , or not . but when it comes to scoring yourself a cuddler , or someone who will write a love note , these are the four that 'll likely dish it out in spades .   "
