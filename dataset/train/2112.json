        "i 'm heading to ces 2018 , the big tech trade show in las vegas next week . and there 's one gadget that i wish i had . travelmate robotics will show off its autonomous suitcase , which is a robot on wheels that will follow you around . travelmate robotics developed the suitcase in san francisco , and it raised $ 793,538 in an indiegogo campaign a year ago . it lights up with different patterns , and it responds to both gestures and voice commands . if you want to give it a name like terminator t-1000 , you can do so and it will respond to you . ",
        "the company will show off the travelmate at ces 2018 . the suitcases range in price from $ 400 and up . that sounds steep , but good suitcases cost a lot . this one has two usb ports for charging devices , an ergonomic handle , a smart lock , speakers , a battery , and sensors that help it navigate through crowds . i have enough trouble carrying a coffee , my backpack , and a roller bag when i 'm trying to board an airplane . something like this could be really convenient . and ces would be the place to test it in the crowds . ",
        "of course , there 's nothing stopping someone from picking up the suitcase and carrying it off . but you might be able to track down its location . you can see its location via the travelmate app , and the travelmate 's wheels can lock if it senses that it is not following you anymore . the device has omni wheels that can roll in any direction . you can chain the devices so more than one travelmate can follow you . they will even avoid colliding with each other . it can measure the weight of what you put in it , so you do n't have to worry about crossing the weight limit . ",
        "the company plans to launch new updates , such as full voice integration . you 'll be able to do things like reserve tickets . other developers will be able to create applications for the suitcase in the future .   "
