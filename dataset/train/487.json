        "subtle changes to traditional chinese fare proving popular with the nation 's gym crowd . to eat , or not to eat that 's always a tough question for people interested in fitness , and it is even more true in china . chinese food , although diverse , is high in fats and features a great deal of fried fare . many chinese bodybuilders nowadays prefer western style dishes like boiled chicken breasts and steamed broccoli because domestic fare is often deep-fried , with heavy amounts of soy sauce and sugary items like lemon chicken . it 's fair to say that many of these foods are caloric bombs waiting to destroy your physique . ",
        "`` i think chinese food tastes fantastic but is something of a guilty pleasure , while western fitness food is much cleaner and physique-friendly , '' said a fitness amateur surnamed he . although china 's various regional cuisines contain unhealthy dishes , not all chinese food is marked by unhealthy cooking . there are plenty of options that are fairly healthy and lean by most standards . for example , unlike in the west , chinese cuisine treats vegetables as meals rather than add-ons . this creates a number of culinary opportunities for those interested in cooking and eating healthy food . ",
        "`` there are lots of foods that can influence workouts , and the most fundamental task is educating people to make correct choices , '' said wang ru of the school of kinesiology , shanghai university of sport . `` there is a common saying that carbohydrates are the culprits of all chronic diseases , but that depends on the types of carbohydrates . not all carbs are bad for you . `` for example , there is a rich variety of cereals in china which are very healthy carbohydrate sources , with a large portion of dietary fiber . ",
        "they reduce toxin absorption , lower blood sugar , increase feelings of satiety and promote gastrointestinal motility . '' wang added that china has some foods that are high in carbohydrates such as roujiamo , or chinese-style hamburgers . `` healthy eating depends on the food itself , and it should not be designated according to different dietary habits in western and eastern countries . the basic rule to avoid misdirection is that healthy eating should not go against the basic human needs , '' he said . zhou zhijia , a chinese restauranteur , said in his daily diet he opts for fresh instead of fried foods , forgoing fried rice and opting for steamed vegetable dumplings or steamed brown rice . ",
        "`` braised beef brisket with tomato is a good choice and boiled fresh fish or steamed fish heads can also provide quality protein with low saltiness , '' zhou said . some people go vegetarian with their chinese meals just to try to keep the calorie count down , but the absence of protein could set you up for a sharp blood-sugar spike , encouraging fat gain and increased hunger . wang xuan , ceo of a company called dream muscle school , said that as long as balanced meals are provided and fat content is kept low , fitness gurus can still enjoy chinese food . ",
        "she recommended an appliance called an air fryer , which can fry foods like potato chips , chicken , fish , and steak while using between 70 percent and 80 percent less oil than a traditional deep fryer . `` try some of the claypot offerings and steamed dishes . even lamb hot pot , or roasted duck ... but without the crispy skin , '' wang said . fats also play a major role in the ideal bodybuilding diet . dietary fats help us absorb important fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin e , d , and a . the survey showed that fats also slow the absorption of carbohydrates into the bloodstream which keeps blood sugar levels from spiking . ",
        "besides , many hormones in the body that are important to an active lifestyle , including testosterone , are dependent on fats for optimal production and function . wang pointed out that there are good fats and bad fats . the fats in certain coldwater fish and vegetables contain many healthy nutrients . some fats , called omega 3 fatty acids , should be supplemented in your bodybuilding diet . che lu has more than 10 years of gym experience and has noticed a gradual change in fitness diet in china . `` years ago , i could barely eat out . ",
        "almost everything served in the restaurants are wok fried in oil , cooking with loads of fat , sodium and sugar , '' che said . `` but nowadays , at more and more restaurants you can have any dish specially ordered . for example , ask chefs to make some of the sauces without sugar when you order it . `` you can also substitute different veggies in the dishes , which shows that the health consciousness of china is improving day by day .
