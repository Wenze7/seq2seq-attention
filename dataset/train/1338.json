        "today was a tough day . i had a cold in the morning and body pain later on . at a point i wondered if i could still walk . after some medication , i felt okay and headed out because i did n't want to miss out on a day . so , i decided not to risk it and just take a really long stroll . i got chased by dogs on my way . luckily , i could escape and was unhurt . i was very hungry when i did the walk today but there was no restaurant in sight . ",
        "however , i tried to focus on just completing the mark and distracted me from thinking anything else . similar things happen with pcos too . you will see mood swings by the hour owing to the hormonal imbalance . you will feel like you are losing control over emotions , and it 's just natural . you are not doing any of this intentionally . in such moments , remember to look for a bigger purpose and goal . take a step back . understand that sometimes you will be inadvertantly hard on yourself . recognize this and distract yourself from such situations . ",
        "try and channelize yourself in a different direction with some sense of purpose , and you will feel much better . i almost could have given up walking thinking that i am unwell and the stray dogs chased me . it was a scary situation with the dogs which could have gone worse . however , i stepped out of their way and looked for a different trail to walk on , and here i am -- happy about completing the walk sans the troubles . always remember , mind over matter .
