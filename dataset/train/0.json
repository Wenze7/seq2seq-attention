        "-- airbus se chief executive officer tom enders slammed brexit and u. s. president donald trump 's pro-america trade policies as presenting twin threats to its business , while singling out the u. k. 's vote to leave the european union as posing the bigger issue . the developments amount to a `` double whammy '' of protectionist hazards , enders said in london at the annual dinner of the ads trade association , which represents more than 1,000 aerospace , defense , security and space companies . brexit will weaken british industry and aerospace manufacturing in particular by increasing costs and curtailing competitiveness , the ceo said late monday . ",
        "while airbus will seek to mitigate the impact on its business , `` whatever we can do , the net result i 'm afraid will be negative , '' he said . the toulouse , france-based company has 25 sites in the u. k. , including its main wing design and production facilities , while the wider supply chain extends to 672 sites and more than 5,000 `` links or relations '' in commercial aviation alone , enders said . though airbus should be protected from tariffs by an exemption granted to aerospace under world trade organization rules , it desperately requires clarity in areas such as future customs procedures and the movement of employees , according to the executive , who said employees make 80,000 business trips a year between the u. k. and other eu states . ",
        "ads president colin smith , a former head of government and regulatory affairs at rolls-royce holdings plc , used the event to call on britain and the eu to negotiate a transition period for brexit of not less than two years during which the status quo for businesses would prevail . ` ruthless ' boeingunder trump , the u. s. is `` no longer fighting for opening markets but to close the u. s. market to foreign companies and foreign competitors , '' with arch-rival boeing co. . a direct beneficiary , enders said . boeing is `` ruthlessly surfing on this ` america-first ' wave , '' he said , citing the import duties imposed on the c series jet built by montreal-based bombardier inc. . ",
        "following complaints from the u. s. company that the model had benefited from illegal state aid . labeling the levy to be imposed on u. s. carriers that buy the canadian plane -- in which airbus has acquired a controlling stake -- as `` predatory '' and `` bullying , '' enders said that the move may bring short-term success but will ultimately be self-defeating , adding : `` you do n't attack customers . '' still , `` the wreckage that president trump will leave after four or eight years in the white house might be easier to repair than the u. k. exit from european union , '' he said . ",
        "the ceo added in a statement tuesday that his remarks were meant to show that u. s. airlines would be best served through competition between `` healthy and balanced '' planemakers , rather than with boeing as the dominant supplier . airbus earlier revealed that it secured 1,109 jet orders last year , 52 percent more than in 2016 , marking its sixth straight annual sales victory over boeing . commercial unit chief fabrice bregier said the trend means the european company should overhaul its competitor 's lead in aircraft deliveries by 2020 . the tally could reach 800 this year , enders said , more than the 763 boeing handed over in 2017 , though the u. s. group is also accelerating output .
