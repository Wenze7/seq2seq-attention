        "can you hear it , clarisse ? can you hear the silence of the coils ? having some success with the single coil shielding fix , i 'll be shielding all the pickups . noisebusters -- the moviethings have moved on -- we have to move with the timesmedium . comas part of a major tune-up , i ' v re-visited these pickups , which from memory are wound to be perhaps slightly higher output than the retro stratocaster style . these are one of the last set output from the late and lamented maxitone pickups , by max frecknall . ",
        "they are wound to have a little more output , and have balance for neck , middle and bridge , with no cheesy pole adjustment . they also sound great -- not a clone sound , but not a sound without character . that bombed , and there are some significant rf pickup , ending up as pickup noise . success ! conclusioni am really happy with these pickups -- they 're not too `` stratty '' , but can bring on the funk , or the telecaster clone sound with the flick of a switch . have near-noiseless operation is just the icing on the cake . ",
        "close up of one of max 's pickups . still going strong ! access is pretty easy once the strings are off in this design . max 's pickups were produced to a very high standard . there 's one out , released from the cover . all of them out . line up some copper tape with conductive glue . this time around , i am trying to avoid soldering onto metal ... attempt # 1 : stick tape onto the base which is earthed . attempt # 2 -- clean the bolt and tape directly onto that . ",
        "same again for all of them . re-assembled . `` super strat '' now even more super .   "
