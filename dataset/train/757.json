        "anchorage , alaska -- an earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 8.2 struck off alaska 's kodiak island early tuesday , initially prompting a tsunami warning for a large swath of coastal alaska and canada 's british columbia while the remainder of the u. s. west coast was under a watch . the national tsunami center later canceled the tsunami warning , but tsunami advisory remains for part of the state . watches have been canceled for british columbia in canada , washington , oregon , california and hawaii . officials in japan say there is no tsunami threat there . ",
        "the strong earthquake was recorded about 175 miles southeast of kodiak island . warnings from the national weather service sent to cellphones in alaska warned : `` emergency alert . tsunami danger on the coast . go to high ground or move inland . `` kodiak officials warned residents to evacuate if they lived in low-lying areas . a dispatcher at the kodiak police department answered a call from the associated press by saying , `` if this about the tsunami , you need to get to higher ground immediately . `` people reported on social media that the quake was felt hundreds of miles away , in anchorage . ",
        "keith perkins , who lives in the southeast alaska community of sitka , arrived at the high school early tuesday morning , after an alarm on his cellphone alerted him of the tsunami warning . he says the city 's sirens also went off later . he said people on facebook were chattering back and forth about whether this was real or not and what they should do . given the magnitude of the earthquake , perkins said he thought it best to head to school , the tsunami evacuation point , even though in the past he felt his home was at a `` high-enough spot . '' ",
        "`` i figured i 'd probably just better play it safe , '' he said . he said police officers were directing traffic and the parking lot at the school was filling up . he said he saw some people carrying suitcases or backpacks . perkins said he did n't bring anything along .   "
