        "by richard martin barcelona - barcelona moved six points clear at the top of la liga by easing to a 4-0 win at home to deportivo la coruna on sunday with doubles from luis suarez and paulinho ahead of next week 's ` clasico ' against champions real madrid . suarez slotted a generous cutback from lionel messi into an open goal in the 29th minute to deservedly put barca ahead , while brazil international paulinho got the second in the 41st , tapping in on the rebound after messi had hit the post . messi had a frustrating night in front of goal and was unable to add to his 14 league goals this season as he hit the woodwork three times and had a penalty saved by former youth team mate ruben martinez with the score at 3-0 . ",
        "suarez then scored his fourth goal in three league games by firing home a sergi roberto cross inside the area two minutes into the second half and paulinho completed the rout in the 75th , pouncing after jordi alba 's shot had come off the post . barca lead the standings on 42 points , six ahead of atletico madrid and eight in front of third-placed valencia . they are 11 clear of real , who have a game in hand after missing this weekend 's action due to playing in the club world cup , where they beat brazilians gremio 1-0 in saturday 's final . ",
        "`` we go into next week 's game feeling very happy and the best way to prepare for a game of that level is to win and feel confident and we are feeling great , '' barca coach ernesto valverde told reporters . `` it 's a very difficult game against a huge rival and we are very excited about playing it . i do n't think a win would assure us of the title because atletico are six points behind . what is clear is that seasons are very long and no-one wins the title at this stage . '' ",
        "barca forward paco alcacer went off injured in the first half and will miss the ` clasico ' after being ruled out for three weeks . la liga 's lack of goal-line technology or a video assistant referee came under the spotlight again near the end of the first half when suarez 's stylish ` rabona ' shot from close range appeared to cross the goal-line before martinez punched it away . the catalans were denied a goal three weeks ago when messi 's shot in a 1-1 draw with valencia clearly crossed the goal-line .
