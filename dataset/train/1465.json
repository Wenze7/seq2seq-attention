        "two weeks after a media report alleging that u. s. army special forces were involved in the killing of unarmed civilians in somalia , the head of u. s. africa command has ordered a new probe into the operation . `` after subsequent media reports alleged misconduct by u. s. personnel who participated in the operation , gen. waldhauser referred the matter to the naval criminal investigative service to ensure a full exploration of the facts given the gravity of the allegations , '' a spokesman for u. s. africa command told abc news . `` africom takes all allegations of misconduct seriously and will leverage the expertise of appropriate organizations to ensure such allegations are fully and impartially investigated . ",
        "`` the daily beast reported nov. . 29 that the 10 to 13 u. s. green berets , along with a group from the somali national army , shot dead 10 civilians in the village of bariire , somalia , about 30 miles outside the capital of mogadishu , on aug. . 25 . shortly after the daily beast reported its story , africom released the results of its investigation into the civilian casualty allegations made after the aug. . 25 operation , concluding `` the only casualties were those of armed enemy combatants . `` villagers who spoke to the daily beast alleged that after civilians were killed , u. s. forces directed somali soldiers to raid the home used to store the villager 's guns and place the weapons beside the dead civilians before photographing them . ",
        "the report goes on to say that the villagers brought the dead civilians to mogadishu in a refrigerated truck , as evidence to present to the somali government . within days , somalia 's chief of defense forces and minister of information said civilians had been killed in the operation , the daily beast reported . but the somali government 's investigation into the incident was never publicly released . a somali government official and former security official told the daily beast that was because of pressure from the u. s. government . to appease the families of the victims , both sources said , the somali government paid the families between $ 60,000 and $ 70,000 each , one source even alleging that money came from the u. s. government . ",
        "there is about 400 u. s. military personnel in somalia partnering with the somali government on counterterrorism operations against al qaeda affiliate al-shabab and isis . the united states has conducted 32 airstrikes inside somalia in 2017 , in addition to accompanying somali military forces on ground operations as part of an advise-and-assist mission .
