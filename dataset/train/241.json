        "the book , `` the little prince '' , a masterpiece by antoine de saint-exupéry is renowned as a children 's book , and hence the title of this post might seem out of scope of entrepreneurship . in this post , however , i focus on the key concern of the little prince , which is grown-ups -- who could not understand children - of the business world . strategic entrepreneurship is a well-known term among community of academic scholars and hence a suggested strategic tool for large enterprises and big companies . innovation and risk-taking are , according to peter drucker , the inseparable elements of entrepreneurship . ",
        "therefore , in an ever-changing world of business that disruptions and technological changes threaten not only large companies that could not keep up with the pace of technological changes , but also their employees who did not keep their personal skills updated . as such , the companies need to have corporate innovation tools in order to survive in such a competitive world , where innovation can disrupt anything , anywhere , anytime . in a previous post , i have discussed some of these issues regarding corporate vcs , which is one of the most popular corporate innovation tools . ",
        "in order to foster innovation , companies should have either a strong internal r&d sector or use one of corporate innovation tools , and their challenge , as mentioned in the prior post , is the lack of agility and entrepreneurial culture . startups on the other hand , developed a culture of innovation and agility inside their small firm , but they lack other business facilities such as business network , financial capability , or fame . therefore , larger firms tend to engage with startups as their innovation tools these days . the success stories of m&a s , business venturing , corporate incubations , and other tools of corporate innovation persuaded large firms to forgo their internal r&d and use newer forms of innovation development . ",
        "terms such as intrapreneurship , extrapreneurship , corporate innovation , corporate startup engagement , etc. . are now familiar to board members . nonetheless , working with both grown-ups and children for years , i can mention some flaws i have seen in grownup 's mindset that are biggest impediments for corporate innovation . risk takingrisk is the inseparable part of entrepreneurship , thus , any entrepreneurial activity involves risk . the extent to which each person is willing to take risk is one of the major distinctions between grown-ups and children . those who lead large companies are considered as already successful people of their own industry and rarely take bold risks in order to achieve more . ",
        "they already earned their current positions through years of professional life , and seldom tend to put themselves in precarious situations . startup founders , on the other hand , tend to take more and bolder risks , as they are audaciously following success . the consequence of these two disparate risk-taking approaches is quite evident ; the strength of startups in risk-taking becomes the weakness of larger firms . larger companies are mostly in defensive mode , whereas , startups tend to be more aggressive and hence the innovation of startups poses one of the biggest threats to large firms , whose market soon might be disrupted by a child . ",
        "future foresightthe other issue i have seen among investors and directors of large enterprises is the mindset they acquired in years of tradition business focusing on revenue , current market , and competitors . i have seen business-people calling themselves venture capitalist , conducting market research to decide whether to invest in a startup . on the other hand , i worked with venture capitalists who helped me correct my own mindset at early times of my involvement in entrepreneurial profession . the future foresight is the key element to success in any entrepreneurial activity , which emphasized on creating the future rather than maintaining the status quo . ",
        "about 10 -- 12 years ago an investor made large investment , setting up a factory to manufacture cd and dvd , just because a traditional consulting firm fed them with the result of a survey , ending up with an interesting npv and an attractive irr for the project . at the same time a startup of some college drop-offs might have been working on cloud computing , while the other large hardware manufacturers , which had a great r&d team on hand , might have been working on the top secret project of making flash drives and micro memories with higher capacities . ",
        "this is really important how far you can see from now ; can you see the world as it is now or as it will be in 10 years ? those who possess the intuition and mindset of seeing the far future and are patient enough to wait until they build it , are golden eagle entrepreneurs . solving this issue seems easy when we talk about it , though , when it comes to action it could be totally forgotten . grown-ups never understand anything by themselves , and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them . ",
        "-- antoine de saint-exupéry , the little princethe bottom linegrown-ups need to listen more to children . they should invite children and put them as board members of their companies . they have to engage more and try to change their mindset . but these children should also be careful , once they grow up they become vulnerable to acting like grown-ups . they might forget they have been once a child themselves . they might be more cautions or lose the sharp eyesight . once they become cautious and lack proper foresight , then it is hard for children to explain things to them .
