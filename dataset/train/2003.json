        "google 's not having the best start to the year , as it 's already been called out , yet again , for unscrupulous advertising practices . an investigation by the sunday times shed light on a significant money-making machine , which played out through google ads , targeting people seeking help for substance abuse issues . someone entering relevant search terms might see an ad for a free advice helpline . these services might subsequently provide details of formal treatment options at private clinics . a caller was n't to know , however , that successful referrals were netting these companies significant commission fees . ",
        "as a result of the investigation , google has now banned these types of ads from appearing in search results in the uk . `` we work to help healthcare providers -- from doctors to hospitals and treatment centres -- get online and connect with people who need their help . substance abuse is a growing crisis and has led to deceptive practices by intermediaries that we need to better understand . in the us , we restricted ads entirely in this category and we have decided to extend this to the uk as we consult with local experts to update our policy and find a better way to connect those that need help with the treatment they need , '' google said in a statement . ",
        "the department of health has also chimed in , telling the sunday times : `` it is disheartening that those seeking privately funded help for their addiction are potentially being exploited . `` this kind of ` patient brokering , ' as it 's sometimes known , is outlawed in several us states . while ethically questionable , it 's perfectly legal in the uk , though google has now decided to apply the same ad restrictions it 's done in the us since last september across the pond . daniel gerrard , chief of the largest uk agency addiction helper , said callers are offered a free service , are recommended government-funded programmes and support groups , with private clinics suggested as a `` last resort . '' ",
        "however , speaking to undercover reporters , gerrard also suggested a certain bias towards some treatment options . regarding outpatient therapy , he said : `` it 's minimal money on counselling , so we try not to overpromote it . `` oliver clark of rival agency adt healthcare told reporters his company also `` gives impartial advice '' in the `` best interest '' of callers . if a rehab centre were to agree to a higher commission fee , though , he said they would get preferential treatment for referrals . these agencies do n't disclose their commercial relationships with clinics unless explicitly asked , and can earn up to tens of thousands of pounds for referring just one patient to a luxury rehab centre for a month-long programme . ",
        "they argue the revenue allows them to continue to provide free support to those who ca n't afford private treatment . aside from the lack of transparency , one fear is the racket could be impacting the cost of private treatment at a time when the nhs is in disarray , and overdose-related deaths are at an all-time high . part of the reason commission fees are so high is because agencies are paying google significant sums to make sure their ads are seen before their competitors . addiction helper reportedly met with google every quarter and paid the company roughly £ 350,000 each month -- up to £ 200 per clickthrough , over £ 4 million per year -- for the best ad slots . ",
        "furthermore , the agency operates more than 300 websites that would funnel visitors back to addiction helper phone lines . showing undercover reporters the extent of this reach , gerrard demonstrated how simple , relevant search terms would spit out results where his sites occupied five spaces on the front page . though not anymore , you 'd hope .
