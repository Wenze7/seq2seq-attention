        "-- factories across the globe warned they are finding it increasingly hard to keep up with demand , potentially forcing them to raise prices as the world economy looks set to enjoy its strongest year since 2011 . a slew of purchasing managers indexes published on tuesday from countries including china , germany , france , canada and the u. k. all pointed to deeper supply constraints . the u. s. reading from ihs markit rose for the third month in the past four , reaching the highest since march 2015 amid `` increased capacity pressures . '' such strains on potential output may mean companies have to hire or invest more to avoid overheating , yet it could also force them to push up prices , propelling inflation enough to squeeze the expansion . ",
        "jpmorgan chase & co. . is among the banks predicting global growth will be around 4 percent this year and on tuesday said its composite of pmi reports from around the world had reached the highest since february 2011 . `` a key development to watch out for in 2018 is the potential advent of accelerating inflation , '' said larry hatheway , chief economist at gam . `` it matters most because it is almost entirely unanticipated by markets , yet seems likely from the perspective of macroeconomic conditions . '' government bonds fell around the world as traders moved to price in the prospect of quickening inflation . ",
        "the yield on 10-year treasury notes increased four basis points to 2.45 percent while the 10-year break-even rate , a gauge of the outlook for consumer prices over the coming decade , approached 2 percentage points for the first time since march . in europe , the five-year , five-year inflation swap rate increased to the highest level since february . in the u. s. , the ihs markit pmi rose to 55.1 from 53.9 in november , while the euro-area index was at a record 60.6 . the report said `` robust intakes of new business tested capacity '' in the euro area and there was a jump in backlogs of work as factories found it hard to keep up . ",
        "in germany , the region 's largest economy , this `` poses a risk to the sector 's ability to kick on . '' the euro-zone report showed both new orders and output were the best in 17 years as exports gained . germany 's gauge rose to a record and france improved . canada reached a three-month high of 54.7 on stronger new orders . global growth also got a boost from a solid reading in china 's manufacturing sector . with industry at its limits , there are implications for inflation in the euro region , which remains below the european central bank 's target of just under 2 percent . ",
        "bundesbank president jens weidmann , who wants to set an end-date for monetary stimulus , recently cited regional bottlenecks as setting the stage for stronger wage growth . `` the missing element has been sustained higher inflation , '' said chris williamson , chief business economist at markit . `` but the near-record incidences of supply-chain delays seen toward the end of 2017 indicate that pricing power is shifting from the buyer to the seller , suggesting upward price pressures are gradually returning . '' the u. s. federal reserve raised interest rates three times last year and , according to officials ' median forecast , has penciled in another three this year on the expectation that inflation will move back toward its 2 percent target . ",
        "`` the combination of strengthening growth , a solid labor market and rising prices will add to expectations that the fed will remain on track for another rate hike in the near future , with march looking a likely possibility , '' williamson said . input costs remain elevated across a number of economies , partly reflecting higher raw material prices . what our economists say `` rising supply constraints across many of the world 's largest economies represent a return to normalcy for now , but if momentum continues it will ultimately become inflationary . accelerating growth has been eating up excess capacity and once that is gone inflation will perform in a more typical fashion and accelerate . '' ",
        "-- mike mcdonough , chief economist , bloomberg economics china growthin china , the caixin factory pmi rose to a four-month high and there was faster growth of output , total new work and export sales , as well as an increase in backlogs . an official pmi weakened slightly , though remained above the key 50 level that signifies expansion . car manufacturers are among those who have ramped up supply or felt the pressure of demand . volkswagen ag 's main passenger-car brand said last friday that production reached a record high last year with global output of more than 6 million vehicles , while philippe buros , renault sa head of sales for france , told bfm business radio tuesday that french orders are up too . ",
        "`` the french market has grown 5 percent on average over five years , '' he said . `` it 's quite rare , so everyone 's struggling a bit to keep up '' in terms of production . in china , state-owned kweichow moutai co. , the world 's most valuable spirits maker , is raising the price for its signature drink for the first time in five years and implementing an average 18 percent increase across its product line . there were signs of weakness elsewhere in asia , with factory indexes in indonesia , malaysia and south korea dipping below 50 during december . ",
        "still , the global economy is forecast to expand 3.7 percent this year , slightly faster than the 3.6 percent pace estimated for 2017 , according to the international monetary fund 's most recent projections . the euro area will cool slightly from 2.3 percent this year , but still record growth above 2 percent , according to a bloomberg survey of economists last month . -- with assistance from andre tartar mark evans harumi ichikura jill ward francois de beaupuy and christoph rauwald to contact the reporter on this story : fergal o'brien in london at fobrien@bloomberg . net .
