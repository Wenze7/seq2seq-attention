        "robocalls documents point to ` pierre poutine ' 3:33 more details are emerging in the mystery of `` pierre poutine , '' a pseudonym of the person behind misleading election robocalls in guelph , ont . michael sona , a 24-year-old former conservative party staffer , is the only person charged with masterminding an automated phone call that went to thousands of non-conservative supporters in guelph , ont . , on election day in 2011 , sending voters to the wrong polling station . new court documents in the elections canada investigation into the calls were made public late monday , but are subject to a strict publication ban . ",
        "the judge who issued the ban , c√©lynne dorval , went so far as to order anyone who wants access to the documents to acknowledge in writing that the sealing order exists , and to refuse to provide photocopies of the publicly available documents , requiring the records to be viewed at the courthouse . the ban runs until sona 's trial is complete . the trial 's start date has n't yet been scheduled . the new information strengthens the links between an automated phone calls account that ordered the misleading robocalls and an ip address belonging to the conservative campaign in guelph . ",
        "the documents , including a 42-page affidavit signed by elections canada investigator al mathews , resolve a small mystery about why a seemingly unconnected ip address was used to order up the automated robocalls : the internet provider gave the wrong information to mathews . mathews had traced the misleading calls in guelph to an account with racknine , a company that provides clients the ability to make automated phone calls to thousands of people at once . the account , under the pseudonym `` pierre jones , '' accessed racknine using a specific ip address , a unique identifier associated with internet service accounts . ",
        "`` pierre poutine '' and `` pierre jones '' are the two pseudonyms used to set up the accounts used to carry out the alleged voter fraud . ip address belonged to conservative office in march , 2012 , rogers communications gave mathews the name of a customer who mathews said seemed to be unconnected to the conservative campaign in guelph . conservative party officials have told mathews that the list of call recipients matches their own list of guelph residents who do n't support the party . but the ip address seemed to be a dead end . in fact , the new records show , rogers gave mathews the name of the customer who currently uses that ip address . ",
        "the company has since corrected itself , mathews wrote in the documents filed in court . `` the true subscriber for during the timeframe requested was ` the marty burke campaign , ' '' mathews said . the court had given mathews a production order for the ip address information on march 20 , 2012 , and rogers complied the next day . mathews went back to the customer named by rogers and got a copy of a may 2 , 2011 email to prove , using data from the email 's header , that the ip address was different . ",
        "he passed it on to rogers and asked the company to take another look . a spokeswoman for rogers says elections canada contacted the company again on aug. . 10 , 2012 , and asked them to re-examine the information originally provided . `` we then reviewed the additional information provided by elections canada and determined that we had inadvertently provided incorrect information . this was a highly unusual and rare error . on aug. . 22 , 2012 we provided elections canada with the correct information responsive to their court order , '' jennifer kett said in an email to cbc news . ",
        "`` we make every effort to respond to court orders thoroughly and without delay . '' timeline details pierre poutine 's plan sona was the director of communications for conservative candidate marty burke in guelph for the may 2 , 2011 election campaign . he went on to work for conservative mp eve adams . sona says he had nothing to do with the misleading calls . in the court documents , mathews sets out some of the timeline for all the purchases that allowed the shadowy robocaller to hide his or her tracks . cbc news has compiled this timeline based on information contained in the court documents released late monday and on previous affidavits filed by mathews . ",
        "all times et . april 30 , 2011 5:30 p. m. andrew prescott , the campaign staffer who dealt with racknine for voice broadcasts , or robocalls , replies to an email by ken morgan , the campaign manager , and sona . morgan and sona had asked prescott to provide the contact information for racknine . racknine president matt meier only provides his direct line to current clients . 6:49 p. m . a $ 75 pre-paid visa card is purchased at the shoppers drug mart on scottsdale drive in guelph . 7:04 p. m . a pre-paid cell phone , or burner phone , is bought at future shop on stone road west in guelph for $ 45.30 . ",
        "the buyer pays cash and activates the phone under the name `` pierre poutine , '' using the same gmail address that later communicates with meier . mathews says in the affidavit that he has driven between the shoppers and the future shop , and they are 1.3 kilometres apart , nearly in a straight line . 7:19 p. m . the pierres1630@gmail . com account is created . mathews says in his affidavit that google has confirmed the email account was created at the same ip address used by the burke conservative campaign . 8:48 p. m . the cell phone is activated through a cell tower at 530 york road in guelph . ",
        "at 1.6 kilometres away from the burke conservative campaign office , it is the closest tower to the campaign headquarters . 9:07 p. m. someone using the name pierre jones calls meier and sets up a racknine account . may 1 , 2011 three more pre-paid credit cards are bought at a different shoppers drug mart . one is a mastercard brand pre-paid card for $ 200 , one is a visa for $ 150 , and the third is a visa for $ 35 . 9:19 p. m. `` pierre jones '' logs onto racknine via a server that hides ip addresses . ",
        "9:20 p. m. `` pierre jones '' accesses racknine again , this time from the ip address used by the burke conservative campaign . may 2 , 2011 , 4:12 a. m. `` pierre jones '' logs into racknine from the ip address assigned to the burke conservative campaign . 4:15 a. m . the account assigned to prescott , the only burke campaign staffer who dealt with racknine , logs in from the conservative campaign 's ip address . every time prescott 's account logged into racknine from the guelph area , it was through the burke campaign ip address . ",
        "10:00 a. m. misleading calls falsely claiming to be on behalf of elections canada direct thousands of guelph voters to the wrong polling station . it 's against the law to interfere with a citizen 's right to cast a ballot . 4:54 p. m. `` pierre jones 's '' account accesses racknine but the access is stored in internal racknine logs as prescott 's user number . the session is left logged in as prescott 's user id .
