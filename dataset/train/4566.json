        "san francisco -- `` pokemon go '' is moving into a different dimension on the iphone , thanks to software that allows the game to play new tricks with its menagerie of digital critters . an upcoming game update relies on built-in apple software called arkit that gives the iphone 's new ways to serve as a portal into augmented reality . ar is a technology that projects life-like images into real-world settings such as parks and streetscapes . the new approach , announced wednesday , adds depth to the playing field and lets pokemon monsters grow or shrink to fit their environment . ",
        "the game 's creatures will now flee when they detect sudden movement or if players approach too quickly . john hanke , ceo of `` pokemon go '' creator niantic , believes iphones equipped with apple 's ar software now offer the best way to play the game . that 's an ironic twist because niantic spun out of google , whose android software powers most of the smartphones in the world . hanke played a key role in build google maps , one of the most frequently used apps on android phones . apple 's ar technology works on iphones dating back to the 2015 iphone 6s , a line-up that encompasses an estimated 200 million to 300 million devices , including ipads . ",
        "`` pokemon go '' has offered an ar option since its release 17 months ago , but apple 's technology is more advanced than what the game has been using . apple is hoping app makers will find compelling ways to deploy its ar tools , helping to hook the masses on a technology that so far has been embraced by a sliver of smartphone users . if ar takes off , many analysts believe apple will branch out in a few years and release a new line of devices designed specifically for ar .
