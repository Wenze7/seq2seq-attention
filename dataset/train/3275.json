        "time and again , donald trump has been cited as the reason why the news cycle in america has changed for the worse . but one tweet shared on wednesday by a linguistics philosopher , george lakoff , cracks the code of just how trump uses social media to easily manipulate you . with the help of the linguist 's taxonomy , you can see how the president 's tweets are more about strategy and less about the substance in his words . `` trump uses social media as a weapon to control the news cycle . it works like a charm . ",
        "his tweets are tactical rather than substantive , '' lakoff tweeted . you may not know who lakoff is ; as a cognitive linguist , author , philosopher , and former professor of linguistics at the university of california at berkeley , he studies , analyzes , and writes about how human beings create and use language in culture , society , and politics . he now works as the director of the center for the neural mind and society . in his tweet , lakoff shared four categories in which trump influences his american audience and the news media . ",
        "those four categories are `` preemptive framing , diversion , deflection , and trial balloon . '' lakoff presented his thoughts in a detailed graphic created with the help of a visual designer , greg gibilisco , of maya design : using lakoff 's taxonomy , readers can approach and decode trump 's tweets without being taken in by them . he gives real-life examples to explain how those four categories work in trump 's favor : as an example of what he calls preemptive framing , lakoff shared a trump tweet from january 2017 where he framed the democratic national committee 's hacking as its own doing . ",
        "`` the hacking of the dnc was the dnc 's fault and the democrats lost by a wide margin . in fact , it was one of the narrowest margins in u. s. history , '' lakoff said . there 's also diversion and deflection . lakoff found an example of trump doing this with a tweet about actress meryl streep during a moment of increased national interest in possible russian interference in the 2016 presidential race . lastly , there 's the `` trial balloon , '' which lakoff said is how trump tests the public 's reaction to something -- and perhaps their tolerance for aggression . ",
        "possible examples of such tweets could include trump 's retweeting of a far-right islamophobic group in the united kingdom last year , or his retweet of an anti-semitic twitter account in 2016 . lakoff 's analysis not only can help people read the context behind trump 's tweets , but also read into his possible intentions . the linguistics philosopher said : he added : `` we have the power stop him . but we must stop letting him control our media - and our minds . it 's time to give trump a twitter time out . let 's shrink him down to size . ",
        "let 's take this weapon out of his hands . `` the linguist 's breakdown of trump 's news cycle manipulation strategy via twitter seems to be a great resource for american citizens . with the help of lakoff 's analysis , you can see how trump frames an idea ; directs mainstream attention away from critical issues of the moment ; deflects by attacking personalities and institutions ; and then tests the public 's patience and reaction with aggressive declarations . it may sound like a lot of steps for one person to go through when reading every trump tweet , but it works , as lakoff said , `` like a charm .
