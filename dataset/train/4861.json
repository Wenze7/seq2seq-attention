        "two of the most sought-after pitchers on the free agent market are jake arrieta and alex cobb . both , however , will cost a good sum of cash to acquire , even as time marches on towards the 2018 season . arrieta spent 2017 with the chicago cubs , where he posted a 3.53 era to go along with a 14-10 record . he did n't quite have the same year as his cy young campaign in 2015 , but he 's still got stellar stuff and will be a great addition to any staff . alex cobb lost the 2015 season to tommy john surgery , but his elbow has fully recovered . ",
        "aside from a few minor injuries , he 's completely healthy . he posted similar numbers to arrieta in 2017 , going 12-10 with a 3.66 era . today , both pitchers ' asking prices were clarified . still want 'em on your team ? levine on asking prices for arrieta , cobb pic . twitter . com/4rwbmspc94 -- mlb trade rumors december 28 , 2017 . arrieta , who is represented by super agent scott boras , will likely sign a huge contract . it 's estimated that it will be somewhere in the ballpark of six years / $ 160 million . ",
        "he may not be quite that expensive , if time continues to pass , but he is on the record as wanting a deal for 5 + years . alex cobb , on the other hand , is looking for a 4-to-5 year deal . his value has been compared to that of mike leake , whose contract is currently on the books for five years / $ 80 million , insider bruce levine expects the contract to ultimately be a little less than this . both righties have had a good number of suitors , and it 's only a matter of time before they land with new teams , even at these heightened values .
