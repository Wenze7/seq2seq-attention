        "related story : should spartans be in panic mode after michigan loss ? now according to some who support this team , like former michigan state basketball player and nba champion draymond green , this is a good thing and that the adversity the current team is going through will enhance their long-term success . and i can agree with that to an extent , but the problem is the conference . in this week 's edition of busting bracket 's bracketology , five teams from the big ten received bids . the spartans received a no . 4 seed and conference leader purdue got a no . ",
        "1 seed . the other three were from no . 6 seeds on down , meaning the number of big wins available michigan state to enhance the team 's resume further is dwindling . this team is certainly not in danger of missing the big dance altogether , but a few more losses will put them in the same position as last year . the opponent in this one , indiana 11-7 , might be in the tournament if the program refused to play mid-major teams within the hoosier state . this team has been playing very well of late , despite losing third-leading scorer de'ron davis to an achilles injury for the season .
