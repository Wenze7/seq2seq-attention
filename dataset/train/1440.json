        "iran 's revolutionary guards chief announced the `` end of the sedition '' wednesday as tens of thousands rallied in a show of strength for the country 's islamic rulers after days of deadly unrest . but even as state television aired footage shot from helicopters of the support for iran 's clerically overseen government , videos emerged showing the anti-government unrest that has swept major cities has also spread to the countryside in the nation of 80 million people . it was unclear however when the videos were taken . protests over economic problems broke out in iran 's second city mashhad last week and quickly spread across the country . ",
        "at least 21 people have been killed in the unrest and some five hundred have been arrested by authorities . revolutionary guard chief general mohammad ali jafari said the guards intervened `` in a limited way '' against fewer than 15,000 demonstrators nationwide and that many had been taken into custody . `` a large number of the troublemakers at the centre of the sedition , who received training from counter-revolutionaries ... have been arrested and there will be firm action against them , '' he said . his declaration came after major rallies by regime supporters . chants of `` leader , we are ready '' were heard as images showed thousands marching in the cities of qom , ahvaz , kermanshah and elsewhere . ",
        "the demonstrators waved iranian flags and pictures of supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , as well as placards saying `` death to seditionists '' . though the anti-regime demonstrations began as protests against a faltering economy , they soon turned against the regime as a whole , presenting the biggest test for the authorities since mass demonstrations in 2009 sparked by disputed elections resulted in bloodshed . while many iranians denounce the violence that has accompanied some demonstrations , they echo the protesters ' frustration over the weak economy and official corruption . us exerts pressurea white house official , who asked for anonymity , said wednesday the administration would look for `` actionable information '' to try to begin imposing sanctions on those responsible for any crackdown . ",
        "us president donald trump insisted iranians were trying to `` take back '' their government , extending a drumbeat of encouragement for the protests . `` you will see great support from the united states at the appropriate time ! '' he tweeted , without offering any specifics . iran 's un ambassador gholamali khoshroo said in a letter that the us government `` has stepped up its acts of intervention in a grotesque way '' in iran 's internal affairs and accused washington of violating international law and the principles of the un charter . afp journalists reported a heavy police presence still on the streets of central tehran , along with a large number of revolutionary guards . ",
        "it remains difficult for journalists to piece together what 's happening beyond the capital , especially as the government has blocked both the photo-sharing app instagram and the messaging app telegram , which protesters have used to organize their demonstrations and share footage . telecoms minister mohammad-javad azari jahromi said telegram would only be unblocked if it removed `` terrorist '' content . the political establishment has closed ranks against the unrest , with khamenei on tuesday saying the regime 's enemies were `` always looking for an opportunity and any crevice to infiltrate '' . even reformists in iran , who backed the 2009 protests , have condemned the violence and the support the demonstrations have received from the united states . ",
        "but they also urged the authorities to address economic grievances . `` officials must acknowledge the deplorable situation of the country as the first step to hearing the protesters , '' tweeted mohammad taghi karroubi , whose father mehdi karroubi has been under house arrest for almost seven years for helping lead the 2009 demonstrations . ` some freedom in iran ` many iranians appear to have been turned off by the violence , which has contrasted with the largely peaceful marches in 2009 . rouhani came to power in 2013 promising to mend the economy and ease social tensions , but high living costs and unemployment have left many feeling that progress is too slow . ",
        "rural areas , hit by years of drought and under-investment , are particularly hard-hit . on the streets of the capital , there is widespread sympathy with the economic grievances driving the unrest , particularly an unemployment rate as high as 30 percent for young people . `` people have reached a stage where they can no longer tolerate this pressure from the authorities , '' said soraya saadaat , a 54-year-old jobless woman . but some tehranis said claims from the us that they were desperate for freedom were overblown . `` we do have some freedom in iran , '' hamid rahimi , a 33-year-old bank employee told afp . ",
        "`` if the people of iran have something to say , it 's about economic problems . they want to see their demands , what they voted for , fulfilled . '' mojtaba mousavi , a tehran-based political analyst , said iranians do not generally support violence , no matter how unhappy they are with their government . `` there are certainly iranians who are n't happy with certain policies , frustrated people who would like to protest against their economic situation , but history shows none of these people support violence and subversion , '' he said . in 2009 , authorities ruthlessly put down protests against the re-election of hardliner mahmoud ahmadinejad .
