        "science is very clear about the importance of sleep to our physical and mental well-being . however , not all high-charging , do-it-all professional women have bought into the benefits of sleep . after all , how can they ? then they would n't be able to pack in 20 hours of activity each day ? and they would have to say no to things and let people down -- gasp ! ! there was a time in my life where i pulled all nighters and/or regularly only got 4 hours of sleep . i produced super-human amounts of work . ",
        "but i was always stressed , on edge and trying to stay busy so i did n't crash . after one particularly bad stretch of late and sleepless nights working , i had gotten in the habit of pounding 5-hour energy shots to function . it kept me awake but came with side effects . like the time i gave a presentation in front of about 50 colleagues and at the end someone remarked how nervous i seemed ... because i had been shaking . turns out , i was n't nervous at all . i was literally shaking from all the chemicals i was pouring into my body to stay awake . ",
        "that embarrassing incident was a wake up call that i needed to get a handle on my sleep . what was the point of killing myself to do all this work if i could n't even appear calm and confident when i presented it to other people ? sleep has been the game-changer for me professionally and personally and the foundation of my self-care . with 7 -- 8 hours of sleep each night , i 'm more clear-headed , calm and less stressed and triggered by things that are out of my control . i no longer test the limits of how many hours i can work in a day and how many projects i can take on at one time . ",
        "because i do n't have to . i do n't need to prove how much work i can do to anyone or have my health suffer for my job . if you feel like your plate is so full that sleep is a luxury you ca n't afford , i strongly urge you to sloooooowwww down . the work will still be there tomorrow . and hopefully your colleagues and clients also want you to take care of yourself . but , if you find yourself in an unforgiving situation where you truly ca n't take your foot off the gas , then it may be time to evaluate whether that 's a place you want to stay . ",
        "remember , we always have choices . sacrificing your long-term health for some fleeting glory at work is a risky play and worth taking a hard look at . missed a post ? catch up on previous posts in the series : 7 things badass professional women do n't do , badass professional women do n't # 1 : put your head down and work harder , badass professional women do n't # 2 : compare yourself , badass professional women do n't # 3 : say yes , badass professional women do n't # 4 : accept the hand you 're dealt , badass professional women do n't # 5 : feel guilty , and badass professional women do n't # 6 : be a tough guy .
