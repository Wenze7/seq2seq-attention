        "via the daily bellwhat does desperation look like ? this : the weird thing about trees is that someday , like all of us , they die . this tree was on its way out . in fact , the tree was removed in order to protect anyone standing under it from danger . who usually stands under it ? the press . melania was trying to protect the same press that now attempts to skewer her over landscaping . the tree will actually be removed on the advice of the national arboretum . it is only held in place by an intricate maze of cables . ",
        "and melania actually made sure they saved cutting from the tree to replant . i felt very silly writing the past few paragraphs because the issue is so trivial . this is not important news . the media that originally reported this story should be laughed out of town . and in one way or another , they will be . it 's not so much the reporting of this non-news that is a problem . i suppose it may be of some interest to someone somewhere . perhaps a side link , or maybe a half page in arborist monthly . ",
        "but the headlines ! that is what really does it . you know , the tree was actually planted by andrew jackson . so the media could have said , `` melania orders removal of symbol of racism , '' or `` two-hundred year old monument to the trail of tears to be cut down . '' the substance of the article missed an opportunity too . the white house had to call in tree experts , who made a report which was delivered to melania , who sat down with the arborists and staff to thoroughly explore every option before making the call to remove the tree . ",
        "if that 's not a metaphor for the government , i do n't know what is ! a dying tree , being held up by cables to preserve some remnant of a long-gone past . the desperate bid to save a symbol , to hold onto something rotting and dangerous . and then the intricate process , bureaucracy , time , and money that it takes to just cut down the freakin tree ! the media is absolutely desperate to criticize the trump administration over anything they can get their hands on . except that this is exactly the type of coverage trump relishes in . ",
        "big nothing-burgers which keep his name in the news , but do n't hurt him in the least . only anti-trump zealots will latch on to a story like this . the rest of us , not even just the trump supporters , will roll our eyes and stop paying attention . and that is the dangerous part of these types of stories . what are they masking ? did you hear about trump 's terrible picks for the federal reserve board ? or about how trump 's justice department settled the old irs tea party targetting lawsuits for peanuts ? ",
        "while this story played out , and trump was `` caught '' golfing by cnn , here 's some other stuff that happened : did the fbi conspire to stop trump ? ironically the fbi investigation into the trump russian collusion charges has done a 360 and now points to the democrats and fbi agents as the real criminal manipulators . but they are in too deep and have overplayed their hand . but how bad has this government gotten that this sort of corruption at the fbi is considered boring ? the fbi has long been a political tool of suppression . ",
        "police in china target bloggers and profile communities for dna collectionchina is a big red flag to the rest of the world on how not to govern . they intimate journalists and dissidents and monitor every aspect of their citizens ' lives . a `` social credit '' system has even started to score citizens based on things like patriotism and neighborliness . but melania approved a tree getting cut down , and that is just too fun an opportunity for the media to ignore ! it fits the scorched-earth-republican narrative too well . she also ordered all the tree 's progeny uprooted and burned . ",
        "as for the tree itself , she plans to fashion a throne , from which she will rule for a thousand years .   "
