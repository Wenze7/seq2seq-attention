        "every product here is independently selected by mashable journalists . if you buy something featured , we may earn an affiliate commission which helps support our work . patrisse cullors -- activist , advocate , community organizer , and co-founder of #blacklivesmatter -- wants to set the record straight : `` the story of black lives matter starts before black lives matter . the story of black lives matter , for me , starts with my childhood . `` since the monumental activist movement was created in 2012 by alicia garza , patrisse cullors , and opal tometi , black lives matter has called attention to systems that keep black communities oppressed , including mass incarceration and police violence . ",
        "the movement gained national attention as it protested the 2012 killing of trayvon martin by george zimmerman , and the 2014 killing of michael brown , and the 2014 killing of tamir rice . but it was n't just those incidents that inspired the rise of black lives matter . it was the instances of oppression that cullors witnessed as a child that brought about the movement . `` the story of black lives matter starts before black lives matter . the story of black lives matter , for me , starts with my childhood . '' `` the story of black lives matter , for me , starts with the very first raid i experienced as a 5 or 6 year old in van nuys , california . ",
        "black lives matter is in some ways the climax of my life , but it is n't the end all be all . i think it 's important for people to know that many of us have been fighting for a long time . i 'm 34 years old . i 've been in movement work since i was 16 years old . black lives matter becomes an important part of the story , but it 's not the only part of the story . `` and , the story that gets told about black lives matter is not always representative of the movement , says cullors . ",
        "some have gone as far to call black lives matter a terrorist organization , despite the fact that the movement is non-violent at its core . `` so many stories have been told about black lives matter , '' says cullors , speaking to the mashreads podcast . `` the beauty of building out a decentralized network , the beauty of building out something that 's a hashtag , is that so many people can take it and run with it . the bad part about that is so many folks can take it and run with it , and misuse it , and co-opt it . ",
        "as i was developing the story , i had to be reminded by other people : you get to tell your story too . you get to name what you 've seen and what you see is the next step of black lives matter . you 're a part of this movement , so you can lay claim to it . `` in her new book , when they call you a terrorist : a black lives matter memoir , cullors shares her side of the story . in fact , it 's a dual memoir , simultaneously documenting cullors ' own life and the challenges she faced growing up , as well as the founding of black lives matter . ",
        "this week on the mashreads podcast , we chat with cullors about her memoir . join us in the episode below . interview highlightsyou 've been a community organizer for so long . what inspired you to write this book now ? `` someone came to me in 2015 and said , ` it sounds like you have a book in you . ' and i was like , ` that sounds cute . ' i started to look into it , i started to do my own research . i wrote my initial outline about what i wanted to write about , and then i put it down . ",
        "i went back to the daily grind of community organizing . `` it was n't until i really started to see and feel the rise of white nationalism and the alt-right . i wanted to tell a different story about black lives matter , especially after we were called a terrorist organization . `` how do you revisit and write this whole book with the gravity of knowing recent history ? `` when you grow up with a significant amount of trauma , you are realizing it as you get older , and you 're realizing the ways you can recover from that trauma . ",
        "the things that i have witnessed and that i have been through , it 's going to take a life time to undo . and also , the things that i 've been through and witnessed shaped why i do activism , shaped why i do black lives matter . would i have preferred that my family did n't go through ? of course . but what you see in the book is that every time there is a tragedy in my life , i really do try to turn it into some kind of action point . it 's my way of healing . ",
        "and that 's how i operate . i am going to do my best to try to undo this thing that 's trying to tear my family apart . `` who are you writing for ? nobody wants to say `` my book is for . '' but i think it 's a little different when you 're doing advocacy and community organizing , where you are , hopefully , speaking directly to people to enact change . who would say you are writing to ? `` as i wrote this book and worked with asha on it , i really felt like this was for little black girls across the world , felt and had to hold the weight of their family and the struggle of their family on their shoulders , and had to survive it . ",
        "this is for young queer kids who are trying to navigate coming out and trying to figure out what our lives are about . this is for poor black folks who are struggling , who need some support and hope . `` then as always , we close the show with recommendations : patrisse recommends `` anything by octavia butler , especially her last book fledgling , which is about racist vampires . amazing . '' she also recommends marge piercy : `` she mixes sci-fi and political issues together . '' and she recommends the upcoming books eloquent rage : a black feminist discovers her superpower by brittany cooper , no ashes in the fire : coming of age black and free in america by darnell moore , and unapologetic : a black , queer and feminist mandate for our movement by charlene carruthers . ",
        "`` it 's the year of black lives books . `` matt recommends 13th , the ava duvernay documentary . `` it 's an hour and a half long but it took me three hours to watch because i kept pausing it , and i took 5 pages of notes throughout the entire thing . it 's incredible and if you have n't seen it yet , it 's not too late . '' he also recommends into each room we enter without knowing by charif shanahan . martha recommends drinking water and meal planning . `` it 's changed my life in the past two weeks . ",
        "it 's made me a lot more frugal and that 's my recommendation . `` mj recommends nic stone 's ya novel dear martin . `` it is so good . it broke my heart in so many ways . '' he also recommends reading martin luther king 's `` letter from a birmingham jail . ''   "
