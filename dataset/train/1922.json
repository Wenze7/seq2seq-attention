        "the afc had a wild finish in week 17 , as four teams were vying for the two wild card spots . not only did we see the buffalo bills clinch a playoff spot for the first time since 1999 , but we also saw several stars step up for their teams in clutch situations . it turns out , the three week 17 players of the week came from teams that had playoff implications . although philip rivers and the los angeles chargers missed out on a playoff spot , he threw for nearly 400 yards and three touchdowns . ",
        "while the chargers could n't clinch a playoff spot , the tennessee titans did because of their defense . as great as the titans ' pass rush was , safety kevin byard was the real game-changer on sunday . his two interceptions against blake bortles brought his season total up to eight , which caps off his fa ntastic regular season . the final member of this week 's awards was juju smith-schuster . he did n't just have over 140 receiving yards and a touchdown , smith-schuster had one of the best kickoff returns this season . it might come as a shock to see that type of burst , but let 's not forget the speed he flashed on his 97-yard touchdown against the detroit lions . ",
        "sure , there were other players that had fantastic performances in week 17 . however , these three individuals completely put themselves in a league of their own last sunday .   "
