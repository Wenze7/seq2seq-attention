        "north korea slammed fresh un sanctions imposed over its missile tests as an `` act of war '' on sunday , its first response to the latest diplomatic move to punish pyongyang 's ever-accelerating weapons drive . tension has been high on the flashpoint peninsula as the isolated but nuclear-armed regime has staged a series of atomic and intercontinental ballistic missile tests -- most recently on november 29 . the latest launch of the hwasong-15 icbm , seen capable of hitting all major us cities , further heightened global alarm over the rapid advance in the country 's weapons technology . ",
        "`` we fully reject the latest un sanctions ... as a violent breach of our republic 's sovereignty and an act of war that destroys the peace and stability of the korean peninsula and a wider region , '' pyongyang 's foreign ministry said in a statement carried by the state-run kcna news agency . pyongyang 's bellicose reply came a day after the un security council unanimously passed new , us-drafted sanctions that will restrict oil supplies vital for the impoverished state . the third raft of sanctions imposed on the north this year , sparked by last month 's icbm test , also received the backing of china -- the north 's sole major ally and economic lifeline . ",
        "the sanctions also order the repatriation of north korean workers sent abroad to earn much needed revenue for kim jong-un 's regime . the country 's weapons programmes have made significant progress since kim took power in 2011 . sanctions ` toothless ' the north has defended its missile and nuclear weapons programmes as measures for self-defense against `` hostile '' us policies towards pyongyang . and a defiant pyongyang vowed on sunday that the country would continue its weapons push `` more vigorously '' to `` form a balance of power with the us '' . `` if you think that those toothless ` sanctions ' could stop the victorious march of our people who have ... achieved the historic goal of building the national nuclear weapons , there would not be a bigger mistake than that , '' the foreign ministry said . ",
        "`` the us and its puppet followers should never forget the newly-upgraded status of our nation as a nation that could pose a real nuclear threat to the us mainland , '' it added . the north claimed last month that its icbm could deliver a `` super-large heavy warhead '' to anywhere in the us mainland . but experts believe that pyongyang has yet to develop the advanced technology to allow its rockets to survive re-entry into the earth 's atmosphere . the latest un sanctions were hailed by us president donald trump , who tweeted , `` the world wants peace , not death ! ",
        "`` trump and kim have traded threats of war and personal insults against each other in recent months , prompting fears of another conflict on the peninsula once devastated by the 1950-53 korean war . the resolution bans the supply of nearly 75 percent of refined oil products to the north , puts a cap on crude deliveries and orders all north koreans working abroad to be sent back by the end of 2019 . it also bans sales of all industrial machinery , trucks , iron , steel and other metals to the north and added 15 pyongyang officials to the un sanctions blacklist for global visa ban and assets freeze .
