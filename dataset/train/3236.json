        "a four-month-old baby left in the care of his godmother died despite frantic efforts to resuscitate him after he was left to sleep in a car seat with a milk bottle beside him . alexander ` alex ' masters had been left in the care of his godmother claire sawyer by his young mum at a flat in lincoln , an inquest has been told . the hearing at lincoln cathedral centre heard the godmother fell asleep , before waking around `` half an hour later '' to find he had rolled over in his car seat and had a blanket over his face . ",
        "the baby boy was found with milk in his lungs . a week-long inquest into his death started today , monday , january 15 , to establish how he died on october 3 , 2015 . the baby , from gainsborough , died at lincoln county hospital after desperate attempts were made to resuscitate him . biker killed in horrific crash with skoda on a46dr stuart hamilton , who carried out a post-mortem examination , told the inquest that the baby boy 's bottle was ` propped up in his car seat while he was sleeping ' . `` there is strong evidence that milk was inhaled into the lungs , '' he said . ",
        "`` do i think more likely or not that caused the death ? i have not reached that level of certainty . `` it is possible that aspiration of milk could have been fatal but i can not be certain on the balance of probabilities . `` it 's there but not necessarily lethal . `` i believe there are concerns about the position alexander was sleeping in , not of the death , and possibility of inhaling milk . so i ca n't say it was a cot death . i have to use the medical term of unascertained . ",
        "`` dr hamilton ruled out that it could have been sudden infant death . the inquest heard that there had been a `` very significant '' police investigation prior to the inquest , as well as lincolnshire county council being subject to a `` serious case review '' . adrian degnan from east midlands ambulance service had been one of the paramedics to arrive on the scene after a call that a baby had stopped breathing . he noticed a baby on the floor in what he described as a `` messy '' property . in evidence read out at the inquest , he said : `` when i looked at the baby , it appeared silenced . ",
        "his lips and ears were blue . his chest was n't moving and i drew the conclusion that he was having a cardiac arrest . `` i focused on the baby and blocked out everything else going on around me . i considered it effective cpr as the airways were flowing . `` a female was crying and said ` i fell asleep ' . `` at some point , she said he was in his car seat for about half an hour . she said ` when i woke up , i found him like that ' . ` he was a hero who made us proud ' -- heartbroken mum and dad speak after lincoln soldier dies `` she said she had picked the baby up and lots of vomit came out . ",
        "i asked ` are you the mum ? ' and she said ` i am his godparent ' . '' mr degnan made the decision to take alex to hospital after around two minutes at the flat and told claire to go with them in the ambulance . once at lincoln county hospital , he went to the relatives room where claire was `` absolutely hysterical '' , saying : `` they are going to kill me . i have killed their baby . '' mr degnan said he had to calm her down to obtain the baby 's name and date of birth and then had to calm her again to ask when she had fed alex. `` at this point , i told the resuscitation team what she had told me , '' said mr degnan . ",
        "`` the blanket was over his mouth but i ca n't remember who told me or when it was said . `` i was suspicious about the vomiting story as when i did cpr , no food or milk came out . `` the airway was smooth and the air seemed to move freely . '' david dauber , a paramedic for emas who arrived as the baby was carried to the ambulance on a stretcher , said alex was `` totally unresponsive and lifeless '' . inquest reveals mishap led to horrific fire which killed cyril , 89the inquest also heard that a group of friends had been attending the flat at the time of the tragic incident to meet with friend hayden bowskill , who claire had been staying with at the time . ",
        "friend richard pollard arrived at the lincoln flat and was met by mr bowskill who said : `` the baby is dead . `` claire was on her hands and knees screaming ` i 'm sorry , i 'm sorry ' . `` i would describe claire as a white female , 40-50 , and her face was a mess where her make-up had run from crying . she had no shoes on . '' he said the property was untidy and there was dog urine on the floor . richard 's wife , melanie pollard , also watched the tragic incident unfold on october 3 . ",
        "in evidence read out , mrs pollard said : `` claire was on the floor at the corner of the settee crying and screaming ` i 'm sorry , i 'm sorry ' . she said ` i woke up and the baby had rolled over ' . `` the baby was blue and not responding . he almost looked like a doll . `` richard also said claire had said to him ` i was on the sofa with the baby when i woke up and the baby had rolled over and was dead ' but i did n't hear this myself . '' ",
        "the inquest , which is being conducted by senior coroner for lincolnshire , stuart fisher , continues .   "
