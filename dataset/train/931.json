        "procter & gamble has paid a dividend in each of the last 127 fiscal years -- ever since the company 's birth in 1890 . its streak of yearly raises dates back 61 consecutive years , which is one of the longest track records of dividend growth in the stock market and gives p&g the status of a dividend aristocrat . p&g is set to report a big profit drop in the year ahead , and it might struggle with minor market-share losses in an overall weak industry . yet those challenges wo n't seriously threaten this dividend . in fact , income investors have every reason to expect a raise in 2018 that extends p&g 's streak to 62 years . ",
        "modest growth reboundafter announcing solid first-quarter results in late october , p&g is on pace to boost organic sales by about 2.5 % in the fiscal year that ends in august 2018 . that expansion rate is modest , and it implies continued , but slight , market share losses . still , it 's a better number than investors have witnessed in the recent past . organic sales rose by just 1 % in fiscal 2016 and by 2 % in fiscal 2017 , and so p&g appears to be in a slow , but steady , operating rebound . ",
        "p&g 's faring better than many of its rivals , too . kimberly clark , whose huggies diapers compete against p&g 's pampers brand , posted flat organic growth in its most recent quarter and is predicting near-zero sales gains for the full 2017 fiscal year . better earningsp & g 's reported earnings are on pace to dive by 27 % in fiscal 2018 due to a massive , one-time benefit that the company logged from selling a large chunk of its beauty product brands in the prior year . that divestment was part of a portfolio reboot plan that removed 100 slower-growing franchises from the business . ",
        "it also generated a temporary earnings spike , which p&g used mainly to fund increasing stock repurchase spending . after accounting for those portfolio divestment sales , investors can expect healthy growth this year that significantly outpaces revenue gains . after all , management is aggressively cutting costs and sees room to generate a further $ 10 billion of savings , which would double its cuts since 2012 . this initiative improved p&g 's already impressive profit margin , and it played a key role in protecting earnings even as sales growth slowed in recent years . how much of a dividend increase ? ",
        "executives are targeting core earnings growth of between 5 % and 7 % this year , up from 2017 's $ 3.92-per-share result . thus , p&g could afford to increase the dividend while still holding its payout ratio at an elevated , but not dangerous , 67 % of profits . income investors should n't count on a robust dividend increase in 2018 , though . p&g prioritizes financial flexibility , after all , which is the main reason why management has leaned heavily on stock buybacks as its primary capital return method . its last two annual dividend increases have been modest : a 3 % raise in 2017 and a 1 % uptick in 2016 . ",
        "those raises trailed the 5 % hike that kimberly clark gave its shareholders in each of those periods . ultimately , i would n't be surprised to see p&g 's 2018 dividend hike , typically announced in april , to come in somewhere between 3 % and 5 % . a modest increase like that would reflect the company 's continued market share struggles in a slow-growing industry while still rewarding investors as profitability improves .
