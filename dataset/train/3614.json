        "when we awaken each day , we do not implement ideas , we implement our existence ; our life . most likely , though , ideas begin marching around that gray matter within the perimeter of our skulls as we go through the morning motions in preparation for the new day 's activities . we humans are blessed with an immensely evolved mind that is trained to judge , color , measure and rate all of the happenings taking place around the sphere of our immediate physical selves . we do the same in speculation of the effects of decisions we make regarding taking actions , speaking words or what-have-you . ",
        "and all of this mental checking is based on ideas ; after all , one need have some point of references in order to function in such a manner . essentially , we learn to qualify and quantify life to the loss of actually living it ; experiencing it . how much is the value of our selves , the self-esteem -- if you will -- of ourselves based on ideas and benchmarks derived from sources not ourselves ? that is , sources of made-up yardsticks ? do we derive concepts of self-worth and value from inner feelings or outer roots ? ",
        "the genius loci of our western society -- at least -- is media . be it social media , print , tv , or news , it 's influence can not be denied and it is magnified with the speed of it all . as all of the input into our minds moves quicker and quicker , there 's little chance to notice life , you know , the one that lies under all of the information system domination . for vacations we often seek a week or so of liberation from all of the agitation inflicted upon our lives . ",
        "ideally we maybe envision a tropical paradise in the middle of nowhere with not wifi nor satellite connections . we want to escape it all because it 's not our `` real '' lives . instead , it feels like leaded vests we put on as our feet hit the floor in the morning weighing us down while we trudge along through the day 's demands . the trick , then , is how to be in touch with our true existence while functioning under the umbrella of the commotion and bedlam going on everywhere . we may be frightened to death if we could see all of the radio , wifi and other waves crisscrossing the air above and all around us . ",
        "meditation is a method that one may consider to reestablish contact with your `` true nature '' amidst the demands of modern daily living . one need not take a course nor study for years to meditate . sitting cross-legged or chanting ohm is not necessary . it 's not complicated and it may help to even drop the word meditation . call it your `` break '' or `` respite '' or word of your choosing . one may find this oasis by merely being still and just breathing . no special techniques , just breathe like you 've been doing since that first inhale in the delivery room . ",
        "recognize that you are simply plugging back in -- mentally -- to your simpler natural human existence . be careful not to be wondering if you 're `` doing it right '' and other habitual idea forming that we all seem to do . everything 's ideas , even this writer 's story which i thank-you for reading .
