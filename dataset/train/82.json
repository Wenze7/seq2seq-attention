        "for all the education i received in life , the really important ones are the ones i received the latest . all my life i was trained to prepare myself to perform on different stages , but without the foundation of self-awareness and other mental acuities needed to deal with real life situations . i learned it the hard way , through several personal and professional setbacks . a major part of my teenage and adult life was spent with an urge to control everything , and reacting emotionally when things did not happen my way . it clouded my judgment and my perception of reality . ",
        "it prevented me from taking ownership of and validating the correctness of my emotional reactions . everything in that world was black and white , a win or a loss , with an element of finalism or defeatism . it kept me from achieving my full potential personally and professionally . the biggest lesson that life finally gave me was the one that completely broke me into pieces , and then gently taught me to make myself whole again on a path of consistent peace , love , joy , kindness , and forgiveness -- towards myself and others , in all our current and previous versions . ",
        "if you are standing with a cup of hot tea and someone comes and scares you , what will you spill on yourself ? hot tea , of course . now , why did you spill the hot tea on yourself ? . . ... . the obvious , and wrong answer , is that because so-and-so came and scared me . the truth is that you spilled hot tea because you had hot tea in your cup . if you had water in your cup , you 'd have spilled water . if you had honey , probably nothing would have spilled out . ",
        "what is in your cup is what spills out . it has nothing to do with who scared you , but what you have in your cup . the one who `` scared '' you probably did not intend that you get scared and burn yourself with hot tea . when life shakes you up , what spills out is what 's inside you . if you have anger , insecurity , worry , doubt , anxiety , pride , and fear inside , that is what comes out . you can try to manage it for a while but if you do not learn , there will come a shake that leaves you utterly to its mercy , naked and vulnerable . ",
        "what is good is that it is an opportunity life gives you to become aware of the unhelpful things inside you , and empty yourself of them . the honey in your cup will not taste quite as sweet if there is still some espresso in it ! you can then fill yourself with pure love , joy , peace , happiness , confidence , kindness , forgiveness , trust , and security . practice this everyday for the rest of your days , and you will be rewarded with a cup that is always full of beautiful things and brimming over on its own . ",
        "like a newborn you will be birthed again , molded by and yet free from your past . you will learn to truly build and sustain all kinds of deeply meaningful relationships in different dimensions , and to always give without ever expecting anything . what you practice every day is what you become really good at . what are you making yourself really good at ? what are you spilling onto yourself and others ?
