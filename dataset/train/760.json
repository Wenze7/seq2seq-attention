",
        "`` diversity offers organisations a wide range of benefits , and our analysis shows that having a more heterogeneous team can deliver measurable gains in innovation and financial performance , '' said roc√≠o lorenzo , coauthor of the report at boston consulting group . `` multifaceted teams offer a robust range of perspectives , and this allows organisations to formulate strategic solutions that can help them efficiently accomplish their goals , overcome challenges , and bring new ideas to the table . '' the study also found small changes in recruitment including targeting new hires from different industries could boost a company 's revenue from new products and services alone by 1 per cent . ",
        "only 40 per cent of businesses said they currently have leadership that is receptive to diversity and an open-minded working culture . a study in august found that a lack of diversity in the uk 's top boardrooms could harm the country 's ability to do deals after brexit , with the ftse 100 's most senior managers less ethnical diversity last year than in 2014 .
