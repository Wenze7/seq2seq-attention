        "over the holidays the washington post interrupted the good cheer to bring us `` a preview of a u. s. without pensions . '' peter whoriskey tells the story of 998 people who lost pension benefits when mcdonnell douglas closed a plant in tulsa , oklahoma , in 1994 . it 's a story that features bankruptcies , lost homes and long-deferred retirements . it 's compelling , it 's sad , and it 's not a useful guide to the future of american retirement . it is part of a journalistic genre that laments the decline of the traditional defined-benefit pension and the rise of defined-contribution plans such as 401s . ",
        "if you want to write an article in that genre , there are four rules that appear to be obligatory . first , gloss over how rare defined-benefit pensions really were . even at the mid-1970s peak of defined-benefit plans , fewer than 40 percent of private-sector workers had them . today , decades after the shift to 401s began , 61 percent of private-sector workers are participating in a retirement plan . the percentage of all workers vested in any kind of retirement plan has risen from 24 in 1979 to 43 in 2012 . second , ignore the advantages that 401s have over the old defined-benefit plans -- even when the risks and flaws of the latter are staring you in the face . ",
        "referring to the mcdonnell douglas workers , whoriskey writes , `` because their pension benefits accrued most quickly near retirement age , the pensions they receive are only a small fraction of what they would have had they worked until full eligibility . '' in defined-benefit plans , benefits typically depend both on years worked and final salary . if you lose your job in your 40s , that structure works against you . the connection the post fails to make is that these workers might well have been better off if the shift toward 401s had happened decades earlier . ",
        "third , rely on misleading numbers that suggest we are in a `` retirement crisis . '' almost half of families have no defined-contribution retirement accounts , the post says . that 's true , but we 're still making the transition away from defined-benefit accounts . count all retirement plans , defined-benefit and defined-contribution , and nearly three-quarters of near-retirees have them . fourth , never look at data on how retirees are doing overall and how their condition has changed over time , no matter how relevant this information would seem to be to your overall story . ",
        "the median senior household of 2013 had an income one-third higher than the median senior household of 1989 , even after adjusting for inflation . breaking these rules should n't lead you to conclude that our retirement system is perfect . some people ought to be saving more , and some policies need to be changed . too many workers , particularly low-income workers , do not have access to 401 plans ; it might make sense to let them save money in the thrift savings program for federal employees , as senator marco rubio has proposed . social security should be reformed so that it does less to suppress saving and more to protect the elderly from poverty . ",
        "a guaranteed minimum benefit above the poverty level could be more than paid for by reducing the growth of benefits for high-earners , and lower payroll taxes on older employees can encourage longer working lives . these are changes that would build on , rather than attempt to reverse , the last few decades of developments in the american retirement system . those developments , especially the rise of the 401 , have largely been for the better . thanks to them , the future of retirement is not going to look like the old age of those mcdonnell douglas workers .
