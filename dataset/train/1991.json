        "i hate when days go by and i 'm just flowing . what i mean by flowing is : instead of being present , i end up getting caught up with replying to messages , jumping from email to email , going here and there , not listening in class . wherever i am , my mind is wandering somewhere else . the evening comes , i got to bed , and i ca n't remember how the day went by . what did i do ? what did i give ? what did i achieve ? not sure . ",
        "one of my favorite things to do when i go to a yoga class is set an intention , at the very beginning of the session . for that intention to be relevant and to serve me , i have to scan through my mind and body to identify : laila , what do i need today ? am i feeling tired , thus i need calm and relaxation ? am i full of energy , so i crave to challenge and to push myself ? am i angry at myself for some reason , and i long for some compassion and kindness ? ",
        "as i pin down what i need at that specific moment , i pick one or a combination of words that translate that . acceptance . persistance . kindness . challenge . push . whatever it is , i print it in my mind and make the conscious effort to regularly come back to it . that simply means thinking about it periodically , both when the practice gets tough , and when it feels great . either to remind myself of my intention as i drift away from that moment . or to feel gratitude towards myself for honoring my wish . ",
        "it always makes my practice different when i do . by the end of the class , i 'm able to assess if i managed to be present to my intention , and i feel immense gratitude towards myself when i have , sometimes to the tears . what if i did n't ? that 's my occasion to practice to not beat myself up , and show compassion when i know i did my best . so , i wondered : what would happen if i did the same in my every day life ? i decided to start setting an intention for each day . ",
        "i start the day reflecting on what i think i 'll need . how am i feeling today ? what is it that will help me go through the day ? what is it that will make this day amazing ? is it more love ? more gratitude ? more focus ? more productivity ? or maybe less . less commitment . less hustle . less thinking . maybe i 've been fidgeting from the moment i woke up , and need some calm and grounding . whatever it is , i decide on it , write it down , and keep repeating it in my mind for the rest of the day , like a mantra . ",
        "that does n't mean i think about it every second of the day . but with the conscious commitment to come back to it , by merely thinking `` remember , today , my intention is to be kind '' , it gives me an anchor for the day . it creates a default state that helps me overcome challenges as they arise , or simply enjoy my day in a much fuller and present way . my intent this year is to make every day count . to feel like i was actually present while each day went by . ",
        "so , i hope this little practice will help me in this personal commitment . i have the intuition it will .   "
