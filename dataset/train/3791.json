        "from thrillers to audiobooks and polemic non-fiction , here 's what you should get your teeth into this month : non-fiction : killjoys by christopher snowdon even the name of this polemic book from the iea 's christopher snowdon is gearing up for a fight . in killjoys , he goes after paternalists hard , and with ruthless logic , systematically breaking down their justifications for controlling public consumption of tobacco , alcohol and unhealthy foods . he deals fairly with opponents , assessing a spectrum of paternalism from the softer `` nudge theory '' of richard thaler and cass sunstein to sarah conly and her hardline ` against autonomy ' stance . ",
        "it is a short read , but neatly packs in the basic economic and philosophical reasons for deregulation , while debunking some common myths along the way . snowdon 's argument is simple : people should be left to do what they want as long as they are not hurting anyone else . the government should not interfere on the grounds that it knows better . his argument relies heavily on john stuart mill 's harm principle , but this does not weaken it , given that even the most hardline proponents of paternalism attempt to justify their ideas under the same principle . ",
        "here is a book that will always be topical , given how frequently the debate is reignited ; the sugar tax , plain packaging , meat consumption and alcohol duty were all headline issues in 2017 . it will perhaps be more interesting to those not already converted to snowdon 's point of view . the book has a natural audience of free marketeers , yet for anyone on the fence or generally incognisant of the issues at hand , it offers something more by encouraging a new view of policymaking . this exercise in critical thinking is well worth the slice of your time that it takes to read it .
