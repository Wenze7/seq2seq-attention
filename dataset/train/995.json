        "the house on wednesday voted to stop an effort by some democrats to impeach donald trump . a total of 58 democrats voted to move forward on articles of impeachment brought by congressman al green , a democrat of texas . another four voted `` present '' , a vote indicating neither for nor against . in his resolution , green said trump 's `` association '' with white nationalism , neo-nazism and his incitement of hatred and hostility was evidence that he was not fit to occupy the oval office . the resolution did not make reference to the russia inquiry . ",
        "`` i have a low tolerance for bigotry , '' green said in an interview after the vote . `` i do n't think that obstruction of justice is more important to this country than racism , xenophobia , the hatred and the ugly behavior that 's coming from the white house . i think that we have for too long put hatred on the back burner . '' in the resolution , the congressman specifically referenced : trump 's comments after the deadly violence in charlottesville , when the president drew an equivalence between neo-nazi demonstrators and liberal protesters ; his decision last week to share three anti-muslim videos posted by the deputy leader of a british far-right group ; and a list of statements he has made denigrating groups and individuals , including nfl players and congresswoman frederica wilson . ",
        "wilson , who voted for the resolution , said `` it felt sort of surreal '' to be mentioned by name and that she was surprised to be included . green took the setback in stride , calling it a `` step '' in a long , protracted process . he said he was already drafting additional articles of impeachment but had not made a decision on when he will bring those forward . the texas democrat said that he is grateful to his colleagues who voted against the motion and in favor of moving the resolution forward . asked if he knew in advance that so many democrats would support the resolution , green said he was equally surprised by the number of democrats who did not . ",
        "`` i did n't have an indication that so many democrats were going to vote for it , '' greens said . democratic leaders have for months sought to temper calls for trump 's impeachment , arguing that the move would be premature given the continuing investigations into his campaign and administration led by congressional committees and the special counsel robert mueller . in a statement before the vote , the house democratic leader , nancy pelosi , and house democratic whip , steny hoyer , made that case . `` this president has made statements and taken actions that are beyond the pale for most americans , embracing those who espouse hatred and division while promoting policies that would harm our economy and undermine our national security , '' the democrats said . ",
        "`` legitimate questions have been raised about his fitness to lead this nation . right now , congressional committees continue to be deeply engaged in investigations into the president 's actions both before and after his inauguration . the special counsel 's investigation is moving forward as well , and those inquiries should be allowed to continue . `` now is not the time to consider articles of impeachment . '' however , the no 3 democrat in the house , jim clyburn of south carolina , voted to advance the impeachment process , as did a number of other prominent figures including keith ellison , the vice-chair of the dnc . ",
        "wilson told the guardian that a different impeachment resolution that mentioned russia and trump 's other legal issues would likely garner more support in the future . the constitution of the united states provides that `` the president , vice-president and all civil officers of the united states , shall be removed from office on impeachment for , and conviction of , treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors . '' impeachment requires a simple majority vote of the house and then the senate serves as a jury to hear the case with a two-thirds vote required for removal from office . ",
        "only two presidents have ever been impeached : andrew johnson and bill clinton . however , neither were convicted by the senate . richard nixon resigned before the house of representatives could vote on impeachment resolutions . nineteen elected officials in total have been impeached in american history and only eight have been convicted . this article originally appeared on the guardian .
