        "testimony began tuesday morning in the murder trial of a man accused in the slaying nearly three years ago of another man who was shot to death on the west side and left in a ditch called `` hell 's gate . '' robert martinez was 21 when he was charged with fatally shooting steven cerna , 19 , in february 2015 . police investigating a report of a shooting found cerna 's body around 8 a. m. feb. . 20 , 2015 in a ditch in the 1100 block of shadwell drive . at the time of the shooting , neighbors told san antonio police that young men and teens used the ditch to hang out and drink , smoke and tag nearby businesses . ",
        "patricia cerna , the victim 's mother , testified that her son suffered from mental illness , had few friends and mostly stayed home , but left the home around 3 a. m. with two men , including the defendant . `` he never came home , '' she told the jury . she said she had a bad feeling about him leaving the house , but he went anyway . she tried to report him as missing but was told she had to wait 24 hours . she said she found out her son had been killed when the medical examiner called her . ",
        "about a month after the killing , police released a photograph of martinez and asked for help from the public to locate the man . however they did not release his name at the time , and police continued to gather leads in the case for nearly two years . martinez , now 22 , was arrested june 7 , 2017 , after a witness told police that martinez and others had plotted to kill cerna by luring him to `` hell 's gate '' to buy drugs , according to an arrest warrant affidavit released at the time . ",
        "prosecutors said cerna was shot over a gang shooting in which he had no involvement . the defense contends that martinez did not kill cerna and that witnesses could not place him at the scene . the case is being heard in the 290th state district court , presided by judge melisa skinner . if convicted , martinez faces up to life in prison . elizabeth zavala is a san antonio express-news staff writer . read more of her stories here . | ezavala@express-news . net | @elizabeth2863 .
