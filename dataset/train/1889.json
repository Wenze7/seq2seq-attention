        "the crown . something we all know about : regal institution ; glittery gem-encrusted headpiece ; netflix drama . but the funny thing is we do n't really . the object we recognise is the imperial state crown - all brilliant-cut diamonds and stonking sapphires - which the queen wears for the state opening of parliament . but this is just a stand-in . the crown with which she was invested by the archbishop of canterbury in 1953 is another object altogether and one most people would struggle to sketch . even the queen herself , reunited with the crown in a new bbc documentary to be shown this month , eyes it unfamiliarly , unsure - like the archbishop at her father 's coronation - which way round it goes . ",
        "the coronation crown , or st edward 's crown , as it is properly called , is used only for the act of coronation . so for the past 65 years it has gone unworn , locked up safely in the jewel house at the tower of london . its story is as fascinating as any bafta winner . the puritans who defeated charles i in the civil war had gleefully disposed of the original medieval regalia : selling gems to the highest bidder and dropping the gold frames into the melting points of the mint to be recast as coins . ",
        "charles ii found the jewel house empty . the queen wearing the st edward 's crown at her coronation in 1953 credit : pa wirest edward 's crown , the same object used for the queen 's coronation in 1953 , was made for his coronation in 1661 , named after the saint-king edward the confessor . the occasion was a sensation , the new regalia representing not just a new reign but the return of monarchy itself . samuel pepys watched it from a vertiginous bank of seating in the north transept of westminster abbey and was ` sure never to see the like again in this world ' .

        "colonel blood , disguised as a vicar , stabbed the keeper of the jewel house in the stomach , shoved st edward 's crown under his cloak and made a run for itthose not on the guest list in 1661 had the option of queuing up afterwards to see the crown at the tower of london , and it was during one such viewing , ten years later , that the only attempt to steal the crown jewels was made . the aptly-named colonel blood buttered up the keeper of the jewel house over successive visits to the tower , disguised as a vicar . ",
        "choosing his moment , blood stabbed the keeper in the stomach , shoved st edward 's crown under his cloak and made a run for it . more by luck than tight security , blood was brought down on the banks of the thames before he could get away . the crown was reported to be ` bruised ' and needed Â£ 145 worth of repairs . perhaps more undignified even than being stolen was the fate of st edward 's crown in the georgian era , when it was simply ignored . the diamond-mad georgians were unimpressed by its simple solid-gold frame which had been designed to imitate the medieval crowns melted down in 1649 . ",
        "the queen 's most spectacular jewellerygeorge ii did n't bother with st edward 's crown at all , and for almost 200 years it was passed over . but come the edwardian era and a new enthusiasm for royal ceremonies , the very antiquity of the crown - and indeed its name - brought it back to the fore and it regained its place as the coronation crown of the english monarchy , used to crown george vi in 1937 and then elizabeth ii 16 years later . but while st edward 's crown is today a gleaming expression of the solidity and continuity of the monarchy , it is also a reminder that things were n't always thus .
