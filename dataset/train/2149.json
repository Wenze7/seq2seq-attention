        "following the release of her breathless independent 2016 mixtape cross your heart and closing out last year with the christmas single `` tropical holiday , '' pop singer liz returns with one of two offerings , premiering the doe-eyed `` could u love me '' on billboard . com in double a-side tandem with the wave racer-produced `` queen of me . `` the los angeles-based artist , previously known as the first lady of diplo 's mad decent imprint , teams with producers arnold and hoodboi for `` could u love me , '' a confessional of sorts that liz describes as a `` vulnerable ` my boo ' '' where she coos over a pattering , supple instrumental . '' ",
        "` could u love me ' is one of the most vulnerable songs i 've ever written , '' says liz , who in the past has collaborated with artists including zedd , diplo and , most recently , rytmeklubben on the single `` no apologies . '' `` in the lyrics , i 'm unapologetically questioning someone if they will not only accept my flaws , but , love me for them . sometimes , i 'll sabotage a relationship because i 'm afraid that the person wo n't like me anymore when they find out i 'm not as ` cool ' as they probably think i am . ",
        "i can be reckless , moody , insecure , jealous and not feel so great about myself sometimes , so , this song is my letter to the person i 'm falling for ; a moment of letting down my guard where i 'm asking for forgiveness and mercy in a sweet way . i think everyone will be able to relate to the sentiment . i also love that we were able to give the production a mid-tempo miami bass vibe you can still dance to . `` the release of `` could u love me '' and `` queen of me '' arrives in anticipation of liz 's forthcoming new music , counting recent sessions with sarah hudson and jesse saint john .
