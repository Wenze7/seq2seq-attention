        "tax proposal imperils minnesota seniors st. paul , minn. . -- the final version of the republican tax bill that congress is expected to decide next week may mean a $ 25 billion cut to medicare in 2018 alone . that 's because at the end of each calendar year , the office of management and budget must cut spending programs to offset any increase in the deficit -- a process known as paygo . erin parrish , associate state director for advocacy and outreach at aarp minnesota , says cuts like that are likely to affect access to health care across the board . ",
        "`` these cuts would be to reimbursement payments to providers like doctors and hospitals , '' she explains . `` certain doctors may stop accepting medicare patients at a time when the medicare population is growing by 10,000 new beneficiaries each day . `` the only way to stop the cuts is with special legislation known as a waiver . aarp is urging members to call their members of congress and make sure they vote to waive cuts to medicare . the tax bill also could disproportionately affect seniors because it may eliminate the medical expense tax deduction . paygo means other cuts also are likely to programs that may indirectly affect seniors -- programs such as student loan reimbursement , farm subsidies and the unemployment trust fund . ",
        "but parrish says cuts at the federal level mean states will have to pick up the slack , and that 's just passing the buck . `` you know , we 're an aging population and we need to make sure that services and programs are there to support our older americans , '' she stresses . parrish says because minnesota third district rep. erik paulsen is on the ways and means committee , he will be particularly influential in talks about tax reform and the medicare waiver . play daily newscasts .
