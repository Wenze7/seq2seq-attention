        "the hoodie-wearing `` hero '' caught on video rescuing a rabbit from the california wildfires may have actually made things worse for the poor critter . a hare-raising video captured a man rescuing a rabbit from ... local animal experts warn that any wildlife spotted near a blaze should be left alone -- especially desert cottontails like the ones common to southern california . this is due to the fact that they are still giving birth to litters around this time of year and are typically keeping them safe underground in their burrows , according to live science . so in reality , while the video of the rabbit rescue is heartwarming , some say it should really serve as an example of what not to do when you spot an animal near the flames .

        "`` if you encounter a wild animal in our neighborhood , leave it alone , '' california fish and wildlife spokesperson peter tira told sfgate back in october as wildfires were raging in northern california . `` fire or no fire , just let the animals be , '' he said . the comments were in response to a facebook post going around at the time asking local residents to provide water and shelter for any wildlife that shows up in their yards . `` fire is something animals have to deal with constantly , '' tira explained . furthermore , cottontails and other desert creatures are known to regularly run near the flames of a wildfire -- to find areas where they can pass through safely , live science reports .

        "researcher e. v. komarek discovered this in the 1960s while documenting animal behavior during wildfires . `` frequently , we have seen cotton rats run across the line of fire , apparently finding a weak spot in it , and return to the smoking burn without injury , '' komarek wrote in a 1969 paper , `` fire and animal behavior . '' according to the us forest service , wildfires actually tend to kill very few animals -- with most going underground to protect themselves . komarek did note , though , that `` under certain circumstances , in certain types of cover , they are occasionally singed or killed .
