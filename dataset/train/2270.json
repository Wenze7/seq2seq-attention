        "time off of work can be very illuminating and helpful in uncovering patterns that can improve your natural work schedule . have you noticed how you naturally fall into patterns that work well for you when you do n't have to be in an office everyday at 9 am ? when you do n't have to adhere to a strict schedule ? by patterns i mean , what you choose to do and when and how these choices start to design your day , everyday . i 've noticed that while on holiday , i still get up early but in the morning , i replace going to work with reading and or writing or some other creative opportunity -- given all the time in the world , this becomes my natural pattern . ",
        "they become patterns because they work for me and help me achieve my goals in a natural format . they help me reach peak performance . peak performance requires an uninterrupted block of time , in an environment where i can focus , at a time during they day when i 'm most creative . peak performance and 80/20 rulea nice companion concept to keep in mind when it comes to quality output is the 80/20 rule or `` pareto principle . '' this rule suggests that 20 percent of your activities will account for 80 percent of your results . ",
        "if we can consistently reach our 20 % , it will help us reach peak performance . i look at these concepts through the lens of being a designer , a maker . i believe the biggest problem in today 's workplace is , as makers and because we do not control our environment , our environment controls us : we do not get to focus enough on the 20 % . it 's extremely difficult to reach peak performancepossibly the most important aspect to peak performance is when it happens . the first 90 minutes rule `` the basic principle of the first 90 minutes rule is to start your day by spending the first 90 minutes on your most important task . ",
        "'' `` you are most productive in the morning . you 're fresh and focused in the morning , even if you do n't feel it . your best work happens within a short time span of the day . and you should be making the most of it . your productive morning should be spent on outputs , not inputs . '' according to this , a good portion of my first 90 minutes is commuting to work . the rest is spent greeting co-workers , catching up with people and reading and responding to slack messages and email . ",
        "i can fit in a trip to the gym in the morning but i only go in the morning because this time works best for me , inside of a traditional workday . since i go to the gym in the morning , it becomes my most important task . this often times drains me of creative energy ; my number one asset . by the time i actually sit down to work , the window of time where i 'm most creative is over and it 's an uphill battle for the rest of the day . being mindful of people 's time and etiquette around scheduling meetings is a must , but these issues still exist because we 're trying to solve them in the construct of a traditional 9 -- 5 schedule . ",
        "this is where things break and they break quickly . designing a day for outputscompanies need to come to grips with the fact that not all employees are well suited for a traditional work schedule . to get the most out of your employees , we need to understand that different people need different things . we need to understand how designers , engineers , product/project managers , etc. . can reach peak performance : i believe companies need to radically depart from tradition , from what makes them `` comfortable '' and focus on what works . figuring out how a group can work together , physically in the same room when they need to is important , but secondary to understanding the individual needs of people and how each person can reach peak performance . ",
        "peak performance is where true productivity , `` magic '' happens . my perfect dayi 've worked full-time in an office for the past year and a half . this was preceded by almost six years of working for myself . these two stark contrasts have really illuminated what works for me and what does n't , in terms of scheduling , productivity and creativity . there are other things that are important to me , that are unrelated to work but indirectly make me better at my job : meditation and exercise . so when i think of designing my day around optimizing for outputs and peak performance , i take these things into consideration . ",
        "this is my perfect day . 6a : get up , drink the coffee6 : 15a : meditate6 : 45a : start working 10:15 a : leave for gym11 -- 12:45 : gym then lunch1p : arrive at work5p : leave workthat 's a solid 7.5 workday , optimized for peak performance . i 've put all of my best , creative energy into work -- for 3.5 hours . i believe many of you share in the idea that 3 or so hours of uninterrupted work at your peak performance time is better than eight hours spent in an office , where you have less control over your schedule . ",
        "research suggests that many people work about three hours in an eight hour workday anyway . ron friedman , ph. d. , and author of the best place to work , on how to structure your day to get the most done says that the first three hours of your day are your most precious for maximized productivity . `` typically , we have a window of about three hours where we 're really , really focused . we 're able to have some strong contributions in terms of planning , in terms of thinking , in terms of speaking well , '' -- ron friedmanbut we 're a startup ... if you 're thinking that this wo n't work in your startup , why ? ",
        "of any type of company , employee performance and productivity is most important in a startup . time is not on your side when you 're a startup . if you feel like your team has to be together for eight hours out of the day , you 're either having too many meetings or having people in the office makes you feel like you have a sense of control . from the schedule above , your team still has a full four hours to spend together doing whatever ! four hours is starting to sound like a lot , maybe it 's too much . ",
        ": -rrb- what now ? pay attention to your own habits and find your peak performance time . think about -- if you could structure your perfect day what would it look like . test it out and remember that you do n't get what you do n't ask for . would love to hear your thoughts -- leave a comment and or talk to me on twitter : lot of people write about the benefits of a morning routine and getting into a peak state .
