        "cortina d'ampezzo , italy -- sofia goggia of italy won a world cup downhill on home snow friday after lindsey vonn made a major mistake . vonn was faster than goggia midway down the olympia delle tofane course but had trouble landing a jump and slammed on the brakes to clear the next gate . `` the hill was really good today but obviously the light was not great , '' vonn said of the overcast conditions . `` one little bump caught my ski and i almost crashed . `` goggia finished 0.47 seconds ahead of vonn in second . ",
        "`` after my ski performance i was not happy , but it lasted and lindsey made that mistake , '' goggia said . `` if that does n't happen she probably wins with a big advantage . `` it was the fourth victory of goggia 's career and second straight after also winning a downhill in bad kleinkirchheim , austria , last weekend . overall world cup leader mikaela shiffrin finished third , 0.84 behind , in her first attempt at the cortina downhill . shiffrin holds a massive 871-point lead ahead of goggia in the overall standings , while goggia leads shiffrin by 49 points in the downhill rankings . ",
        "julia mancuso , another american standout , announced her retirement and bid the circuit goodbye by wearing a wonder woman suit during a casual run . slowed by worsening hip problems in recent seasons , mancuso failed to qualify for next month 's pyeongchang olympics . mancuso will be remembered for her record at big events , having won four medals at olympics and five at world championships , despite having a small frame for a ski racer . `` in ski racing , for me it was always about having fun , '' mancuso said . `` and when i had fun success followed . ",
        "... i hope my career can inspire others to just have fun , especially as an underdog . `` in the finish area , teammates sprayed mancuso with champagne . friday 's race was originally scheduled for val d'isere last month but was moved from the french resort because of poor conditions . another downhill is scheduled for saturday , followed by a super-g on sunday .
