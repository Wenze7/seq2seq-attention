        "marseille - what have sophia loren , john cleese and woody allen got in common ? they all began their careers in the oft-derided world of photo comics or photonovels . the genre , infamous for stilted storylines and sugary romantic melodramas , is finally getting its day in the sun in a major museum retrospective in france . the lingering kisses and frozen horrified looks that were the bread and butter of photo comic stories now seem irredeemably kitsch . but in strait-laced postwar europe they were lapped up by millions even after the dawn of television -- sparking moral panic and condemnation by both the pope and communist leaders . ",
        "well into the 1960s one in three french people were avid readers , according to the curators of the `` roman-photo '' exhibition at the mucem museum in marseille , which claims to be the first definitive look at a genre `` that has rarely attracted the attention of historians '' . indeed many of the people who created photo comics were so scornful of them that they left very little behind for posterity . yet `` photonovels were one of the biggest pop cultural successes of the 20th century , '' said co-curator frederique deschamps , `` modern fairy tales filled with cars , fridges , record players and other objects that symbolise modernity , romance and desire . ",
        "`` from their birth in italy in 1947 , photo comics reflected changing moral values and fed the slow rise of feminism with stories about touchy and taboo subjects like `` divorce , abortion and women 's rights at work '' , said her co-curator marie-charlotte calafat . - ` opium of female masses ' - `` they do not deserve their retrograde reputation at all , '' she added , `` it 's the reverse actually . `` instead they were real barometers of the `` aspirations of society with storylines where women questioned their place , '' calafat insisted . ",
        "so much so that even the reforming pope john xxiii denounced them in 1959 , prompting one liberal catholic weekly to call them `` the opium of the female masses '' . a lobby group made up of french communists , christian intellectuals and some feminists also famously branded them `` infantile magazines that undermine morality and break up families '' . eventually though even the church gave in and began using photonovels to recount the lives of the saints . the genre soon spawned imitators in britain and the us , where the satirical magazine help ! called on the budding comic and acting talents of woody allen , john cleese and fellow monty python member terry gilliam . ",
        "photo comics also featured in national lampoon as `` photo funnies '' , with americans borrowing the italian word `` fumetti '' for the genre , meaning speech bubble . - sex and schlock horror - but as the 1960s wore on and tv became increasingly dominant , sales began to wane , pushing publishers to ape hollywood and up the sex and shock factors . a large part of the marseille show is dedicated to killing , a sadistic italian photo comic character who stole from other criminals and took particular pleasure from torturing scantily-clad women . the french version of the series , satanik , was banned after 19 issues in 1967 , but the brutal anti-hero -- who wore a skeleton costume -- spawned a bootleg turkish version called kilink that featured in several cult films , borrowing liberally from french and italian pulp movies `` fantomas '' and `` kriminal '' . ",
        "but it was pornography that gave photo comics their longest and most lucrative afterlife in such bestselling top-shelf magazines as the italian fotosex . the british tabloid the sun still uses photo strips to illustrate its dear deidre problem page , which inevitably turns on sexual dilemmas or titillating situations . and photo comics continue to be widely used for health education worldwide . putting the exhibition together , however , was not an easy task . curator deschamps said she began her interest in the genre after finding a stack of the french magazine nous deux in a skip . ",
        "as she dug deeper into the subject she discovered that the originals of most of the massively selling magazines had also been confined to the dustbin of history , leaving researchers with little to go on . without chancing upon thousands of negatives of original photos in the archives of the mondadori publishing house in milan , she said they would not have been able to stage the show . the exhibition runs at mucem , marseille , until april 23 , 2018 .
