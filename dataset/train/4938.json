        "wag ! is a popular dog walking app that has been described as the `` uber of dog walking . '' within minutes while you 're away , you can schedule for a walker to come to your apartment and take your dog out for a walk for 30 to 60 minutes . while on a walk , the dog walker then sends notifications through the app to the owner at given points during the walk : when the walker arrives at the apartment , checks the leash , when the dog poops and pees , and when the dog is returned to the apartment . ",
        "however , as a user of the app , i 've come up with some helpful improvements so the dog owner can have an even fuller idea of how their dog 's walk is going . here are some helpful additions to improve the app and better inform dog owners . a `` dog walker miraculously put on dogs leash '' pin . in this scenario , the owner would get a notification saying `` the dog walker has miraculously put on your dog 's leash ! '' with a pin that depicts the praise hands emoji . image : shelby slauerwhile the app does offer a feature that allows walkers to notify the owner that they 've double checked their leash , this extra step would show that the walker was miraculously able to contain the dog in one corner of the apartment and put on his leash . ",
        "a `` dog almost runs into traffic '' pin . for this one , the owner gets a notification that says , `` oh jeez , your dog almost just ran into traffic ! '' with a pin that depicts their dog , but dead . image : shelby slauerthis pin would be helpful for right after the enormous dog the walker is guiding suddenly decides it wants to bolt across the street into busy traffic when there 's no walk signal . a `` dog walker gags from picking up poop '' pin . the owner would receive a notification that says , `` yikes , your dog 's poop almost made the walker vomit ! '' ",
        "with a pin that depicts vomit . image : shelby slauerwhile there 's already a pin for when the dog goes number two , this pin would notify the owner that the walker came very close to throwing up but somehow managed to just gag a lot while throwing it away . a picture of the dog walker at the end of the walk to show how much they sweat . the owner would get a notification that says , `` gross , the walker started sweating about halfway into the walk and has n't stopped yet ! '' with a pin that depicts sweat . ",
        "image : shelby slauerthe wag ! app requires that the walker take a picture of the dog at the end of the walk , but my improvement would require that the walker also takes a picture of themselves after the walk , so the owner can see that they were dragged on a two-mile jog in the rain but also somehow their sweat is visible . a `` dog walker walks home sore after being dragged around for 60 minutes '' pin . this will notify the owner that the walker is now going to walk home sore after their strenuous journey , with a pin that says , `` um , ow . ",
        "`` image : shelby slauerthis new feature would notify the wag ! dog owner that the walker is now going to walk home , sore and wet . a notification that the walker has quit dog walking because of your dog . this notification reminds the owner to tip . image : shelby slauerthis notification is pretty straight forward . it lets the owner know that because of their dog , the walker has quit working for wag ! and is all the better for it . with these notifications , wag ! walkers and owners will experience a better , more accurate interaction .
