        "a new web-based application from the university of nebraska-lincoln will allow the state 's wildlife managers to examine how virtually manipulating land cover in a region could affect pheasant populations -- and how much such efforts might cost . though the pheasant habitat simulator was created to help the nebraska game and parks commission bridge the gap between game-bird habitat research and land management for the species , lyndsie wszola and her colleagues built it as an open-source app . as long as researchers know the relationship between their question of interest and land cover , they can replace the pertinent bits of code to create a new web application suited to their needs -- examining links between cropping practices and nitrates , for example , or the emerald ash borer and its spread among urban trees . ",
        "`` this is not just a pheasant app , '' said wszola , research associate with the nebraska cooperative fish and wildlife research unit in the school of natural resources at nebraska . `` it is a framework . because it 's open-source , we 're interested in seeing people use it in new ways . we want to see how it grows and progresses . `` the application came out of a request by the nebraska game and parks commission to create an easy-to-use , localized and efficient tool to help manage pheasants . scientists with the cooperative had previously provided the commission with a thematic nebraska map showing the state on a color gradient : red for areas with better pheasant habitat and blue for areas with poorer habitat . ",
        "the map was instrumental in the development of the berggren plan for pheasants and was used to predict what might happen to pheasants under future land-cover scenarios . `` but if the scenario does n't fit what actually occurs , it 's not useful , '' said t. j. fontaine , assistant unit leader with the cooperativce . `` a static map , the minute it 's made , is always out of date . what the world wants is to answer , ` what can i do today to affect the population where i am ? ' `` the pheasant habitat simulator shows each nebraska county as a pixelated grid , representing six land-cover types and accounting for how suitable the land cover is to pheasant populations . ",
        "users can manipulate the ratio among them -- increasing wetland , for example , while decreasing pasture or cropland . in the background , the app uses a statistical model of pheasant-habitat relationships in nebraska to translate the change in land cover to that of pheasant suitability . on the user side , a visual representation of their decisions ' consequences is displayed . a second tab shows the estimated costs of those actions , which are tied to average land-use values based on county-level data . traditionally , building this type of app would cost an organization thousands of dollars , rendering it unaffordable for many organizations , fontaine said . ",
        "but manipulating the open-source application requires only time and ingenuity . `` we can move science forward faster if we close the gap in communication between researchers and users , '' he said . `` we believe this makes the gap narrower . it helps researchers communicate information outside the walls of academia to those who actually use it . `` chris chizinski , assistant professor of human dimension and wildlife management in the school of natural resources , agrees . `` decision-support apps , such as lyndsie and t. j. 's , are incredibly useful in synthesizing and illustrating complex models in a way that clearly shows the trade-offs in alternative management approaches , '' he said . ",
        "`` with the development of more open-source tools , i think that these types of apps will become a greater tool in science communication . `` the app was designed using shiny , a software package for the open-source statistical programming language r , and it will be updated based on user feedback `` as long as the tool is useful , '' wszola said . wszola and fontaine authored a recent study on the app alongside graduate students and professional researchers from the school of natural resources , state and federal natural resource agencies , nonprofit organizations and the private sector .
