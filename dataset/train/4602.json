        "at least 8,605 people were killed or injured by anti-personnel mines last year , a 150 percent rise in three years , with particularly high casualty figures in afghanistan and yemen , the handicap international charity said thursday . at least 8,605 people were killed or injured by anti-personnel mines last year , a 150 percent rise in three years , with particularly high casualty figures in afghanistan and yemen , the handicap international charity said thursday . `` the vast majority of people killed by anti-personnel mines are civilians , '' making up 78 percent of the total in 2016 of whom 42 percent were children , according to a new report . ",
        "`` we are witnessing an alarming upsurge in the use of mines , and an unacceptable increase in the number of mine casualties , '' said aleema shivji , executive director of handicap international uk . mine casualties were recorded in 56 states and territories around the world last year . the majority of new casualties of anti-personnel mines , factory-made or improvised , and of explosive remnants of war were recorded in afghanistan , libya , syria , ukraine and yemen . the 2016 figures also mark a 150 percent increase since 2013 , when 3,450 dead or wounded were logged . ",
        "the total number of casualties is the biggest since the first annual report was published in 2000 by the landmine monitor , which does research on behalf of the international campaign to ban landmines . handicap international was a founding member of the icbl which won the nobel peace prize in 1997 . the landmine monitor also confirmed new uses of anti-personnel mines by government forces in myanmar and syria between october 2016 and october 2017 . the publication of the report comes 20 years after the signing of the ottawa treaty , which bans the use of anti-personnel mines . ",
        "it has now been signed by 162 state parties , but not by all countries , with the united states , russia , china and india among the high-profile non-signatories . `` we 've stepped back in time , '' said jeff meer , executive director of handicap international in the us . the sharp increase in casualty figures since 2013 comes after 15 years of steady decline and is `` unacceptable , '' he said . `` war does not justify everything . `` the casualties figures , though higher , remain well down on those seen before the ottawa treaty came into being when the number of victims annually could reach 25,000 .
