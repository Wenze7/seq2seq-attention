        "harrisburg , pa. . -- penn state has settled a lawsuit by a man who claimed former university assistant football coach jerry sandusky molested him in a car in 2007 , when the man was about 14 years old . the settlement notice was posted monday on the philadelphia courts website and confirmed by a lawyer for the plaintiff , called john doe in case documents . the case had been scheduled for trial in late february , but late last month the parties told the judge they no longer needed sandusky to be brought to philadelphia from the state prison where he is serving a lengthy sentence . ",
        "a penn state spokeswoman said there is only one pending civil case left related to sandusky abuse allegations , a philadelphia lawsuit filed under the name jack doe . she declined to comment on the john doe case being settled . the university has paid more than $ 109 million to settle sandusky abuse claims by at least 35 people . sandusky , 73 , maintains he was wrongly convicted of 45 counts of child sexual abuse in 2012 and is pursuing appeals . john doe was granted judgment against sandusky last summer after sandusky , a defendant in the case , did not respond . ",
        "the trial would have determined how much he might owe in the case . sandusky had refused to leave his prison cell when attorneys arrived to depose him in april . court records show john doe claimed he met sandusky around the summer of 2005 through the second mile , a charity for at-risk youth sandusky founded in 1977 . the next year , sandusky gave him free tickets to penn state football games and visited him at home when he was sick . in march 2007 , john doe claimed , sandusky took him to visit a football coach at bucknell university in central pennsylvania . ",
        "he alleged sandusky touched and rubbed his thigh on the way to meet the coach and when they ate pizza together afterward . he claimed that on the way home , sandusky `` slowly slid his hand up thigh and began grabbing , squeezing , rubbing and fondling '' his genitals . the lawsuit says state prosecutors in 2012 `` recognized '' john doe as a victim of sexual abuse by sandusky and that he testified before a grand jury . john doe accused penn state of negligence and recklessness in its handling of sandusky complaints . the university had argued in a court filing that it `` owes no legal duty '' to a young man it did not know who alleged an activity that happened off-campus by a former employee unrelated to school business .
