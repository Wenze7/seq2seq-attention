        "serena williams wo n't be defending her australian open title after the american withdrew from the first grand slam of the 2018 season , saying she needs `` more time '' after giving birth last year . the 23-time grand slam winner returned to the court at the mubadala world tennis championship in abu dhabi at the weekend , less than four months after becoming a mum , but playing that tournament has given the american pause for thought . `` after competing in abu dhabi i realized that although i am super close , i 'm not where i personally want to be , '' the 36-year-old said . ",
        "`` my coach and team always said ` only go to tournaments when you are prepared to go all the way ' . i can compete -- but i do n't want to just compete , i want to do far better than that and to do so , i will need a little more time . `` with that being said , and even though i am disappointed about it , i 've decided not to compete in the australian open this year . `` serena williams defaeted her sister , venus williams , to win the 2017 australian open . ",
        "when williams won last year 's australian open she was already two months pregnant . `` the memory of last year 's open is one that i will carry with me , and olympia and i look forward to coming back again , '' added williams . `` i appreciate the support and understanding of my fans and everyone at the australian open .
