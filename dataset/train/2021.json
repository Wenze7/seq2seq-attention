        "travelers accustomed to using their current california driver 's license to get through airport security might have heard that those days are numbered . fortunately , the number is about 991 . starting jan. . 22 , california residents may apply for a more secure version of the state driver 's license or identification card , called real id , that complies with federal security requirements for air travel and access to federal buildings and bases . the actual deadline for when a current state license will no longer work at tsa checkpoints -- even on domestic flights -- is n't until oct. . ",
        "1 , 2020 . that should be sufficient time to avoid a panicked rush at the dmv , according to jaime garza , a california department of motor vehicles spokesman . `` we do n't want the public to freak out and say ` oh my god , what is this new driver 's license ? ' time is on our side . '' the federal real id act became law in 2005 , requiring that states create licenses and identification cards that meet minimum federal security standards . the enhanced card is not mandatory , however , and california will continue issuing the standard driver 's license and identification for those who do n't need it . ",
        "residents will not need real id to drive , vote , apply for federal benefits or visit a federal building that does n't require an id . but after oct. . 1 , 2020 , they will need real id to fly domestically if they do n't have a passport , military id or global entry card . all u. s. travelers will still need a passport to fly internationally . `` if you fly a lot , you may want to consider applying for a real id card , '' said garza . `` if you do n't fly a lot , you can just use your passport , passport card , military id '' or other federally approved identification . ",
        "applying for the real id will cost $ 35 , the same as renewing a standard license , but there are a couple of extra hoops to jump through : 1 -rrb- residents must go to a dmv office in person ; 2 -rrb- they must bring more documentation than is typical , including proof of identification , proof of social security number , proof of california residency and , if necessary , documents related to a name change . anticipating longer lines -- more people will have to show up in person , and the paperwork will take longer -- dmv officials are preparing , garza said , including increased staffing and extra hours on saturdays specifically for driver license processing at 60 offices statewide . ",
        "`` what we 're asking people to do is wait until your license is up for renewal , make an appointment , then you come in and provide the necessary documents , '' garza said . because the term of most licenses is five years , however , waiting might not work for residents who already renewed their licenses after oct. . 2 , 2015 -- they should consider renewing before the october 2020 deadline . more information is available at hilton is the editor of travel . email : shilton@sfchronicle . com twitter and instagram : @spudhilton .
