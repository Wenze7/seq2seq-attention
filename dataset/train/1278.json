        "the riders introduced their new quarterback , former ti-cat and argo zach collaros , to the media on tuesday . all zach collaros is looking for is an opportunity to prove himself again . that was pretty much the theme of collaros 's first meet-and-greet with the saskatchewan media . `` i think it 's a rebirth because i 'm in a new place , '' said collaros after arriving in regina tuesday , following last week 's trade from the hamilton tiger-cats . `` i 'm really looking forward to this opportunity and focusing on the present and there 's not a better place to be . ",
        "`` the riders ' newly acquired quarterback is anxious for a fresh start . while johnny manziel looks for a `` zach collaros-type contract '' in hamilton , collaros himself is more interested in regaining `` collaros-type form . `` roughriders fans will be just as curious which version of collaros they will get -- the collaros who was having a most outstanding player-type season in 2015 , which justified the richest contract in the cfl , or the collaros who had difficulty winning a single game in hamilton last year . he played a starring role on the bench for the second half of the season while jeremiah masoli led the tiger-cats back to respectability . ",
        "collaros is looking for a fresh start in saskatchewan and an opportunity to ` prove himself again . ' priority 1 for ti-cats management post-season was shedding collaros and his $ 500,000-a-season contract . the riders were happy to oblige , giving up a second-round draft pick and making the trade with the understanding collaros would agree to renegotiate . those talks have apparently already started . `` that 's something my agent and coach jones are working out , '' collaros said . `` it seems like everything is going well . i have n't really asked many questions about it . ",
        "`` who can blame collaros if he prefers to keep his head in the sand while other people hammer out his salary cut -- and a large one it will be . collaros insists he 's focused on getting his career back on track . `` obviously things did n't go the way i had planned , or we as a team in hamilton had planned , the last two years . but from a physical standpoint i feel the exact same . i 'm really looking forward to going out there and proving myself again . `` collaros , who will go into his seventh cfl season , will battle brandon bridge for the no . ",
        "1 job in training camp , but given his resume and bridge 's lack of starting experience , it will be collaros 's job to lose .   "
