        "after months of uncertainty , the future of the toronto argonauts is starting to look brighter . bell and mlse chairman larry tanenbaum announced wednesday that they have purchased the cfl team and will relocate it to bmo field . the team can start play at the lakefront soccer stadium as early as next season , pending renovations to accommodate football . the argos currently play at rogers centre , home of the toronto blue jays . their lease at the domed stadium runs through the 2017 season , but can be terminated earlier . rogers , which owns the stadium and the blue jays , plans to install a grass playing surface and has told the argos their rogers centre lease will not be renewed . ",
        "the announcement caps roughly a year of talks between argos owner david braley and maple leaf sports and entertainment . absent from the deal is rogers communications , which is part of the mlse ownership group with bell and tanenbaum . rogers was reportedly not interested in acquiring the 142-year-old franchise , likely because it has no ties to the cfl while bell has a vested interest in the league through its broadcast affiliate tsn . fans have long complained about the lack of atmosphere at rogers centre , where toronto averaged under 20,000 spectators last year in a stadium that can hold over 50,000 fans for football . ",
        "also , the argos have found it difficult to secure decent home dates because of stiff competition from baseball and special events . in a glaring example of the argos ' difficulties at rogers centre , the team has been forced to schedule it 's home opener this season against edmonton in fort mcmurray , alta . , due to conflicts with the 2015 pan am games and the blue jays .
