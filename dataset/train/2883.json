        "buzz grows for oprah 2020 democratic women -- - from grassroots donors to wealthy political benefactors -- are stepping up contributions at a record pace as they seek to send president donald trump a strong rebuke in this year 's midterm elections that will determine control of congress . democrats have a shot at seizing control of the house from republicans and at least a potential path to a senate majority , and women activists are helping create a wave of momentum for the party . after being stung by hillary clinton 's loss in the 2016 presidential election , the women have been regrouping , organizing and spending in an effort to help the democratic party bounce back . ",
        "their efforts have been bolstered by the #metoo movement , recent special election victories and an inspirational speech last week by oprah winfrey . as trump closes out his first year as president , a record 266 democratic women have reported raising money for house races , and other women are putting money into campaigns at unprecedented rates , according to an analysis by the center for responsive politics in washington . anniversary marchesthe outpouring of support for women on social media as a result of the flood of sexual harassment and misconduct accusations against men in powerful positions has spurred some of the new activism . ",
        "this weekend marks the one-year anniversary of the women 's march in washington and other cities , and on saturday and sunday , thousands of people across the nation are expected to gather for rallies and other events . `` it has the potential to be the year that women turn the tide and transform our country , '' said barbara lee , a boston-based political consultant and philanthropist who gave $ 1.9 million to super political action committees that supported the clinton campaign . a quinnipiac university poll released on jan. . 17 showed that 63 percent of women disapprove of the president 's job performance , compared to 57 percent of american voters overall . ",
        "`` women are facing the brunt of trump 's and the republican party 's attacks -- attacks on reproductive justice , minimum wage laws , protections for tipped workers , anti-immigrant policies , student loan debt forgiveness and access to healthcare , '' said amber anderson mostyn , a texas lawyer and a major democratic donor . in the first three quarters of 2017 , democratic candidates , especially women , benefited the most from the trend , with female candidates receiving 44.2 percent of their contributions from women , on average , up from 40.3 percent in 2016 , the analysis by the center for responsive politics showed . ",
        "record numbersamong democratic candidates , about 33 percent are women , while fewer republican women are running and raising money in house races than usual this cycle . campaigns will next report their latest fundraising totals on jan. . 31 . `` there is a real commitment here and women are looking around to see who the candidates are , '' said susie tompkins buell , a prominent democratic donor from san francisco who co-founded the esprit clothing line . `` i 'm focusing more on the house races because i think that 's where the fresh young ones are going . '' ",
        "emily 's list , the largest national organization devoted to electing female candidates , said december set the fundraising record in its 33-year history for the final month of the year . much of the added giving came in the form of small donations contributed online . the group said it could not provide a total as it was still tallying the final numbers . stephanie schriock , the group 's president , said the number of women running for office is soaring . during the entire 2016 election cycle , emily 's list heard from 920 women who were considering running for office or getting involved politically in some way . ",
        "that number has already grown , to 26,000 for the 2018 election cycle . `` people are seeing women candidates are a good investment , '' schriock said in an interview last week in her washington office . `` we are in a tipping-point moment . `` a decisive win by democrat patty schachtner this week in a special election in a wisconsin state senate district that trump carried by 17 points in 2016 gave the party its latest boost , following the first democratic victory in a u. s. senate race in alabama in 25 years in december and decisive wins for governor and other contests in virginia the month before . ",
        "still , november remains a long way off , and trump won 41 percent of women 's votes in 2016 , according to exit polls . the republican party is also likely to have significant financial resources in 2018 . house speaker paul ryan 's joint fundraising committee , team ryan , said thursday that it raised more than $ 44 million in 2017 , a record total for a non-national-election year . midterm mathtypically , the party holding the white house almost always loses congressional seats in the midterm elections . democrats need a net gain of 24 seats to take the house and two to secure a majority in the senate . ",
        "analysts suggest their chances are better in the house because they 're defending far more senate seats than republicans and only have a few strong pick-up opportunities in that chamber . democratic candidates for office -- and potential future ones -- are also seeking to leverage this weekend 's marches and rallies for their own campaigns . `` this weekend marks one year since women across the country marched for equality and in protest of donald trump 's sexism , '' j. b. pritzker , a billionaire and democratic candidate for governor in illinois , said in a statement thursday . ",
        "`` as these issues continue to plague our country , i 'm proud to march again this coming saturday . `` tompkins buell , a major supporter of clinton 's campaign who gave $ 2.5 million in the 2015 and 2016 election cycle to candidates and committees that report to the federal election commission , said she 'll likely give even more for this election than in past midterm races . `` anyone who was committed to hillary is committed to the bigger picture , '' she said . `` these deep dark days have really brought the best out of women . '' ",
        "in addition to the record number of house candidates , there are 79 women who are running or exploring runs for governor and 49 for u. s. senate seats , according to the center for american women and politics at rutgers university . lee , the boston philanthropist , said she is leaning toward supporting candidates in those races because the positions are better stepping-stones to the oval office . as disappointing as clinton 's 2016 loss was , lee said , she thinks the number of women running for office -- including at the local and state level -- will make it easier for a woman to eventually win the white house . ",
        "`` she will have been carried by a movement and not compelled to carry it herself , '' said lee , whose family foundation helps women running for office regardless of party .   "
