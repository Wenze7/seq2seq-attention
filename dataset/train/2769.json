        "disney ceo bob iger positioned his company 's acquisition of fox 's tv and movie businesses as a way for the company to prepare for a future in which streaming and direct-to-consumer dominate media consumption , on a conference call this morning to discuss the $ 52 billion deal . he noted that while they 're still planning to support cable channels and external distribution channels , this will also set them up to be ready to `` flip a switch and distribute those programs and channels direct to consumer through platforms we 've created . `` as part of that , disney seems to have big plans in place for developing hulu out as a direct-to-consumer service , according to iger , who noted that hulu is `` obviously a great opportunity to expand '' its direct consumer offerings , and relished the additional ownership stake that disney will gain as a result of the deal in terms of what it means for the company 's ability to influence hulu 's development direction . ",
        "iger added that this will allow hulu to `` become an even more viable competitor '' to existing services , likely referencing netflix and amazon prime video without naming them directly . he also said that disney will of course be `` flowing more content in hulu 's direction '' now that it owns a controlling 39 percent majority stake , but he seemed more exited by the reality that disney now has essentially final say in terms of hulu product decisions . `` managing hulu becomes just a little bit more clear , a little more efficient , a little more effective as a controlling shareholder , '' he said . ",
        "iger also responded to multiple questions about the difference between its various direct-to-consumer offerings , including its forthcoming disney streaming service coming in 2019 , and its espn over-the-top subscription services . he outlined that they sort of see hulu as a delivery method for more adult-oriented fox tv offerings , disney 's streaming service as a family oriented offering around lucasfilm , marvel and disney , and espn as a sports fan service . `` i do n't think you should necessarily look at it as individual businesses , but i think you should look at it as opportunities in consumer choice , and consumer options , '' he added , clarifying that `` of course '' there would be options available whereby consumers could sign up for everything all at once , too . ",
        "`` hulu has been increasing its investment in original programming and licensed programming , '' but disney has n't yet decided whether it will continue or increase that since it 's premature to be making those kinds of plans at this point . iger did point out that disney 's ownership puts it in a position to ramp considerably on original content based on its existing intellectual property , however . this article originally appeared on techcrunch at .
