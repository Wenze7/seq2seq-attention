        "although overbuilding is a critical problem in capacity expansion in a commodity business , there is a strong tendency toward capacity expansion . the risk is most severe for two reasons , i. e. , demand is cyclical , and products are not differentiated . key discussion : . get the full series in pdf . cyclical demand leads to optimistic expectations in upturns while the second reason makes costs crucial to competition , sales are tied to the amount of capacity , and ensure `` adequate capacity to achieve their target market share . '' michael porter in competitive strategy techniques for analyzing industries and competitors divided the commodity business and other businesses into the following categories with brief details . ",
        "technological : . adding capacity in large lumps : `` the necessity to add capacity in large units increases the potential for overcapacity . '' economies of scale or a significant learning curve : the cost advantage obtained by firm 's that add capacity early will motivate other companies to move quickly and aggressively . long lead times in adding capacity : porter extensively wrote in the book of competitive strategy ; `` long lead times penalize the firms that are left behind and motivates them to add more capacity . '' increased minimum efficient scale : he believed that `` as larger size plants are built , the minimum efficient size plant increases to motivate firms to keep building larger capacity . '' ",
        "for example ; the capacity of supertankers ordered in the early 1970s far exceeded the market demand . changes in production technology : `` new production technology attracts investment in new plant capacity , but the older facilities tend to remain in service because of exit barriers . '' for example ; this situation is occurring in the production of chemicals . structural : . significant exit barriers : inefficient excess capacity remains in the market where exit barriers are necessary . forcing by suppliers : behavior by suppliers can force overcapacity by subsidies , or price cuts . building credibility : overcapacity is sometimes needed in industries to motivate buyers to switch to a new product otherwise they will be vulnerable to the suppliers . ",
        "integrated competitors : `` if competitors are integrated either downstream or upstream , there will be pressure on them to overbuild capacity to protect these operations so that they do not lose market share . '' capacity share affects demand : as buyers are prone to approach airline firms , greater capacity may get the disproportionate share of the market . age and type of capacity affect demand : `` having the most modern , well-decorated fast-food outlet may yield competitive benefits because capacity is marketed directly to the buyers . '' competitive : . a large number of firms gain market position , the lack of a robust and credible market leader , new entry with low entry barriers , and motivation from first mover advantages contribute to the overcapacity problems . ",
        "information flow : . highly optimistic and overinflated demand expectations promote overexpansion . divergent misestimates or assumptions and perceptions of competitor 's strength , resource , and staying power may lead to overexpansion . signals that are stable support orderly expansion , while distrust of market signals causes instability . as structural change needs the firms to invest in new plant , overbuilding of capacity occurs . by asking excessive questions to the management , financial communities and analyst create pressures to increase expansion . managerial : . `` capacity overbuilding seems to be particularly liable to occur when production has been the traditional concern of management . '' ",
        "asymmetric aversion to risk is the cost to the firm that is left behind because of a lack of capacity is higher than the value of overbuilding capacity . governmental : . tax incentives that tax un-invested profits or that allows tax-free retention of earnings by u. s. subsidiaries can encourage overinvestment . if the minimum efficient scale is large relative to the world market , the desire by many countries to establish a position to lead to overcapacity . governments may pressure firms to invest in capacity expansion to maintain employment and reduce unemployment . limits to capacity expansion : . ",
        "there are some checks against the tendency for overbuilding including financing constraints , company diversification , an additional cost of new capacity , uncertainty about the future , and previous periods of overcapacity . some firms may discourage expansion in various ways . for example `` they may announce a large addition , or release discouraging messages about future demand , or predict technological obsolescence of the current capacity in the industry . '' conclusion : . porter stated that `` under capacity in an industry is rarely a problem since it will usually attract new investment . overbuilding is indeed a chronic problem that has repeatedly and severely plagued many industries -- paper , shipping , iron ore , aluminum , and many chemical businesses , just to name a few .
