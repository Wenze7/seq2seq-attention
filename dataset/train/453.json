        "google 's ces 2018 booth featured an impossible-to-ignore sign stating `` hey google , '' the command to wake up your smart assistant . sarah tew/cnetat one section of google 's giant outdoor booth at ces was an impromptu , carney-style one-man show , with a guy wearing dark sunglasses and a white google assistant jumpsuit loudly and enthusiastically giving away free electronics one by one to a snaking line of gawking tech-show goers . `` he got a google home mini ! let 's get a picture , boss ! '' he yelled out as i walked by on thursday . ",
        "`` google 's even giving out smart lights ! '' he told the crowd . `` i did n't even know lights could be smart ! congratulations , dude ! `` this one booth bro embodied google 's efforts at ces 2018 , with the search giant making a rare and splashy appearance at the world 's largest tech show . the company was working to drum up attention for its google assistant voice helper as it tries to catch up to amazon 's alexa , the dominant force in voice-controlled smart speakers . not to be outdone , amazon was part of dozens of partnership announcements at ces , with alexa making its way into toyota cars , vuzix smart glasses and kohler smart toilets . ",
        "that blow-for-blow fight between amazon and google highlights the tech industry 's expectation that voice assistants will play a much bigger role in your digital life this year . executives from both companies at ces talked about bringing their voice assistants to many more places like cars , earbuds and office meeting rooms , so your voice assistant can seamlessly be available to you anytime and anywhere -- apparently even on the toilet . 63all the cool new gadgets at ces 2018 `` if voice is going to be everywhere , you want to see voice transition from the home , when you get into your car . ",
        "... you 'd also want it at work , '' said steve rabuchin , amazon 's vice president of alexa voice service and alexa skills . `` we 're going off into auto and these other places because we believe voice is a natural interface and it should be ambient . `` so far , voice assistants have built up a fanbase as controllers of the smart home , helping people play music or operate their connected lights . the challenge will be whether these assistants can effectively transition into other places . that test is already playing out in phones , with apple 's siri , alexa and google assistant already available in oodles of handsets , but results have been mixed . ",
        "samsung is also working to bring its assistant bixby into its tvs and appliances this year . siri , meanwhile , was wholly overshadowed at ces and is in danger of falling well behind the pack . plus , some customers , concerned about privacy , may not want their assistants to travel with them . others might be annoyed if someone is loudly chatting with his assistant out in public , requiring new guidelines for voice assistant etiquette . what i can say ? at a posh suite in the wynn resort , gummi hafsteinsson , product management director for google assistant , last tuesday sat by two new google assistant-powered smart displays , which are essentially smart speakers with built-in touchscreens . ",
        "google teamed up with sony , samsung-owned jbl , lg and lenovo to create four of these displays , which had been unveiled at ces the day before . vr , smart displays and even smart toilets at ces 2018 with so many companies working to add voice assistants into their products , hafsteinsson said google wanted to come to ces -- even though it 's avoided a public presence at the show in past years -- to show its support for the growing google assistant ecosystem . `` we 're here with all the partners , '' he said , `` to make sure we 're talking about the broad story , talk about the ecosystem ... doing it in a way that makes sense to the user so they get the choice they want . ",
        "`` in 2018 , he said , google will work to make its assistant more conversational so it 's easier to use , more capable and , with the help of google 's partners , more nearly ubiquitous . `` when you think about what 's happening this year , we 're trying to make the experience richer without making it more complicated , '' hafsteinsson said while gesturing to one of the smart displays . amazon 's steve rabuchin , at the company 's meeting space at ces 2018 , stands by a set of alexa development kits . ",
        "these kits help hardware makers create new alexa-powered devices . ben fox rubin/cnetat the show wednesday , at the sands expo and convention center , amazon 's rabuchin discussed a similar game plan for the coming year . `` we 'd love alexa to be moving with you , '' he said in a corner of a large private meeting space amazon set up at the show , which included a handful of glass displays filled with alexa-powered gadgets . the e-commerce heavyweight is inching closer to that goal . rabuchin said that alexa is integrated into over 4,000 smart-home devices from 1,200 brands and that more than 30,000 alexa skills are now available . ",
        "he added that the alexa economy is showing signs of strength , with some alexa developers making `` over six figures '' through checks amazon pays for the most popular skills . he conceded that there are hurdles to bringing alexa into more areas of your life , but added that the company is thinking about how to make alexa useful in each of those different places . the assistant wo n't do the exact same things in your car as it will on your personal computer or in an office space . one thing rabuchin said is n't changing soon is amazon 's ads policy , which strictly limits advertising on alexa . ",
        "he batted down reports this month that amazon was talking to brands about bringing more ads to the assistant . `` there 's no change in our advertising policy , '' he said . `` a couple stories broke in the last couple weeks that we were going to do more . there 's no truth to those . `` everywhere for everybodyit might be hard to imagine why you would want a digital assistant on your face in a pair of smart glasses or inside a toilet so you can flush using your voice . rabuchin said these integrations are all about giving customers choice . ",
        "he said amazon is also happy to have voice assistants work together -- like alexa and microsoft 's cortana do -- for the same reason . back at the google booth , amid the one-man show , carol raymundo , a ces attendee , had another idea . the 43-year-old from albany , oregon , manages the center for accessibility resources at linn-benton community college , helping students at the school that have learning , cognitive or physical disabilities . she said she sees lots of potential for people with disabilities to use google assistant and alexa to make their daily routines easier , while also making that accessibility unobtrusive and helpful for everyone . ",
        "`` if you already have it into your technology naturally , '' she said , `` it 's better . `` ces 2018 : cnet 's complete coverage of tech 's biggest show . the smartest stuff : innovators are thinking up new ways to make you , and the things around you , smarter .   "
