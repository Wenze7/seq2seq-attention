        "in november of last year , a division of walt disney company brought a lawsuit against redbox . the mouse now has kicked it up a notch by moving for a preliminary injunction . one of the ways in which disney markets its movies is in combo packs . these are bundles that include dvd and blu-ray discs as well as digital download codes . the combo packs are packaged and priced to be sold as a unit . the outside packaging of the combo packs states that `` codes are not for sale or transfer '' ; similar language appears on the package insert containing the code . ",
        "a consumer redeeming the codes on the disney portal is likewise required to represent that he or she is `` the owner of the physical product that accompanied the digital code at the time of purchase . '' redbox is best known for its automated cut-rate video rental kiosks outside drugstores and supermarkets . the lawsuit alleges that redbox has purchased disney combo packs , disassembled them and sold the digital download codes through its kiosks and directly on its website . the business issue this raises for disney is that because disney discounts the price of the code when sold in a combo pack , redbox can resell the codes for less than the price of a digital download on itunes or a similar site . ",
        "in an effort to shut down redbox 's practice , disney has asserted claims for breach of contract and copyright infringement . the breach of contract claim is predicated on the contention that redbox accepted the prohibition on sale or transfer of the codes when it purchased and opened the combo packs . to this end , disney cites numerous cases upholding the validity of `` shrink-wrap licenses . '' the sale of the codes does not in itself infringe on the rights protected under copyright law ; the actual infringement alleged by disney occurs when the redbox customer downloads and views the movie . ",
        "but under the doctrine of contributory infringement , redbox could be held liable if it knowingly induced or materially contributed to its customer 's infringing activities . to establish this point , disney cites not only the sales themselves , but that they were promoted heavily by redbox as `` cheap '' and a `` smart buy . '' interestingly , disney 's preliminary injunction motion attempts to answer what it anticipates will be redbox 's principal defense . redbox carries on its main disc rental business under the `` first sale '' provisions of copyright law . the first sale defense provides that the lawful owner of a copy of a work may sell or otherwise dispose of its possession . ",
        "this is why you can sell your secondhand books , cds and dvds without fear of liability , and why redbox contends that it has unlimited rights to rent dvds lawfully purchased from their copyright owners . disney argues that the first sale defense is inapplicable to resale of the download codes . that defense , it contends , applies only to the distribution of lawfully obtained copies of copyrighted works , whereas a digital download constitutes a reproduction of the work . likewise , a download code is not a copy at all , merely a code permitting a user to download a copy subject to the posted terms of use . ",
        "disney 's motion will prevail if the judge agrees that sales of the codes are causing it irreparable harm , and that it is likely to succeed on the merits . if the preliminary injunction is granted , it will bring an immediate halt to redbox 's sales of the unbundled codes and likely lead to a quick resolution to the lawsuit as a whole . you can read disney 's full motion here .
