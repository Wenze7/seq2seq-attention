        "few gave ospreys a chance of finishing above the bottom of their group , never mind making it through to the next stage when the european champions cup draw pitched the welsh region with the holders , last season 's beaten finalists and the 2000 winners . yet they go into the final two rounds of the pool stage second in their group , and victory over saracens at the liberty stadium on saturday night would very probably knock out the club that has won the competition for the past two seasons . `` we are still in contention , which not many people outside our camp would have expected , '' said the ospreys ' coach , steve tandy . ",
        "`` physically we are starting to step up and we are getting into a rhythm . we just have to go out and enjoy playing the european champions at home . saracens have an unbelievable squad which makes it a bit david against goliath . `` europe has salvaged ospreys ' season . they mustered a mere two victories in the pro14 in the opening three months of the campaign , at home to zebre and the dragons , but although they lost their opening two champions cup matches , they nearly stole victory from clermont auvergne before surprising saracens and leaving allianz park with two bonus points . ",
        "their campaign turned around when they secured a bonus point win over northampton at franklin 's gardens last month and followed it up with another in the return in swansea the week after . since then , they have secured derby victories over cardiff blues and the dragons having lost at the scarlets with the last move of the match . `` the boys have delivered and are in a great place mentally , '' tandy said . `` saracens have some of their big boys back : i was hoping they would be out for a few more weeks but we have to be super-excited . ",
        "we are in a group where no one gave us a chance of winning a match but we took 10 points off a premiership side , should have beaten clermont and played some exceptional rugby at allianz park . `` ospreys ' upturn coincided with the return of their half-backs dan biggar and rhys webb and their captain alun wyn jones from wales duty . all three were part of the lions tour to new zealand last summer and if biggar and webb are off in the summer to northampton and toulon respectively , they showed against the blues last weekend that they still have the freedom of the liberty . ",
        "biggar was at his bustling best and will be inspired by the presence of owen farrell opposite him . `` when players like that return , they demand a performance from the team , '' tandy said . `` their presence in the dressing room picked up the boys and they were exactly what we needed after losing at home to glasgow . they have driven us forward and to beat saracens , we need dan to be on top form . farrell is a massive driving force for them and if we can keep him quiet , we will have a chance . ",
        "`` saracens and ospreys are playing for second place , unless clermont , who shipped 58 points to racing 92 last weekend , implode . the holders , whose previous visit to ospreys resulted in a tight contest and a 16-13 victory , have rebounded from a five-match losing spell emphatically with three wins , including two at leicester and wasps , and have the england forwards maro itoje and billy vunipola back in their ranks . `` the next two weeks are big for us because they will decide our european destiny , '' said itoje , who returned last weekend having missed four matches after suffering a fractured jaw at harlequins six weeks ago that required four plates to fix . ",
        "`` my jaw feels absolutely fine and i did not think about it during the game at wasps . it still feels a bit funny eating on my left side but the injury did not affect my arms and legs so i was able to run and lift properly in the gym and feel in decent nick . it 's just about playing now .
