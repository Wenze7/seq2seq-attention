        "like most metal gear fans , i looked at metal gear survive and saw disaster and desperation . there appears to be nothing there but yet another zombie game . the zombies appear to be nothing but shuffling ai units that absorb bullets . more often than not , zombies represent lazy writing and even more lazy gameplay . they are an easy enemy that presents little challenge to the player and require very little explanation . games like dead rising take this to the extreme and just have fun with the clich√©s and tropes ; the point is to be silly and not give one wit about the zombies . ",
        "metal gear is not a game series known for `` silly '' enemies or mindless gameplay . i mean , there 's the chicken and the box , but that 's not the whole game 's theme . zombies have little to do with the metal gear world , although there are some fantastical elements in the original games , like psychic powers and vampirism . red lyrium zombies , however , are not a part of that list . zombies just do n't fit in the metal gear narrative . nor are they nearly as believable . a little more explanation than `` alternate universe '' and `` through the hole in the sky we go '' is required , especially for a narrative as complex as metal gear 's . ",
        "a note on why i keep calling the zombies of metal gear survive `` red lyrium zombies , '' since no one seems to see this but me . if you 've played dragon age : inquisition , you might recall a mission called `` in hushed whispers . '' during this mission , the player learns a little more about a fictional substance called red lyrium . we encountered the substance before in dragon age 2 but all we learned was that it corrupted people , drove them to insanity . in inquisition , we learn that the corruption is the least that red lyrium can do . ",
        "it grows inside people by simply being in the same room . metal gear survive 's zombies look almost exactly like the corrupted characters in dragon age : inquisition . i realize it is really just red crystals , but i can not for the life of me get the comparison out of my head . what metal gear survive can do to actually have staying power is one of two things . one : not be a zombie version of metal gear solid v. i say this because the recent gameplay details explain only that survive has the exact same gameplay as its predecessor : mother base , questing , crafting , and all . ",
        "two : it would be nice if konami was capable of making survive a good zombie game . this is possible even if konami decides not to reference metal gear whatsoever . they can at least pull ideas from other zombie game plots and gameplay . for example , the premise of zombie games allow for the creative exploration of a variety of human conditions . like economics and a theory called the tragedy of the commons . this is where communal resources are eventually exploited by human greed , to the point where each individual hoards their own supplies . ",
        "a few games approach this differently , like pubg can be communal among a team , but something like call of duty is very much every man for themselves . another idea that might make survive a decent game , would be the exploration of newly formed government and social systems . something that the last of us has in spades , ranging from extremist religious groups to close-knit family units . such a concept could explore the formation of government and social systems without the influence of larger outside governing bodies and traditions . these are always individuals or small communities set on survival and nothing else . ",
        "as a motive , survival can remove a great deal of the social and political obstacles we face today , like poverty or race . of course , none of that matters in the face of survival or when zombies are chasing you down . or it can matter even more , as zombie games have the ability to pick and choose what each of their worlds looks like -- there is no need to adhere to any rules . as such , metal gear survive could be a good game . fans of metal gear might reject it outright on principle , but the potential is there . ",
        "if konami found a good batch of developers and did n't let their corporate greed get in way , then survive could be the sleeper hit of 2018/2019 . we could have a game that uses zombies as a back drop for a heavy narrative on human nature , morality , and society . or the red lyrium zombies will be annoying enemies that attack the mother base at well-timed intervals . no characters will developed beyond the point of a cardboard cutout to conveniently post at your base in order to finish the next stretch goal . want to know what other upcoming games are on the horizon ?
