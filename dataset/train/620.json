        "when you do n't get what you wantlike everyone else , i do n't do well when a person -- or the universe -- answers one of my requests with `` no . '' i get angry , sad , feel sick , get mysterious aches and pains . i sleep too much or ca n't sleep . i have a hissy-fit . i blame others . i blame myself . the intensity of all that is equal to the intensity of how much i wanted that thing . if the rejection was vital to my heart , i 'm an agony . ",
        "if i think i am to blame , i 'm in hell . it hurts when others betray you . the pain is almost unbearable when you betray yourself . my general suggestion when strong emotions wash over you is to sit with it . when bad things happen , feel bad . that 's the healthy and appropriate response . feel bad . cry , pout , yell at the the walls , write long , rambling , tear-stained letters . man-o-man , feeling bad is hard in this `` do n't worry be happy '' world . feeling bad is hard in any world . ",
        "it 's an affront . it 's an insult . it 's not how things are supposed to be . so we do things to escape . my two biggies are eating and sleeping . others drink or drug . other people engage in distracting or risky behavior . sex , drugs , rock and roll . so taking my own advice to just sit there like a crying child in a mud puddle is not easy . but eventually , if we face into it , if you stare it down , the ocean of bad recedes and drains away . ",
        "that 's a promise . nothing is permanent . nothing . even hell passes away . then comes the next stepyes , they did this to you . yes , you did this to yourself . yes , nobody could have been foreseen this and yes , nobody can fix this . so now what ? no matter how much blame there is to be laid , revenge to be had , `` even '' to get , all that is aimed away from you . you can get totally even . you can get devastating revenge . but it will not reduce the pain by the width of a cat whisker . ",
        "jocko willink has a line of thought he calls `` extreme ownership . '' his book is on my `` to-read '' list and i occasionally dip into his podcast . he 's talking most about leadership but his basic idea is that you need to own your life completely and take complete responsibility for it . toxic responsibilityyou see a sort of toxic version of responsibility in movies and tv shows that goes along the lines of `` i feel deeply guilty because i should have been able to . '' it 's a lazy way for script writers to make heroes sad or angry . ",
        "i usually find it annoying . i do n't mean you should take responsibility for things over which you have no control . `` well she was 50 miles away , tornado killed her . i should have been able to protect her . '' nah , if you 'd been standing right there when the tornado hit , you 'd just be another piece of debris . another form of toxic responsibility is co-dependency . that 's where you do n't allow someone else to take responsibility for their problems and their life outcomes . their drunken violence landed them in a jail cell ? ",
        "it 's not your responsibility to cushion their fall . radical responsibilitytake radical responsibility . what i mean by radical responsibility is this : after the tornado passes through and destroys what it will , it 's up to you to start cleaning up the mess . do n't wait for the national guard . do n't wait for someone to tell you how to do it . allow the pain to drain away a bit . then when the tears have dried , you have to decide what 's next . it 's the time to do . to act . ",
        "let 's say you want something badly -- the love of your life , to be a writer , to be a doctor , whatever -- and something blocks you such as the fact that your personality is an effective birth control method or you have no skills , no talent , no time , no money . you may , indeed , be trapped in a box or behind a wall , but whatever happens next -- how you think , what you say and how you take your next step -- is absolutely your responsibility . you can spend the rest of your life feeling guilty , being afraid , being bitter , laying blame , spoiling for revenge , getting even . ",
        "or you can take radical responsibility . fix your lifenobody can fix your life for you . nobody wants to fix your life for you . and even if they could or wanted to , it would not be a good idea . so what do you do when you do n't get what you want ? care for yourself for a while . sit in your anger , disappointment and frustration . these feelings yours and they are fine . there is no such thing as a wrong feeling . and , above all , in time , those feelings will pass . ",
        "then stand up , dust yourself off and say something along the lines of : `` i 'm in charge of my life , nobody else . time to get to work . ''   "
