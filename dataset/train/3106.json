        "@pti_news @ani @httweets @toiindianews @navbharattimes @ddnational -- dcp new delhi january 8 , 2018 . in 2017 , the ngt banned all protests and dharnas around the historic jantar mantar area , which has been a hotspot of many agitations over the past decades , saying such activities violate environmental laws . earlier on monday , the delhi police said mevani 's request for holding a rally in delhi was still `` under consideration '' , even as the organisers insist it will be held on pre-scheduled time . the ` social justice ' rally or ` yuva hunkaar ' rally is planned to be addressed by mevani and assam peasant leader akhil gogoi . ",
        "one of the organisers and former jnu students ' union president mohit kumar pandey said : there have been many attempts to stop this event and even some media houses are spreading wrong information that the permission for the rally has been denied . ever since the rally was announced on 2 january , `` a lot of money has been spent on posters calling mevani a deshdrohi and urban naxal , '' pandey told pti , adding the event will be held as per schedule . mevani could not be reached for comment . in a statement , the organisers have urged the prospective participants to `` assemble on the parliament street at 12 pm on tuesday '' . ",
        "a senior police officer , though , said , `` mevani 's request for the rally is still under consideration . `` the rally seeks to raise the demand for the release of dalit outfit bhim army 's founder chandrashekhar azad and emphasise issues like educational rights , employment , livelihood and gender justice . a large section of students from universities and colleges in delhi , women 's groups , teachers ' associations and activists associated with mevani from across the country are expected to attend the rally . azad , 30 , was arrested in june last year from himachal pradesh as he was the main accused in the thakur-dalit clash in uttar pradesh 's saharanpur district .
