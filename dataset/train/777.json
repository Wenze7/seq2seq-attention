        "oakland -- by the time the cleveland cavaliers and golden state warriors meet again on jan. . 15 , everything about the latest rivalry meeting will be different . the warriors ' steph curry will be fully healed from the ankle injury that has cost him nine games , and cavs all-star point guard isaiah thomas will be a few weeks into his first stretch with lebron james & co. . after recovering from the hip injury that has had him out since may . none of which is to say that the warriors ' 99-92 win on monday at oracle arena meant nothing . ",
        "you ca n't have the same two teams clash in the finals for an unprecedented three consecutive seasons and not strike all kinds of entertaining chords -- injuries notwithstanding . above all else , it was the latest reminder that this post-oklahoma city thunder version of kevin durant remains as impactful a player as there is in the league . no matter how good his teammates might be . durant dominates . the 2017 finals mvp had 25 points , seven rebounds , three assists and five blocks , and his two-way game was on full display down the stretch . ",
        "durant took a chance while guarding james on the left side down the stretch and poked the ball out of bounds for a cleveland turnover . with 24.5 seconds remaining , he blocked james as he drove the lane and bounced the ball off of his rival 's hand for another turnover . yet durant 's finest moment came midway through the fourth , when he paired with draymond green for a block of tristan thompson 's layup at the rim and soared high for a right-hand slam on the other end just seconds later . but wait -- this might mean nothing . ",
        "based on history , anyways , that would appear to be the case . during this three-year stretch in which the warriors have won two titles while winning at an unprecedented pace in the regular season , there has never been a correlation between christmas day outcome and their final goal of winning it all . they lost to the clippers on christmas day during the 2014-15 campaign in which they won it all , downed cleveland in the annual affair a year later at quicken loans arena before falling to them in the finals , then lost to cleveland at oracle arena in 2016 before winning it all again . ",
        "admiring lebron . lebron had 20 points , six rebounds and six assists , and it speaks volumes about the season he 's having that the performance was n't up his standards this year . james , who entered play shooting at a career-high pace of 57 % overall and 41.1 % from three-point range while averaging 28.4 points , 8.2 rebounds and 9.2 assists , drew high praise from warriors coach steve kerr before the game . `` lebron 's playing as well as he ever has , '' kerr said of james , who had seven turnovers in the loss . ",
        "`` i was thinking about it on the drive in : how many players are better in year 15 than in year 10 ? then especially when you 're talking about superstars . go down the list ... michael , bird , magic , wilt , kareem , bill russell . a lot of them did n't even get to 15 years . `` were any of them better in year 15 than in year 10 ? i ca n't imagine . so what he has done with his game is just incredible . he 's always been the dominant physical force from year one . ",
        "but the skill at this point is better than it 's ever been . '' here 's one guess as to why james did n't play better : he would have much rather been at home . a day before the game , james -- who is the first vice president of the national basketball player association -- had this to say about the nba 's commercialization of christmas . `` being away from my family for the holidays for work is the absolute worst ! love what i do and would n't change it for the world but does n't change the fact of how i 'm feeling at this moment ! ",
        "#missingthejamesgang . klay being klay . cleveland 's only lead at a quarter break came after the first , but it would have been much worse for the warriors if not for klay thompson 's sharpshooting . the assist , clearly , went to his shiny shoes . just hours after the proud anta spokesman shared a shot of his human highlighter collection that sat beneath his personal christmas tree on instagram , thompson -- wearing a fluorescent green sneaker on his left foot and a griswold-bright pink one on his right -- buried all three of his three-point shots in the opening period . ",
        "this would n't typically qualify as news , considering thompson holds two of the top seven single-season marks for three-pointers made in nba history . but thompson , whose warriors had their 11-game winning streak snapped by denver on friday night , entered play having hit just three three-pointers in his last two games . thompson finished with 24 points and seven rebounds against the cavs . draymond being draymond . klay was n't the only warriors player who had his shoe game ready . green , who had a triple-double in the win , wore a pair of nikes that featured the smiling cartoon character , arthur , and a christmas tree on both heels and was widely seen as a poke at his good friend , king james . ",
        "the translation goes like this : back when the cavs were struggling in early november , james posted a picture of arthur 's balled-up fist on instagram and thus sent a message that he was n't happy . this , one can safely assume , was green 's way of trolling james while making it clear that the warriors could n't be happier these days . follow usa today sports ' sam amick on twitter .
