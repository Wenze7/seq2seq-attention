        "stroudsburg , pa. . -- a national fraternity was banned from pennsylvania for 10 years and ordered to pay a fine of more than $ 110,000 as it was sentenced monday for its role in the death of a 19-year-old pledge during a 2013 hazing ritual . the judge and a prosecutor slammed pi delta psi for calling itself a victim of rogue fraternity members , saying the organization tolerated and even encouraged hazing for years leading up to the death of baruch college freshman chun `` michael '' deng . `` it 's the epitome of a lack of acceptance of responsibility . ",
        "it 's their rituals and functions that led us here today , '' said monroe county assistant district attorney kim metzger said in court . pi delta psi , an asian-american cultural fraternity founded in 1994 , has 25 chapters in 11 states , including one at penn state university that will now have to be disbanded . four defendants who pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and other charges will be sentenced later monday . a grand jury said fraternity members at baruch , a campus of the city university of new york , physically abused deng , and then tried to cover it up as the 19-year-old lay dying in their rented house in the pocono mountains . ",
        "police charged 37 people with crimes ranging from aggravated assault to hazing to third-degree murder . pi delta psi was convicted of involuntary manslaughter following a trial . in a written statement , pi delta psi said its now-disbanded baruch chapter had brought `` shame and dishonor '' to the national fraternity . the fraternity also called itself `` in part a victim , '' which brought a rebuke from monroe county president judge margherita patti-worthington . `` i would never label the national fraternity as a ` victim , ' '' said the judge , who faulted the fraternity 's board for allowing the hazing rituals to persist . ",
        "pi delta psi 's attorney , wes niemoczynski , argued that the organization had developed a `` no excuses '' hazing policy before deng 's death , but he said the policy worked on an honor system and proved to be inadequate . the fraternity 's `` crossing over '' initiation rituals `` involved some physicality , but they certainly did not involve the level of physicality , the level of inhumanity , and the depravity of the individuals who are also coming before the court , '' he said .
