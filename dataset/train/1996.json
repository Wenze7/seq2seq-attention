        "maybe not everyone has this ability , but maybe i can awaken that side in a person . this is dedicated to all those who feel that they can not continue , that they are not enough or are not worth much . i 've been alone all my life , i have nothing to brag about . i have a head full of dreams and sharing those dreams is a tragedy because everyone says `` no '' to me . i wo n't deny that many times i 've felt useless , but i 've managed to overcome it , how can we go there ? ",
        "we all have dreams , we all have goals , we all have objectives . many of these dreams or objectives have already been fulfilled , but what happens ? we happen to be victims of society , we are affected by the negative criticisms they make of us , and every day words become emotional killers who have the power to make a person feels bad . we all already have an opportunity to realize our dreams and fulfill our goals , we all already have a great investor and it is life . life . life invests time and space in waking up every morning after 8 or 10 hours of sleep , giving you the opportunity to wake up with a clear mind . ",
        "life gives you the opportunity to have one more day to accomplish your goals or work on your goal . for example , you want to be a musician , every morning you already have a chance to take your instrument and learn new things that will eventually lead you to become a big star and maybe you can have a business meeting with jamie oborne . some people on society are an obstacle in the way , massive emotional killers . i was a victim of psychological bullying . some people around me wanted to convince me that i 'm not attractive . ",
        "many times those people have told me `` better kill yourself '' or `` dead you 'd do the world a great favor '' but that 's not true . they , the cursed ones , may not have any goal in life and do n't have the same dreams as you . you have reasons to live , you have reasons to move on and have a perfect life for yourself , no matter what your appearance or personality is . the best decision you can make is to decide to do what you want to do . life is the best choice . ",
        "now , speaking of personal issues , society will never be satisfied with how you are . if you 're skinny , they 'll call you anorexic . if you 're fat , they 'll call you whale . if you 're over 30 , they 'll call you old . if you 're under 20 , they 'll call you a girl . and i can stay for an eternity making a list of all the negative things that society will always have to offend others . but that does n't matter , it does n't have to matter . ",
        "you 're you and everyone has to admire you for who you are . i arrived alone where i am , i study at the best university in the country and it has been excellent for me . no one helped me , but i set out to do it and i did it . the point is to stand up , continue and decide to pursue dreams . never share your dreams with most people , do it in silence and make them come true . you 'll impress people not because of how you look , but because of what you do . ",
        "today , what you do and what you know , is worth more than your physical appearance . do n't forget that . if you need help or you 'd like to talk to me , you can find me in 7 cups . explain what 's going on and i will contact you as soon as possible . thank you for taking a little time and a cup of coffee to read this text .
