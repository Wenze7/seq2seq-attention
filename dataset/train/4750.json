        "i started writing about google assistant before i 'd even fully unpacked . the company had posted up a week-long residency with a profile to rival any in vegas that first week of january . celine dion at caesar 's , david copperfield at the mgm grand , google at the las vegas convention center . the company wallpapered the vegas monorail and plastered the words `` hey google '' on every rentable screen in town . take that , donny and marie . that crazy booth in the convention center parking lot seemed like a terrible idea on tuesday when the rains opened up and swallowed it whole -- but a day later , when the lights went out on ces for a few hours , everyone came running to google and its free donuts . ",
        "our own booth at the sands , meanwhile , where a number of us were posted up for much of the week , was way too close to the giant google gumball machine . every ten or so minutes , cheers erupted from the crowd as another eager tech industry type won a home mini , after dutifully waiting in line for an hour or so . and then , on my last night , when i thought i 'd escaped the company 's presence for long enough to enjoy that run the jewels corporate gig , i walked out on the balcony of brooklyn bowl and spotted the same machine down below . ",
        "the damn thing was everywhere . google 's ces 2018 presence was an act of sheer brute force -- a consumer electronics blitzkrieg that some how managed to standout among the bright lights of america 's most stupidly garish city . the fact of the matter is that , even if the company had n't followed through on that promise , it would still have managed to capture plenty of headlines . but google delivered . after having virtually no presence at the show in past years , the company went from zero to 60 . practically no press conference or news release went by without some mention of assistant . ",
        "the company played its hand well at the show . there was no big google press conference , and it did n't release a single piece of its own hardware . instead , it harnessed the platforms of its highest profile tech partners -- sony , lg , lenovo , huawei and the like . at the latter 's press conference , an executive even came out on stage to run down the specifics of assistant -- though to be fair , perhaps huawei was simply filling time in the wake of some last minute adjustments . assistant made it onto virtually every manner of hardware at the show , from tvs to refrigerators to electric bike wheels . ",
        "and while the company went into the last holiday season with no direct competitor to the echo show , suddenly it had several , letting its hardware partners do all of the heavy lifting . from the looks of it , amazon 's got something to be concerned about on that front -- especially given the fact that the company went with the nuclear option a few months back , pulling youtube from amazon 's offering . amazon had a good show , too , albeit with a decidedly more subdued presence . there was no giant gumball machine or armies of employees in matching outfits screaming until the voices went hoarse , but the company handily sent along a list of alexa announcements at the end of each show day . ",
        "and the list is a solid one , particularly with the planned launch of alexa on several windows 10 pc -- effectively eating into cortana 's one stronghold . both companies ' respective assistants had a successful ces , but google 's list of devices go a long way toward shrinking the gap between the two players -- and take it even closer to its dream of device ubiquity . that positioning , coupled with the years of backend development that have coalesced behind assistant should leave amazon more than a little concerned about holding onto its place at the top of the heap .
