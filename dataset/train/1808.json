        "this is a woman who caused a great deal of drama for my partner and me last year and nearly broke us up . she lives in another country and he did n't think he was doing anything wrong but he was texting her several times a week and complaining about me/telling her stuff before me/using her as a shoulder to cry on . she was using him as a distraction from her `` unhappy marriage '' . it was like a co-dependent relationship/emotional affair . we had so many arguments about her -lrb- he thought he was doing no wrong in just texting her and said he 'd `` chosen me '' so there was nothing wrong in it . ",
        "we nearly broke up but eventually he said he 'd stop texting her . things have been ok between us but i mentioned her recently as i wanted to explain the whole emotional affair thing as a lot of people see no wrong if there 's nothing physical happening . he agreed that it had been inappropriate . he had a bit of a meltdown a couple of days ago because he 's been really stressed out about life and has been lying low although he emailed me yesterday and texted a little . he is ashamed of his behaviour and said he understands if i want to end things . ",
        "now i noticed that he is no longer following the ex on instagram . he was until very recently . she is still following him . he has n't commented on her posts for months but this is a strange development especially in light of his meltdown . why would he do this , now of all times ? any ideas ? i 'm thinking either he wants to commit to me fully and is shutting the door on her properly or he 's anticipating us breaking up and wants to `` distance '' himself from her , for some reason .
