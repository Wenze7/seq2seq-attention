        "cash-strapped volunteer emergency services like surf life saving clubs should be careful what they wish for , a chief executive has said . on tuesday , surf life saving northern region 's chief executive matt williams called for the government to treat surf clubs as fully-funded emergency services . however , surf life saving new zealand chief executive paul dalton said life-saving clubs should n't go it alone asking for funding from the new government and should work with other largely volunteer rescue groups . williams said his 17 northern region clubs , which supervised more than 500,000 beach-goers last year , gets `` zero '' direct government funding despite providing an `` essential service '' .

",
        "`` it 's almost negligent for the government to leave things as they are . `` we 've already had a reduction in services this year , '' volunteers were `` literally limping off beaches , doing 12-hour shifts '' covering shifts paid lifeguards used to cover . williams said government surf life saving oversight has been shunted between several ministries in the last eight years . surf life saving northern region needs $ 12 million per year to meet existing commitments despite increasing demand , williams said . most funding comes from philanthropic grants and fundraising drives . it 's time for surf life saving to `` have a conversation '' with the new government and regional councils `` who are now going through their funding rounds , '' paul dalton said . ",
        "but paul dalton said going it alone would mean the country 's 74 surf clubs risk alienating other volunteer-based groups including coastguard , the new zealand mountain safety council and search & rescue new zealand . the millions in funding needed by each group really adds up , presenting more challenges to `` long-term sustainability '' he said . `` we need to be coordinated in what we ask for from the government , you do have to be careful for what you work for '' . dalton is unsure if volunteer groups understand the implications of accepting full government funding either becoming part of a ministry and answerable to a minister . ",
        "presently , slnz is working through water safety new zealand on approaching government , dalton said . minister for the community and voluntary sector peeni henare said he 's aware of slnz 's request for more funding . although not directly funded by government , slnz does receive grants through various ministries and henare said he would need to meet with respective ministers to discuss any changes . `` i will commit to talking to my colleagues and have a discussion on how we can support and what more can we do . '' council contributions matt williams has praised northland and waikato regional councils ' commitment to funding surf life saving clubs in their areas but is concerned about auckland council support . ",
        "he said council 's new 2018-2028 draft long term plan gives no specific allocation to life saving clubs . auckland regional amenities funding board chairman vern walsh said the board would n't notify each life saving club 's 2018 operational allocation until february . auckland council environment and community committee chairwoman councillor penny hulse said the club 's council capital funding contribution has yet to be decided in ongoing the 2018-2028 draft long term plan process . while helping fund surf saving , council needed to balance the `` needs of the many other organisations that also require our support , '' hulse said . ",
        "`` i would certainly like to see more funding for surf lifesaving northern region and would welcome a discussion with central government '' .   "
