        "dear abby : i 'm at a loss as to how to stay in my 21-year marriage . in august , when our twin daughters leave for college , my wife and i will become empty nesters . we have n't had sex in more than 2 1/2 years , and before that it did n't happen more than a couple of times a year . my wife says she `` does n't feel a connection with me anymore '' . we have seen a counselor a couple of times over the past 12 years , but the most he has to offer now is that i will have to decide whether or not to accept this as my new normal . ",
        "we do n't fight , but we live like roommates , although we continue to share a bed . we are on opposite sides of the political spectrum , and i suspect that may have something to do with her sense of disconnect . the little affection progress we were making died the night of the presidential election . she seems content to continue like this . i hate the notion of divorce , both for what it would mean spiritually and for what it would do to our families and friends . can you help ? is this my new normal ? ",
        "dear `` is '' : couples on opposite sides of the political spectrum can still have successful marriages if they respect their mates and can discuss their differences intelligently and calmly . however , you state that your sex life has been the way it is for 21 years -- which makes me wonder whether the chemistry was strong to begin with . i do think you and your wife are overdue for a series of honest conversations , and the first should start with whether the difference in your political beliefs has affected the way she feels about you . ",
        "the next should start with asking her whether she was ever satisfied in the bedroom with you . if you can get her to talk about it , you may be able to find out where the two of you went off track and fix it . however , if you ca n't , then your counselor was correct . more advice : carolyn hax : surviving a year of stress and heartbreakdear abby : i 've been single for more than a year and playing the field , having casual relationships but never anything i was too invested in . ",
        "that changed recently when i met someone i 'll call `` eve . '' we have hit it off spectacularly and are very much into each other . the only issue is she has a kid . i 'm only 23 , and i 'm not in a position to be any kind of father figure . that being said , i would still love to be with eve and occasionally help out with her little one , but i do n't know how to open up and tell her directly that i 'm not prepared for the pressures of being a `` dad '' to a newborn . ",
        "how do i express this to her ? no white knight in knoxvilledear no white knight : `` daddyhood '' is n't a skill that every man is born with . some men are naturals at it ; others learn gradually through experience . tell eve that you care about her , but that at 23 you are not in a position to be a dad to her baby . in time , things may change -- gradually -- but not right now . it may or may not cause the end of the relationship . her first responsibility must be to her child , and a romance right out of the delivery room is too soon , `` white knight '' or no white knight .
