        "so far , the governments of liaoning , the inner mongolia autonomous region and tianjin have reportedly `` taken the initiative '' to admit that they had exaggerated their economic data in the past few years . china youth daily commented on tuesday : it is an intriguing timing that these provincial-level governments － more are expected to follow suit as the adulteration is probably not restricted to the three places － have acknowledged the inflation of their economic data , ranging from about 20 percent to 30 percent , mainly the gross domestic product , industrial added value and government revenue , on their own initiatives . ",
        "but instead of these governments being courageous , their honesty comes from external pressure . the central authorities will assume the responsibility for computing the gdp of provincial-level regions from next year . that makes now the last time the provincial-level governments will calculate and report their own gdp , and thus the last chance for the local governments to admit their faults in falsifying the data . if they miss this window of opportunity , they would face harsher punishments next year when the central authorities uncover the huge gap between the data they previously reported and the true situation . ",
        "tianjin and inner mongolia chose to do so now . there will surely be some punishments for the local officials . but they still think admitting the fault now is better than having their falsehoods exposed next year by the central authorities . in other words , their `` honesty '' is the lesser of two evils . in fact , the provincial governments ' conniving with city and county governments to lie about their gdp is almost an open secret , because the total sum of the gdp reported by the provincial-level regions has always been markedly higher than the national gdp calculated and issued by the national bureau of statistics each year , something that has for a long time been conveniently attributed to `` statistical technical problems '' . ",
        "after the central authorities take over the gdp calculations next year , it is believed the gdp of china will be more accurate in reflecting the true economic development situation of the country .   "
