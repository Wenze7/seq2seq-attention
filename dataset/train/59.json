        "one of the biggest decisions facing many companies undertaking the development of connected products or services is whether to build iot platform or to adopt an existing one . there is a broad array of capabilities and expertise required to build a truly scalable and secure iot platform , so companies must ask themselves if developing it all in-house is the best path . the cost and time associated with building and maintaining data infrastructure in-house , which is n't adding any differentiation to products or services , are substantial . before deciding whether they would tackle building their own iot platform , companies should seriously think about these critical questions : what building an iot platform entails ? ",
        "in the decision to build an iot platform , one should be aware that the most mature iot platforms on the market have accumulated over ten years of development . even mirroring the basic functionalities of the existing iot platforms may take years , since building an iot platform is a multidisciplinary complex endeavor comprising of lots of moving parts . if companies are n't experts already , there is a steep learning curve that will likely result in failures that can delay their time-to-market . iot platforms , like wolkabout iot platform , were built from the ground up to incorporate the necessary features and functionalities required for any successful iot solution . ",
        "but during the development process , there were many lessons learned from past mistakes . benefit from mistakes paid for by iot platform vendors is all the more reason not to follow the diy track . unless companies have already done a few large-scale iot implementations , they may not figure out all the possible pitfalls in time to avoid them , they will maybe run into problems as they scale their solutions , or as they try to make them interoperate with their future products and those from other manufacturers , or they will face issues as iot technologies continue to morph and evolve . ",
        "are we capable of building proper availability , security , and scalability ? availability : if the backend is n't constantly working , smart connected products or services at best are no better than the products/services companies are trying to enhance , and totally nonfunctional at worst . therefore , they must ask themselves if they are ready for 24/7/365 monitoring and consistent uptime . if not , the consequences can be steep . security : there are multiple vulnerability points in an iot system that most companies with the lack of internal expertise , do not know how to manage . ",
        "companies must make sure that their team is fully capable of using the latest strategies and technologies to protect data from attack or theft . scalability : the speed and volume of device traffic will more than likely grow as a company grows , and the company needs to make sure that its platform has the ability to handle the increased workload . it 's one thing to build a demo and run a limited trial , and quite another to manage billions of transactions in real-time and at the global scale . if a company uses platform that is n't built for scale , it might encounter one of many issues , including having to rebuild its system in a mid-life cycle . ",
        "do we have the in-house expertise in all the areas of technology that are needed for building an iot platform ? since iot projects are complex , it takes both money and time for the employees to understand advanced cloud computing , protocols such as mqtt , and building agents onto hardware devices . furthermore , iot platform , like any it investment , must be maintained throughout the entire product lifecycle . so , the team must research , architect , design , develop , and maintain the platform . hiring a developer team that is able to not only build , but maintain company 's platform long into the future is a serious challenge . ",
        "having this in mind , it is clear that the total cost of ownership can be lower in a buy scenario as you rely on 3rd party developers to handle new features , support , and maintenance . finally , does it make more business sense to build or buy an iot platform ? the research conducted by iot analytics stated that by outsourcing the already developed iot platform , companies can benefit from a ~ 50 % shorter implementation cycle and the assurance of working with iot experts . solutions built in-house usually take at least 6 -- 12 months to get off the ground , since there is likely to be a lot of research and potential setbacks to get through before reaching stability . ",
        "that means that time spent developing an iot platform leads to delayed time to revenue and a full year of advantage for competitors . by eliminating the need for custom development , companies can focus on what they do best , building great products or services and adding value where it matters . only after they 've done that , can they begin to focus on iot use cases that actually benefit the business and presumably , generate a return on investment . building an iot platform is not what generates an roi , but rather solving business challenges which put the company ahead of its competition . ",
        "considering time-to-market , developer resources , scalability , support , and security , it might be better and less risky if a company focuses on integrating with existing iot platform and on developing the rest of the iot project instead of starting from scratch . when a company decides not to reinvent the wheel , but to rapidly deploy the existing iot platform , then the question remains -- how to choose the right one among many that are on the market ? references : iot analytics . 5 things to know about the iot platform ecosystem . retrieved from www .
