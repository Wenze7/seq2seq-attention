        "u. s. bank executives and investors expect a long-term boost from the new federal tax code , but the biggest lenders will first need to book multi-billion-dollar charges that will muddle fourth-quarter results . banks will adjust deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for a lower corporate rate , and also take charges related to other tax changes . but analysts said the overall benefit from lower taxes will make up for any short-term hit . citigroup could report a quarterly loss of more than $ 15 billion and goldman sachs group will likely have lost about $ 3 billion , based on analyst estimates and recent profit warnings . ",
        "jpmorgan chase which reports first on friday morning , could show a 35 percent plunge in net income from a year earlier . bank of america , which reports the following wednesday , could show a 50 percent drop . `` it is no doubt going to be a messy quarter , '' said jason goldberg , bank stock analyst at barclays . citigroup is expected to take a $ 20 billion charge , largely because its losses during the 2007-2009 financial crisis will offset future taxes less now that the corporate tax rate has been cut to 21 percent from 35 percent . ",
        "goldman is expected to take a $ 5 billion charge , mostly due to a new repatriation tax on income kept outside of the united states . meanwhile , banks with deferred tax liabilities will be able to write those down thanks to the lower tax rates . in an extreme case , wells fargo is expected to report a $ 2.5 billion boost to its bottom line largely because it will owe less tax in the future on income from a set of businesses including mortgage servicing . but most analysts and institutional investors brush aside big one-time items , viewing them as accounting charges that reveal little about underlying financial performance or future profits . ",
        "instead , they are confident that big banks will be largely better off from paying a lower tax rate . still , just how much each bank will benefit will vary based on where they earn their income . bank of america could earn $ 4.5 billion , or 19 percent , more in 2019 than it would have without the lower rates , said keefe , bruyette & woods analyst brian kleinhanzl . that would more than cover an expected $ 3 billion fourth-quarter charge . but citigroup might get a profit pickup in 2019 of only $ 1.7 billion , or 11 percent , kleinhanzl said . ",
        "that would be far less than the $ 19.7 billion he expects in total fourth-quarter charges . bank of america earns about 90 percent of its income in the united states , according to estimates by analyst richard ramsden of goldman sachs . citigroup , meanwhile , has been getting only about 50 percent of its earnings at home , so will not benefit as much from lower u. s. tax rates . analysts plan to push executives in conference calls for clues about whether investors will benefit as much as they hope . banks could provide a boon by putting more money toward stock buybacks and dividends . ",
        "but there is worry they will be too quick to shift those dollars towards trying to beat competitors with lower prices on loans and better services for customers . `` banks benefit from a lower corporate tax rate , '' said barclays ' goldberg , `` but what will they do ? ''   "
