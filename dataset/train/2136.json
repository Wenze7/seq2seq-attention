        "new york -- the yankees reached one-year contracts with their remaining six players eligible for arbitration , leaving their projected luxury tax payroll at $ 177 million -- $ 20 million below the threshold . shortstop didi gregorius agreed at $ 8.25 million friday , pitcher sonny gray at $ 6.5 million and setup man dellin betances at $ 5.1 million . also reaching deals were relievers adam warren and chasen shreve , and backup catcher austin romine . new york 's luxury tax payroll rose to $ 149,927,500 for 15 players with agreements , and the projected total is well under the $ 197 million tax threshold . ",
        "the projection includes $ 10 million for the rest of the 40-man roster , $ 14,044,600 for benefits and a $ 3 million charge for cash transactions : a $ 5.5 million payment to houston as part of the brian mccann trade , a $ 500,000 payment to san diego as part of the chase headley deal and a $ 3 million credit from miami as part of the giancarlo stanton acquisition . yankees owner hal steinbrenner has vowed to end the team 's streak of 15 straight years of paying tax . if new york gets under the threshold , its base tax rate would reset from 50 percent to 20 percent in 2019 -- better positioning the yankees to pursue next offseason 's free agents , who could include bryce harper , manny machado and possibly clayton kershaw .
