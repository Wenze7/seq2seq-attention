",
        "a recent wwf survey shows that the ban has widespread support from most consumers asked . the organization suggests the ban is likely to substantially reduce ivory purchase . dr. fred kwame kumah , director of wwf regional office for africa , commented that `` china has shown great leadership on this urgent issue '' . `` this ban means we start 2018 a step closer to a world where the demand for ivory is extinct not elephants , '' kumah said . china 's state forestry administration says by fulfilling its commitment to ending processing and sales of ivory by the end of 2017 , china has sent a new-year gift to elephants .
