        "days after president donald trump 's highly controversial decision to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel , the official twitter account of palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas 's fatah party compared the u. s. president to adolf hitler , the former german chancellor and architect of the holocaust . `` i do n't see any difference , do you ? #handsoffalquds , '' reads the tweet containing a picture of trump right above one of hitler . the tweet was posted on december 14 , eight days following trump 's december 6 official declaration recognizing jerusalem as israel 's capital and announcing plans to move the united states embassy to the city . ",
        "al-quds is the arabic name for jerusalem . that tweet was preceded by one on december 12 comparing the u. s. to the islamic state group , referring to both as terror organizations . `` usa = isis = terror #handsoffalquds , '' read the tweet , posted six days following trump 's official announcement . the tweet also included a poster with pictures of four americans : trump , vice president mike pence , u. s. ambassador to israel david friedman and designated special envoy to the region jason greenblatt . the poster included the phrases `` stop raceism '' and '' #handsoffjarousalem . ",
        "`` the content was not posted to the party 's official facebook page , which has more than 108,000 likes . fatah 's twitter account has fewer than 7,000 followers . the tweets began garnering media coverage this week . trump announced earlier this month from the diplomatic reception room in the white house that the u. s. would recognize jerusalem as the official capital of israel , overturning u. s. official policy since 1949 , when the u. s. opposed israel 's decision to name jerusalem its capital . the decision also began the process of moving the u. s. embassy to jerusalem , though no official timetable has been given for when that will take place . ",
        "several hundreds muslims attend a gathering to protest against the recent announcement by president donald trump to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel on december 16 , 2017 in frankfurt , germany . thomas lohnes/getty images `` i 've judged this course of action to be in the best interests of the united states of america and the pursuit of peace between israel and the palestinians , '' trump said , referring to his decision . `` israel is a sovereign nation with the right like every other sovereign nation to determine its own capital . acknowledging this as a fact is a necessary condition for achieving peace . ",
        "`` trump 's decision encountered immediate blowback as protests broke out across much of the muslim world and both adversaries and allies alike criticized the decision . abbas also said he would no longer participate in any peace talks with the u. s. `` the united states has chosen to lose its qualifications as a mediator ... . we will no longer accept that it has a role in the political process , '' abbas said . additionally , the u. s. received a striking rebuke at the hands of the united nations general assembly . the assembly voted overwhelmingly to condemn trump 's decision , with 128 nations voting in favor of a condemnation , 35 abstaining and just nine opposing the motion .
