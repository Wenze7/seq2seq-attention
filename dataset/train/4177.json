        "this was only rafael nadal 's second retirement in a slam ; the other came against andy murray here in the 2010 aussie quarterfinals . for the fourth time in his career , rafael nadal lost a grand slam match when leading two sets to one . no . 1 rafael nadal concedes his match against marin cilic in the fifth set with an upper right leg injury . melbourne , australia -- one of the fittest athletes in tennis , rafael nadal struggled to walk as he entered the media room at the australian open following his loss in the quarterfinals tuesday night . ",
        "he stepped gingerly onto the two stairs that led to the table where he would answer questions . nadal grimaced in pain as he lowered his body to sit . it was difficult to watch . only 30 minutes earlier , the crowd at rod laver arena was waiting in anticipation for the start of fifth set between nadal , the top-seed here in australia , and marin cilic , the no . 6 player in the world . the high-quality play between the two , at that point , was worthy of a championship match . and just like that , it was over . ",
        "after cilic broke nadal to give him a 2-0 lead in the final frame , the croatian pumped his hand in celebration not realizing what was going on . then he caught a glimpse of nadal approaching the chair umpire , signaling a sudden and unexpected retirement to seal a 6-3 , 3-6 , 7-6 , 6-2 , 2-0 win . what a shame . nadal was making a bid to become the first men 's player in the open era to win each of the grand slam events twice . and he was making his run in a tournament that 's featured huge upsets in both the men 's and women 's field . ",
        "needless to say , the nadal-roger federer rematch from a year ago is not happening . instead , nadal 's immediate future will be an mri on wednesday to figure out the extent of an injury that he indicated was in his upper right leg . with his unexpected departure , nadal took a parting shot at tennis officials in the final question of the q&a with the media after being forced to retire from a grand slam event for just the second time of his career . `` somebody who is running the tour should think a little bit about what 's going on , '' nadal said . ",
        "`` too many people are getting injured . if we keep playing on this very , very hard surfaces what 's going to happen in the future with our lives . `` it 's been a week in which nadal has had several complaints . last week , his targets were the heat and the preferential treatment some players received to avoid playing in extreme conditions . both justifiable concerns . before tuesday , nadal never mentioned any kind of health concerns over the first four rounds , which seemed to be encouraging news . he ended last year early with a knee injury and decided to skip the australian open tune-up events in brisbane and sydney . ",
        "nadal , whose only australian open win came in 2009 , appeared primed to make a return trip to the finals . he had dropped just one set all week . and he was playing a semifinal opponent in cilic whom he had beaten five of the six times they had played . cilic 's only career win against nadal came in 2009 , at a time when the current defending us open and french open champion was recovering from knee and abdominal ailments . in a match that was competitive early wednesday , the world no . 1 said he started to feel pain in the next frame . ",
        "he took a medical break in the fifth game of that set and said he had limited his mobility the rest of the match . it was n't long afterward that nadal approached the chair umpire and shook his hand . it stunned nearly everyone in the arena , most of whom probably never saw the gesture . `` it 's very unfortunate because rafa is always fighting hard , always gives his best on the court , '' cilic said . `` he played a good tournament . obviously , it 's very sad for him to finish the way he did . ",
        "`` sad for nadal but an amazing opportunity for cilic on a day in which the no . 3 seed , grigor dimitrov , was upset by kyle edmund of great britain . cilic will play edmund in a semifinal thursday . cilic , in beating a world no . 1 for the second time in his career , reached his fifth grand slam semifinal . and in this upset-filled tournament where the remaining players in the men 's field feature roger federer and a bunch of other guys who do n't really scare you , cilic has to like his chances . ",
        "`` for me a big focus is to continue with my own game , '' cilic said of playing edmund . `` hopefully i 'm going to have another great match . `` as for nadal , who knows what 's next . after shaking hands with cilic , he walked over to his bench and slammed one of his wrist bands to the ground , a sign of the disgust he felt in being forced to retire . later , in the interview room , nadal could n't really pinpoint what happened to this body . he came in to tournament looking fit and trim . ",
        "his massive and well-defined arms were on full display as he wore a sleeveless shirt throughout the tournament . he got through his first four matches in a relative breeze . but it all came to an end abruptly , a sudden departure for a guy who would normally have to be carried off the court . `` i worked hard to be here , '' nadal said . `` we did all the things that we believed were the right things to do to be ready . ''   "
