        "hong kong activist joshua wong was jailed for three months wednesday for obstructing clearance of a major encampment during mass pro-democracy protests in 2014 , the second time he has been imprisoned over the rallies . wong , 21 , who had pleaded guilty to the contempt charge , was already on bail pending an appeal over a six-month sentence for another offence related to the umbrella movement . it comes as some fear prison terms for leading campaigners are discouraging young people from expressing their views and muzzling freedom of speech in the semi-autonomous city , where there are growing signs that china is increasing its control . ",
        "judge andrew chan described wong 's involvement in obstructing the clearance operation as `` deep and extensive '' in his written judgement . `` he played a leading role on that day , '' he added . `` the only appropriate punishment for mr wong is immediate imprisonment . `` fellow activist raphael wong was jailed for four months and 15 days wednesday over the same incident . chan denied both bail but defence lawyers pushed for him to reconsider his decision and were granted a further hearing wednesday afternoon . meanwhile both activists were taken into custody by security guards . ",
        "`` our determination to fight for democracy will not change ! '' raphael wong shouted as he was led away . ` no regrets ` ahead of the hearing , joshua wong -- who became the teenage face of the umbrella movement -- said he had `` no regrets '' about his involvement . `` they can lock up our bodies but they ca n't lock up our minds , '' he told reporters . dozens of supporters gathered outside the high court , chanting : `` civil disobedience , no fear ! '' and `` i 'm a hong konger , i want universal suffrage ! ",
        "`` the umbrella movement was an unprecedented rebuke to beijing as tens of thousands of protesters brought parts of the city to a standstill demanding fully free leadership elections to replace a system where the chief executive is selected by a pro-beijing committee . they failed to win concessions and since then leading activists have been charged over their involvement . beijing has been further incensed by the emergence of some activists calling for independence for hong kong since the failure of the umbrella movement to win reform . wong 's party demosisto wants self-determination for the city . hong kong has been governed under a `` one country , two systems '' deal since 1997 , when britain handed the territory back to china . ",
        "the agreement allows citizens rights unseen on the mainland , including freedom of speech and a partially directly elected parliament , as well as an independent judiciary , but there are concerns those liberties are being eroded . wong was jailed for six months in august on unlawful assembly charges for involvement in the storming of a fenced-off government forecourt known as civic square in september 2014 , which sparked the wider umbrella movement rallies . wong and fellow campaigners nathan law and alex chow were originally given non-custodial sentences by a lower court over that incident , but after the government 's intervention they were jailed by the court of appeal . ",
        "the government 's move was seen as further evidence of beijing 's growing influence over hong kong . their appeal against their sentences is currently being considered by hong kong 's top court .   "
