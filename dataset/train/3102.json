        "the iconic toy retailer -- which will stage its retail comeback next fall after shuttering its famous fifth avenue flagship in mid-2015 -- is in talks with a slew of manufacturers to keep fao unique . that , for example , means hooking up with the discovery channel to create a floor space for learning about `` stem '' -- or science , technology , engineering and math , says david conn , ceo of threesixty group , which acquired fao from toys ` r ' us in october 2016 . elsewhere , conn says he 's in talks with children 's brands like melissa & doug and spin master for popular kid lines like hachimals and paw patrol , which will open mini-shops inside the flagship store . ",
        "threesixty group designs and distributes consumer products to more than 70,000 retail stores and has its fingers many other brands . it already owns sharper image , smithsonian , and animal planet , so expect lots of big plush toys along with drones and remote-control cars . though the space at rock center will be a fraction of the size of the old , 61,000-square-foot flagship in the gm building , there will still be plenty of room for that giant piano keyboard that tom hanks danced on in the 1986 hit `` big . '' `` the brand is all about the large format , '' conn said , also signaling that giant plush toys and fao 's iconic clock tower wo n't be left out of the mix . ",
        "meanwhile , the company has created a line of fao-branded products that are now offered at 3,000 in-store boutiques at macy 's , bloomingdales and other spots . those , of course , also will be available at rock center . a classic fao schweetz shop will also be set up to deliver sugar fixes . the new location will reopen next fall at 30 rockefeller plaza , joining american girl at 75 rock , plus the lego store and nintendo nearby -- thus making rock center the next hot spot for kids . founded in baltimore by german immigrant frederick august otto schwarz in 1862 as the `` toy bazaar , '' the store opened in new york in 1870 . ",
        "the fifth avenue store had been one of the top five visited attractions in the city . conn expects the area 's foot traffic and mass of children 's stores will aid the comeback . so why rock , and not , say , times square ? `` we were seduced by the location in the heart of rockefeller center next to the christmas tree and ice skating rink , '' conn said .
