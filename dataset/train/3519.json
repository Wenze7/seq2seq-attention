        "allow me to abduct your attention for five minutes at most , thank you . i have intended , not once , to bring this up but i got inadequate universally facts to express it . first , am saying all this in great care because am in no way perfect and am adamant that no one is . for though , i love and appreciate both my friends and truth piety , requires me to choose the truth first . far gone , are the days that we were made to believe , that , only the old has knowledge and unquestionable wisdom . ",
        "with time , we have learnt that everyone can acquire knowledge and more so , it chooses no one in particular but lands on whoever passionately receives it . in the present-day world , we have these people who have grouped themselves , having this strong belief that they are perfect which definitely no one is . these people never listen to anyone , they always think their ideas are more important than what the others think . they have this egoistic attitude and they posses this gross haughty behavior that really irritates . members of this clique are always termed as `` know alls '' because being right is always their motto , they can not be wrong . ",
        "it 's their nature not to accept any guidance or advice from their juniors because deeply they assume juniors are klutz . they hate to depend on others intellectually . these individuals never choose words while conversing , pestering others and making them feel inferior is their satisfaction . they do n't actively and imaginatively put themselves into the other fellow 's situation and try to understand why they choose to be different from their own views . this group do n't take time to understand the problem the way the speaker sees it , they only reflect themselves as the most brilliant and forget most importantly , their image in terms of a fair human being . ",
        "someone once quoted `` those people who believe they know best should know that they know little '' though this never makes sense to all of us . learning is a continuous process , meaning we get to learn something new daily . initially , we were all born ignorant hence , no one can proudly declare that they know everything , unless you are god , and if you are then you are not included in this discussion . there is a good reason behind occupations , we have different jobs because no one can be a doctor , engineer , pilot and so on at the time and work best . ",
        "they split this jobs because no one can be spectacular at all of them and significantly avoid incompetence . together , let 's give an applause to those human beings who appreciate and motivate others . another clap for them for their willingness to listen and understand everybody . they do n't criticize , they simply point out ones limitations in an accurate manner and support them with factual explanation and afterwards give out advice on how to change . definitely , they are human too and have their own weaknesses but they manage to make everyone around them comfortable . ",
        "they create good unforgettable memories with their acquaintances and live them happy . the surest way to bring about more harmonious relations with every person you meet is to try and understand what they say , teach when you can and appreciate everyone . living in this competitive world , most of us are most of the time concerned with getting our own views across , and we tend to find other people 's speeches a tedious interruption of our ideas . everyone sometimes strongly believes that they are correct , even when clearly wrong , which is a normal thing , but accepting to be taught is the most important thing . ",
        "no one knows everything , so do n't despise anyone . thank you for your time . i am really honored , please share this for your friends to gain what you 've gained .   "
