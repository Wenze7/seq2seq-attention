        "washington - after a critical loss for republicans in alabama last month , president donald trump is wading back into congressional politics on thursday when he travels to western pennsylvania to signal his backing for the party 's candidate in a special election . trump said on twitter on thursday he was making the trip `` in order to give my total support '' to rick saccone , the republican seeking to replace representative tim murphy . murphy resigned in october amid a sex scandal . `` rick is a great guy . we need more republicans to continue our already successful agenda ! '' ",
        "trump said . saccone will meet trump on the tarmac when he lands in pennsylvania . afterward , trump will tour an industrial equipment company outside pittsburgh , where he will tout the tax-reform legislation passed by congress last month . the democratic candidate in the march 13 election to replace murphy is conor lamb , a former marine and u. s. attorney . the race is being watched nationally as an indicator of whether democrats can be competitive in republican-leaning congressional districts ahead of november 's mid-term elections , when control of both houses of congress will be at stake . ",
        "trump won the district by nearly 20 points in the 2016 presidential election and surprised political observers by winning pennsylvania , traditionally a democratic-leaning state , by less than 1 percent . in an interview with reuters on wednesday , trump pledged to be heavily involved in congressional races , including the one to replace murphy . trump 's last foray into congressional politics did not go well . in a special u. s. senate election in alabama late last year , the president first backed the incumbent candidate in the republican primary , luther strange , who had been named temporarily to fill the seat vacated by jeff sessions when trump named him u. s. attorney general . ",
        "after strange lost to roy moore in the primary trump switched his support to moore . the president stood by him even after moore was accused of sexual misconduct - allegations that the republican candidate denied . moore lost to democrat doug jones in the general election , a stunning result in deeply conservative alabama and shaving republicans ' majority in the senate to 51-49 . exit polls showed many voters turned out to register their disapproval of trump . on tuesday , democrats scored an upset in a wisconsin state senate special election in a district trump won by about 17 points . ",
        "republican wisconsin governor scott walker on twitter called the result `` a wake up call '' for the party there .   "
