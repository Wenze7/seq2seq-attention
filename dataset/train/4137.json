        "afp/file / mandel ngan trump will undergo a physical on friday at the walter reed national military medical center in bethesda , maryland , shown here in 2015donald trump is headed to the doctor : later this week , the 71-year-old us president will undergo his first physical since taking office at a military hospital just outside washington . but his critics who have openly questioned his mental health , as well as his supporters looking for proof the attacks are wrong , will be disappointed , as physicians are only looking at his weight , blood pressure and cholesterol levels . ",
        "no psychiatric tests are planned on friday at the walter reed national military medical center for trump , who has described himself as a `` very stable genius . `` in 2015 , trump 's personal doctor harold bornstein insisted -- in terms seen as a bit too glowing -- that the real estate mogul would be `` the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency . `` but questions persist . a new tell-all book by michael wolff paints a portrait of a man whose closest aides doubt his ability to govern . the president has no obligation to undergo an annual physical , and even if he does , he is not required to reveal the results . ",
        "but it has become something of a tradition . and the white house says that trump , the oldest man ever to enter the oval office , will follow in the footsteps of his predecessors . in the 1980s , during ronald reagan 's second term , a lively debate erupted over whether his intellectual capacity was deteriorating . several years after he left office , reagan announced that he was suffering from alzheimer 's disease . in 1994 , former president jimmy carter himself raised the alarm bell about such situations , writing in the journal of the american medical association about the `` continuing danger '' to the nation of a president becoming disabled , especially by `` a neurologic illness . ",
        "`` but nothing has changed since then about presidential succession , or how presidential health is evaluated . - draft law - in april , democratic lawmaker jamie raskin proposed a bill that would create a panel of 11 people -- mainly psychiatrists and neurologists -- who could be called upon to assess the president 's mental health . the draft had at its core the 25th amendment to the us constitution , adopted in 1967 , which says the vice president would become president `` in case of the removal of the president from office or of his death or resignation . ",
        "`` afp / jim watson trump has dismissed questions about his mental health , calling himself a `` very stable genius `` but the amendment provides no specifics about how the president 's mental health would be assessed . `` we need this body in general , not just for this presidency but for every future presidency , '' raskin told afp in an interview . `` the framers of the 25th amendment understood the perils of having a president who is somehow incapacitated in the nuclear age , '' he explained . `` i turn on the tv and radio , and people are arguing about whether the president has a neurological incapacity or whether he is mentally fit , '' raskin said . ",
        "`` i do n't think mental health is a partisan issue ... what we really need is a process by which this could be examined if we arrive at a crisis . `` in a republican-led congress , raskin 's draft has no chance of being approved . but it could fuel the larger debate . for now , some media outlets have called on specialists to offer an analysis of the 45th president from a distance . they look at his tweetstorms , his sometimes surprising body language and his sporadic difficulty in speaking -- offering myriad explanations , all of them limited by the fact that they have not examined trump . ",
        "white house spokesman hogan gidley slammed journalists for what he called an `` absolute dereliction of duty '' in reporting opinions of `` psychiatrists who have never sat down and talked to the president . '' `` it 's repugnant , '' gidley said monday .   "
