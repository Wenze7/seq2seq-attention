        "the mainstream media loves to shame bitcoin mining for using more energy than denmark , but contrary to popular belief , it 's still less than 1 % of the total energy used by the united states . media , bank executives , and misinformed individuals love spreading any type of fear , uncertainty , and doubt about bitcoin at any opportunity . this is just awful and irresponsible . blockchain technology/bitcoin is the most innovative invention since the creation of the internet and the understanding of this technology continues to be convoluted due to the circulation of incorrect information . ",
        "the majority of people fail to understand that we are witnessing the most incredible phenomena right before our eyes , for the first time in the civilized world , we are seeing the separation of state and money . remember , if innovation and change were easy it would happen quietly . i plan to show you not only how wrong the media is about bitcoin 's energy usage , but how other widely accepted practices expend much more energy than bitcoin . the overarching design of bitcoin mining : to start , bitcoin mining is just the process that transactions are verified and added to the public ledger , known as the blockchain . ",
        "miners , or computers , are rewarded with bitcoins for verifying and securing the network . the mining process involves compiling transactions into blocks and trying to solve a difficult puzzle . the participant , or computer , that solves the puzzle first gets to place the next block on the blockchain and claim their bitcoin , or block reward . here is an important part , the block reward is halved roughly every 4 years , with the current block reward at 12.5 bitcoins . this diminishing block reward will continue until all 21 million bitcoins are released . ",
        "here is the second important part , the difficulty of mining each block , or the amount of energy needed to solve each block , can be adjusted . the mining difficulty adjusts itself with the aim of keeping the rate of block discovery constant , so if there is more computational power dedicated towards mining , the difficulty will adjust upwards to make mining harder . vice versa . the importance of block rewards halving : it is important to realize that bitcoin miners are running a business that is expensive with a high monthly overhead . so simple economic theory tells us that miners will only continue to operate as long as they find it profitable . ",
        "when the bitcoin protocol experiences a halving of a block reward , and the price of bitcoin stays the same , by theory , you should expect half of the miners to cease operations . however , since the price of bitcoin has been steadily rising , miners have still found the act of mining to be profitable . the importance of mining difficulty being adjusted : it is important to realize that no matter how much energy is being deployed on the bitcoin blockchain , the mining difficulty adjusts accordingly so that only one block is produced every 10 minutes . ",
        "so miners will cease operation if the difficulty increases to the point of unprofitability . in essence , the bitcoin protocol has been designed to decrease energy consumption over time . for example , in 2009 the cpu 's used to mine bitcoins used 1 million times more energy than the current asics . these bitcoin miners will continue to find ways to operate more efficiently and employ cheaper energy available to them , like hydroelectric plants and renewable energy resources . putting bitcoins energy usage in perspective : currently , it is estimated that bitcoin mining consumes about 9 terrawatt-hours per year . ",
        "keep in mind that this is a rough estimate from several different surveys . however , it is very evident that the data centers in the us , gold mining , and global fiat production all consume more energy than bitcoin . below are the list of annual energy consumption for various tasks : bitcoin mining -- 9 terrawatt-hours per yearglobal production of fiat currencies -- 11 terrawatt-hours per yearoperating data centers in us -- 16 terrawatt-hours per yeargold mining -- 130 terrawatt-hours per yearit becomes clear very quickly that the argument for bitcoin mining using excessive energy is completely overstated . ",
        "also , these numbers do not include the massive amount of energy spent on operating bank vaults , security systems , transportation via armored cars , or even basic energy needed to operate a branch of a bank . example from history : in 2006 , the department of energy was slamming and media shaming google 's data centers for consuming enough power to run 200k homes in the united states . the department of energy continued to claim that google 's energy usage would double every five years . however , contrary to their claim , time proved that google 's electricity consumption flattened . ",
        "google contributed this to better cooling systems and power management that improved their efficiency . summary : after reading this article it is safe to say that the concerns over energy consumption for bitcoin are overblown . it is also important to realize that these miners are converting electricity into something much more useful to the global economy .
