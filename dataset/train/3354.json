        "`` i 'm going to japan . what can i do when i get there ? '' i have been asked many , many , many times . yes , i even get messages from strangers asking me this . i wish i were joking , but no , i am not . japan causes fascination and `` obsession '' in everyone . i mean , i do not want to brag but here you have it all . i mean you can rock the world here , baby . . ! !! if you are willing to work hard , be friendly and respectful , then people will welcome you with `` arms wide open '' like the song . ",
        "you know , the song `` arms wide open '' from creed . nobody ? god , i feel so old . ! !! anyway , as i was saying , you can have it all here , are you into anime , video games , and j-pop ? then this is the `` tengoku '' for you . are you into fashion ? then you definitely should go to harajuku and shibuya , the fashion center of japan are you into michelin restaurants ? we have several , and as we would say in american english , we have a bunch of them . ",
        "are you more into shopping ? then go to ginza , where we have the most luxurious brands you can ever imagine . are you into history , i mean you are into history ? then kyoto is the perfect place for you . japan is a wonderful place , where you can find anything , i mean literally anything at any time . do n't believe me ? well , then i invite you to go to your closest `` konbini '' and check for anything you might want to buy . my own husband , yes , ladies and gentlemen-pause for effect-while i put a hand on heart , my own husband did n't believe this . ",
        "but when we got lost in another town , we went to a `` konbini , '' and without faith , he asked for bath salts , and to his surprise , the shop worker told him `` sure , what kind would you like , sir ? '' i was glowing with happiness because i proofed the man wrong . . ! ! i am kind of dancing in my chair , but i am sure you guessed that . when you come here , just relax and enjoy . what did you say ? what about the language barrier ? ",
        "well , you shall not worry , because japanese people are working really hard on their english abilities , and believe me if you give us a beautiful wide smile , when ask us to give you directions , we would gladly give them to you . you just have to say , please and thank you .   "
