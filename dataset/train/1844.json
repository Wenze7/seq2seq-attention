        "getty imagewhen outkast won a grammy for album of the year in 2004 , nearly the whole world seemed to think that the dynamic atlanta duo was the most deserving . before carlos santana and faith hill read the list of nominees , someone in staples center in los angeles yelled `` andre , '' as in andre 3000 , who had just performed `` hey ya ! '' when santana got to speakerboxxx/the love below , he pumped his fist in the air like he was cheering on his favorite team . by then , the double outkast album had already sold 3.1 million copies . ",
        "in regards to hip-hop and its merits , despite the genre 's enormous impact on our music and our vernacular , the industry has n't quite been in agreement since . only arrested development , lauryn hill and macklemore and ryan lewis have won best new artist , while in other big categories like song and record of the year , hip-hop gets overlooked altogether . if a rap artist wins album of the year in 2018 , it will be for the first time since outkast won the trophy in 2004 . jay-z , kendrick lamar and childish gambino are all nominated for the trophy , which makes a win for hip-hop seem actually plausible . ",
        "yet , because of the nature of outkast 's win , nothing is for certain , nothing is for sure . two years prior , of all the records nominated for album of the year , the four-times platinum stankonia was both the critical and fan favorite . it was an artistic leap forward for the already-ambitious pair , and the blockbuster singles `` b. o.b. , '' `` ms. jackson , '' and `` so fresh so clean '' made a post-civil rights era american south global takeover seem not only impending , but welcome . the overall reception struck andre 3000 so much that when speakerboxxx/the love below won for album of the year , he said , `` stankonia is not our first album . ",
        "do the history . '' yet the o brother , where art thou ? soundtrack , a t-bone burnett-led , carefully researched retread of what the american south had done before , would win the coveted trophy instead . by the time speakerboxxx/the love below was nominated for that same category , outkast already had the name recognition that made a big win seem overdue . the only grammy nomination outkast received prior to 2001 was for `` rosa parks , '' for best rap performance by a duo or group . that is to say nothing of 1994 's southernplayalisticadillacmuzik , 1996 's atliens and 1998 's aquemini -- outkast albums that amounted to atlanta hip-hop 's man on the moon moment , and better testaments to how big and dre functioned as a duo . ",
        "going into 2004 , speakerboxxx/the love below 's lead singles `` the way you move '' and `` hey ya ! '' climbed into the top two positions on the billboard hot 100 , making outkast only the fourth act to achieve that feat . those songs stayed there for eight straight weeks , while sometimes replacing each other on the top spot . `` the way you move '' topped billboard 's rap charts . `` hey ya ! '' broke the top 20 in modern rock , adult top 40 and latin pop airplay . by then , the recording academy already had a history of rewarding pop-friendly singles . ",
        "will smith won four grammys total , including best rap performance for dj jazzy jeff and the fresh prince 's `` parents just do n't understand '' -- the first time the grammys had a rap category , period . the grammy screening committees could n't possibly ignore the bizarre `` the way you move '' and `` hey ya ! '' chart takeover , on top of the album sales that eventually had speakerboxxx/the love below go diamond , selling more than eminem 's the marshall mathers lp . `` we were doing things that had never been done , '' phillana williams , head of marketing of arista records , said to mtv news . ",
        "`` putting out two singles from an album that was not a straight outkast album , but one from dre and one from big boi ? launching them simultaneously at radio and trying to do that at urban and pop ? but then they went to all formats , because nobody wanted to be left out . everyone wanted both songs ! '' speakerboxxx/the love below started as a batch of tracks andre 3000 had been crafting at home for five years . dre originally thought it would act as a soundtrack to a film directed by outkast 's longtime video director bryan barber . ",
        "`` four or five songs in , i told big boi about these plans , and he was cool with the idea but did n't know if it was the right time , '' andre 3000 said in third coast : outkast , timbaland and how hip-hop became a southern thing . `` we had just won grammys and big boi and my manager thought the record company would be expecting to cash in on the next outkast album . '' so what speakerboxxx/the love below did instead was divide outkast 's seemingly disparate influences into two discs , a big boi album and an andre 3000 album . ",
        "the latter especially could n't have been more bored with rap , telling the guardian about how his tastes ranged from aphex twin to the buzzcocks , and how his dj fell asleep during a strokes concert . but outkast 's manager michael `` blue '' williams had long explained to music directors and concert bookers that the group 's appeal extended beyond regional and genre lines . `` my goal has always been for outkast to be the biggest rap bands of all time and eventually one of the all-time great rock bands , '' williams said to pbs ' frontline in 2004 . ",
        "`` because there 's a difference between a rap band and a rock band , and i think at the phase that we are right now , we 've become a rock band . when you 're a rock band , your numbers are different . when you 're a rock band you can make a million dollars a night , to do a show . when you 're a rap band , you can make $ 100,000 a night . that might be the top you 'll make . and so that 's the difference . '' you could argue that speakerboxxx/the love below apparently made such versatility all the plainer for the grammys committee to see . ",
        "vince staples might phrase that point differently . `` it probably got because was able to say , ` oh this is n't a hip-hop album , ' '' he said to npr just last month . to rephrase : this landmark hip-hop moment at the grammys was n't about rewarding hip-hop for what it is . this is n't entirely like how the oscars overlooks comedies , though it is still a telling statement on what deserves industry recognition . there are at least four more rap artists who have been nominated for an album of the year grammy , but did n't win . ",
        "eminem 's the marshall mathers lp lost to steely dan 's two against nature in 2000 . kanye west 's late registration lost to u2 's how to dismantle an atomic bomb , as he was touring with u2 . graduation , west 's successful bid for arena rock success , lost to herbie hancock 's rivers : the joni letters . like west , kendrick lamar has been nominated for album of the year for three consecutive full-lengths , including damn . lamar 's good kid , m. a.a. d. city lost to daft punk 's random access memories in 2013 , while taylor swift 's 1989 won over to pimp a butterfly two years later . ",
        "drake somehow did n't earn his first album of the year nomination until last year , with views . you could try to justify these snubs based on artistic merit , critical reception or sales figures . what actually seems to be happening , though , is that hip-hop is being held to an entirely different standard , a near impossible one , based on speakerboxxx/the love below 's win . this does n't allow for innovations within the genre , much less indie success stories to be celebrated within that space . `` it 's like winning the super bowl , '' big boi said in 2013 , on winning album of the year . ",
        "but staples figures that he would never know that feeling . on what rap artists should want from the grammys , the big fish theory artist further told npr , `` if you want that best rap album , then of course . but then it 's kind of obvious that you probably wo n't get album of the year . we 're not getting many packaging grammys . it 's a lot of stuff that we 're not really getting . '' this year 's ceremony could help change that course . as mentioned aboved , three of the contenders for album of the year are hip-hop artists , even though childish gambino 's awaken , my love ! ",
        "is more traditional funk than any outkast album tried to be . should they win , no one would be surprised if the artist in question calls this a win for hip-hop , acknowledging the momentousness of the occasion . but they should also feel free to address the good , hard work that the grammys had already missed -- if they implore the industry to do the history .
