        "peaceful co-existence , rather than war : that 's how sooty mangabeys , a monkey species found in west africa , handle infection by siv , a relative of hiv , and avoid developing aids-like disease . to learn how sooty mangabeys achieve this important health feat , a yerkes national primate research center-led team of scientists has sequenced the sooty mangabey genome . by comparing it with the genome of humans and other nonhuman primates , the team has found clues that may help people infected with hiv . studying how siv and its natural hosts co-exist without aids could translate to improve long-term care of individuals infected with hiv , reduce mother-to-infant transmission as well as guide the development of a vaccine against hiv . ",
        "the results are scheduled for publication in nature january 4 . led by guido silvestri , md , chief of microbiology and immunology at the yerkes research center at emory university , the scientists say this is the first example of inter-species genome analysis for identifying and validating genes that may regulate an important disease process . `` we are taking advantage of an evolutionary experiment that took place over many thousands of years , revealing how it is possible to be infected with siv and not progress to aids , '' says silvestri , who is also professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at emory university school of medicine and emory vaccine center , and a georgia research alliance eminent scholar . ",
        "co-first authors are david palesch , phd , a yerkes postdoctoral fellow , and steve bosinger , phd , assistant professor of pathology and laboratory medicine and director of yerkes ' genomics core . jeffrey rogers , phd , and his team of geneticists at the baylor college of medicine human genome sequencing center performed the genome sequencing and assembly . dr. rogers is a member of the yerkes national scientific advisory board . additional contributors include greg tharp , robert norgren , beatrice hahn , daniel sauter and frank kirchhoff . `` this project is a wonderful example of the scientific advances possible when we combine whole genome sequence analysis with expert understanding of the causes of disease , in this case the immune response to siv infection , '' says rogers . ",
        "`` by integrating genomics expertise from the baylor college of medicine with the long-term experience of the yerkes/emory team regarding sooty mangabeys , we have generated truly exciting and important results , '' he continues . sooty mangabeys , along with other monkeys , such as drills and african green monkeys , are natural hosts for siv . when infected by this virus , they maintain healthy levels of immune cells and do not progress to aids . that protection contrasts with non-natural hosts , such as rhesus macaques , which do progress to aids-like disease , making them a model for understanding hiv infection of humans . ",
        "genetic analysis has shown hiv infection of humans arose through multiple cross-species transmissions of siv from nonhuman primates , including chimpanzees and sooty mangabeys . `` we found two big differences in proteins of the immune system in the sooty mangabey genome , which we hope will help us better understand why sooty mangabeys avoid aids despite siv infection '' says palesch . one of the major differences is an adhesion molecule on immune cells . called icam2 , this molecule is not functional in sooty mangabeys . a deletion in the icam2 gene appears to be specific to sooty mangabeys and is not found in other siv natural hosts or other primates , such as baboons and macaques . ",
        "in addition , sooty mangabeys have an alteration of the tlr4 protein , which impairs its function . tlr4 is part of innate immune sensing and triggers activation in response to components of bacterial membranes . `` this finding is intriguing , '' silvestri says , `` because damage to intestinal barriers and bacterial release contributes to chronic immune activation , which is associated with aids progression in hiv-infected humans and siv-infected non-natural hosts . `` in sooty mangabeys , a less active form of tlr4 may reduce immune activation in response to siv infection . the tlr4 alteration was shared in the genomes of sooty mangabeys and other natural hosts , such as vervets , drills and colobus monkeys , but was absent in non-natural hosts , such as macaques , suggesting some evolutionary advantage . ",
        "the scientists followed up to these findings to show how these differences affect immune cell behavior . a next step is to explore subtler genomic differences between sooty mangabeys and their relatives . in previous work dr. silvestri led , he and his research team compared the immune systems of sooty mangabeys and other natural hosts with hiv-infected humans , including viremic non-progressors , a unique group of patients that avoids hiv-related disease in similar fashion . the current study expands on that research by being the first to compare whole genome sequencing and identify pathways that may confer resistance to aids . ",
        "with the success of this approach , the yerkes team is planning future sequencing projects that look at additional natural host species . the yerkes team also plans deeper studies on the genes it identified . `` future studies in which icam2 and tlr4 are manipulated in vivo during siv infection are necessary to reveal whether and to what extent these two genes directly impact the non-pathogenic nature of siv infection in this host species , '' the authors write . `` it 's a really exciting time in aids research , '' says bosinger . `` with the berlin patient , who is the only person to have been cured of aids , we 've seen hiv cure is possible . ",
        "sooty mangabeys and other natural hosts have for years served scientists as a roadmap to aids therapies , but we 've only been able to look at small pieces of the map at a time . now , by examining the entire genome of these species , our team believes we can accelerate discoveries that make a difference in the fight against hiv and aids , '' he continues .
