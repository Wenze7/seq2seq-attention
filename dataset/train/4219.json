        "san diego -- live music . free t-shirts . a `` fweedom '' celebration with mystery prize boxes worth up to $ 500 , and a shot at a behind-the-scenes tour . marijuana legalization arrives monday in california with lots of hoopla , but only a handful of cities will initially have retail outlets ready to sell recreational pot . los angeles and san francisco were late to approve local regulations , meaning no recreational pot shops there will open their doors monday . the lucky few outlets with licenses -- mainly in san diego , the san francisco bay area , palm springs area and santa cruz -- think they have an edge being first out of the gate . ",
        "but excitement about california joining the growing list of states and washington , d. c. , with legal recreational weed is tempered with the stresses of ensuring shelves are stocked in the face of uncertain demand . the state issued its first 20 retail licenses two weeks ago and an additional 22 trickled out since , some for already established medical marijuana businesses that have thrived in california for two decades and will continue . alex traverso , a spokesman for the california bureau of cannabis control , said a dozen employees were vetting applications to `` issue as many licenses as we can '' in the coming days . ",
        "the temporary permits represent just a sliver of the thousands of licenses expected to eventually be issued for retail recreational sales . local permits are a prerequisite for the state licenses , and many cities -- including los angeles , san francisco and long beach -- have yet to issue any local rules , putting huge swaths of the state on the sidelines for opening day . the palm springs area had nine of the state 's first retail licenses , including seven in cathedral city , population 54,000 . san diego had eight . santa cruz and san jose had four each and others were scattered around the san francisco bay area and the state 's northern reaches . ",
        "an outlet known as caliva in san jose is promoting the `` fweedom '' celebration monday with the prize boxes and exclusive tours of its growing areas , along with massages , acupuncture , waffle desserts and music with `` mellow beats . `` a county supervisor will attend a 7 a. m. ribbon-cutting ceremony at kindpeoples in santa cruz . its chief executive , khalil moutawakkil , said weed has long been `` a huge part '' of the culture of the oceanfront college town . berkeley patients group , which opened as a medical marijuana dispensary in 1999 and has received a permit for recreational sales , expects lines around the block to mark opening day . ",
        "the mayor of the city that includes the university of california , berkeley campus is expected at a ribbon-cutting ceremony at 6 a. m. `` you 'll see the people who have been consumers for decades and they were for legalization back in the '60s , '' said sean luse , chief operating officer . `` but you 're also going to see a more mainstream group of people who were waiting for the green light . `` harborside is planning brass bands at its locations in oakland and san jose , with flags and t-shirts for the first 100 people in line . ",
        "a few outlets with recreational licenses are passing on the hoopla . for them , excitement at being first out of the gate is tempered with the stresses of complying with new regulations . golden state greens , with a modest storefront amid car repair shops and budget hotels in san diego , houses a bustling business that has sold marijuana for medical purposes since 2015 . it will open its doors at 7 a. m. monday , like it does every other day of the year . after california voters approved recreational weed last year , the shop changed its name from point loma patients consumer cooperative , reflecting its ambitions for a broader clientele . ",
        "`` we 're planning for the worst and hoping for the best , '' said adam knopf , its chief executive . `` there are a lot of unknown factors but we 're prepared . `` gary cherlin , chief executive of desert organic solutions collective in north palm springs , received holiday news of his recreational sales permit as he devised promotional packages with hotels aimed at tourists who come for warm winters . he said being among the first shops to sell recreational pot means less competition . `` i do n't know how many more are coming but they do n't have a lot of time left , '' he said . ",
        "mount shasta patients collective , which opened three years ago in the northern part of the state as a medical dispensary , has already turned away people coming for recreational pot . others with medical marijuana cards have been stocking up ahead of price increases expected after recreational weed is legal . `` we 'll have all hands on deck , '' general manager austin freeman said of opening day . `` it could be really hectic .
