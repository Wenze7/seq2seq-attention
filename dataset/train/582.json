",
        "this is , therefore , the fifth and final game between the avalanche and stars . that said , the avalanche have only been in the american airlines center one other time this season , a 3-1 loss . but this happened : it looks like patrik nemeth and tyler seguin had some bad blood between them . hopefully they got it out , though , because nemeth was injured , and we need our d-men healthy . how to enjoy the gamegame time : january 13 , 7:00 pm mttv networks : altitude 2 tv , fs-sw radio : altitude radio before the game , which is in dallas , the stars will honor former dallas goalie ed belfour as part of the 25th anniversary reunion nights series .

",
        "the stars and wild . colorado has two games in hand over the stars and three over the wild . what 's more , the avalanche are unbeaten in 2018 . they also have a five-game win streak on the line . last year , teams coming off the bye-week often had to face teams that had been playing those five days . quite often the teams coming off of vacation were rusty . this season , the nhl organized the schedule so that teams played other teams coming off a bye-week . so , the stars and avs are on even footing . ",
        "they 've both beaten each other twice . with a win tonight , the avalanche wo n't overtake the second wild card berth , but they will be just one point out with games in hand . the avalanche have shown they can win big games , as they did against the wild before the bye-week . but that was a home game . the avs need to show they can win big games on the road , too . they 're just 7-9-2 in other teams ' barns . players to watchthree players suiting up tonight have been named to the all star team -- tyler seguin and john klingberg from the stars and nathan mackinnon from the avalanche . ",
        "naturally , we 'll be watching them . for the stars , i think we avs fans will be watching alexander radulov with a little side-eye because he was an almost-av . he has 38 points , which would put him third in colorado for scoring . for the avalanche , i think we 're going to start watching goalie jonathan bernier a lot closer . semyon varlamov is expected to be out at least until the end of the month with more groin problems . that makes bernier our number-one goalie for the next couple weeks . last season bernier went 21-7-4 with the anaheim ducks . ",
        "unfortunately , bernier has already matched his loss total from last season in just 17 games , having gone 9-7-1 . however , bernier was perfect in the home stand , earning second star of the week honors for the nhl for his 3-0 record . next : 1st avs practice after bye-weekafter tonight 's game , the colorado avalanche head home for a nice three-game home stand against two important western conference rivals -- the anaheim ducks and the san jose sharks -- as well as the new york rangers . the colorado avalanche hope to keep their win streak alive , and get closer to a playoff spot , with a win against the dallas stars tonight .
