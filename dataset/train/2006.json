        "gaza city , gaza strip -- palestinian medical records in the gaza strip show that a paraplegic man who died during a violent protest along the border with israel earlier this month was killed by a bullet that struck him in the head . the records , obtained by the associated press on thursday , shed new light on a case that has become a rallying cry among palestinians since president donald trump recognized jerusalem as israel 's capital . ibrahim abu thraya , who lost his legs in a separate incident several years ago , was killed on dec. . ",
        "15 in clashes that broke out along the israeli border . palestinians say abu thraya was shot deliberately by an israeli sniper -- a claim the military denies . the medical records , which include a hospital report and a death certificate , say that abu thraya , 29 , was struck by a bullet above his left eye and died from bleeding in the brain . the same findings were detailed in a report by the palestinian red crescent ambulance service reviewed by the ap . the reports did not specify who fired the bullet or what caliber it was . ",
        "while the dec. . 15 clash turned violent , with protesters hurling stones , firebombs and burning tires at the border fence , witnesses have said there was no gunfire from the palestinian side . the protest came amid a wave of violence that has erupted in the palestinian territories since trump 's jerusalem declaration . twelve people have died so far , almost all in gaza . a picture of the 29-year-old abu thraya on a wheelchair , raising the palestinian flag and flashing a `` victory '' sign , has become ubiquitous in gaza . he has emerged as a symbol of resistance to trump 's jerusalem move , which the palestinians largely see as siding with israel . ",
        "an israeli military investigation after the shooting said abu thraya had participated in an `` extremely violent '' protest . the investigation , which the military closed after one day , said that live fire was employed against the main instigators but was not directed at abu thraya and that it was impossible to determine the cause of his death . the investigation cleared troops of any wrongdoing and said it found no `` moral or professional failures '' in the soldiers ' conduct . the military says it has repeatedly requested information about abu thraya 's injuries through official channels and would examine any information provided . ",
        "the ap showed the report from gaza 's shifa hospital and the death certificate to the army . in a statement , the military said the report `` was not known '' to it . `` if it will be received through the relevant professional channels , it will be evaluated appropriately , '' it said . alyona synenko , spokeswoman for the international committee of the red cross , said the organization has an `` ongoing dialogue '' with authorities in israel and gaza . she said all talks are confidential and that she could not elaborate . abu thraya was a well-known figure in gaza . ",
        "while relatives have claimed abu thraya lost his legs in an israeli airstrike while trying to rescue people , ap records show that he was wounded on april 11 , 2008 , in a clash between israeli forces and palestinian militants in the bureij refugee camp in central gaza . ap television footage from that day shows abu thraya identifying himself as he is taken away on the back of a pickup truck . both militants and civilians were wounded and killed that day , and it is not clear whether abu thraya had participated in the violence . since losing his legs , he often rolled around gaza city , earning a living by washing cars . ",
        "he also was a frequent participant in protests along the border with israel . ahmed yaghi , who was also protesting on dec. . 15 , said abu thraya and some others stood about 15 meters from the border fence , facing soldiers behind a mound of sand . he said he saw a soldier assuming a shooting position and then he heard one gunshot . `` i ran closer and saw ibrahim bleeding from his forehead . he was on the wheelchair . some youths pushed him on the chair away and then carried him to the ambulance , '' yaghi said . ",
        "yaghi said that two days before he was killed , israeli soldiers across the border fence called on him by name through a loudspeaker , asking him to leave the area . hamas , which normally praises its fighters killed in battle , has not identified him as a member , nor has any other militant group . also thursday , an israeli military court extended for five days the detention of a palestinian teen who has become a national hero after she was filmed kicking and slapping israeli soldiers . ahed tamimi , a 16-year-old from the west bank , was arrested last week by israeli troops and faces charges of attacking soldiers . ",
        "her mother 's detention was also extended and a cousin is expected to be released on sunday . tamimi was filmed earlier this month outside her family home shouting , pushing , kicking and slapping israeli soldiers , who fended off the blows without retaliating . palestinians are celebrating her as an icon of a new generation of resistance to israeli occupation , while the soldiers ' restraint stirred uproar , with some israelis saying the army was humiliated . ___ federman reported from jerusalem .
