        "according to the world health organisation , depression is the greatest single cause of disability worldwide . therefore , understanding mechanisms leading to depression and how to minimise its risks is very important . several studies have reported that fish consumption is associated with a reduced risk of depression . however , these studies remain to be controversial due to inconsistencies between some of them , the method that they used to assess depression and because none have established a clear dose that is required for the observed effects on depression . a group of japanese researchers has recently demonstrated that moderate fish intake is recommended for preventing depression in aged japanese individuals . ",
        "yutaka matsuoka and colleagues from the national cancer centre japan , the university and toyama and keio university school of medicine , investigated the association between fish consumption and the risk of psychiatrist-diagnosed major depressive disorder in japan . the study involved 1181 individuals for whom dietary information had been available over the course of up to 25 years , because they had taken part in the japan public health centre-based prospective study . psychiatric assessment was conducted for each of these individuals using both standard questionnaires and assessment by trained psychiatrists . credit : keio universitythe authors assessed the active ingredients in fish that are thought to mediate the anti-depression effect which are n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid and docosapentaenoic acid . ",
        "the study found that the relationship between fish intake and mdd does not follow a simple linear profile , but rather a so-called reverse j-shaped association is observed . a decreased risk of mdd was observed in individuals with a median intake of 111 g/day of fish , 307 mg/day of epa or 123 mg/day of dpa . the authors conclude that `` emerging and compelling evidence suggests that diet and nutrition are extremely important factors in the high prevalence of depressive disorders , and our findings provide a basis to further examine the effectiveness of fish and n-3 pufa intake for the prevention of mdd in both aged individuals and those with a history of major physical illness .
