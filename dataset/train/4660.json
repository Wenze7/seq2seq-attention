        "it 's liberatingmost of us have too much stuff . it 's almost like life has evolved into a game of collecting stuff . whoever has the most stuff wins . seriously . look at how much people worship their stuff . `` i 've shirt from this brand . '' `` well , i 've got a shirt from this better brand . '' and so it goes . is this a problem ? it does n't have to be , but there is a lot to gain by reducing your dependence on stuff and throwing things away . ",
        "stuff used to be so important to me . stuffed animals in particular . i had a bunk bed . i slept in the bottom bunk . the top bunk had all my stuffed animals . they filled the whole bed . i had the hardest time getting rid of them . they all had their story of how i had gotten them , they had all been there at some significant point in my life or another . it may seem bizarre but to some degree they were alive . the fact is , i 'm the one who gave them that life . ",
        "it was the reality i had created , and changing that reality was what was necessary for me to get rid of them . do i still have a lot of stuff ? yeah sometimes , but i also go on throwing away sprees . and instead of being so latched onto stuff , i 've come to see it for what it is . it 's just stuff . friends matter , family matters . stuff is stuff and no amount of stuff means anything in the end . i go on throwing away sprees because it 's liberating . ",
        "it 's a physical acknowledgement of the fact that stuff does n't matter . i like stuff , i enjoy stuff . i do n't need stuff . sure , i need food , water , clothes and a place to sleep . beyond that though , it 's not much of a need . here 're three tips for throwing stuff away without having any regrets : 1 . start with stuff that does n't matter . do n't start a throwing away spree with family keepsakes . when people do that , they 're just shooting themselves in the foot . ",
        "sure , they might manage to throw away one item , but then they 're going to feel sad and decide they should n't keep doing this . get some momentum going first before you go for the hard stuff . start with clothes or even just trash . once you 've cleared some shelf and cabinet space , you 'll probably feel pretty good about it . it 'll be easier to throw away things that may have some meaning but you do n't have any use for . 2 . if it makes you feel good , keep it . ",
        "if it brings bad memories , toss it . seriously , it 's that simple . if you have a keepsake that is `` important to you '' because it belonged to your uncle , but your uncle used to abuse you , toss it . on the other hand , if you 're just trying to throw stuff away for the sake of throwing stuff away , do n't toss something that brings you joy . that defeats the purpose . 3 . follow the 3 month rule : have you used it in the last three months ? ",
        "this is what allows me to have regular throwing away sprees . when i 'm deciding whether something stays or goes , it 's a matter of `` have i used this in the last three months or not ? '' if i have and i still need it , it stays . if not , it goes . the only exception is seasonal things like winter jackets or swim trunks . obviously i do n't use swim trunks in january , but at the same time it 'd be a waste of resources to throw them away now only to have to re-buy them in june . ",
        "throwing things away can be tremendously liberating because it removes clutter from your environment . it also helps to reduce your dependency on objects for happiness . when you look at what really matters , it 's your relationships with people , not objects . too much of a fixation on objects can you to put on blinders to what really matters and get lost in the race to get the most stuff . that said , you 're allowed to like stuff and you 're allowed to have nice things . it 's just a matter of finding a balance . ",
        "interestingly enough , whenever i start throwing things away that i do n't really need or want anymore , i seem to have an easier time procuring the things i do need and want . thank you for reading ! if this story helped you in any way , use the clap button to get it seen by more people .
