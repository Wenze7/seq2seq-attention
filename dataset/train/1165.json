        "maz williams is encouraging the use of te reo māori one kawhe at a time . three weeks ago , the urenui-based woman opened the doors to the small township 's newest cafe , the corner . the main drag eatery is slowly but surely duplicating its menus so they are offered in both english and te reo māori . `` i just think that why not ? '' williams said . read more : `` you should do . i think everybody should be encouraged to speak the language . '' about five years ago williams relocated to new zealand from the north west coast of wales where she ran a cafe for about 15 years . ",
        "all of her patrons were offered menus in both english and welsh . `` you just would n't open your doors without having both options . `` welsh is my first language . i would put welsh before english . when williams arrived in the country she immediately noticed the lack of kiwis using te reo māori . but with more businesses making a noticeable effort to incorporate it in their operations , she believed more people were becoming interested in learning and helping to preserve the language . `` it 's becoming more popular and i would like to add to that , '' she said . ",
        "in time , williams would have her cabinet food and kitchen menu in both languages , as well as sentence structures available for people wanting to order their meals in te reo māori . it was also a journey for williams who has committed to learning the language . `` i think kids coming in here , adults , young and old , we 're going to have some fun . `` first learning coffee and learning how to say it properly . '' so far the response from her customers had been positive , she said . although some people were a little reluctant from fear of mispronouncing the words but williams said the cafe was a safe environment to `` give it a go '' . ",
        "`` we have fun and i help them . `` because i 'm welsh i think i have a bit of a headstart on a lot of the prounciation . ''   "
