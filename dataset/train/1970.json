        "netflix bosses have fired andy yeatman after he told one of danny masterson 's sexual assault accusers that executives did n't believe the claims against the actor . the former that '70s show star was hit with allegations for rape by four women back in march , and netflix bosses came under pressure to fire him from their sitcom the ranch after they sacked kevin spacey from house of cards following allegations of sexual abuse in november . netflix announced they were writing masterson out of the show last week , a day after one of the actor 's alleged victims , who remains anonymous , told huffpost she had a conversation with yeatman , netflix 's director of global kids content , at the sidelines of a children 's soccer game and he told her that netflix authorities did not believe the accusers , unaware that she was one of them . ",
        "at the time , a spokesman for the streaming service branded yeatman 's comments `` careless '' and `` uninformed '' and not representative of the company , and he has now been let go . `` mr. yeatman is no longer employed at netflix , '' they confirmed in a statement . after netflix bosses announced he was being written out of the show , masterson issued a statement expressing his disappointment with their decision . `` from day one , i have denied the outrageous allegations against me , '' he said . `` law enforcement investigated these claims more than 15 years ago and determined them to be without merit . ",
        "i have never been charged with a crime , let alone convicted of one . '' he will still appear in the second half of season two , which is due to be released on the streaming service on friday . it is also thought he may return for an appearance in season three while they write him out , according to the hollywood reporter .
