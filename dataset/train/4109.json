        "orchard park , n. y. -- with his bruised left knee feeling considerably better , tyrod taylor stood comfortably at the podium requiring no reminder of the doubts and adversity he 's overcome in preparing to once again reclaim the buffalo bills ' starting job . whether the bills latest quarterback shuffle was poetic or fitting , taylor could n't say in assessing a tumultuous season that was coming full circle . taylor would acknowledge enjoying a certain degree of satisfaction in knowing buffalo 's bid to continue its late-season playoff push rested on him some 10 months after he was nearly cut before agreeing to restructure his contract , and a month after being briefly benched in favor of untested rookie nathan peterman . ",
        "`` i would n't have it any other way , '' taylor said , following practice wednesday . `` that stuff i 've been through in my life and in my career has only made me who i am today , '' he added . `` i take it in stride , learn from it and continue to keep moving forward . `` taylor 's immediate focus is on sunday , when buffalo closes its home schedule against the miami dolphins . all indications point to him starting at a time the bills have little margin for error in a convoluted afc playoff picture with three weeks left in the season . ",
        "taylor showed no signs of being limited by the bruised tendon in practicing fully for the first time since being sidelined during a 23-3 loss to new england on dec. . 3 . also , peterman has yet to be cleared from the nfl 's concussion protocol after being hurt in the third quarter of a 13-7 overtime win over indianapolis on sunday . coach sean mcdermott declined to reveal his starter before practice , but reiterated taylor would regain the job once healthy . taylor sidestepped a question regarding mcdermott 's vote of confidence by saying : `` i do n't necessarily think about that . '' ",
        "`` we have to go out there and execute better than we 've done , '' he added . `` the time is now for us to take that step . `` the bills have had issues at quarterback no matter who 's been under center with a passing attack that 's failed to complement a lesean mccoy-led running game that remains the offense 's strength . with a 6-5 record , taylor has been efficient in protecting the ball , but his production has been inconsistent . he 's topped 200 yards passing just four times , and thrown more than one touchdown pass in three games . ",
        "taylor 's threat as a scrambler has also been minimized in first-year offensive coordinator rick dennison 's system that relies more on a quarterback making quick passes from the pocket . taylor 's benching came after two consecutive losses in which he combined to complete 38 of 58 passes for 341 yards with two touchdowns and two turnovers , including a lost fumble . mcdermott 's decision to start peterman , however , backfired when the fifth-round draft pick was yanked after throwing five interceptions in the first half of a 54-24 loss at the los angeles chargers on nov. . ",
        "19 . peterman 's performance before he was hurt against the colts was difficult to gauge because of the limitations of a snow-covered field caused by a lake-effect storm that caused near whiteout conditions . mcdermott acknowledged the lack of a consistent passing attack has limited the offense . however , he refused to revisit the reasons why he benched taylor last month except to say : `` it 's what i felt our team needed at that time . `` guard richie incognito is impressed by the poise taylor 's shown in the face of adversity . `` tyrod 's been shunned and tyrod 's been through a whole bunch , and the one thing about tyrod is he stayed consistent , '' incognito said . ",
        "`` he 's stayed true to himself . he 's never wavered . `` taylor 's future beyond this season was uncertain before being benched . he has only one year left on his contract after having it reduced from a five - to a two-year deal in march . taylor said he ca n't focus on what 's beyond his control , while thankful to have another opportunity to start . `` there 's always something to prove to myself and others , '' he said . `` ultimately , as a team , we have a goal to do something special for this city , and that 's first off to get back in the playoffs , '' taylor said . ",
        "`` it starts with one game . and it 's this game right here . '' ___ more ap nfl : and .   "
