        "as bitcoin continues to soar in valuation , new investors are joining the craze , even if they do n't initially have the money to pay for the cryptocurrency . securities regulator joseph borg says he has seen people doing everything from running up credit card debt to mortgaging their homes to pour money into the cryptocurrency . it 's easy , from one angle , to see why . bitcoin started out the year being worth $ 1,000 . on nov. . 20 , bitcoin set a new record by passing the $ 8,000 mark . as of mid-morning tuesday , it was worth over $ 17,000 . ",
        "very few investments double their value in just 22 days . but bitcoin is the very definition of a volatile investment . the current rate of investment in bitcoin is bound to eventually result in a sell off as investors reap their profits . `` you 're on this mania curve , '' borg told cnbc . `` at some point in time there 's got to be a leveling off . cryptocurrency is here to stay . blockchain is here to stay . whether it is bitcoin or not , i do n't know . '' even if bitcoin is here to stay , it 's worth noting that it still remains unregulated . ",
        "hackers have been showing an increasing interest in pilfering it from people 's bitcoin wallets . earlier this month , thieves stole an estimated $ 64 million in cryptocurrency .   "
