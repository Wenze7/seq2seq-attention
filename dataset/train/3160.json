",
        "yep , all that in a single package on every modern platform . the assumption is these are the arcade versions , as opposed to the many ports released over the years . offline , every game will include save states so you can pause the action if you need to . out of the entire collection , four titles -- street fighter ii : hyper fighting , super street fighter ii : turbo , street fighter alpha 3 and street fighter iii : third strike -- will have support for online play . players can fight it out against the cpu in online lobbies as they wait for other players to join . ",
