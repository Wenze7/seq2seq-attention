        "as ford rides in a cab into manhattan to celebrate his oscar nom with his sister , the historic significance of this moment is `` still sinking in '' for the filmmaker , though he 's `` honored '' and `` humbled '' to be `` that person to cross that threshold . '' `` any first timer , any emerging filmmaker , anybody in film school who looks at this nomination and is inspired by it in any way -- whether it 's because they lost someone to gun violence or because they 're lgbtq -- they need to find their story and find their storytelling style and use that and not ever doubt that , '' ford says .
