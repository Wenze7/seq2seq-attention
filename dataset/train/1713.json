        "the chicago blackhawks are on a four game winning streak , and if you ever wanted joel quenneville to retire his line blender there is one play that shows the importance of player playing together . one of the things i miss about old time hockey is the fact that lines stayed together not just for a winning streak or part of hot streak , but back in the day lines stayed together for years . my favorite line of all-time was the denis savard line with steve larmer and al secord . the line had everything from savard 's flair to secord 's toughness with a sniper on the other wing . ",
        "there have been other great lines in chicago blackhawks history . there was the m. p.h. line of dennis hull , pit martin and jim pappin . they played together for 7 years and they put up some great numbers during their time together . there was something special about their bond off the ice which made it great on the ice . another great line in chicago blackhawks history was the scooter line anchored by stan mikita with kenny wharram and ab mcdonald . these lines produced short term and long term because they played together all the time . ",
        "i know that is a long introduction to say that coach joel quenneville needs to keep his lines together to start building the same kind of cohesiveness . coach q never messed with artem anisimov , artemi panarin and patrick kane and look what they were able to do for two seasons . if there is one play that shows what they are capable of doing together after playing with each other for sometime , look no further than thursday nights game . nick schmaltz picked up a rebound from a connor murphy shot , and he blindly passed it over to patrick kane for a tap in goal . ",
        "schmaltzy taking a page out of kaner 's book with that no-look setup #blackhawks pic . twitter . com/wwfyyoeqym -- chicago blackhawks december 15 , 2017 . so after the game nick schmaltz was asked if he knew patrick kane would be there waiting for the pass , and schmaltz said no but he figured he would be somewhere in that area . that 's the kind of goal playing together brings . just sensing where your teammates are because you 've been skating with them day after day and game after game . joel quenneville needs to keep the lines together win or lose to build something bigger and better this season than just a four game winning streak !
