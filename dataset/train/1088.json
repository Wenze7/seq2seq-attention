        "case renders show the galaxy s9 and s9 plus could be both quite different to each other , and yet similar to what 's come before . hot on the heels of a photo seemingly showing the samsung galaxy s9 's backplate , we 're now seeing purported renders of cases for both the samsung galaxy s9 and samsung galaxy s9 plus , and they claim the phones might differ in more ways than just screen size . the cases for the s9 plus offer an interesting discussion point , because we 've not seen as much of that phone , but they echo what we 've heard before -- namely that samsung 's larger handset will have a dual-lens camera on the back , while the standard galaxy s9 will have just a single-lens one . ",
        "other than that , a potentially slightly larger screen and a fingerprint scanner that 's been moved from next to the camera to underneath it , the two phones look a lot like the samsung galaxy s8 and galaxy s8 plus , complete with a curved screen , a likely metal frame and a glass back . with the number of leaks now suggesting this design there 's a good chance that it 's what we 'll get , but will it be popular ? or will buyers feel short-changed by a phone that looks a lot like last year 's model and in the case of the standard s9 does n't even have a second camera lens ? ",
        "this could be the design of the galaxy s9 and s9 plus . credit : mobile fun / olixarlearning from appleit 's a tactic that 's seemingly worked for apple with its iphone 8 and iphone 8 plus , both of which sport old designs and only the larger of which has a dual-lens camera , but then apple also launched the iphone x for buyers who wanted something truly new . there 's no sign that samsung has something more original on the way , unless the foldable galaxy x lands soon . so it will be interesting to see how much people take to these phones , and whether the s9 plus is more popular due to its extra lens . ",
        "of course , that 's if this design is accurate . although there 's growing evidence for it nothing is official yet , and while these latest images were supplied to mobile fun by case-maker olixar , it 's highly possible that the company is speculating on the s9 's design . according to mobile fun , olixar also claims that the samsung galaxy s9 will hit stores on february 28 , following a mid-february announcement , whereas previously we 'd heard rumors that the phones would be announced on february 26 , likely followed by an early march launch - a big red flag over the validity . ",
        "so the dates do n't jive with what we 've heard so far , meaning it 's hard to be confident that these are genuine renders rather than pictures based on internet rumors - but would you want an s9 if it only had a single lens ? the lg g7 might arrive soon too with a dual-lens camera of its own .
