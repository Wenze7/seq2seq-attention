        "the kentucky wildcats got absolutely disrespected in the latest ap poll . the wildcats went 2-0 last week , with a dominating victory over louisville and a hard fought win against the georgia bulldog 66-61 . however , despite the school 's largest ever victory over louisville , and an undefeated week , the team somehow dropped in rankings . full ap poll1 . michigan state2 . duke3 . villanova4 . arizona state5 . xavier6-25 : pic . twitter . com/mpoitjs2kp -- ncaa march madness january 1 , 2018 . yes , kentucky is coming off a disappointing loss to the ucla bruins last saturday , but the bruins are still one of the best teams in the pac 12 , and the loss is by no means inexcusable . ",
        "also , there 's no reason that should effect this week 's ap rankings . additionally , while you can make the argument that louisville is n't as talented as they 've been in past seasons , the team is still very good . louisville was 10-2 on the season before the loss to kentucky , and a 29 point victory between power conference teams just does not happen usually . ðŸ—£ hami diallono . 16 kentucky beats louisville 90-61 for first 20 + point win over its rival since 2001 pic . twitter . com/lolmvkdouc -- bleacher report december 29 , 2017 . ",
        "it just seems inexcusable that kentucky should win both games in the manner they did so this week , and then subsequently drop a spot in the ap poll . especially when there is a multitude of two loss teams sitting ahead of them in the rankings . put some respect on the wildcats name .   "
