        "during his keynote at ces 2018 monday night , intel ceo brian krzanich revealed two processors : one `` loihi '' chip for neuromorphic computing , and tangle lake for quantum computing . intel believes these areas are the future . at its keynote at ces 2018 , intel slid in mentions of its more experimental forms of data processing that could be coming down the pipeline . amidst talk of the importance of data in virtually every aspect of life , the company believes that the future of computing resides within two key areas : neuromorphic and quantum computing . ",
        "intel ceo brian krzanich made this revelation during his keynote monday night during ces 2018 , showing off two new processors built for these computing segments . processors that act like brainsthe new neuromorphic computing processor throws out the conventional desktop processor architecture , and instead attempts to mimic how the brain learns and grows on its own . the prototype chip , called loihi , simulates the brain in silicon by implementing digital circuits and pathways . but according to krzanich , these pathways will change as the chip receives data and self-learns as a result , just like our own brains . ",
        "krzanich said the prototype chip learned how to perform simple object recognition in the company 's labs in just several weeks . he believes this technology will influence `` future products and innovations , '' and that will start by placing prototype chips in the hands of researchers to discover the true potential of neuromorphic computing . even more , the chip promises faster machine learning with better power efficiency . `` the loihi test chip offers highly flexible on-chip learning and combines training and inference on a single chip , '' added intel labs ' dr. michael mayberry . ",
        "`` this allows machines to be autonomous and to adapt in real time instead of waiting for the next update from the cloud . the self-learning capabilities prototyped by this test chip have enormous potential to improve automotive and industrial applications as well as personal robotics . '' the loihi prototype chip will be shared with universities and research institutions in the first half of 2018 with a focus on advancing the artificial intelligence field . the 49-quabit quantum chip as for the quantum computing aspect , krzanich predicates that quantum computing could solve problems that the current best supercomputers on the planet could take months or even years to resolve . ",
        "that 's the driving force behind intel 's latest quantum computing solution : its new 49-qubit superconducting quantum test chip dubbed as `` tangle lake . '' the label means the chip contains 49 quantum bits , which are units of quantum information . unlike a single `` normal '' bit that 's either a one or a zero , a quantum bit can be both at the same time . a watered-down definition implies that this dual-personality allows a quantum bit to hold more information . this is why quantum computing is a hot topic regarding the future : as our chunks of data grow larger each day , we 'll need computers that can handle the increasing load in as little time as possible . ",
        "with the new tangle lake processor , researchers can energize an otherwise `` nascent field '' to simulate computational problems , and improve error correction techniques . we still have a very long way to go before quantum computing reaches `` commercial relevance , '' but intel 's research and development into tangle lake seems to be pushing quantum computing forward . `` in the quest to deliver a commercially viable quantum computing system , it 's anyone 's game , '' mayberry added . `` we expect it will be five to seven years before the industry gets to tackling engineering-scale problems , and it will likely require 1 million or more qubits to achieve commercial relevance .
