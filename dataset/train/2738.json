        "i got this new coworker about 6 weeks ago . we hit it off right away and he showed me signs of intrest . other people noticed it aswell . he asked me to go get coffee with him wich we did and he took me to the new/fancy/expensive place downtown and payed without hesitation . because i couldnt read him really welk i asked what his intentions were . he got confused and stated that he thought all he did was just friendly and that he does n't want a relationship because he has been hurt pretty bad by his last ex . ",
        "so then it got a bit awkward at work . people were still saying that he acted like he liked me . i was trying to move past it . then he asked me to get coffee again . we had a good time but when we said goodbye he wanted to clarify that the reason he asked me out again was to state again that he does n't want a relationship right now and that even his friends and roommates are all like ; she can actully handle your dark/sarcastic persona and you turn her down ? so an hour after that 2nd date he started to text me to see of my heart was n't broken and we jokes around a bit text wise and it got flirty wich he was n't aware about first . ",
        "so i was like ; now you know why i think that you like me . so now at work its kinda awkward again . people still say that he acts this what because they can tell he likes me . he wants to learn more about me , because i dont talk a lot about myself and he keeps bringing stuff up i said earlier . rembering details and such . when another coworker wanted to ask me a question i jokingly said ; no i dont wan na go out with you . wich she said laughing ; no i know you are clearly not a lesbian . ",
        "and this guy said ; but i am a woman ? so any help please .   "
