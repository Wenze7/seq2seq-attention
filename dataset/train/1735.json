        "as you gaze up the shelves at a nightclub bar or liquor store , vodka can get surprisingly expensive . quickly . it does n't matter if you 're searching for the usual destination brands -- grey goose , belvedere , ketel one -- or something like russo-baltique , which is billed as `` the most expensive vodka in the world '' . most of the value for that particular brand lies in its packaging : the bottle is covered in over twelve pounds of gold and silver , and the cap is encrusted with diamonds . in fact , packaging , celebrity endorsements , and marketing goes a long way towards explaining price in the vodka world . ",
        "now , it seems a number of new ultra-premium brands are moving beyond status and offering something unique from the actual booze . while the prices are n't russian oligarch stratospheric , most run two or three times the cost of the standard top-shelf vodkas . whiskey fans may deride all vodkas as tasting the same , but the fact is there are significant differences in quality and flavor that are into everything from the water sources to base grain or fruit to the distillation processes . it 's just possible these vodkas are worth cleaning out the piggy bank . ",
        "grey goose interpreted by ducasse -- $ 100launched in november , this partnership between grey goose cellar master fran√ßois thibault and michelin-starred french chef alain ducasse is the second recent upgrade on the classic vodka . chef ducasse 's goal in the partnership was to introduce a `` gastronomic vodka '' for food pairings . to achieve that , he and thibault took the goose 's regular french winter wheat and toasted it in ducasse 's cocoa bean roaster . three different toast levels were employed , adding subtle but distinctive notes of nuts , toasted bread , and chocolate . ",
        "as a result , the vodka blends nicely with more vegetal mixers , standing out in the drink just a hair more than the original . woody creek reserve -- $ 90woody creek 's flagship label , colorado potato vodka , is already pretty special , employing as it does the rio grande , a special breed of high-altitude potato that is perfectly suited for growing in the centennial state . but the reserve is another level of swag altogether . made from stobrawa , a rare heirloom polish potato specifically grown to make great vodka , much of the cost for the final product involves sourcing and curating the seed , which requires special permission and care to bring to america . ",
        "`` it was quite a process , '' says head distiller david matthews . `` it makes an excellent vodka , with an amazing creamy mouthfeel . '' and he 's right . the vodka is noticeably different and smooth with a hint of earthy flavor -- the result of no filtration . harvesting their own potatoes means they can only make small batches once each year . the flavor , moisture , and starch differs between those straight-from-the-field spuds versus potatoes that sit in a warehouse for months is night and day . `` we call it a ` martini in a glass . ' ",
        "it really does n't need anything else , '' says matthews . chopin single young potato -- $ 100this is another vodka that emphasizes rare and unusual potatoes at its base . this limited release from polish purveyor chopin uses local zuzanna and hinga potatoes harvested at a peak starch content . the result is a round , viscous vodka with distinctive notes of earth , potato , stewed apples and apricots . if you want your vodka odorless and flavorless , this one is not for you . however , if you like your booze to actually taste like something , this one is it . ",
        "each batch is from a single harvest , or vintage , of potatoes , so the weather that year has a hand in crafting the finished product . compare one vintage to another and you 're bound to find differences . carbonadi -- $ 90perhaps the closest thing to a baller vodka on this list , carbonadi is influenced in part by fine wines , with the heavy dark bottle and fancy script label reflective of that inspiration . distilled at a longtime family distillery in northern italy and bottled in california , the vodka is beautifully viscous , even at room temperature . ",
        "it opens with a hint of fruit and sweetness , and closes with a smooth , spicy note . though it smells like a standard vodka , you might try and convince yourself otherwise if you were tasting it blind . components that add to the price include a five-fold distillation process through active charcoal and a final filtering through carbonado diamonds , a porous black diamond actually made up of many composite crystals in one stone . `` we pressure through a custom chamber filled with 3,000 carats of uncut carbonados , '' says ceo ricky miller . `` their microporous attributes extract impurities a conventional filter can not . '' ",
        "the spirit then goes through a wine method called micro-oxygenation , which mimics the barrel-aging process . `` it 's not just priced high to be priced high , '' miller insists . `` the process is a very intricate one . '' crystal head aurora -- $ 65dan aykroyd 's labor of love and conversation maker , crystal head , re-released aurora last year . despite the novelty skull container and aykroyd 's insistence that aliens and crystals are a thing , this is a legit vodka out of newfoundland , canada . the cool factor is the iridescent skull inspired by canada 's northern lights , but inside , the juice is crafted from english wheat and water from st. john 's , newfoundland , for a dry , spicy , clean spirit . ",
        ". the vodka is filtered first through activated charcoal , then through herkimer `` diamonds , '' which are actually a form of quartz crystal . the process of applying the metallic finish through heat application means no two skulls are exactly the same . stoli elit pristine water series -- $ 3,000 if you 've got some serious coin and do n't want all your money to go to crystal-encrusted lalique bottles , consider this series of four limited-edition releases from stoli elit . by design , vodka is 60 percent water , so it stands to reason that better water makes for better drinking . ",
        "in this case , the `` better water '' comes from specific , hard-to-access sources . trying the stoli elit pristine water series side-by-side , there are most definitely unique distinctions among the smooth , subtle vodkas . bonus : you still get some packaging goodies , like a hand-blown crystal bottle and gold-plated ice pick . feature image courtesy of chopin vodka/facebook . holiday shopping guide : gifts that keep on givingshotsgiving : an entire thanksgiving meal in shotsbeards , booze , and bacon : the thanksgiving episode .
