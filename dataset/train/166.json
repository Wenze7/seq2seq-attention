        "htc struggled in 2016 . despite releasing a few great smartphones like the htc 10 and desire 10 pro , the company lost money each fiscal quarter . to turn things around in 2017 , htc opted for a different business strategy . it reduced its lineup of smartphones , and stopped production on low-end smartphones , focusing solely on mid - and high-end releases , in an attempt to return to profitability . instead of releasing close to 20 models like in previous years , htc released six more premium phones . did the strategy work ? also , what do we want to see from htc in 2018 ? ",
        "an overview of 2017htc u ultrahtc announced two smartphones in january -- the mid-range u play and high-end u ultra . despite offering brand new metal and glass designs , they failed to impress . u ultra was especially disappointing , with its small battery , and lack of water resistance and headphone jack . it was also overpriced at launch , that dropped from $ 750 to $ 600 a month after its u. s. release . the next product launch happened in april when htc took the wraps off the one x10 . it came with a 5.5-inch full hd display , mediatek 's helio p10 chipset , and a massive 4,000 mah battery . ",
        "it only launched in select markets and excluded the u. s. . the company finally grabbed more attention in may with the release of its flagship handset . called the u11 , it impressed with top-of-the-line specs , a fantastic camera , and the innovative edge sense feature . but it was n't perfect . the device has a small display for a flagship , at 5.5 inches , and thick bezels -- making it hard to compete with the near bezel-less lg g6 and samsung galaxy s8 . the price was also too high at launch , as the smartphone was $ 50 more expensive than the g6 , at $ 650 . ",
        "nevertheless , the u11 outsold the htc 10 , as well as the one m9 , in its first month . htc said the smartphone was so popular in certain markets it had trouble keeping up with demand . still , it was n't seen as a worthy competitor to devices like the galaxy s8 due to its drawbacks . htc took its game to the next level with the announcement of the u11 plus . in november , htc took its game to the next level with the reveal of the u11 plus . the device followed all the latest flagship trends , with high-end specs and a large 6-inch display with an 18:9 aspect ratio . ",
        "it 's htc 's true flagship of the year and can go head-to-head with just about any smartphone out there . it comes in a few different colors including the eye-catching translucent black , which reveals various internal components with its see-through back . the last htc smartphones announced in 2017 were the u11 life and the unlocked u11 life . the android one version came running vanilla android , and the unlocked model featured htc 's sense ui on top . sure , it does n't feature an 18:9 display or thin bezels , but it 's still a fantastic smartphone . ",
        "the mid-ranger came with a 5.2-inch full hd screen and snapdragon 630 chipset , at an affordable $ 350 . htc u11 lifehtc got better over the past year . it failed to impress in its first quarter , but grabbed more attention later , with the u11 . things got even better in the last quarter with the announcement of the u11 plus and u11 life , htc 's most interesting smartphones of the year . overall , 2017 was still a bad year for htc . the company generated an average net loss of $ 80 million in each of the three quarters -- q4 results have n't been released yet . ",
        "due to the bad financial results it has been experiencing for a while now , rumors started in august that htc is looking for a new owner . google acquired the company 's `` powered by htc '' research and development division for $ 1.1 billion . the rumors turned out to be partly true in november when google announced it has purchased the company 's `` powered by htc '' research and development division for $ 1.1 billion . but the acquisition does n't mean htc will exit the smartphone market . it will continue to operate independently and develop its own smartphones , albeit with less manpower . ",
        "how big a difference this will make in launching innovative new products has yet to be seen . 2018 : time for a change the roundtablebased on how 2017 went , it 's clear htc has to make changes in 2018 . the u ultra was n't well received , so it would n't make sense for htc to release a successor , especially when the u11 plus already competes with phones like the lg v30 , huawei mate 10 , and google pixel 2 xl . htc has to impress with its successor to the u11 . the device should still come with top-of-the-line specs , innovative edge sense feature , and a free pair of usonic earbuds in the box , but it should also have a larger display with thinner bezels , a dual-camera setup , and a lower price tag . ",
        "without all that , it will have a hard time competing with the galaxy s9 and other 2018 flagships . samsung galaxy a8the company should also bring its mid-range lineup to the next level . samsung has done a great job in this area with the recent announcement of the galaxy a8 and a8 plus . both smartphones share a few things with the galaxy s8 series , like an 18:9 screen , premium metal and glass body , and ip68 rating for protection against water and dust . to grab attention in the mid-range market , htc should take a page out of samsung 's playbook . ",
        "releasing a few handsets inspired by u11 plus ' design that offer similar if not better hardware than the a8 and a8 plus at a lower price could be the way to go . that 's something we might see at the beginning of this year . rumor has it the company will announce a mid-range variant of its htc u11 plus in january , but there 's no word on specs and pricing yet -- so we do n't know how exactly will it stack up against the galaxy a8 series . if htc does n't improve sales and financial results , it might be forced to leave the smartphone market . ",
        "this year will be an important one for htc . sales and financial results have to improve , otherwise , it may be forced out of the smartphone market . the company played it safe , which turned out to be a recipe for disaster . in 2018 , it should be bolder , try out new things , and make more of an effort to differentiate its products from the competition . here 's an idea : htc could launch a budget brand . it can keep prices low by focusing on online sales , just like huawei with its honor brand . ",
        "after all , pricing is one of the main factors keeping htc from success . the company 's smartphones are n't the most expensive ones out there , but they 're sure as hell not the cheapest . there are many other business strategies htc could opt for , too . the important thing is the company needs to start thinking outside the box and makes some serious changes . final thoughtsit 's hard to predict how good or bad 2018 will be for htc . we want to see it make a bigger impact on the market . more competition is always better for consumers , it forces companies to innovate more and brings down prices .

        "editor 's pickhtc rumored to bring back its eye branding with upcoming phone in china update : a new rumor about htc 's upcoming mid-range phablet has come to light , thanks to noted gadget leaker evan '' @evleaks '' blass . he claims on his twitter account that the phone , which has been called the ... htc 's plan is to increase sales and return to profitability . achieving such ambitious goals wo n't be easy , especially without its `` powered by htc '' r&d division , but it can be done . the smartphone business can change in the blink of an eye . ",
        "htc could make a big step forward in a short period of time . to turn things around , the company has to release more attention-grabbing smartphones , reduce prices , and invest more money into marketing -- which is almost non-existent in many european countries . the alternative for htc would be to stick to its old ways , and likely have another disastrous year . do you think htc has what it takes to return to profitability in 2018 ? let us know in the comments .
