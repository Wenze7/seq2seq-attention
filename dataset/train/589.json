        "no matter if it 's a grandchild or a fur baby , some parents just know how to turn on the nurturing switch when it comes to their kids ' offspring . as we grow older , the time we spend with our parents can see all-time lows as we navigate our own adult lives , but while we may not call or visit as much as we might like , that makes moments like this one that much more special . when meghan specksgoor had to make an impromptu trip to nyc on short notice , she struggled to find someone to take care of her 4-year-old dog , chance . ",
        "but thankfully , specksgoor 's dad stepped in to save the day and quickly became the grand parenting mvp . grandpa specksgoor and chance are quite attached to one another , so it came as a surprise when meghan began receiving a series of text messages from her father . but at second glance the text messages were from one proud grandpa spoiling his grandpup and giving mom constant updates in the `` voice '' of chance . it 's clear to see how much chance loved spending time with his grandfather as the two went to the park , stopped for a quick treat , and went on countless other adventures .
