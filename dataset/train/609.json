        "a finnish hotel chain has created a stunning winter retreat that 's perfect for diehard `` game of thrones '' fans -- if they 're brave enough to go ranging that far north , at least . lapland hotels has teamed up with hbo nordic to create a `` game of thrones '' - themed hotel sculpted out of snow and ice . each room features an ice sculpture : there 's a ferocious white walker with glowing blue eyes , an icy replication of braavos ' hall of faces and a life-size iron throne . inside temperatures can dip to 23 degrees fahrenheit , so the hotel recommends only staying for one night -- even though overnight guests are given thermal sleeping bags to help them stay warm . ",
        "the hotel has 10 overnight rooms that start at $ 200 . it 's part of a larger attraction that includes a movie theater , a chapel , and restaurant and bar carved out of ice . the snowvillage is set to be open until april 30 . see more photos of the `` game of thrones '' - themed hotel below .
