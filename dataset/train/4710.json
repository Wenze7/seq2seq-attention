",
        "twitter . com/ejiakyagkl -- ron brackett december 22 , 2017 . that 's absolutely heartbreaking . fusco was pitching last week when he was immediately struck in the head by a comebacker . we 've seen that happen many times in major league baseball , which would lead you to assume something as horrible as this would n't be caused by a ball which is much softer . there is no positive way to take a life of a man who was just 37-years old , but having this tragedy occur on the diamond where he loved playing is nothing short of awful .
