        "dubai , united arab emirates -- bahrain released radar tracks on tuesday it said showed qatari fighter jets passing by emirati commercial airliners bound for the island nation , encounters which set off a new dispute pitting qatar against the gulf nations that have been boycotting it since last summer . the two alleged fly-bys on monday morning could further escalate tensions between qatar and the four arab nations , among them the uae , home to the world 's busiest international airport . they also could affect long-haul airline travel , as the region 's carriers are a crucial link between the east and west . ",
        "emirati officials on monday described the fly-bys as though the fighter jets `` intercepted '' their civilian aircraft . qatari officials deny their jets intercepted the aircraft and on tuesday dismissed the footage as `` unauthenticated videos . `` bahrain state television aired radar footage it described as showing emirates flight no . ek837 from dubai flying toward bahrain international airport at 3,170 meters . two other radar signals described as qatari fighter jets flew at around 2,590 meters and crossed briefly in front of the emirates plane 's flight path . the screen briefly flashes orange text , likely a collision warning . ",
        "it was n't clear from the footage at what distance the fighter jets allegedly passed the emirates flight , but bahrain previously described the distance as being 3.2 kilometers . the broadcaster also aired footage of an aeronautical chart it said showed a qatari fighter jet flying across the flight path of a just-passed etihad airliner , both at 24,000 meters . it identified the flight as etd23b , which corresponds to etihad flight no . ey371 , a direct abu dhabi-bahrain flight that took off monday morning . dubai-based emirates and abu dhabi-based etihad have declined to comment . ",
        "both flights flew in international waters just north of the tip of qatar , a peninsular nation that juts into the persian gulf , before landing in nearby bahrain . the uae said it planned to file a complaint to the united nations over what happened monday . reached on tuesday , qatar 's government communication office dismissed the bahrain state television report as part of a `` smear campaign '' against it by the uae . the uae 's allegations follow two complaints by qatar to the united nations about emirati military aircraft allegedly violating its airspace amid the diplomatic crisis . ",
        "the uae denies those allegations . `` these matter should be dealt with by filing a formal complaint to the u. n. security council , as qatar has done following two breaches by uae military aircraft of the state of qatar 's airspace , and not by distributing unauthenticated videos to the media as how the blockading nations have done since the start of the crisis , '' it said in a statement to the associated press . at issue as well is language in the dispute . intercepts normally refer to military jets flying alongside passenger planes and giving orders in emergencies . ",
        "military jets also do n't necessarily file flight plans , as required by commercial airlines . however , military mistakes have caused tragedy in the persian gulf before . in july 1988 , the uss vincennes in the strait of hormuz mistook an iran air flight heading to dubai for an attacking fighter jet , shooting down the plane and killing all 290 people onboard . qatar 's stock exchange dropped some 2.5 percent in trading monday , one of its biggest jolts since the crisis began . on tuesday , the market reversed the losses , closing up 2.58 percent . ",
        "bahrain , egypt , saudi arabia and the uae cut off qatar 's land , sea and air routes on june 5 over its alleged support of extremists and close ties with iran . qatar has long denied funding extremists , though it supports islamist opposition movements that are considered terrorist groups by other countries in the region . it recently restored full diplomatic ties with iran , with which it shares a massive offshore natural gas field . on tuesday , iranian president hassan rouhani offered support for qatar during a meeting with ahmed al-mahmoud , the speaker of qatar 's emir-appointed advisory council . ",
        "`` we believe any pressure on the government and nation of qatar is unacceptable , '' rouhani said in a statement on the presidency 's website . `` iran is ready for any cooperation with the government and nation of qatar and it will not allow muslim people of the country to be under unfair pressure . `` al-mahmoud thanked tehran for its support , saying it helped doha stand `` firm before hostility and plots . `` the diplomatic crisis has hurt qatar airways , doha 's long-haul carrier that competes with emirates and etihad . qatar had complained to the montreal-based international civil aviation organization about the boycotting nations cutting off its air routes , forcing the carrier to take longer flights through iran and turkey . ",
        "its regional feeder flights in saudi arabia and the uae also have been cut off . however , widening the gulf dispute to include civilian aviation and airspace could hurt emirati airlines already stung by president donald trump 's travel bans , as well as last year 's ban on laptops in airplane cabins , which has been lifted . `` i do think the tit-for-tat claims and the spillage into aviation risks tarnishing the reputation of the gulf as a safe and secure location for the three global airlines that have made it their hub and a transit point for travelers , '' said kristian coates ulrichsen , a research fellow at the james a. baker iii institute for public policy at rice university . ",
        "`` with the gulf airlines coming under pressure from even longer-range aircraft that are capable of bypassing their hubs altogether , it makes little sense to risk the reputation for comfort and security that the gulf airlines have so assiduously built up , '' he added . ___ associated press writer nasser karimi in tehran , iran , contributed to this report . ___ follow jon gambrell on twitter at www . twitter . com/jongambrellap . his work can be found at .
