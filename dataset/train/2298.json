        "as i sit here and watch rocky 3 for like the umpteen time , adrian is always there cheering on her main man . i cant help but to think about how tough relationships really are . the hardest relationships must be the ones where your man is a boxer . how it must feel to watch him get hit so hard and all you can do is pray that he recovers . imagine watching that over and over : knock him down and get back up . now i to ask what if he get 's that one opponent , that one fight where he gets hit harder than life . ",
        "you know like hit so hard he forgets his own damn name ? again , knock him down and get back up ! now even our great rocky knew that nothing will hit you harder than life . so what is our role as women when we are the real life adrian ? the man that your with is in the fight of his life . and we all know it 's not a good rocky fight if he do n't get his ass whipped a few rounds and gets knocked down . but what if your man is n't rocky , what if he just keeps getting hit and cant stay the fuck up ! ",
        "like damn ! but adrian was a soilder , she never left that man 's side , even when he could fight anymore , even when all the glits and glam was gone . even during the fights she never once left the arenas , no matter how many times she closed her eyes , covered her eyes or squirmed . she never left that man . her man , her husband , her heart , her other half . let 's not get it twisted she was no door mat or sucka because on several occasions she has to give him those `` get your shit together quick talks '' sometimes you have to remind him and ask `` what do you want ? ",
        "because at the end of the day when everything and everybody is gone its ' just us '' . but at what point is enough just simply enough because life is not a movie . are we supposed to be adrian at the end of rocky 4 ? broke and broken ... because she helped build rocky the man and the brand . then it was all gone . was she supposed to let her man risk his life so she can stay in rolex , prada and gucci ? was she supposed to be upset because she did n't invest in herself more ? ",
        "was she suppose to be content with her new life and simply just adjust back to being poor ? but honestly after the shock and anger she did n't leave him . what happened is what happens in life all the time , her vision of happiness changed . like when you 're a teenager all you want is the latest fashion , then when you hit a certain age all you want is good credit . what is want was to have her family , she wanted her husband alive . as long as he was healthy and safe she was great . ",
        "her life vision of happiness changed as her man 's life and career changed . so baby , my lesson is this if your happiness and life vision cant change with him then you know it 's time to go . - but what do i know , i 'm just a girl from the brook !   "
