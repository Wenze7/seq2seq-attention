        "las vegas -- dell today unveiled the rest of its 2018 lineup , and chief among the announcements is a 15-inch convertible xps laptop with discrete graphics . dell added 2-in-1 functionality to the 13-inch xps at ces last year , and now the larger laptop gets the same treatment . it 's positioned as a system for power users and professionals , but does n't sacrifice portability ; dell says it 's the smallest and thinnest 15-inch 2-in-1 on on the market . it joins the pre-ces new xps 13 announcement , an updated version of the high-end laptop that now comes in a white and rose gold color scheme . ",
        "inside the xps 15 2-in-1 , there are eighth-generation intel processors and amd radeon rx vega m graphics , which should deliver that professional-level speed compared to what you 'd find in the average 2-in-1 . those components should clear the demands of most modern titles , even if you ca n't run the highest settings . the extra cores in the eighth-generation cpu , meanwhile , add to its multimedia prowess . its touch display is available in 4k resolution , which is too demanding for gaming with this hardware , but useful for media creation and viewing . ",
        "like most xps products , the display is an infinityedge design for super-thin bezels . the chassis maintains the premium metal and carbon fiber construction of the other models . it will be available this spring starting at $ 1,299.99 . samsung recently announced a new 13-inch convertible laptop , opting for a smaller size body for the time being . we said the past 15-inch model was a bit too large to be comfortable in tablet mode , unwiedly for one-handed use , so it will be interesting to see if dell 's claims of thinness make a difference for the xps 15 2-in-1 . ",
        "dell also claims a 15-hour battery life , which would be better than-all-day battery , but we 'll have to put in through its paces in testing to find out if it can meet that bar .   "
