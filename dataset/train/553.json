        "`` antisemitism is the dangerous fuel feeding our enemies for generations , '' he said . `` we must ensure every jew in the world can live a safe and proud life . '' `` also in 2017 we saw a strong antisemitic presence online , '' bennett added . `` much of this discourse was related to the changes in governments around the world , the refugee crisis and the visibility of antisemitism in social media . we must act with all available tools against current antisemitism to ensure the security of the jewish people , in israel and the diaspora .
