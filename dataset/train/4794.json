        "dwindling u. s. housing inventory during 2017 forced desperate homebuyers to bid higher and pay thousands over the asking price for homes across the country . nearly a quarter of homes sold for an average of $ 7,000 above the asking price , according to zillow research released thursday , but in the booming markets of san jose , san francisco and new york , buyers paid about $ 62,000 , $ 41,000 and $ 12,000 more , respectively . housing inventory has been in steady decline for nearly three years , just as millennials should be buying their first house . ",
        "most of them have n't saved enough money for a down payment on their first home , and will be hard pressed to purchase homes above asking price . president donald trump 's tax bill is projected to lead to even fewer homeowners . an aerial view of homes in pittsburgh , pennsylvania . photo by bruce bennett/getty images `` in the booming tech capitals of the california bay area and pacific northwest , paying above list price is now the norm . in the face of historically tight inventory , buyers have had to be more aggressive in their offers , '' said aaron terrazas , a senior economist at zillow , `` we do n't expect this inventory crunch to ease meaningfully in 2018 , meaning buyers will be facing many of the same struggles this year . ",
        "`` american homes selling above asking price have increased from 17.8 percent in 2012 to 24.1 percent in 2017 . though inventory will likely remain low this year , construction firms are expecting high demand across all sectors of residential and commercial real estate , and they have even increased efforts to hire new workers based on president donald trump 's infrastructure promises . `` the demand for new housing is there , inventory is low , and home prices are going up , so there could be more construction in 2018 , but one of the limiting factors will be the low number of workers available to build those houses , '' chief economist robert dietz from the national association of home builders told newsweek earlier this week . ",
        "the share of homes on the u. s. market valued below $ 1 million dollars has been decreasing , and the number of homes valued at over $ 5 million has surged in recent years as a result of tight inventory and a shortage of construction workers . more from newsweek .   "
