        "still deciding what to give your child 's teacher for the holidays to show how much you appreciate her skills and patience ? we asked five educators what they love to see on their desk the day before winter break -- and the answers are sweeter and simpler than you may have expected . a few hours of your time `` we really do appreciate a parent who is willing to come in and organize a holiday party and take a little stress off our daily workload , '' says abby yemm , a third-grade teacher in kansas city . ",
        "`` it 's even better if they coordinate holiday goodies without us having to do it ! '' something personal `` i love receiving a holiday gift that shows the student or family has really gotten to know me . i think it 's great when the kids have ownership over gifts and are excited to share them with me ! '' says maddie mayerson , a first-grade teacher in boston . a heartfelt card `` i 've been teaching for almost 30 years , and the notes and cards are the only thing i keep , '' says randi pellett , a math specialist in new york city . ",
        "`` i read them all and then keep them in a decoupaged cardboard box that a student made for me during one of my first years as a teacher . the time and personal touch are more important to me than a mug holding another bag of hot cocoa mix . '' a gift the entire class can use `` instead of sweets , i love getting gift cards for stores like office depot and office max , which i can use toward supplies for my classroom , '' says stephanie shaw , a third-grade teacher in north texas . ",
        "spontaneous gifts `` some of my favorite gifts have been unexpected , ` just because ' gifts , '' says liz savage , a teacher in cabot , arkansas . `` for example , a child recently brought in my favorite coffee drink and a muffin , and one time a little girl brought me a handmade card with a picture she had colored . these gifts are heartwarming and very much appreciated !
