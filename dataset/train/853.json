        "old fred is furious . the majority owner of the new york mets , fred wilpon , is reportedly beyond upset with the yankees ' decision to pick up giancarlo stanton 's contract and bring him to new york in a blockbuster trade . for that matter , according to a person close to wilpon , `` fred is pissed every time the yankees make a move . and he always seems surprised . `` fred wilpon is furious with the yankees acquiring giancarlo stanton : `` he keeps saying the yankees ca n't keep this model up . and they keep showing that they can . '' ",
        "-- new york post sports december 22 , 2017 . the yankees have been out-showing the mets for literally all of their existence , and wilpon really does n't have any right to get mad when he makes such little effort to dish out big time money for big time players in the queens . wilpon believes that the yankees economic model is `` unsustainable , '' and that the yankees ca n't keep it up . history seems to say otherwise , fred . mets fans have their own long history of becoming disgruntled with ownership not taking more risks economically , and it 's looking like the 2018 season might follow suit . ",
        "so , @joelsherman1 believes the mets have just $ 10-15m left to spend . imo , it 's awfully hard to see them building a winner for that . they 're precariously close to blowing their chance at sustained success . yet , no answers from fred and jeff wilpon . -- marc carig december 20 , 2017 . according to the post 's joel sherman , the mets ' 2018 payroll will be around `` $ 20 million lighter than in 2017 . `` additionally , the only move the mets have made to this point , is the addition of reliever anthony swarzak on a two-year deal worth $ 14 million . ",
        "while swarzak is a solid pitcher , he 's by no means a big-name acquisition . the mets ' ownership has no right to get angry over the yankees ' stanton acquisition , especially if they are n't going to at least make an effort to be somewhat financially competitive with their crosstown rivals .
