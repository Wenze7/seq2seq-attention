        "jared kusher and wife ivanka trump were served with a lawsuit this week after a washington lawyer alleged their failure to disclosure certain investments violated the guidelines stated by the ethics in government act / the suit , filed by jeffrey lovitky , who also filed a suit against president donald trump earlier this year , focuses on investments that kushner made in two firms : claremount v. associates lp and thrive partners iv gp , llc . he alleges that white house counsel in the office of govenment ethics , which is under the supervision of the president , certified kushner 's financial disclosure as being in accordance with the eiga with the knowledge that it lacked certain necessary investment information . ",
        "the eiga guidelines state that any source of income aside from salary than exceeds $ 200 in a calendar year must be reported and that an investment for the production of income in a trade or business exceeding $ 1000 must be reported . kushner submitted a financial disclosure report in march 2017 , which he has amended several times . lovikty 's suit claims that kushner failed to disclose investments in the above mentioned firms , for which his returns would be plausibly be greater than $ 1000 . the eiga does not allow the refusal of disclosing of financial investment information under the guise of a pre-existing confidentiality agreement , but lovitky 's complaint surmises that the information to be disclosed may not be treated as confidential in this suit . ",
        "`` the eiga permits a reporting individual on whose behalf payments are made to charitable organizations to report the recipients of such contributions on a confidential basis , '' the complaint states . `` based upon a search of public records , neither kushner nor trump are practicing attorneys , and as such can not assert attorney-client privilege as a basis for withholding information . '' ms. trump is included in the lawsuit not because she herself has invested in the firms , but that she failed to report her husband 's investments in them . trump 's financial disclosure report , submitted in june 2017 , fails to disclose any of the relevant information and , similar to her husband , has also amended the report several times , including as recently as october 17 . ",
        "according to politico , which first reported the lawsuit , the white house has yet to comment on the suit . lovitky 's suit against president trump also alleges that the financial disclosure agreement that he submitted in 2016 failed to accurately delineate trump 's financial liabilities for various debts listed in the disclosure . the justice department has moved to dismiss the suit , but the presiding judge has yet to issue a motion .
