        "when kol peterson moved to portland , oregon , in 2010 , affordable housing was a priority , as it was for many newcomers in this city 's booming real-estate market . he looked at two frequently discussed options for high-cost cities -- tiny houses on wheels and communal living -- but decided on another option : accessory dwelling units , or adus -- also known as `` granny flats , '' or basement or garage apartments . adus were n't yet common in portland -- that year , the city issued only 86 permits for them -- but when peterson did the math , he decided that building one was his best option . ",
        "`` i could buy a house , construct an adu in the backyard , and live in the adu while renting out the house , '' he said . that 's what he did : he bought a home in the city 's king-sabin neighborhood , built a two-story mini-home in its backyard , and moved in . the experience , he says , has been life-changing : `` building an 800-foot adu eventually eliminated my housing costs , and i 'm living in my dream house . `` eight years later , peterson works full-time helping others build adus and teaching classes for other interested portland homeowners . ",
        "the number of adu permits the city issues has risen dramatically ; in 2016 , it was 615 . in vancouver , canada -- an adu pioneer -- more than 2,000 adus have been built citywide in the last decade . but for most cities in north america , steep legal barriers are preventing this form of housing from taking off : many cities ban them outright , and those that do n't often have severe restrictions on size , owner occupancy , and parking . only a handful of cities have adjusted their regulations to encourage more adus -- mostly on the west coast , where severe housing affordability is a growing problem . ",
        "but peterson and other proponents of adus are predicting that the country is on the verge of welcoming more of them . `` by 2020 , adus will take off in tens of cities , '' he said . `` this does n't mean there will be an explosion of them overnight , but the concept will become more popular in the next couple of years . `` peterson recently wrote a book , backdoor revolution : the definitive guide to adu development , that walks potential adu builders through the planning and construction process , and tackles the social , economic , and environmental issues that relate to such housing . ",
        "i spoke with him recently about why adus are gaining traction and how cities could make them easier to build . the conversation that follows has been edited for length and clarity . kirk : why do you think we will we see more adus in the u. s. ? peterson : there 's a lot of single-family zoning in the center of our cities , and urban planners , civil society , and city leaders are questioning whether these zoning rules make sense . we 're missing dwellings that can house more people and are more affordable , such as duplexes , triplexes , and adus . ",
        "i do n't think tiny houses on wheels will soon become a widespread form of housing , because they are n't yet permittable . but media coverage of them has helped to spur more interest in small housing in general . these factors are positioning adus to become a popular movement . kirk : what are the benefits of adus for residents , cities , and the environment ? a converted garage apartment in portland peterson : adus allow people housing flexibility over time . you can design an adu in which to age in place , and then rent out your main house , allowing you to stay in your neighborhood as you grow older , and at less cost . ",
        "parents , caregivers , or adult children can also live in adus . adus use fewer resources like gas and electricity due to their size , and because they 're often built in walkable and bikeable areas , their residents generate less of an environmental impact that way as well . they also reduce the per-capita residential footprint . this is important because there are a lot of one - and two-person households in cities , but not the housing to match that demographic . adus can help fill this need . and adus generally do n't have a significant infrastructural impact on a city , in contrast to , say , a 400-unit apartment building . ",
        "they bring more housing to an area organically , and the city does n't have to build new infrastructure to accommodate it . kirk : where are adus already taking off in the u. s. ? peterson : a city must relax their adu codes to increase their number . in 2017 , the state of california did just that . while the legislation did not address one of the most problematic issues , the owner-occupancy requirement , it did relax the rules on providing parking spaces for adus . los angeles 's code already did n't require owner occupancy , so the statewide reduction in other regulations has been especially effective there . ",
        "l. a. went from having 142 adu permits issued in 2016 to roughly 2,000 in 2017 . san francisco , oakland , santa barbara , and numerous other california cities have also experienced a significant uptick , though not as extreme as l. a. ; portland and austin , texas , are other fairly adu-friendly cities . though this is a pretty limited subset of cities , the interest and demand for adus is growing . kirk : what should people do if they want to build an adu but they are illegal in their city , or the codes are too strict ? ",
        "peterson : one strategy is to point to other cities that are experiencing similar affordable-housing issues -- basically every coastal u. s. city -- and how those that allow and foster adus have benefited from them . as for codes , the owner-occupancy requirement is perhaps the most important to overcome . a strategy to eliminate the provision would be to request the city to drop it in a certain area , and then take stock of the consequences a year or two later . inevitably , adus wo n't generate problems , and then advocates can push for expanding the relaxed rule to the entire city . ",
        "the other argument worth noting is that cities in which adus are n't legal still have many of them ; people are just building them illegally . when a city relaxes adu codes , it encourages people to construct more of them -- and build them better so they 're safer . kirk : what should one keep in mind when designing an adu ? peterson : given the small size of an adu , it 's necessary to have a `` great room '' that houses the living room , dining room , and kitchen in a contiguous space . ",
        "such a room with high ceilings and a visual connection to an outdoor area that 's adjacent to the adu makes the space feel bigger than it is . also , adus are a form of urban-infill housing , so it 's a best practice to be respectful of neighbors and not infringe on their privacy . this means being careful in terms of placement of doors and windows . kirk : one critique of adus is that they encourage more short-term rentals , which actually exacerbate the dearth of affordable housing . what 's your response ? peterson : my hope is that adus would be treated like any other house in regard to short-term rentals . ",
        "by this i mean that if a city does n't allow short-term rentals , it should n't allow them in adus or any other dwelling . the reason parity is important is that the rules should be the same across the board , such as regarding owner occupancy . cities generally do n't require owner occupancy for a duplex , for instance , but do for an adu . this rule should be equally applied , or permitted adus will not be viewed as a desirable housing form for homeowners .
