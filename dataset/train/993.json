'' donaghy was found dead back on january 5th at a rental property he owned on valley oak drive in stockton . ",
        "police say the 17-year-old male was arrested friday , charged with homicide , and is currently booked in juvenile hall . `` even though an arrest has been made , this is still an active investigation , but our investigators believe this was not a random act , '' said joe silva with the stockton police department . donaghy was admired and respected throughout the stockton community for his selfless work feeding the hungry as director of the emergency food bank . a lasting legacy not lost on his son justin . `` it makes me very proud of my father , '' he said , standing next to his mother at saturday 's press briefing .
