        "israeli authorities are imposing `` severe restrictions '' on visits by palestinian families in the gaza strip to relatives held in israeli prisons , ngo b'tselem has reported . citing official israeli figures , b'tselem says there are 358 palestinian prisoners and detainees from the gaza strip being held in israeli prisons located within the green line . `` keeping residents of the occupied territories incarcerated within israel forces their relatives to obtain permits in order to visit them '' , the ngo noted . it is a violation of international law to transport prisoners outside of occupied territory . ",
        "as described by b'tselem , `` over the years , israel has imposed overwhelming obstacles on the families of inmates from gaza '' , such as banning all visits in 2007 , and only reinstating them in 2012 . at first , only visits by parents and spouses were reinstated , and , according to the red cross , israel now allows visits by children up to the age of 16 . there is , however , `` a blanket ban on visits from other relatives , including grandparents and siblings '' . visits are short , lasting 45-60 minutes , and `` a glass partition separates the inmate from his visitors , and they communicate by phone '' . ",
        "children under the age of ten are allowed to hug their father . as so-called ` security prisoners ' , palestinians are unable to communicate with their families by phone . when coupled with `` the stringent restrictions on visits , this makes life very difficult for their children , who grow up without their fathers ; on their wives , who are left to raise the children alone '' . b'tselem stated that `` maintaining family ties is a fundamental human right , and prison inmates are no exception '' . `` family visits are a right of detainees and prisoners , and visiting their relatives is a family 's right . ",
        "as israel chose to incarcerate residents of gaza in its sovereign territory , in breach of international law , it must allow their relatives to visit them without imposing arbitrary restrictions '' .   "
