        "richarlison has sparked speculation over his future at watford after posting a cryptic message on his twitter account . the brazilian has been in sparkling form since moving to the hornets in the summer , so much so that chelsea are weighing up bringing him to stamford bridge at the end of the season . he arrived at vicarage road in part thanks to manager marco silva , yet the shockwaves of the portuguese 's exit from the club as he was sacked on sunday , may lead for him to push for a move . -- richarlison andrade january 21 , 2018 in the aftermath of silva 's sacking , the 20-year-old published a tweet that simply showed an angry emoji . ",
        "watford have already made clear that richarlison is unavailable for transfer in january , though chelsea have already discussed a potential summer deal with agent giuliano bertolucci . however , the hornets have already shown that they are perfectly capable of playing hardball when it comes to the futures of their key figures . they rejected an approach from everton for silva -- an action that they claimed had an unsettling influence on their manager , pre-empting the difficult run of form that they have not been able to lift themselves from . with five goals and five assists in 24 premier league matches , richarlison has widely been considered their star performer this term .
