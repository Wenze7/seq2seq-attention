        "the birds and bees . children are punishment for narcissism . mine who is 16 , quite funny and often weird asked one of her famous dumb questions recently . what is the difference between the love we feel for a partner and that we feel for anyone else ? i did n't like this question , at this point , all l really want as a mother is a young adult who does her chores , bring good grades home and lets me watch shameless in peace . so we started one of our convoluted conversations in which we agreed that love is love but not all are born equally never mind treated fairly . ",
        "i tried to indoctrinate her into my preferred basic , lazy generalisation that men and women love differently whoever the gaze of love is directed ; parent , offspring , sibling lover , work or material . men seem hardwired to love in relation to themselves whilst women are conditioned to love in relation to relationship . men love me , women love us . the result is men tend towards selfishness and women towards manipulation . this does not make men and women bad or holy , they are bad and holy , recognition of this would make them more sexy , less problematic and pent up . ",
        "one must always fear and possibly detest those too cowardly to own their bad . my late great friend who was tearjerker funny often loudly proclaimed a preference for what she called bush bad men , she called them powerful . she was disdainful about `` new men '' whom she called new york vulnerables which l understand now to mean performance wokeness or what l call adire progressives . the female equivalent would be the ya-ya sisterhood of lies , manipulation and liberated repressors . they of the literal literati and academia who use words as weaponry to hide what is in essence crippling self doubt and social anxiety . ",
        "i was getting off on my own juice when the 16-year old who was now casually bored drawled , yeah mum but my question is what is the difference between the love we feel for our partner and love for others regardless of how women and men love . distractedly , all l could think of was sex so i blurted -- they are the ones we want to have sex with , even though we may want to have sex with those we do n't love as well and might no longer want to have sex with those we love . ",
        "i could hear myself sounding dumb although l trust my dumb . she looked confused , i felt confused so i dug the hole deeper saying -- i think the problem is we often have emotions we ca n't put words to and we tend to use sex as a way of expressing those emotions . words are such inadequate convoy for emotions . sex is one of our tools of comfort , expression and camaraderie . it 's abrahamic modern day power is derived from a need to organise society for material gain . that 's why sex generates such complex emotions in us , like food water and any other forms of taxed and regulated interactions with others and the elements . ",
        "we can use it for our own good or detriment . making it a major determinant of romantic love is problematic . love itself is fluid , i love you differently today than l did at 3 months old but l love you no less . she said she thinks she understands , so we both went back to doing things we love but which we do not want to have sex with . - ms chief witch .
