        "the european commission announced today that it has leveled a $ 1.23 billion fine against qualcomm for a deal it made with apple that prevented other companies from competing fairly for smartphone giant 's chip business . the fine is massive , thought it 's well below the more than $ 2 billion the commission could have sought under europe 's antitrust laws . still , officials made it clear that they believed qualcomm 's strategy hurt consumer choice and limited innovation . `` qualcomm illegally shut out rivals from the market for lte baseband chipsets for over five years , thereby cementing its market dominance , '' said commissioner margrethe vestager , head of competition policy , said in a statement . ",
        "`` qualcomm paid billions of us dollars to a key customer , apple , so that it would not buy from rivals . these payments were not just reductions in price -- they were made on the condition that apple would exclusively use qualcomm 's baseband chipsets in all its iphones and ipads . '' qualcomm has previously denied it violated antitrust laws , and is expected to appeal the decision , which means a final resolution of the case is likely years away . the commissions investigation was launched in 2015 , over concerns that qualcomm was abusing its dominant position in lte chipsets . ",
        "while having market dominance is not illegal , eu antitrust rules make it clear that such power can not be used to limit competition . in fact , the investigation found that between 2011 and 2016 , qualcomm accounted for more than 90 percent marketshare . the commission concluded in its ruling that this power was abused because qualcomm made `` significant payments to a key customer on condition that it would exclusively use qualcomm chipsets ... by making sure that rivals had no chance to compete for any of apple 's important business , qualcomm 's conduct had an effect on the lte baseband chipset market as a whole . '' ",
