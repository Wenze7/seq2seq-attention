        "manchester city 's technical superiority has been the envy of the premier league thus far this season , although it turns out that even the likes of sergio aguero find the odd shape of a rugby ball disorienting . in the first part of a series of challenges pitting football against rugby by online bookmakers betsafe , a select handful of city players were tasked with controlling a variety of balls from a height . sergio aguero , fernandinho , nicolas otamendi and danilo make up the team representing football and city , while jamie george , schalk burger , ben spencer and richard barrington lineup for rugby and the saracens . ",
        "former city goalkeeper shay given and ex-saracens player jim hamilton act as captains for their respective teams . the series , created by betsafe with support from uk agencies fuse and pretty green , will involve a number of challenges , including aiming kicks into a 20m high crane , taking shots at goal in the face of a wind machine , and catching balls through a wall of smoke . episode one , however , might have been considered a slightly less onerous task for players possessing such silky first touches . episode 1 | watch @mancity try and #overcometheodds set by @saracens in the ultimate football vs rugby challenges .
