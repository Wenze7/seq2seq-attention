        "the philippine government has revoked the operating license of leading news website rappler , officials said monday in a ruling denounced by president rodrigo duterte 's critics as the latest blow to press freedom . rappler , set up in 2012 , is among a clutch of philippine news organizations that have sparred with duterte over their critical coverage of his brutal drugs war . but the government rejected allegations that the ruling was an attack on press freedom , with duterte 's spokesman saying rappler and rappler holdings corp had violated a provision in the country 's constitution restricting media ownership to filipinos . ",
        "at his state of the nation address to congress last year duterte vowed to expose rappler 's `` american ownership . '' `` the issue at hand is the compliance of 100 percent filipino ownership and management of mass media . it is not about infringement on the freedom of the press , '' duterte spokesman harry roque said in a statement monday . `` no one is above the law . rappler has to comply , '' roque added . rappler 's acting managing editor chay hofilena told afp the company would file a court appeal against the securities and exchange commission ruling , which is due to take effect in 15 days . ",
        "`` this is pure and simple harassment , the seeming coup de grace to the relentless and malicious attacks against us since 2016 , '' the website said in a statement . `` we will continue bringing you the news , holding the powerful to account for their actions and decisions , calling attention to government lapses that further disempower the disadvantaged , '' it said . the case concerns rappler holdings ' decision to issue philippine depositary receipts for shares of rappler inc. . that the government said were sold to foreign companies . '' existing for no other purpose than to effect a deceptive scheme to circumvent the constitution , '' the sec said in a january 11 ruling to revoke rappler 's certificates of incorporation that was posted on the commission 's website monday . ",
        "the ruling followed setbacks suffered by other philippine news organisations which have criticized duterte 's war on drugs that has killed nearly 4,000 suspects . in march last year duterte described top newspaper philippine daily inquirer and leading television broadcaster abs-cbn as `` sons of whores '' and warned them of karmic repercussions over their criticism of his drug war . `` i 'm not threatening them but someday their karma will catch up with them , '' duterte said . `` they 're shameless , those sons of whore journalists , '' he added . four months later the inquirer announced its owners were in talks to sell the publication . ",
        "a business tycoon who backed duterte 's 2016 election bid later disclosed he was planning to buy the inquirer . last year duterte threatened to block abs-cbn 's application to renew its operating franchise , a permit that requires congressional approval . the mass media watchdog group national union of journalists of the philippines denounced the rappler ruling . `` it was but one of many threats duterte has made against media critical of him and his governance , such as the philippine daily inquirer and broadcast network abs-cbn , '' the union said in a statement . `` we call on all filipino journalists to unite and resist every and all attempts to silence us , '' the group added . ",
        "opposition senator risa hontiveros also criticised the ruling , calling it `` pure harassment and a clear attack on press freedom . ''   "
