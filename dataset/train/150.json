        "australia 's injured spearhead mitchell starc has peppered england with barbs before the boxing day test . starc wo n't play at the mcg this week but he came off the long run in pre-match press duties , describing jimmy anderson 's claim about australia 's supposed lack of pace depth in the ashes as humorous . the left-armer also took exception to recent debate about his side 's short - pitched salvo at the opposition 's tail , noting `` our guys have copped enough bouncers and we have n't whinged about it yet '' . anderson remarked last week australia have `` got problems '' beyond the gun pace trio of starc , josh hazlewood and pat cummins , saying `` they 've not got much other than these three '' .

        "he still bowls quick enough , i 'm pretty sure he still bowls quicker than the poms ' bowlers . `` hopefully he takes a five-for and sticks it up this depth comment . `` it 's pretty humorous . i think they 've got bigger things to worry about than the depth of australia 's fast bowlers . `` we 've got to keep playing good cricket on the field , hopefully be 4-0 by the end of the week and they wo n't have too much else to say . '' anderson , england 's all-time leading wicket-taker , has infuriated australia like few others throughout his entire career . ",
        "the veteran clipped michael clarke with a batting pad after english and australian players shared a couple of beers in the dressing rooms back in 2006 . clarke memorably told anderson to get ready for a `` broken f ** ing arm '' during arguably the most heated moment of the lopsided 2013-14 ashes . steve smith described anderson as `` one of the biggest sledgers in the game '' prior to the second test of this summer , taking exception to one of the spearhead 's newspaper columns . it 's understood smith was sledged by anderson throughout his game-changing ton at the gabba , while the pair swapped heated verbals at adelaide oval .
