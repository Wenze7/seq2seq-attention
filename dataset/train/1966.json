        "jurgen klopp will reportedly allow woodburn to leave anfield on loan , providing he is guaranteed first team opportunitiessunderland have been handed a huge boost in their pursuit of ben woodburn , with liverpool boss jurgen klopp said to be ready to allow the young winder out on loan on one condition . according to our sister paper the liverpool echo , klopp will sanction a loan exit for woodburn during the january transfer window , providing the side he goes to guarantees him chances of first team action . that is a huge boost for sunderland and manager chris coleman , who is keen to bring the former wales international to the stadium of light , but faces tough competition . ",
        "not only will coleman be able to offer woodburn first team football , klopp , who looks set to be very selective with where he sends one of liverpool 's brightest prospects , should also trust the black cats boss to look after him , just as he did during his time with wales . on top of that , it is believed woodburn himself is very keen on the move to sunderland to be reunited with coleman who gave him his wales debut . coleman has the advantage of knowing both the 18-year-old and his family , as he and other wales officials worked hard to convince them that he should commit his international future to them over england . ",
        "it would appear woodburn joining sunderland is certainly likely , providing klopp is willing to allow the move . klopp is very protective of the winger which is why he knocked back a number of enquiries in the summer . don goodman : sunderland need to make changes in january , but will they have the budget to ? he 's made ten senior liverpool outings already , but has only managed 45 minutes for the first team this term , which is why they are now considering a loan .
