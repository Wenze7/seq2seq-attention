        "simone quinlan 's parents say they 'll never lose the hatred they have for the men who bashed , shot and set their daughter on fire for `` snitching '' on her boyfriend by reporting his violence against her to the police . justice jane dixon denounced the `` punishment for snitching '' imposed by brendan neil , 31 , and wayne marmo , 26 , as she jailed the men for the vicious murder of the melbourne woman . on thursday in the supreme court of victoria , dixon sentenced neil to 26 years in prison and marmo to 24 years . ",
        "wayne quinlan said while nothing would replace his daughter , the sentences were `` better than some of the outcomes i 've seen in recent times '' . `` i do n't think i or my wife will ever lose the hate of what they 've done , '' he said . after quinlan was bashed and shot , the 33-year-old was dumped in a mineshaft and set alight as punishment for reporting neil , who had hit her in the head with a baseball bat . quinlan started seeing neil only months earlier . she had been homeless , had a drug problem , had lost custody of her two sons and was living under a bridge . ",
        "neil was controlling and violent , and days after she made her statement to police that mentioned the baseball bat incident , he attacked her at his melton home , north-west of melbourne , in august 2015 . the court heard he beat her and smashed her head with a hammer , before taping it up and telling her she looked beautiful like that . during the assault , his mate marmo sat in the kitchen , filing the barrel of a . 22-calibre rifle as he smoked ice with friends . quinlan passed out , leaving large pools of blood on the floor . ",
        "it is unknown whether she was already dead when the pair loaded her into marmo 's ute . marmo then drove quinlan to a mineshaft at kangaroo flat , 120 km from melton , stopping on the way to shoot her in the head about five times . he poured petrol down the mineshaft and set her body on fire . the pair then tried to cover their tracks . neil went to the pub to get his face on cctv and later sent a text message to quinlan , ending their relationship , in an act described by the court as `` self-preservation '' . ",
        "marmo washed the blood from his car and set it on fire before the pair later sanded the floors of neil 's home to remove bloodstains . neil pleaded guilty to murder , while marmo was found guilty of murder by a jury for being complicit in neil 's actions . dixon said neil was prone to jealous and violent outbursts , while marmo agreed quinlan must be disposed of . `` wayne marmo , you were loyal to your friend brendan neil and you were prepared to involve yourself in murder because of this loyalty , '' she said . ",
        "`` under the code that both of you lived by at the time , it was unacceptable for simone quinlan to snitch . this culture of punishment for snitching must be denounced . `` quinlan 's grieving loved ones wore red - her favourite colour - at court for her killers ' sentencing . lynda quinlan told reporters afterwards that her daughter 's favourite time of year was christmas , making december a difficult time . `` knowing we 'll never see her again , i still ca n't compute in my brain , '' she told reporters . neil will be eligible for parole in 22 years , while marmo could be out in 20 years .
