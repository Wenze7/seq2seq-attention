        "president donald trump got back on twitter this morning , and at one point , he issued a bit of misleading information about a supposed boost in his approval ratings . the president got the most out of his `` executive time '' today , issuing statements about several of his favorite talking points . one tweet that stood out though was this : . as quite a few responders on twitter pointed out , the president 's approval rates among african americans have not doubled , and they 're actually still quite low : . this is n't true - just more bullshit from @foxandfriends ðŸ™„ -- montel williams january 16 , 2018 . ",
        "it would seem that trump 's approval ratings quote is a spin based on a recent breitbart piece that positively compares his 2016 vote share to his approval ratings . among black men , trump 's `` 2017 average approval rating significantly exceeds his 2016 vote share , '' admitted a january 11 article in the atlantic by author ronald brownstein . `` 23 percent of black men approved of trump 's performance versus 11 percent of black women , '' said the article . that score averages out to 17 percent , or twice the 8 percent score he was given in the 2016 exit polls . ",
        "as washington post explains , the problem with brietbart 's article is that it draws misleading averages from the data collected by surveymonkey and cbs , which were then compared to exit polls from the 2016 election . even though trump 's approval rating as a candidate was enough to topple hillary clinton , many of the surveyed voters do not have a favorable opinion of his job in office . the breitbart piece cites an article written by the atlantic 's ron brownstein , which was headlined the voters abandoning donald trump . brownstein noticed that trump 's approval among african american men is double his rating among black women , though a 2016 vote share of 13 percent is not a particularly difficult number to improve upon . ",
        "it 's also unlikely that trump 's approval ratings will go up at the moment , since he 's still dealing with the controversy surrounding his remarks about `` people from sh*t hole countries . '' -- -- > > follow ken meyer on twitter .   "
