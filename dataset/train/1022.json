        "sudanese president , omar al-bashir , asserted , thursday , that his country 's forces are ready to repel what he described as the `` aggression of the traitors , the conspirators and the insurgents . '' earlier today , the sudanese presidential assistant , ibrahim mahmoud , stated that his country is anticipating security threats from neighbouring countries egypt and eritrea following military movements conducted by the two countries in eritrean sawa region . there was no immediate comment from the egypt . however , cairo has repeatedly denied the interference in sudan 's internal affairs . during a televised public speech from singa , sennar state , al-bashir announced that `` the soldiers are ready to repel anyone lurking . '' ",
        "during his speech , al-bashir called for the revival of what he described as `` the virtue of jihad '' and quoted the slogan , `` we are ready , ready to protect religion '' in reference to slogans that became prominant at the time of his rise to power in 1989 . khartoum announced last saturday the closure of the border crossings with eritrea , and attached the government order with a presidential decree , issued on 30 december , 2017 , which provided the declaration of the state of emergency in the state of kassala for six months amid deteriorating security conditions . ",
        "however , sudanese media outlets attributed the closure of the border , sending military reinforcements and the announcement of the state of `` mobilization and alert '' in kassala to what they called egyptian-eritrean military forces and darfuri insurgent movements on the eritrean side of the border .
