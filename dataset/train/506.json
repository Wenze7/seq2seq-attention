        "european cities are increasingly exposed to physical risks stemming from climate change shocks and trends that will test their ability to adapt and may weaken their credit strength , according to a new report . in a note to its clients , ratings agency moody 's opined that the range of climate challenges faced by european cities is broad : rising sea levels and increasingly frequent river floods will affect some cities , while others will experience more heatwaves , drought and wildfires , creating new challenges for city governments . `` from coastal flooding in northern europe to water scarcity in the south , changing climate patterns have the potential to alter cities ' economic profiles and financial strength , '' said mauro crisafulli , associate managing director at moody 's and co-author of the report . ",
        "`` climate risks will manifest themselves through both gradual trends and acute shocks for cities across the continent , not only disrupting economic activity , but also causing damage to property and infrastructure . `` with nearly three-quarters of europe 's population living in cities , municipal authorities will play an active part , along with national governments , in responding to climate challenges and planning for future changes that may alter the physical and economic landscape of urban areas , moody 's added . industry surveys suggest that awareness about the issue is high among european city administrations , and that , to varying degrees , authorities are taking steps to develop long-term plans and to put money aside to respond to the threat .
