        "pittsburgh steelers wide receiver juju smith-schuster and cincinnati bengals safety george iloka both were suspended one game for their hits in the steelers ' 23-20 win monday night . smith-schuster leveled bengals linebacker vontaze burfict on a fourth-quarter blindside block and then stood over him in celebration . burfict had to be carted off and was placed in the nfl 's concussion protocol . smith-schuster was penalized for both the hit and taunting . `` i apologize for standing over him . that 's not me , '' smith-schuster said . `` i 'm better than that . it 's very unsportsmanlike conduct and i hope he feels better and gets better . '' ",
        "in a letter explaining the decision , nfl vice president of football operations jon runyan wrote , `` the contact you made with your opponent placed the opposing player at risk of serious injury and could have been avoided . your conduct following the hit fell far below the high standards of sportsmanship expected of an nfl player . '' iloka issued a helmet-to-helmet hit on steelers wide receiver on antonio brown in the fourth quarter . brown held onto ben roethlisberger 's touchdown pass on the play , tying the game at 20 . runyan wrote : `` you violently struck a defenseless receiver in the head and neck area . ",
        "the competition committee has clearly expressed its goal of ` eliminating flagrant hits that have no place in our game ' and has encouraged the league office to suspend offenders for egregious violations such as the one you committed last night . '' smith-schuster is set to miss sunday 's game against the baltimore ravens , while iloka will miss a home game against the chicago bears . photos : best of nfl week 13 .   "
