        "the oakland unified school board on wednesday night finalized $ 9 million in mid-year budget cuts in an effort to remain fiscally solvent after years of overspending . of that $ 9 million , $ 3.8 million is coming from school site budget -- a move opposed by hundreds of teachers , students and parents at school board meetings over the past few months . the rest is coming from the district 's central -- or administrative -- budget . the cuts include the laying off of 26 central office employees -- including school police officers , people in administrative positions , program managers and more -- and reduction of nine full-time central office positions to part-time positions . ",
        "twelve full-time school site employees will be also be laid off -- including academic mentors , a library clerk , physical education attendants , a family parent liaison , noon supervisors and more -- and others were reduced to part-time positions . no teachers are being laid off . the layoffs will take effect in march , ousd spokesman john sasaki told the oakland tribune . the employees will be given 60 days notice . reductions in the school sites budget were also made in supplies , substitute teachers , and overtime . the school board , in november , voted to enact more than $ 15 million in cuts , but later reduced it after further assessment of the district 's finances . ",
        "the $ 9 million accounts for $ 1.1 million to restore the district 's reserve account to the minimum required to avoid state receivership , $ 3.9 million to pay for specified costs such as special education services , substitute costs and transportation contracts , and $ 4 million to account for unforeseen costs based on historic fluctuations . activists have been urging the school board only to cut the minimum amount to avoid state receivership -- first said by district officials to be $ 1.2 million , then $ 1.1 million . but if the district does n't have extra funds and ends up going over budget by the end of the school year -- which it has for the past five years -- it would then go in to state receivership , superintendent kyla johnson-trammel said at the meeting .
