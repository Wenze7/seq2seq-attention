        "richard goodwin 08/01/2018 - 10:54 amhonor will break into the us phone space in 2018 , and the first handsets out the blocks will be the honor 7x and the honor view 10honor is an offshoot of huawei . the company has been pumping out handsets for the uk and china for a solid few years now , and for the most part the handsets it has made have been very impressive . like oneplus , honor is all about value for money . the phones are well built , pack in plenty of technology , and , most importantly , look rather nice too . ",
        "but the biggest usp for honor has always been price -- the phones retail for less than $ 200 in most cases . meet the honor 7x and honor view 10the honor 7x will be available in the us later this year for $ 199 , or a fifth of the cost of the iphone x . it will be available in red or black and it features some pretty impressive specs , as you can see below : the honor view 10 is honor 's flagship handset and it will apparently retail for $ 399 in the us , though the extra cost nets you quite a bit more with respect to specs and hardware . ",
        "the honor view 10 is very similar to huawei 's mate 10 , an exceptional phone , and features the company 's lauded kirin 970 cpu , a 16mp camera , a 3750mah battery , and a decent-sized display for media . both phones are very solid options for anyone that is looking for value for money and decent specs and features . honor has not yet confirmed when the handsets will get a us release date , but as soon as they do we 'll update this article with all the pertinent details .
