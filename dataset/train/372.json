        "in a world where it 's just not that surprising that the president has been accused of an affair , a main point of interest in regards to the announcement of his potential affair is that president donald trump may have an obsessive fear of sharks . the wall street journal reported last friday that president trump paid adult film star stephanie clifford $ 130,000 to sign a non-disclosure agreement in regards to their alleged relationship . however , five years before the agreement , clifford conducted an interview with in touch magazine in which she describes the president 's fear of the finned creatures . ",
        "clifford eloquently declared they were watching a show `` about u. s.s. something '' when trump made clear not only his dislike of sharks , but also that he would love the species to die out all together . she then claimed trump to have said `` i donate to all these charities and i would never donate to any charity that helps sharks . '' something about trump talking about how great he is even while discussing an irrational fear just makes these allegations seem true . but if you do n't want to take the word of a porn-star who may have let a presidential candidate pay her off , look no further than president trump 's tweets where he has , as usual , expressed his unfiltered thoughts . ",
        "probably the most surprising part of this tweet is that trump apologized for his views . meanwhile , making random claims about the lifespan of the species seems just his style . but even though he thinks sharks will live a long time , he still has no interest in them being around . the president 's tweets from 2013 also make it pretty clear that the allegation that he does n't like sharks is absolutely true . as for his views on `` losers and haters '' , they were already pretty clear . and honestly , his fear is n't even that surprising after allegations of his fear of stairs and dinosaurs . ",
        "maybe soon he will develop a fear to something useful .   "
