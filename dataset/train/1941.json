        "relationships are hard . that 's why there 's so many books , courses , and councillors out there dedicated to helping people with their relationships . one of the most common reasons people cite as to why a relationship broke down is due to poor communication . that is the biggest misconception about relationships to date . the real reason why relationships break down is due to the lack of/degradation of respect between the parties involved . take a moment and think about some things/events that occurred in your own personal relationships that have broken down . hopefully , you 'll see some patterns . ",
        "namely , the other person/people in the relationship lied to you , gave you advice that did not have your best interest in mind , and ultimately had no respect for you . that 's right . no respect for you . do n't believe me ? take a moment and think about how this person/these people treat people they ` have a great relationship with ' . when asked a question , they answer earnestly . when asked to do something , they promptly get it done . i am no councillor and have no advice to give to those who wish to reconcile a broken relationship or a relationship that is hitting the rocks . ",
        "however , i can provide a simple way to determine whether someone has any respect for you or not . play a simple game with this person/these people . and i mean play a game -- a video game , a board game , badminton , volleyball , any game -- an actual game . but do not choose a game that contains deception as part of the game . while playing the game , observe how this person/these people behave . that is it . simple . bonus : take a moment to think of times when this person/these people behaved the same way in real life scenarios .
