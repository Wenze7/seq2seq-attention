        "the los angeles angels are sick of wasting mike trout 's prime . the team continued its strong offseason friday , picking up former cincinnati reds shortstop zack cozart on a three-year deal , according to jeff fletcher of the orange county register . the deal is worth $ 38 million , according to ken rosenthal of the athletic . the 32-year-old cozart broke out in a big way in 2017 , hitting . 297 / . 385 / . 548 , with 24 home runs , over 507 plate appearances . that performance was enough to send the veteran to his first all-star game . ",
        "prior to 2017 , cozart 's main draw was his solid defense at short . that wo n't be needed with the angels . with andrelton simmons already at the position , and ian kinsler now at second , it 's assumed cozart will play third base . that should be a new challenge for him , as cozart has never played third base in the majors or minors . cozart marks the third major move made by the angels already this offseason . the team kicked things off by being the surprising winner of the shohei ohtani sweepstakes . ",
        "they then solidified second base by trading for kinsler . cozart gives them yet another solid weapon that inches them closer to the postseason , especially if he can retain his offensive gains from 2017 . this post will be updated .   "
