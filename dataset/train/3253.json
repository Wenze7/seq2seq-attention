        "warsaw , poland -- poland 's lawmakers rejected a proposal to liberalize the country 's strict abortion law wednesday and voted to continue work on further toughening the rules . the opposing approaches were embodied in two separate draft laws proposed by different civic groups . the current law outlaws abortions in all but the most exceptional cases and only up to the 12th week of pregnancy . abortion is allowed only when a woman 's health or life is in danger , a pregnancy results from crime , or a fetus is irreparably damaged . following a heated debate , lawmakers voted to send a proposal to ban abortions of sick fetuses for more work by special parliamentary commissions . ",
        "the proposal is backed by the conservative governing party and president andrzej duda . the lawmakers also voted to reject the proposal that would have removed all restrictions on abortion within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy . the ruling party has a slight majority in parliament , allowing it to block legislation it does not like . in 2016 , a nationwide protest organized by women led the government to back away from plans to ban all abortions .
