        "ico a new way to finance business ideas and developing projects , the last few years have become more and more popular especially in 2017 . major developers are interested in this method to raise funds to finance their projects . by using ico , developers will get quick funding to speed up the projects they are financing . meanwhile , investors who launch the funds will get a token or coin that will be traded freely in the market exchangers . while investors also get benefit by following the ico . they benefit because the price is cheaper before the coin is launched into the free market . ",
        "and when the coin is launched , the price can soar many times over . this is what will benefit for the investors . although the using of ico is considered beneficial , this fundraising or ico also has substantial losses . this is because blockchain technology - global online databases - has no guarantee for investors to avoid scams and fraud . therefore , decentralized escrow is a leading decentralized escrow platform for ico implementation . some issues such as mistrust in the startup project , lack of confidence over the use of funds invested , lack of control over the use of funds invested , and the absence of user friendliness in interacting with startup projects in the final product development process , can be overcome by descrow platform . ",
        "the use of escrow is the most perfect way that can be used to ensure the security , storage , collection , and use of collected funds . includes problems of possible manipulation . however , the problem of belief can be overcome with descrow because descrow is able to define further financing rationality through the general voting of investors on each implementation of a project . and without covering up the shortcomings , that descrow believes no one can make an efficient business model in a short time because at least we need 6 months to make the realization stage of a different project . ",
        "to avoid scam or froud , descrow tries to offer a system that allows to check the intent of the project creator , so that things that harm such a scam can be minimized at least . investors can avoid losing income if something happens like force majeure circumstances . other benefits to be gained by investors include the allowance to verify startup 's team , and also the readiness to follow the road map . in fact , if the startup team fails to meet its obligations , investors are entitled to stop financing . however , the termination of the term must first be through voting . ",
        "in case of non-compliance with the prescribed liability , descrow will return the fully booked invasion . then with the help of funds collected during ico and commission fees , descrow will help fund the insurance for assets invested in the previous stage . if the first stage of the theft occurs , because this stage is a vulnerable stage , affected parties will get compensation . for the value , the replacement can be made in proportion to the value of the token scam or the stolen value but will not exceed 70 % of the funds lost by the investor . ",
        "and other surprises , descrow will give the owner the opportunity to participate in the lucky draw every three months . from the above explanations , it can be concluded that des is able to increase investor confidence which results in increased funding , and allows to receive feedback at various stages of project implementation . and it is important that des tokens give shareholders 30 % discount for services available within platform frameworks . so , of the several advantages mentioned above , are you still not interested in using the descrow platform ?
