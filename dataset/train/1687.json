        "columbus , ohio -- an ohio man who admitted he plotted to kill u. s. military members after receiving training in syria apologized to his family and adopted country monday before a federal judge sentenced him to 22 years in prison . after returning to the u. s. , abdirahman sheik mohamud planned to fly to texas and attack the federal medical center carswell in fort worth in an attempt to free aafia siddiqui , a pakistani scientist convicted of shooting at two u. s. soldiers in afghanistan , judge michael watson said as he outlined the allegations against mohamud . ",
        "mohamud , 26 , told watson he knew what he 'd done was wrong and that he 'd fallen into the trap of radicalization while abroad . `` do you have any idea how misguided that was ? '' watson asked mohamud before he sentenced him . `` absolutely , '' replied mohamud , who appeared in jail clothes and had shackles around his ankles and his hands chained to his waist . `` i wish i could take it back , your honor . `` watson said he based the sentence on the `` deadly serious '' nature of the crime and the need to deter others from considering similar actions . ",
        "watson drew attention to the fact that mohamud applied for a passport to travel abroad only a week after he became a u. s. citizen in 2014 . mohamud was born in somalia and came to the u. s. as a 2-year-old child . he was arrested in 2015 and pleaded guilty a few months later . the attacks were never carried out . mohamud bought a ticket to greece with a stop in turkey , where he disembarked before going to syria , prosecutors said in court documents . they said he never intended to go to greece . ",
        "mohamud trained with al-nusrah front , a terrorist organization affiliated with al-qaeda , according to the government . defense attorney sam shamansky asked for leniency , saying mohamud did n't have his father around when he was growing up , was brainwashed while abroad `` by professional head twisters '' but later realized his error and abandoned his plot . `` this is a scared , confused , 23-year-old kid , an american kid , who gets his head twisted , '' shamansky said . he called mohamud 's plan `` nonsensical . `` prosecutors noted mohamud contacted others from jail after his arrest and told them not to say anything . ",
        "`` before sept. . 11 , 2001 , a plot to take down the twin towers would have been considered nonsensical , '' said assistant u. s. attorney doug squires . `` because of the fbi , this plot was taken down , and we 're all safer for it . `` several members of mohamud 's family were in court but did not speak . watson said , referring to a letter mohamud 's sister had written , `` your actions have shaken the whole family . `` an investigation continues . watson made reference to a plot involving at least five people . ",
        "shamansky referred to a group he called `` the basketball five , '' but would n't elaborate . the judge also sentenced mohamud to 10 years of supervision after his release from prison and ordered him to earn his ged while behind bars .   "
