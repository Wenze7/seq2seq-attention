        "donald trump tweeted that the us `` foolishly spent '' $ 7 trillion in the middle east , urging for money to be invested in rebuilding his own country . trump 's twitter statement published on friday initially focused on economic issues , but eventually took aim at the us policy in the middle east . `` at some point , and for the good of the country , i predict we will start working with the democrats in a bipartisan fashion . '' `` infrastructure would be a perfect place to start , '' the tycoon-turned-president tweeted , adding : `` after having foolishly spent $ 7 trillion in the middle east , it is time to start rebuilding our country ! '' ",
        "the tweet came a day after 128 un members supported a general assembly resolution which condemned the trump administration 's recognition of jerusalem as israeli capital . the vote took place during a rare un general assembly emergency session , convened at the request of arab and muslim states . trump warned before the session that the us could punish nations which vote against washington 's decision at the general assembly , saying on wednesday that there are countries that `` take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars , and then they vote against us . '' ",
        "`` well , we 're watching those votes . let them vote against us , we 'll save a lot . we do n't care . '' us military ventures in the middle east over just the last decade and a half have indeed cost washington a pretty sum . even though the pentagon said in june that it had spent only $ 1.5 trillion on war-related costs since september 11 , 2001 , the real figures could be much higher . according to a report prepared by the congressional research service back in 2014 , the costs of the us war on terror already amounted to at least $ 1.6 trillion at that time . ",
        "later , a 2016 brown university study put the costs of us wars in iraq , afghanistan , pakistan , and syria at about $ 3.6 trillion over the period between 2001 and 2016 , adding that they would likely reach $ 4.79 trillion by the end of 2017 . a 2013 harvard university working paper said that the cost of just two us wars -- in iraq and afghanistan -- could eventually amount to between $ 4 and 6 trillion , including long-term medical care and disability compensation for service members , veterans and families , military replenishment , and social and economic expenses . ",
        "bonnie kristian , a fellow at the washington-based defense priorities think tank put the total costs of the us wars in iraq and afghanistan , including the `` relevant legacy costs , '' at $ 5 trillion . in her article published by forbes magazine , she also predicted that this already hefty bill would grow to $ 12 trillion by 2053 even if the us is `` done in iraq and afghanistan by the end of 2017 , '' as it includes healthcare commitments to us veterans and `` interest on the debt incurred by these wars . '' ",
        "and that does not include the costs of other us military endeavors , such as the 2011 intervention in libya or overseas operations in countries such as pakistan , somalia , or yemen . apart from that , since 2001 , the us has also spent $ 164.3 billion worth of aid to iraq and afghanistan , according to usaid .
