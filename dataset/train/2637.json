        "14 ways sobriety changed my life # 8 setting boundaries : this was hard to do . learning to not pick up other peoples baggage and add it to mine . learning to step back from situations and let things play out . learn to tap out when i know i 've had enough . learning to shut up in the heat of the moment before my mouth makes a situation worse . learning to say no ! when i do n't want to help someone , when i do n't want to go to an event , when i do n't want to add in more responsibility . ",
        "i have learned what my limits are and how to set a boundary with a person i am not comfortable with . i was a woman who wanted to live in a world with boundaries . when i under the influence i would a set boundary but moved the line multiple times in order to accommodate people . it did n't take much to persuade me into moving my boundaries around . it was a weak boundary which also ended up with me in terrible situations . i can not tell you how many times i had to deal with strangers , sleep in strange places , and go to places i 'm not comfortable with because i set a boundary but i moved it to accommodate other people . ",
        "today i 'm no longer moving that boundary and i stand my ground when i do n't want to go somewhere or run off with some stranger just because my friends . i 'm no longer doing things to accommodate other people .   "
