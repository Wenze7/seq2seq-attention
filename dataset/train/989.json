        "environment victoria says extending australia 's most polluting power station would pose an ` unacceptable risk ' to the climatemelissa daveythe victorian government is considering whether to extend the coalmining licence for australia 's most polluting power station , yallourn , in the state 's latrobe valley . a spokesman for the resources minister , tim pallas , said the government 's mining industry regulator , earth resources regulation , was assessing the mine licence extension application and was expected to provide advice to the minister shortly . the existing licence was issued in 1996 and is due to expire in 2026 . ",
        "related : what is the national energy guarantee and is it really a game changer ? in november the victorian government legislated for net zero emissions by 2050 , and set interim emissions reduction targets at five-year intervals . the ceo of environment victoria , mark wakeham , said extending the licence would pose an `` unacceptable risk '' to the climate and to the stability of an ageing electricity grid . he said given the zero-emissions legislation , the government should reject the proposal outright . `` since the closure of hazelwood , yallourn has taken the mantle of dirtiest power station in australia , '' wakeham said . ",
        "`` rather than proposing to extend the life of this polluting clunker we should be planning for its closure and supporting the latrobe valley community with a fair and just economic transition . `` the andrews government must n't give special treatment to ageing coal-burning power stations that are endangering our climate . '' yallourn has sought an extension to continue open-cut coalmining operations to 31 december 2032 , at which point it has said it will turn its efforts towards mine rehabilitation . but an honorary associate professor with the australian national university 's school of public policy , hugh saddler , said he did not believe the refusal of license extensions to mine coal should be used as a de facto mechanism for driving the closure of high-emission power stations . ",
        "the federal government 's proposed national energy guarantee would not adequately support coal stations to transition away from high-emissions power generation , he said . related : south australia and act outvoted on national energy guarantee `` just because a power station might be granted an extension , it also does n't mean they will keep operating the power station until that date , '' saddler said . `` some years ago the then owner of hazelwood sought and was given an extension which went way beyond last year when it closed . i do n't think that the refusal of the licence to mine coal should be used as the instrument to plan the orderly closure to high-emission power stations . '' ",
        "while saddler said he opposed the extension of hazelwood 's licence at the time , he said circumstances had changed . `` what is happening now with the electricity system is we are entering into a period of transition which is huge and which is a really historic change , similar to the change away from telecom to mobile phones , '' he said . `` it 's a massive change and it 's clear to everyone the change is being very much driven by new technologies . apart from the environmental requirements to change , the economics of renewables alone are a powerful driver away from traditional suppliers . ",
        "`` but that has massive implications to the structure of the electricity grid , which is an enormous asset , and what we have n't had in australia is a clear and consistent way to plan for that . we need something better than what the proposed national energy guarantee offers . '' in the absence of a strategy , it was not unreasonable to grant power plants more time to transition through a license extension as a kind of insurance policy , he said . the proposed national energy guarantee would require energy retailers to commit to a reliability guarantee to meet energy needs in each state from sources such as coal , gas , pumped hydro and batteries , while also signing up to an emissions guarantee to meet australia 's international commitments to reducing emissions . ",
        "it would effectively force electricity providers to have a mix of energy sources , including low-emission sources . the guarantee , which requires sign-on from state and territory governments , has been met with a mixed response , with some experts saying it will encourage investment in low-cost renewables , while others believe it does not go far enough to push providers away from polluting energy sources .
