        "greetings everybody ! my name is agam berry , a serial entrepreneur and technology enthusiast with a passion for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin . i became interested in the space in 2013 after a friend told me i should look into it . i was amazed by all of the advantages cryptocurrency has over more traditional fiat currencies , especially their potential to enable individuals in countries with limited access to conventional banking institutions to participate in the global economy . after completing my own research , i started telling friends , family , and anybody else who would listen about the value of crypto . ",
        "i even convinced my accountant to accept payment in bitcoin in 2014 and tweeted about it . that was so fun ! you need an exchange to get into the crypto market , and choosing the right one is essential for both fun and profit . today , i 'm going to share my three favorite cryptocurrency exchanges with you . 1 . coinbasecoinbase . com is a fantastic exchange for novice investors looking to get acclimated to the cryptocurrency ecosystem . it offers an intuitive interface and the convenient option to link a bank account or credit card to fund your investments , making the entire process really simple . ",
        "i also like how it limits investors to the most popular tokens on the marketplace . these established coins tend to be more stable than those with less of a track record , making them ideal for a beginner just starting out . finally , coinbase caps how much you can invest at a time . i love cryptocurrency , but i do n't want new investors to risk more than they can afford to lose , lose it all , and blame the space for the mistake . 2 . bittrexas crypto investors gain experience , they might start to feel limited by coinbase 's limited selection of coins and purchase limits . ",
        "investors may also grow wary of the site 's relatively high transaction fees . bittrex provides a solution to all of these problems . first of all , bittrex offers over 190 cryptocurrencies to choose from . whatever you want to speculate on , bittrex probably offers it . you are also limited only by the crypto in your bittrex account when purchasing coins , giving users the freedom to invest whatever they want to . best of all , bittrex charges a flat fee of . 25 of a percentage point on every transaction , leaving investors plenty of room for profit . ",
        "3 . geminithe biggest limitation of bittrex is that there is no option to use traditional monies to purchase crypto on the site . instead , every transaction is made with other crypto tokens . for example , you can buy ethereum with litecoin , but not with usd . gemini offers the ability to fund your purchases with a bank account while charging low transaction fees . however , the selection is even more limited than coinbase 's and bank account purchases are limited to $ 500 per week . this makes gemini into a coinbase with lower transaction fees .
