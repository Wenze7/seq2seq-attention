        "the notoriously optimistic ex-president is n't known for making extreme analogies , making his comment surprisingnicole karlis2017-12-08t23 : 30:16 z • 2017-12-08t23:30:16z • 0 commentsbarack obama made a public appearance on tuesday at the economic club of chicago , a members-only organization in chicago which focuses on improving economic and social issues . a video of his discussion surfaced on facebook , and viewers seized on his comments warning about the dangers of complacency in democracy . when asked by the moderator about how `` what it means to be an american '' has evolved , and how to deal with competing narratives of this within the united states , obama explained : `` i do think because we 've been so wealthy and so successful that we get complacent . ",
        "we assume things continue the way they have been just automatically , and they do n't . you have to tend to this garden of democracy , otherwise , things can fall apart fairly quickly . and we 've seen societies where that happens . now , presume there was a ballroom here in vienna in the late 1920s or '30s that looked and seemed as if it , filled with the music and art and literature that was emerging , would continue into perpetuity . and then 60 million people died . an entire world was plunged into chaos . ",
        "so you got to pay attention -- and vote . '' during the same discussion , obama reiterated the importance of not taking american values for granted -- specifically , values like freedom of the press . the former president emphasized that even if he did n't agree with news reports while he was president , he understood the values and importance of the principle . `` timeless values should transcend parties . i 'd argue that freedom of the press should be ideal , '' he said . `` what i understood was that principle that the free press was vital . ",
        "as president , part of my job was to make sure that that was maintained . '' in the video , obama did n't specifically criticize or mention his successor , but it seems clear he is referencing current president donald trump . trump has been consistently engaged in a war against the media , and seems not to understand free speech . professor and cultural critic henry giroux has called trump 's behavior an `` attack on democracy . '' the notoriously soft-spoken ex-president is known for being extremely careful with his words . throughout his presidency , he took an optimistic tone of the future , even during dark times or when he struggled to get his policy agenda through . ",
        "likewise , obama was often hesitant to issue harsh critique , even of his opponents , and was not known for making analogies to nazi germany , a rhetorical tactic that often backfires and which is viewed by many as often offensive . notably , obama did not directly say the word `` nazi , '' `` germany , '' `` hitler '' nor `` world war ii , '' but chose to reference world war ii indirectly . on a lighter note : in another highlight of the night , obama was asked to pick his favorite between michael jackson and prince . ",
        "obama reportedly chose prince . nicole karlisnicole karlis is a news writer at salon . she covers health , science , tech and gender politics . tweet her @nicolekarlis .   "
