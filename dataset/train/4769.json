        "challenge 2 of 52 -- this month we pursue intentionthe rewire : life on purpose challenge was launched this year . it 's a 52-week journey covering the most critical life topics , one month at a time . the challenge is about taking action . i 've done the research and created the challenges , and i 'm in for the full year . join me ! we 're laying important groundwork these first few weeks as we determine and set our intentions . last week we examined some of the old and tired beliefs we have about ourselves , and then we created new ones . ",
        "this week , we 're diving deeper into the system to uncover our most closely held values . i think of these as our internal operating system . even when we do n't know exactly what our values are , they guide our life , our emotions , and our reactions to life . if we can grab ahold of them , we can leverage them to strengthen us and our work every day . we can also redesign them . the challengewe 're going to uncover our core values . many of the possible values we consider will seem important , and they are . ",
        "but we want to discover what drives us . the directions are explained in the image below . you can print it here , or start at step 2 and write down your values instead of circling them . work through this in 15 minutes or less . set your timer . hit start . go ! trust the process . do n't over think this one ! you will want to make quick decisions . you can go back and change them anytime . heck , you can crumble up your notes when you 're done and toss them . ",
        "there are hundreds of different values . below are some of the most common . feel free to add your own or search for more online . bonussimilar to last week , take a picture of your list . read it every day . put your values to work immediately in your next meeting , project , etc. . notice the changes in energy , and the response from others . jot down a few things you notice at the end of each day . are there changes to your list you want to make to live your best life ? ",
        "the philosophywhat you value determines what you focus on . - tony robbinsour beliefs and our values can control our every move . we go through life collecting experiences and memories , being shaped by our family , society , and the culture we live in . this all facilitates what we value and believe . it 's more unique than a finger print . and it 's ours . but , these beliefs and values are floating around with little construct as to what they really mean in our life . we need to catch them , shape them , and in the process shape us and the world around us . ",
        "if we want to have an impact , we need a vision . to have a vision , we need to know what is important to us . to arrive at that , we need to intimately know our beliefs and values . this challenge is n't about putting yourself in a box . to say you are one set of words . however , it does create a definition of where you will operate from in any given situation . tired ? need some energy ? retreat to your core values and you will find all the energy you need . ",
        "also , over time i believe there can be movement in your values . they will shift as you create your life , and along with it new experiences and memories . be open to repeating this exercise each year . what life do you want , and do your values align ? try replacing or reprioritizing new ones for a week to see how it feels . you wo n't find the right advice online or in a book . guidance for sure . but we need to get up and put our values to work . now that you have defined them , be intentional about bringing them into your life , your work , and your plans . ",
        "try them on continually . see how they feel . head to the facebook page to tell me what you think about this week 's challenge . to your success , willjoin the challenge for free . it 's a full year of new experiences . every month has a theme . every week during any given month has a challenge that corresponds with the theme . it 's only 15 minutes a week .
