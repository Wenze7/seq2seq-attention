",
        "thomas has progressed to the point where he will be scrimmaging 5 on 5 in the next few days with the possibility of playing in games with the cavs before the year ends . `` when that time comes to where i 'll be out there , i 'm sure everybody is going to know and i 'll be out there playing the way i 've always played , '' said thomas , who hosted a holiday party for some area kids at the team 's training facility . `` i 'm just trying to get as close as 100 percent as possible and to be out there to be special . ",
        "not just to be out there and be another body . however long that takes -- it might be next week , it might be a week after that . we do n't know and we 're really not trying to put a date on it because it just depends on how my recovery is . `` i 'm ramping up my workouts , but at the same time it 's how i feel the next day , and it 's getting lighter and lighter , which is a good sign . `` thomas is as close as ever to making his debut with cleveland , which acquired him last summer in the blockbuster trade that sent kyrie irving to boston . ",
        "since training camp opened , the cavs ' timeline for thomas was for him to be playing games by the end of december . that now seems possible . the cavs , who have won 18 of 20 , host chicago on thursday and are expected to practice twice before their christmas day matchup against the golden state warriors , whom they 've met in three straight finals . cleveland has games in sacramento and utah next week before returning home on jan. . 2 against portland . the next day , the cavs will play in boston , where thomas spent more than two seasons and where he hoped to play longer before being traded .

        "since the deal , thomas has talked about being motivated to show the celtics they were wrong to let him go . although he has not suited up for the cavs , thomas has been embraced by the city 's fans . as a way of giving thanks for their support , he teamed with world vision -- a humanitarian aid organization he has partnered with for seven years -- to host children from the boys & girls clubs of cleveland at the party . `` the biggest thing is just putting smiles on these kids ' faces , '' said thomas , who played basketball and video games . ",
        "`` you really do n't know what they 're going through or what they do n't have . it 's about having fun today . `` thomas said he has been touched by the warm welcome he 's gotten in cleveland . `` it 's genuine , '' he said . `` i just like giving back no matter where i am . that 's just who i am and that 's what i 've always been about , so i just try to reach kids and touch kids and show kids i 'm just like them . i 've come from a similar background and especially in the holiday season , it 's about making others happy and putting smiles on other people 's faces . ",
        "`` the 5-foot-9 thomas blended in easily with the kids , some of whom were n't much smaller than him . at one point , he joined a game of `` knockout '' and was quickly eliminated . `` i expected that , '' he said . `` every time i play knockout with kids they try their hardest to beat me and i always seem to lose . that was n't my first loss .
