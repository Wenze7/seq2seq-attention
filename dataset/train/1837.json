        "the smith family has a long history of making fascinating if not outright mind-bending claims about the state of conscious existence for enlightened humans , but will smith has always seemed to be the most measured of the bunch . he 'll speak his mind when he wants to and did quite a bit during the 2016 election season . now politics are in his orbit again . as smith did press for his upcoming dystopian netflix movie bright , doug jones ' upset win in alabama 's senatorial race came up . without bringing up the names donald trump or doug jones , smith explained that politics are cyclical , but it 's where we emerge from the other side of these divisive times that 's going to be interesting . ",
        "`` we had to expect that was going to go the other way . as a cleanse -- this is the darkness before the dawn . this is the purge , right ? this is the cleanse , this is what happens . this is the natural reaction to the amount of light that came into the world when barack obama was the president . i feel very , very strongly that we are shifting into what the next age of humanity is going to be right now . it 's just the shit has to get stirred up , in a way . ",
        "we 're seeing it all . it 's going to be really interesting to see how humanity reacts to it , and it 's going to be a f*cking mess . it 's going to be a mess , but it 's the mess in the cleanup . it 's the mess and the purge before that new , real light shows up . `` whether smith feels that this is the official shifting into a more peaceful , accepting time in the history of humanity and the united states is n't completely clear , but one thing he knows is that things are going to get nasty before they get better . ",
        "unless that 's already happened .   "
