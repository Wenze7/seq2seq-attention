        "a couple of troubles i have faced while photographing performance artslow lightingwhile it may look powerful for the audience or enhance the emotion of a scene , lighting choices in performing art are a real pain to photograph . wide aperturesi mainly work with a 24 -- 70 mm lens so the widest aperture i can achieve is f/2 .8 . while this is good for close ups , portraits and detail shots e. t.c , for wide group shots , like the one shown , as not all the faces are in focus . slow shutter speedto be able to freeze someone in motion , and for these situations they wo n't be going too fast , you want to be on the 1/125th - 1/250th range . ",
        "however , when you are dealing with low light situations it is difficult to keep it in this range and actually to be able to see the image . so often i find myself lowering the shutter speed as the actors generally wo n't be moving around and i can freeze them , however , when things start to pick up i tend to find i end up having images looking like the one shown . high isothankfully if you have a camera that can handle it , having a high iso wo n't be too much of a problem , but there are always limits . ",
        "i try to keep my iso as low as i can but generally i find myself in the 2000 -- 4000 mark . while the images may look okay , when zoomed in it is clear that the quality of the image has gone greatly down . the image below was an iso of 8000 . the stagewith each performance there are different stages , i 've had ones that go from having no stage where i was free to go where ever in the room to get the best angle , to an elevated stage where i was not allowed on . ",
        "being able to deal with the different types of stages is a great way to learn how to manoeuvre around difficult situations . audiencesometimes having an audience is great , you get to use them as a means of framing , and the actors wo n't be focused on you they will be too busy focusing on the many other people in the room . but they can get in the way sometimes , in a situation where there the stage is in the round you have an audience all the way around the stage with not much space in between meaning that you spend most of the night apologising to the audience for stepping on their feet . ",
        "in the image shown feet were just the problem , they wanted to share the spotlight as well . an opportunitysometimes the stage can be a blessing . they can provide a different angle to the performance , as well as provide a creative opportunity . mirrorsthe rare time i need to photograph a situation where mirrors are present can be a real test to how much you can be the ` fly on the wall ' . you have to think about another factor when photographing , not just get the right angle for the image but also you have to be aware of yourself and try to remove yourself .
