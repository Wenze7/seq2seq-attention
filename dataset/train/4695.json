",
        "thanks to its innovative compression system there will be fewer arguments over who should take out the bins out , and more room in landfill for all of us . hoorah ! how to buy the best binif you 've only got £ 10 you can find a whole selection of cheap kitchen bins capable of holding onto a bin liner , but be prepared for flimsy flip lids and gunk collecting hinges . sure , they 'll work , but if , like ` first husband ' philip may , taking out the bins is one of your ` jobs ' you deserve a little bit more . ",
        "if you 're a family of four , choose the largest capacity bin you can fit in the kitchen : at least 30 litres . for smaller kitchens and flats , a 20 litre design should suffice . the ideal bin should give the give the longest possible time between emptyings , but without taking so long to fill that everything rots and stinks out your home . of course , much rubbish these days is recycled , and for that you need a bin with at least one container . recycling takes up a huge amount of space , and while multi-compartment bins offer a seamless solution , expect to be emptying them regularly . ",
        "you 're better off sacrificing some cupboard space and choosing an inexpensive built-in recycling solution -- try ikea . com -- that can hide all the bottles from the neighbours until the bin men arrive . as for freestanding designs , it 's worth choosing models with removable inner compartments -- usually plastic -- that make it easier to remove a full bin liner without tearing it . charcoal filters are some help for absorbing nasty odours , which can be a godsend in the summer , but do n't rely on them too much . finally , make sure your bin can be cleaned properly . ",
        "stainless steel and plastic are both hygienic materials , but look for easily removable parts and minimal joins , where foul bin juice can fester . the best rubbish and recycling bins 2018it 's quite costly , as bins go , but no other kitchen trash can comes close in terms innovation . as well as its fingerprint-resistant , stainless steel construction and stress-tested foot pedal , the standout feature here is its hygienic trash compactor mechanism that means you can maximize the amount of rubbish in each bin liner , and reduce the number of times it needs emptying . ",
        "once the bin is opened via the foot pedal , you chuck the rubbish in and then lift the top handle to vertical and push down into the bin . yes , yes , we wanted it to be automatic as well , but the action is extremely satisfying , especially as you do n't have to encounter any gunky old stuff , as it 's all sealed within the bin liner . joseph joseph estimate that you can get three times as much rubbish in one bin liner , and while it does depend on the rigidity of what you 're throwing away , the results were fantastic . ",
        "we were worried that having loads of rubbish lingering about would just make the kitchen smell , but the well sealed lid and replaceable charcoal filter help keep things fresh . featuring a 24 litre pull-out bin and separate 34 litre internal compartment , this 56 cm wide stainless steel design is the most spacious twin compartment recycling bin on the market . the steel pedal has been engineered to last more than 20 steps per day for 20 years , the innovative internal hinge wo n't bash on the kitchen wall , and inside there 's a pouch for storing spare bin-liners -- it works like a packet of wet-wipes -- that 's beautifully simple and saves time and faff . ",
        "the look may not exactly be elegant , but the stainless steel is hard to fault and easy to clean , helped in no small part by a finger print resistant nano-silver coating that 's also resistant to germs . be warned , though : this bin is a monster . while practical , especially for hiding the recycling , you 'll need a huge kitchen for it not to dominate the space . the utility room might be a better home for it . another premium bin from joseph joseph , the intelligent waste separation and recycling totem -- to give it its full title -- boasts one massive compartment and one smaller , pull-out drawer with an optional divider to make it into two smaller compartments . ",
        "i actually ended up using this for storage of sponges , dishcloths and the like , but you could use it as an on-the-small-side recycling area . the main bin is easy to fit and remove bin bags to/from , and has a charcoal filter and well-sealed lid to reduce odours , or at least keep them within the bin . another solution to smells is provided by the inclusion of a small composting box , which is stored at the top of the bin and can be filled and emptied of food waste much more regularly , while the larger compartment fills up with non-rotting rubbish . ",
        "the powder-coated steel body is great , although the polished steel lid is a bit of a smear magnet . i 'd say this is great for couples who generate a lot of waste but possibly just that bit too small for a family of four or more . hello , spaceboy . wesco bins always look the absolute business , and while the price of even its smallest pedal bin pushes the £ 100 mark , they 're built exceptionally tough , and should last for decades . and , if you had n't noticed , the spaceboy xl looks like a 1950 's cartoon rocket . ",
        "it does n't do anything fancy -- no sensors , compactors or odour filters here -- but it 's made from thick rolled steel , has an equally robust steel insert bin , for easier emptying , and unlike any other bin on the market , if a part breaks -- the sprung hinge , bin-liner band or recessed handle -- you can buy replacements . there 's not much in the way of tech or exciting features here , but brabantia offers its usual understated style , with an elegant , soft-touch opening and closing mechanismthe removable plastic inner bucket and stainless steel lid unit reduces the amount of wrestling required when changing the bin liner . ",
        "that said , given the 72 cm height , if you 're not especially tall , you may struggle to lift the internal bin out , especially when fully loaded . it 's only a minor niggle , but it could mean one less chore you can get the kids to do ... this classic cylinder pedal bin from brabantia comes in a choice of 16 colours including the suitably on-trend moss green and metallic mint . offering endless amusement for toddlers , and reduced cleaning for grown-ups , touch-free bins like the sensé are great if your hands are so full of rubbish , operating the usual lid-opening mechanisms is difficult . ",
        "that 's particularly handy if you 've got raw meat all over your hands and you 're trying to chuck some cooking waste away . just wave your e coli-infested mitts over the bin and wait for the magic to happen . the lid also closes automatically after five seconds of inactivity , or you can keep it open or close it manually , via a button . made . com 's is the best of this breed , with seven attractive finishes including blue , chrome , white and black , and a very attractive price . the quality of steel used is not as good as on the pricier bins here but , interestingly , when the one i had started to rust , made . ",
        "com replaced it , no questions asked , without me even mentioning i 'm a journalist . buy direct from made . com for around £ 50 .   "
