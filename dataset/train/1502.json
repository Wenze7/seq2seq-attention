        "bitcoin 's recent slide is n't discouraging for crypto bull thomas lee , who predicts that the value of the digital-coin market will roughly double to more than $ 1.2 trillion this year . lee expects the price of one bitcoin will surge to $ 125,000 by 2022 . that 's 400 percent higher than his forecast from october , when he said the top digital token may reach $ 25,000 over the same period . that compares with about $ 11,750 thursday . but before these crypto dreams become reality , bitcoin has some hurdles to overcome in 2018 . ",
        "`` while returns should be strong , we forecast returns to be lower than 2017 , '' wrote lee , head of research at fundstrat global advisors , in a report . `` we expect bitcoin 's major low to be $ 9,000 and would be aggressive buyers around that level . ''   ",
        "here 's what else lee thinks is in store for the cryptocurrency market : by the end of this year , ethereum will climb to $ 1,900 , ethereum classic will rise to $ 60 , and neo will rally to $ 225the dominance of large-cap tokens will increase in 2018 , but investors may also take advantage of opportunities to rotate into alternative coins ; small-caps outperformed bitcoin during five of the past six bitcoin selloffs more institutional money will flow into crypto in 2018the theoretical maximum number of bitcoins that can exist -- 21 million -- probably wo n't be mined until 2045 or later given the deceleration of new coins ."
