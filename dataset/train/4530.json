        "some investors look at a stock that has nearly quadrupled in price within less than 12 months and are excited about buying it . others look at the same stock and are afraid that the momentum could evaporate . that 's the situation for exact sciences corporation right now . is exact sciences a stock to buy ? perhaps the best way to answer that question is to use the swot business analysis technique that assesses an organization 's strengths , weaknesses , opportunities , and threats . here 's how exact sciences ' swot analysis looks . strengths . ",
        "exact sciences has quite a few strengths . the most significant strength is the increasing popularity for the company 's cologuard dna screening test for colorectal cancer . in the third quarter , 161,000 cologuard tests were completed , reflecting a year-over-year increase of 136 % . exact sciences also reported an all-time number of providers ordering the tests during the quarter . other strengths for the business have helped make this impressive growth possible . cologuard is now covered for 87 % of americans . positive actions by the u. s. preventive services task force , the blue cross blue shield association , and the centers for medicare and medicaid services have boosted cologuard 's status as a standard of care . ",
        "as for exact sciences stock 's strength , the enormous gains achieved so far this year speak for themselves . weaknesses . there are three major current weaknesses for exact sciences , in my view . first , the company remains unprofitable . in the first nine months of 2017 , exact sciences lost nearly $ 93 million . the reality is that the company has lost money since it was formed -- nearly $ 850 million in total . exact sciences expects losses to continue for several more years . second , the stock valuation gives investors reason to pause . ",
        "exact sciences shares currently trade at nearly 38 times trailing-12-month sales . exact sciences ' third big weakness is kind of the flip side of its main strength . while sales for cologuard are growing quickly , it 's the only product on the market for the company . all of exact sciences ' eggs are riding in one basket right now . opportunities . that leads to one of exact sciences ' greatest opportunities . the company is actively working on developing additional products . exact sciences teamed up with the prestigious mayo clinic to develop liquid biopsies for early cancer detection . ",
        "the cancer dna markers the two organizations are using should be less expensive than next-generation sequencing . the liquid-biopsy market is expected to reach $ 13 billion or more by 2030 . there are also huge opportunities remaining for cologuard . the colon cancer screening rate in the u. s. is stuck at around 62 % , but the american cancer society 's goal is to boost the rate to 80 % . cologuard 's convenience and relatively high accuracy should make it a natural solution to help achieve that goal . in addition , there should be room for the company to expand into international markets . ",
        "with these opportunities , exact sciences should be able to grow cologuard into a multibillion-dollar product . threats . in june , i examined the bear case against exact sciences stock . at the time , i identified three key threats to the company . one was that physicians might not prescribe cologuard as much as hoped . exact sciences ' results since then have convinced me that this is n't a big concern . however , the other two threats remain , at least to some extent . it 's still possible that the price for cologuard could fall . ",
        "there 's also a not-so-insignificant risk that another company could beat exact sciences in developing liquid biopsies for early cancer detection . it 's only fair to note several other threats that short-seller andrew left of citron research thinks that exact sciences faces . earlier this year , left predicted that the stock price would `` soon be cut in half '' and possibly be close to worthless within a few years . this claim stemmed largely from his view that cologuard is an `` inferior product '' and that exact sciences ca n't continue spending as much money as it is currently to grow the business . ",
        "i do n't find left 's critique particularly convincing , though . the numbers show that healthcare providers , payers , and patients are accepting cologuard . and while exact sciences is spending plenty of money to grow the business , that 's a good business strategy in my opinion . also , the trend for the company 's bottom line is headed in the right direction . final analysis . in my view , the strengths and opportunities for exact sciences carry more weight than the company 's weaknesses and threats . the key for the business is continued momentum for cologuard and achieving success in its development efforts of liquid biopsies . ",
        "i see no reason to think that cologuard 's momentum is in jeopardy . sustained sales growth for the product over time could address the current weaknesses of losses and stock valuation and the threat of falling prices for the product . and while there 's no way to know if exact sciences will be successful with its liquid biopsy development program , the threat that another company will be successful is probably still well into the future . is exact sciences stock a buy ? in the final analysis , my answer is `` yes . '' not long ago , the stock was routinely setting new all-time highs . ",
        "i thought then that exact sciences remained a smart pick . with the share price pulling back some recently , now could be an even better time to buy the stock .   "
