        "return on investment is n't a useful measure today . roi is an industrial age term , applicable to companies that manufacture things in factories . that era is now over . even if a company manufactures things in factories , that process has become commoditized . when something is commoditized it means that it uniformly goes to market at the lowest possible price . milk or wheat or nails are sold at essentially the lowest price possible . to sell a commodity for less means operating at a loss . commodities are often outsourced , like milk or wheat or nails . ",
        "or smartphone manufacturing or it development . it 's possible for the price to go down , but then it goes down for everyone . that is , if you can get it cheaper in bangalore , i can get it cheaper in singapore . this is not to say that you should n't keep trying to make your atom-based business processes cheaper and more efficient , because if your competition does it and you do n't , then you are no longer a commodity and they are . your sales will drop because your price will be higher than your competitor 's . ",
        "however , as business sage peter drucker said , there is no longer any way to differentiate one 's business doing better or cheaper or more efficient manufacturing . so , while roi is still a useful tool for tracking manufacturing processes , it is quite useless in the world of tech product design , development , and deployment . this is because tech products are about innovation , about doing things in a new , and more desirable way . by definition , innovation means doing something new , something you have not done before . that means you will experiment , make mistakes , have failures , and learn by trial and error . ",
        "it means that the first implementation will never be the most efficient implementation . containing costs is antithetical to innovation . there remain a lot of foolish young manager-wannabes , trained by older executives and academics who cut their teeth in the industrial age , who still use roi in their work . but they are going to fail . they are going to lose to those who understand that solving problems and creating desirable products has far more leverage than lowering the costs of manufacturing . in the industrial age , the bottom line was the most important thing in business . ",
        "that is , the cost to make something overwhelmed every other aspect of that product . the best managers kept their costs down better than lesser managers . in the post-industrial age , the top line is the most important thing in business . that is , the desirability of your product overwhelms every other aspect of that product . if people want your iphonex , they will buy it regardless of the fact that they can buy a functionally equivalent android phone for less . that is , the iphonex is not a commodity . the cost of innovation is irrelevant if you can innovate . ",
        "if you ca n't come up with something new and desirable , then you 've just wasted money . that is terrifying to an old-school , industrial-age manager . keep that in mind as you debate roi . when a foolish manager applies roi to a modern company , it translates into only two things : 1 -rrb- underpay the creative practitioners who might save the company , thus forcing them to go elsewhere , and b -rrb- bludgeoning creative people with the demand , `` tell me the roi of your design if you want it built . '' ",
        "they make this demand because they are in over their heads , scared , and it gives them a frisson of power . one interesting way to counter that belligerent demand for an roi calculation is to just turn the tables . ask the asker how he calculates the roi of everything else he does . this will at least start a dialog over what is important . here 's a thing . it 's my new thing .
