        "michael kors holdings ltd. , ralph lauren corp. . and other fashion brands are locked in a high-stakes contest this christmas . but the winner wo n't be the company that sells the most -- it 'll be the one that winds up with the least amount of unwanted merchandise . after years of struggling to manage their inventory , brands are using increasingly sophisticated tools to track apparel and accessories through the supply chain , aiming to avoid the typical post-christmas fire sales . the idea is to improve profit margins , even if it means ceding some revenue . ",
        "despite the technological advancements , it 's still no easy task . the decline of department stores has exacerbated the problem in recent years , with their nonstop discounting hurting the prestige of brands like polo and kate spade . that 's increased pressure on brands to show they can get the balancing act right this holiday season . `` there 's a dashboard that they are watching , '' said david bassuk , co-head of the retail practice at alixpartners llp . `` it 's literally managing a war . '' every monday morning , retailers typically hold a manager meeting to look at the sell-through rates , or the percentage of the total inventory sold , for the past week . ",
        "during the holiday period , they meet daily -- and decide if they should use promotions or increase their markdowns to stay on track with their inventory , bassuk said . the rise of omnichannel marketing -- the notion of having brick-and-mortar stores work seamlessly with e-commerce operations -- has made matters more complicated . customers , for instance , may buy an item online and then return it to a store . getting it right `` this holiday season is more critical than the recent past to get this right , '' bassuk said . `` there 's a lot of speculation about whether retailers are really able to manage inventory properly in the world of omnichannel . '' ",
        "michael kors and other upscale brands are still using discounts to drive sales . but they 're aiming to be more targeted with their promotions . michael kors chief executive officer john idol has pledged to cut the number of days with big promotions by as much as 65 percent this quarter . the company is currently offering 25 percent off purchases , but that deal ends on dec. . 12 . building an impression of scarcity is key for high-end brands . toward the end , michael kors lowered its number of stock-keeping units by 12 percent this month , according to research firm edited . ",
        "less is moreoverall , there 's little sense that promotions have abated this holiday season . in the week leading up to black friday , the number of marked-down apparel and accessories was up threefold from the same period of 2014 , according to edited , which tracks the websites of america 's 19 largest retailers . but there 's hope that smarter promotions will set up retailers and fashion brands for a better 2018 . the industry also has closed thousands of stores this year , helping supply better match demand . tapestry inc. , the owner of the coach and kate spade brands , uses historical seasonal sales data to build its stock allocation plan for each store . ",
        "and it has the capability to restock its retail stores as many as three times a week during the holiday season , said spokeswoman andrea resnick . retailers have traditionally been dependent on historical sales and loyalty data to predict trends . in an era of big data , they 're relying more on analytics and machine learning -- a form of artificial intelligence -- to better maintain inventory . they build out customer profiles based on shopping patterns , helping companies predict the kind of assortments and quantity needed for their websites and stores , said joann martin , vice president of retail industry strategy at supply-chain management company jda software group inc. . ",
        "e-commerce burdenbut the rise of e-commerce and increasing demand for fast delivery have made the process more complicated , she said . that 's what led to especially bad inventory problems in recent years . `` with a lack of understanding of where to put that product , they bought more than they needed , '' martin said . high-end department stores and specialty retailers have started tagging their products with radio-frequency identification sensors , which casinos have been using for their gambling chips , to track inventory in real time . managers still sometimes make gut decisions , but it 's a gamble , said jda 's martin . ",
        "coach did n't anticipate that products with prominent logos had come back in fashion , and its outlets failed to stock enough of the merchandise last quarter . in a skittish retail industry , it 's probably safer to stock too little than too much . but that means companies will have lower sales growth when they begin to rebound , said simeon siegel , an analyst at instinet llc . he likens lean inventories to being on antibiotics , a painful but necessary part of getting healthy again `` companies who have been sick -- and have already been on a year of antibiotics -- need to take another round , '' he said .
