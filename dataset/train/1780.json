        "part ii : from engagement to relationshipthis is part ii of an updated version of a talk i gave for @futures_design at the mozilla foundation in san francisco on july 20th , 2017 . part i of the talk is here . in part i of this talk i argued that artificial agents , such as social robots , can exceed an average human in engaging human users . this can be done by a design that embraces their lack of human-likeness , while still endowing the robots with expressive abilities that make them believable characters . here is the graph that shows that character-enabled media artifacts raise above humans in their utility , with the crossing point sometime between past and future , depending on the particular interaction scenario . ",
        "in this part of the talk , i will argue that believable characters are capable of further increasing engagement and , as a consequence , their utility through development of a social relationship . engage user → transform useronce a user is engaged , the interface has the ability to affect the user transforming the user 's cognitive , emotional , or physical state . this is a bit of a chicken and egg problem , as engagement is itself a kind of a user 's state . transforming a user towards a more engaged onein the case of the roboceptionist tank , users can be divided roughly into those who use relational conversation strategies , such as starting with a greeting , saying thanks , and ending with a farewell , and those whose conversation is utilitarian , consisting of only the information-seeking question . ",
        "as i mentioned in part i , the relation-oriented users engage better : they are more persistent in the face of communication breakdowns . as a consequence , they are more likely to succeed in their task of getting the information they seek from the robot . would n't it be nice to be able to convert some of the utility-oriented users into the relation-oriented ones ! turns out this may be possible , by having the robot deploy the following conversational strategies : proactively greeting the user , once the robot 's sensors detect the user 's intent to communicate . ",
        "priming for thanks : saying `` thank you for stopping buy . '' expressing an effort : saying things like `` i am looking it up . please hold on , '' or just pausing for half a second . the process of chipping away users with strategically placed dialog turns from the utilitarian group and converting them into relationally-oriented users within a single interaction can be shown like this : corollary : counter-intuitively , adding delay to the robot 's response can actually help engagement . transforming a user towards less a prejudiced onemilitary personnel stationed abroad and locals . ",
        "migrant workers and locals . residents of neighborhoods with strong social class and ethnic majorities . these pairs of communities have one thing in common : members across each pair rarely get a chance to interact with each other within an equal power status situation . equal status within a contact situation is one of the necessary conditions for a positive contact , according to gordon allport 's work on intergroup contact theory published in 1954 . positive intergroup contact can reduce stereotyping , prejudice , and discrimination . conversely , a contact that is not positive , is not expected to have such benefits . ",
        "as a consequence , there are few chances for positive contact between many communities that are correlated with ethnicity . without the benefits of the positive contact , even few negative contact situations , lead to development and reinforcement of racial and ethnic stereotypes . fortunately , studies suggest that even a positive contact with a virtual character may help reduce ethnic prejudice . would a social robot like hala , described in part i , that expresses ethnicity through behaviors while still maintaining its robotic agency , be able to create a positive intergroup contact that reduces ethnic prejudice ? ",
        "this is still an open research question . engage user → transform user → mutual shapingthe most rewarding interactions are balanced : none of participants dominate beyond the comfort of others and all converge to some middle ground . this includes convergence in both a cognitive state , and linguistic and physical behaviors . just like the julie delpy 's character said in that movie : ... if there is any kind of god , it would n't be in any of us , but just this little space in between . if there is any kind of magic in this world , it must be in the attempt of understanding someone sharing something . ",
        "in less poetic terms , a successful interaction is a joint activity , where participants work together towards establishing a common ground . peers and teachable agentsgiven this balanced view of each participant 's contributions to an interaction , it is not difficult to imagine conversational agents that are peers to the users or even dependent on the user 's help . for example , a peer storytelling robot can work with children to jointly tell a story while introducing new vocabulary . a simulated student may need to be taught by a user , which in turn leads to the user 's learning by teaching . ",
        "alignmentinteractions where participants align their linguistic choices such as lexemes and syntactic patterns are more mutually comprehensible and are also reported to increase feelings of rapport , empathy , and intimacy . less obviously , breathing rates and neural patterns of the participants in such interactions align too . check out this recent report for an overview of the research on alignment . tl ; dronce a conversational agent has succeeded in engaging a user , it may be ableto steer the conversation towards a more social one , increasing the objective metrics of a success of the interaction , andto reduce the user 's cognitive biases , including racial and ethnic prejudice . ",
        "mutually rewarding human interactions are usually balanced : the participants converge to both shared content and shared linguistic and physical behaviors . repeating such mutually shaped interactions between a human and an agent over time may result in the participants establishing distinct social roles that would serve as a basis of a human-agent social relationship .
