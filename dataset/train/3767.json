        "cybersecurity is one of the unsung heroes of the modern world . every day it seems our lives become more dependent on computer systems and more intertwined with the internet . from simple things like shopping on amazon or social networking , to on-line banking , government affairs , business operations , communications , bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies , all of these operate on the infrastructure laid down by cyber space . and all of this on the basis that it is actually quite safe to use . for the average user , keeping a computer safe is as simple as keeping the anti-virus up to date and choosing long enough passwords for their personal accounts . ",
        "as often happens though , there is a lot more going on behind the scenes . behind every move and transaction on the internet there is a sophisticated set of tools and algorithms operating in the shadows to ensure your personal security and that of your assets . in the 21st century cybersecurity is on the watch always and everywhere . we , the users , passively entrust our security to its methods . and we are right to do so . there are always hacking events . every year a few movies are leaked due to hacking of the big producers security systems . ",
        "from time to time , the group anonymous manages to take down some government websites . we all probably know someone who has had their credit card hacked ! these problems are mainly due to human error or a slip of judgment which exposes an exploit . if we follow simple instructions we are essentially safe from digital threats . at the basis of many of today 's cybersecurity techniques are two fundamental tools . one of these is prime numbers . these are special kind of number : you can only divide them by themselves and have no remainder . ",
        "2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , and 11 are the first five prime numbers . they are interesting for cryptography because it is laborious to check whether a large number is prime or not . the second fundamental tool is random numbers . these are important because , as their name indicates , they allow a degree of uncertainty to be introduced in our safety systems . once again we are faced with a problem though : computers can not generate truly random numbers . i if enough of them are sampled from a particular source a pattern can be found . ",
        "and patterns mean predictability . these appear because behind what looks like a random number is often a deterministic physical process . for this reason , random number generators are more correctly called pseudo-random number generators . usually this is n't a problem though , as the patterns are not visible for trillions of iterations of the random number generator . the combination of these tools essentially has the effect of a being a extremely strong deterrent . they allow for the implementation of very good encryption systems and very safe computer networks , but the fact that these systems are only good enough for their current jobs , and far from perfect , is an ever-present caveat . ",
        "they are a deterrent because current computers do not allow for an efficient attack at the basis of cybersecurity systems . however , the advent of quantum computing may expose the truth about these methods . as their name indicates , quantum computers are based on the principles ruling the atomic world , quantum physics . once quantum computers become widely available , all commonly used encryption methods will cease to be safe . and with them the way of life we have built around cyberspace . does this , in an post-quantum computing world , mean the end of internet shopping , home based business and the safety of our private information ? ",
        "yes , if no new solution is implemented there will be no more safety for online data . however , the solution to this problem can be found at its origin . protection from the threat of quantum computing comes from quantum physics itself , from quantum entanglement . references : about quantum1net : quantum1net was founded in 2017 to prepare the world for the rise of quantum computing . with an international team , decades of combined industry experience and its unique qekg technology , quantum1net will provide quantum security to ensure the safety of digital transactions and communication for decades to come .
