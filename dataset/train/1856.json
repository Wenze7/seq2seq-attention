        "a landmarked 1890 queen anne-style townhouse in central harlem has set a record for the neighborhood after selling for $ 4.59 million . according to the wall street journal , it 's a record for the specific area , and the second-highest price paid for a townhouse across all of harlem . bruce and holly brittain purchased the property , at 208 lenox avenue , in 2010 for $ 825,000 . at the time , the windows were bricked up and the fire department spray-painted `` no floors '' across the facade . but the couple moved forward with a complete rebuild , what the wsj calls `` a massive do-it-yourself project in which they controlled nearly every facet of engineering , design and construction , and moved into the top two floors . '' ",
        "holly brittain is a licensed architect and associate broker with rutenberg nyc , so she oversaw the re-design and listed and sold the house herself . her husband worked in finance , so he took over day-to-day construction and financial management . their efforts transformed the former rooming house , with more than a dozen units , into a three-family home . they fully restored the 20-foot-wide facade , installed wood-framed windows , put in new floors , and added a rear balcony and a roof deck paved in porcelain tiles . each apartment has condominium-level finishes , with efficient boilers , radiant underfloor heating , and marble-finished bathrooms . ",
        "the buyer is an investor , and they put the townhouse 's duplex unit , which comes with roof access , on the rental market before even closing . the three-bedroom , three-bathroom pad is available through douglas elliman asking $ 7,200 a month . as wsj points out , harlem has set records in 2017 for average and median prices and price per square foot for one-to-four-family townhouses . with a string of seven sales going for $ 4 million or more this year , the average price of a harlem townhouse rose 34 percent to just over $ 3 million . ",
        "that 's more than double the price at the peak of the last real estate boom in 2007 . harlem fixer-upper sets price record . 208 lenox avenue # 3 .   "
