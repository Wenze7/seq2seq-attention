        "aquaman director james wan is ready to sink an online rumor about the villainous character lineup for his stand-alone d. c. comics movie . fans have figured the film could have a total of three villains for arthur curry to face : patrick wilson as aquaman 's half-brother orm , abdul-mateen as black manta , and dolph lundgren as king nereus . but wan says that math is off . `` this is what i 'll say : i do n't have three villains , '' wan exclusively told ew . `` i think that 's ridiculous ! i would never go into an origin movie with three villains . ",
        "we do n't even know the main character let alone the world and its antagonist . i believe in taking baby steps . '' so ... maybe two villains then ? `` i want to introduce arthur curry in a much more emotional and powerful way , and introduce mera played by amber heard , and of course there 's nicole kidman and temuera morrison playing his parents , '' the furious 7 director added . `` we know black manta is in there , but i will say this : patrick wilson is the main antagonist in this film . ",
        "i would n't necessarily say ` villain , ' but he 's the antagonist . '' and there you have it . it 's that 's a relief that wan is keeping the film focused on mainly a single vill ... antagonist , rather than creating , say , a spider-man 3-type situation in an origin movie . previously , momoa told us we can expect to see a tale that spans details curry 's difficult childhood as a half-human , half-atlantean to eventually becoming king . `` justice league was only a weekend in arthur curry 's life , '' momoa says . ",
        "`` this is a totally different beast . in aquaman , you see when his parents met and what happened to hem . then the little boy being raised and finding his powers and going through that and never being accepted on either side . and then becoming this man who puts up all these walls . you just slowly see this man harden up and be completely reluctant wanting to be king and not knowing what to do with these powers he has . i think james wan just killed it . '' aquaman is slated for release dec. . ",
