        "new york -- the road struggles of the new york knicks already are a focal point . their issues away from midtown manhattan are about to become even more magnified if they continue . the brooklyn nets would like to be the opponent handing the knicks another road loss . the knicks start their season-high seven-game road trip monday afternoon when they cross the east river to face the nets at barclays center . `` those are trips that in the past , that teams i have been on , teams our coaches have been on , teams some of our players have been on , that can turn things around , '' knicks coach jeff hornacek said . ",
        "`` you go out there and somehow win five of seven road games , all of a sudden your mentality becomes that much different . we 're looking at it as an opportunity . we 'll see if we can rise to it . `` new york owns a 4-15 record outside of madison square garden and its four road wins are tied with the atlanta hawks and utah jazz for the fewest in the league . the difference is that its 19 road games are the second fewest in the league , only one behind charlotte . new york , which averages 99.5 points in road games , is going on this trip because the grammy awards are being staged at madison square garden on jan. . ",
        "28 and they 're inheriting the `` grammy trip '' previously forced on the los angeles lakers and los angeles clippers in recent seasons . new york 's trip will feature five games against teams with losing records , though the quality of the opponent does n't seem to matter in its road games . one of its four road wins occurred dec. . 14 in brooklyn when courtney lee scored 27 points after kristaps porzingis injured a knee in the first half of a 111-104 victory . the knicks were 15-13 after beating the nets for the second time this season but are 4-11 in their last 15 games after blowing a 19-point lead in a 123-118 overtime loss to the new orleans pelicans on sunday . ",
        "new york also is 3-10 in its last 13 games since porzingis returned from the knee injury . he is averaging 20.2 points in those games but shooting 37.1 percent . on sunday , the forward scored 25 points , but only three after the third quarter , and he was 1 of 7 from the floor in the fourth quarter and overtime when the knicks were outscored 41-22 while missing 22 of 31 shots . `` so , so many similar games like this , '' porzingis said after the knicks fell to 15-7 when leading or tied after three quarters . ",
        "`` it 's painful . we need to do a better job at the end of games . it 's simple . `` they made some good plays , but today one quote popped through my mind . it was , ` a smooth sea never made a skilled sailor . ' so we just have to stay positive and try to find something positive . `` new york is hoping to find something positive in a stretch that will see them play 17 of the next 23 on the road because of the grammy awards , and the big ten and big east conference tournaments in late february and early march . ",
        "meanwhile , the nets are in the middle of playing 15 of 23 games at home through the all-star break . after losing the final two games of their five-game homestand against toronto and detroit , the nets split a back-to-back set by beating atlanta on friday and losing in overtime at washington on saturday . brooklyn is 5-11 in its last 16 games since the meeting with the knicks after trailing by as many as 23 points in a 119-113 loss on saturday . of their 27 defeats , 11 are single-digit losses when the nets have trailed by double-digits at some point , including last month when the knicks led by 18 points . ",
        "`` it 's a recurring theme with our team this year , '' nets guard spencer dinwiddie said . `` we 're in so many close games . `` dinwiddie is right . in games decided by five points or less , the nets are 9-8 , but in games when brooklyn has trailed by double-digits at some point , it is 4-23 . the nets will be looking to get off to a better start than saturday , when they trailed by 20 at halftime . they also will hope to see the version of dinwiddie who nearly had a triple-double friday and not the one who was 4 of 16 saturday . ",
        "`` we had a good second half , fought hard , but we ca n't come out the way we did to start , '' brooklyn guard caris levert said . `` we just came out sluggish , not cutting hard on offense , not fighting through screens on defense . the score got out of hand early . `` new york has won six of the last 10 meetings after brooklyn swept the four-game season series in 2014-15 .
