        "my mother 's been teaching me how to cook since i was 13 , so that i would be able to care for myself when i 'm alone ... i 'm a pretty good cook now , and i can easily make some delicious dishes such as : pizzas , burgers , fried food , spaghetti and cakesmy little brother adores my food , he even says that i cook better than mum lol ! so , i decided to put my rather exceptional culinary skills to work as my roomies said ! i decided to save my colleagues from the trashy food that we get from school that forces us to order absurdly expensive food from outside : - i decided to start up a small scale food franchise in which i 'll be selling pizza , burger , french fries , fried chicken , chocolate cake , crepes , some good ol' english tea , fresh juices and milkshakes for an affordable price ... the idea was a great success that in a few weeks , i was earning a pretty good amount of money ... would that impress colleges ?

        "p. s. 1 -rrb- i 've stated such business all by myself from my own savings without any external aid whatsoever and will continue to go solo till i finish high school . 2 -rrb- what makes me ask such question is that it is kinda creative , because , unlike selling ready-made merchandise effortlessly , i 'm actually `` cooking '' my merchandise and selling it , so i think my business would stand out in my application form .
