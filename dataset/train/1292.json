        "the fcc repealed title ii net neutrality regulations this morning , making it legal for internet service providers to fracture the internet and charge more for the leftover pieces . we 've covered the technical details of title ii and title i , discussed how net neutrality has enabled creatives and entrepreneurs to thrive , and broken down the new transparency rules -- but what does today 's vote actually mean for the future of the internet ? let 's dive in . there are three major players caught in net neutrality 's web : tech companies , isps and consumers . ",
        "the first two groups have the same goal : make money . the final group , consumers , has a rival goal : save money . and even though tech companies and isps both dream of the same conclusion , they 're on opposite sides of the financial food chain here , with disparate views on net neutrality . take google for example . now that net neutrality rules have been dismantled , the internet monolith faces the possibility of paying higher fees to access high-speed lanes . this is one reason google , apple , facebook , twitter and other major companies have been so loudly , fervently opposed to the destruction of net neutrality : they want to make money , and paying higher fees does n't compute with this goal . ",
        "meanwhile , small isps hoping to enter the market would face these same elevated prices for faster connections , potentially stifling innovation at the onset . isps , on the other hand , want the ability to charge these higher fees . not only does today 's fcc 's ruling open the path for isps to institute multiple internet speed lanes , but it also allows them to engage in previously banned practices like throttling , blocking and paid prioritization . throttling , for instance , would allow a company like comcast to slow speeds down on certain apps or sites , thereby nudging people toward alternative services . ",
        "comcast is the largest isp in the us and it happens to own nbcuniversal , which has a controlling stake in hulu . if comcast wants to give hulu an edge over netflix , it 's now free to slow down speeds just for netflix . hell , it could even block the service entirely . isps are now required to report when they engage in practices like throttling or paid prioritization , and the fcc and ftc have promised to investigate those reports as they roll in . however , there 's a loophole here : if isps can classify any of these moves as `` reasonable network management , '' they do n't have to report them at all , leaving customers in the dark as to why their netflix shows suddenly look like shit . ",
        "major isps have attempted to legitimize throttling in the past , and they now have a green light from the us government to do so on a large scale , free from regulation . everyday internet users lose power -- meaning , access to information -- with the repeal of net neutrality . today 's decision eliminates reporting requirements that were mandated under title ii of the telecommunications act . this means isps no longer have to report `` packet loss , geographically-specific disclosures and performance at peak usage times , among other things , '' as the fcc finds these requirements `` burdensome . ",
        "`` internet users in the us already have few choices when it comes to isps , and now we 'll have less information about these companies and their practices . what 's more , today 's move essentially legalizes zero-rating plans , a common practice among mobile carriers that the fcc has been overlooking since ajit pai took over as chairman in january . zero-rating schemes exclude some apps or services from monthly data caps , meaning customers can access them free of charge even if they 've hit their plan 's limit . some carriers throttle service once a user hits their data cap , but any zero-rated apps will work as usual . ",
        "advocacy groups argue this practice violates the spirit of net neutrality , treating some data differently than others . zero-rating essentially allows carriers to charge customers more to access competitors ' apps , a practice that can now carry over into the isp world . but for consumers , the effects of today 's fcc vote transcend financial matters . this is about equality , giving every person the same foundation from which to launch their businesses , enjoy their hobbies and consume entertainment . charging more for faster speeds or certain services undercuts the foundation of a free and open internet . ",
        "this is why advocacy groups like the aclu and eff are so fervidly for title ii net neutrality regulations . in an age of #influencers , youtube stars and instagram divas , everyone deserves the same shot at going viral . it 's the american dream for the digital age , and the fcc just crushed it . however , this is n't the end of the net neutrality debate . advocacy groups and new york attorney general eric t. schneiderman are set to sue the fcc over today 's vote , and congress actually has the power to reverse the ruling . ",
        "under the congressional review act , congress has 60 working days to review and overrule the fcc 's repeal via a simple majority vote ; democratic sen. ed markey and rep. mike doyle have already promised to raise the issue . they 're surely not alone : before the vote , 39 democratic senators sent a letter to pai urging him to abandon his plans to repeal title ii protections . the digital american dream may be crushed , but it is n't dead . this article originally appeared on engadget at .
