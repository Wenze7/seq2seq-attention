        "yesterday was a very long day . as a matter of fact , my readers would have noticed that i did n't publish any article . i lost balance and this eventually became a working weekend . it was a weekend but i still spent plenty of time discussing over the phone and in person with people . in the end , i missed one vital part of the day -- rest . rest is a very important part of the day . in speaking with a partner yesterday evening , we talked about work life balance and how it affects us . ",
        "we felt excited talking about our experiences , the differences and much more . however , we came to a very valid point ; we need more rest in our work life . every day , i plan for when to start and finish . i decide on the peak and off-peak periods and the best time to take a break -- for real . we laughed over the fact that i did n't find some time to rest . i told him that my body reacted due to my failure to go on the regular cycle so i went home . ",
        "certain domestic circumstances did not let me take a break , though i wanted to write on a topic , i did n't -- i had to sleep . in our daily work life , we should factor in rest if we want to live long -- strong and healthy otherwise work would often become a futile thing in the end . i hope you had plenty of time to rest this weekend . if not , please create time . meanwhile , have a great week ahead and stay awesome ! strike a balancerest is an ultimate part of daily agendawhen i fail to rest , this is how i pay for it .
