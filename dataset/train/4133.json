        "christmas is just around the corner , bringing with it santa claus ' annual gift-giving traversal of the globe . to most , it seems santa 's operation has remained materially unchanged for over a century . however , a closer examination suggests otherwise . initially , santa 's deliveries were entirely original works . they were timeless and simple , like toy trains and teddy bears . in 1993 , though , i started noticing a shift . that was the year i received a huffy bicycle , and each year thereafter , more and more of santa 's deliveries were highly branded items . ",
        "it 's technically possible santa manufactured some of these and licensed branding rights from popular toy companies . in terms of the actual product , there is negligible difference between , say , a ty warner-produced beanie baby and an elf-crafted equivalent ; slap the official logo on there , and there 's not a 6-year-old on earth that will be any the wiser . now , however , he 's delivering more specialized goods , such as the playstation 4 with its proprietary hardware and accompanying games . i reached out to a sony representative , who confirmed that 3rd-party hardware manufacturing is not authorized , and there have been no software development kits deployed to the arctic circle . ",
        "additionally , the admission profiles of all major computer science and electrical engineering programs make no mention of any elf matriculates . what does this mean ? at some point , santa ceased producing toys in favor of distributing goods he was incapable of producing internally . an analysis of north pole business practices reveals 3 key pillars of success when it comes to a major business model pivot : trusting customer data , maintaining a seamless user experience , and cultivating talent . i feel it necessary to preemptively address the concern that some readers may feel with my referring to children who receive gifts from santa as `` customers '' or `` users '' because they do not pay santa for the goods they receive . ",
        "this is a symptom of an all-too-common ignorance to santa 's nature and operations . while the children do n't pay with cash , they do pay with their belief in santa , as manifested by the performance of good deeds . so what does good behavior actually provide for santa ? why should santa care if boys and girls are naughty or nice ? short answer : he does n't , at least from a business operations perspective . belief in santa is what powers his sleigh , and it 's fair to assume that this same belief powers the entire north pole . ",
        "should belief run short , the repercussions would be catastrophic : a total infrastructure collapse at the north pole , resulting in countless layoffs , numerous hypothermia deaths , and the indefinite cancellation of christmas . however , belief by itself is too abstract of a concept for children to grasp , let alone sincerely express . by coupling belief with some sort of external behavior , santa reifies , and thereby facilitates , the conveyance of belief in him , and by extension ensures perpetuation of the north pole . trusting customer datasanta has advantage of data that most companies only dream of . ",
        "he receives an annual summary of nearly every customer 's key pain points and unmet needs , either via mail-in comments or in-person customer interviews , not to mention his otherworldly real-time customer monitoring capabilities that are a bugatti veyron to the nsa 's mule-drawn carriage . more important than having data , though , is knowing what to do with it . apple , for instance , has a wealth of user data , but recent product design decisions , courageous as they may be , suggest an inability to extract and utilize meaningful customer insights . santa does what many businesses are incapable of doing : set aside pride and take shifting customer preferences to heart . ",
        "it must have pained santa to shut down his toy workshop . it was the lynchpin of his operation for decades , the products of which possessed an attention to detail borne only from the passion of a master craftsman . however , he was not so blinded by his passion that he could not foresee the long-term consequences of stubbornly clinging to a dying business unit . maintaining a seamless user experiencethe second key to a successful pivot is maintaining a seamless user experience . for santa , this was especially important . should children catch wind any turmoil at the north pole , the seeds of doubt would fester into weeds of disbelief , and christmas as we know it would have ended years ago . ",
        "frankly , i do n't know exactly how he did it , and that 's the greatest compliment i could give him . the north pole underwent a total organizational overhaul , and nobody besides the author of this case study was able to notice , let alone characterize the nature of the transition . so many companies that undergo massive restructurings have obvious missteps along the way , but not santa . instead of taking a christmas or two off to regroup and strategize , he continued delivering joy to children around the world , and they were none the wiser that his manufacturing wing had gone dark . ",
        "cultivating talentthe final piece is cultivating talent . the north pole is not known for employing an immigrant workforce . even if there was a desire to h1b their operation , good luck convincing a senior manager at amazon to jump ship for the abysmal living conditions and notoriously awful work-life balance offered at the north pole . santa did what is accepted by many as a superior hiring practice , but implemented by few : he placed greater importance in competence and capability than in experience . though lacking in import/export experience , his staff had proved they could accomplish great things christmas after christmas , so he correctly trusted them to acquire new skills as necessary . ",
        "a final thoughti 'm convinced that these practices fell into place because of the high-stakes nature of the scenario . if a company wants to mirror the aforementioned successes , they need to recreate this same high-stakes mentality that was obviously pervasive at the north pole . management needs to communicate that the consequences of sloppy pivot execution will be equally disastrous for shareholders as santa 's failure to pivot would have been for christmas .
