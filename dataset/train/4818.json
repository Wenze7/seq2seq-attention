        "football fans were utterly distressed sunday night as the new england patriots secured a spot in yet another super bowl . the patriots scored in the last quarter of the american football conference against the jacksonville jaguars in a 20-24 win . jacksonville was leading for the majority of the game , up by three points in the fourth quarter , when patriots receiver danny amendola scored with less than three minutes left in the game . this marks the eighth super bowl appearance for the team since 2000 , and while patriots fans are rejoicing , quite a few football fans are tired of the team 's non-stop arrival to the biggest game in the national football league .
