        "live calgary more streams the university of calgary and alberta health services have teamed up for a campaign encouraging albertans to sign up for clinical trials . with hundreds of clinical trials already underway in the province , the be the cure campaign is using an online database to connect patients , doctors and researchers to find ways to detect diseases and test new treatments . dr. michael hill told the homestretch how clinical trials are making advancements in medicine and how albertans can get involved . the following is an excerpt from that interview : q : what are clinical trials and why are they important ? ",
        "a : clinical trials are the way we asses and understand new treatments , diagnostic strategies or surgeries in medicine to know if they 're actually effective in treating patients . als patients take anti-psychotic drug in clinical trial led by calgary researcher and there are different tiers or level of trials before new treatments are accepted for routine use . q : how man clinical trials are going on in the province at any given time ? a : hundreds . we function both as a site ... and in other cases , we 're the organizing site where we 're the ones recruiting other hospitals to run trials that we want to do . ",
        "q : how has this new online tool changed how people sign up for trials ? a : it very much depends on the details of the trial . clinical trials are a big organizational effort and so management of information and getting access to people is critical . in the province we are part of a national strategy called the strategy for patient oriented research , or spor ... and so we 're trying to organize information so that physicians know what trials are ongoing and also so patients know . so we want patients to register , we want physicians to know what 's going on and then , if we can sum it up , what 's happening nationally . ",
        "q : how long has this been up and running and what 's been the response ? a : well it 's gradually picking up momentum . i learned that we 've had 3,000 hits on the website last week . we 're trying to build this in tiers so we 're trying to link all these things together . so we 'll have connections where patients can be involved but we also need to connect the researchers , we need to connect people in the hospitals . q : is there potential for this to be expanded beyond alberta ? ",
        "a : i think it 's building on what 's happening globally . certainly when we 're leading clinical trials , we look internationally for sites and hospitals that would be interested in participating . that also applies to patients . to find out more about clinical trials happening in alberta , visit www . bethecure . ca . with files from the homestretch .
