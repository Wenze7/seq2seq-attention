        "a girl from california died from a deadly infection after doctors misdiagnosed her of having just the flu , which was the same thing that her family thought . there are cases of death related to seasonal flu , but the unfortunate incident , caused by an entirely different disease , may have been avoided if the girl was able to take the necessary medicine to cure her infection . flu misdiagnosis leads to death of california girlalyssa joyce alcaraz , a 12-year-old girl from tulare , california , died dec. . 17 , 2017 , due to a fatal blood infection that was misdiagnosed by doctors as the flu . ",
        "alyssa 's family also thought that the girl was coming down with the flu , especially as the current flu season in california has been out of control . `` i remember she came home from school and she was throwing up , and i thought oh she 's probably got food poisoning , she 's going to be ok , '' said alyssa 's sister mariah in an interview with abc news . however , alyssa was not suffering from food poisoning , nor was it a case of the flu as doctors initially diagnosed . alyssa stayed at home for a few days , but she did not get better . ",
        "her family then took the girl for a follow-up checkup , and that was when a physician discovered that alyssa 's low oxygen levels . alyssa was rushed by ambulance to the kaweah delta medical center . however , within hours , the girl 's organs started to shut down , and she coded six times . according to alyssa 's death certificate , she suffered from a strep blood infection , resulting in cardiac arrest and septic shock . nobody in her family knew of the infection , which exhibits similar symptoms as the flu virus . this may be why doctors made the misdiagnosis , likely skipping the tests that determine flu cases due to the prevalence of the virus in california . ",
        "a gofundme page has been set up for donations to alyssa 's family . so far , the campaign has raised over $ 11,000 . the danger of medical misdiagnosisthe death of alyssa is another case of medical misdiagnosis , which was the topic of a study reported in april 2017 . according to the study by the mayo clinic in minnesota , most patients with serious health issues are initially misdiagnosed , with changes in their diagnosis after they seek a second opinion . the researchers viewed reports of nearly 300 patients from 2009 to 2010 . out of the population , only 12 percent received the same diagnosis on their second round compared with the first time . ",
        "patients should always try to seek for a second opinion on the diagnosis of their diseases to avoid tragic cases such as that of alyssa .   "
