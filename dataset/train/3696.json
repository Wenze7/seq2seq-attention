        "jan 10 -- huddersfield are targeting quality signings this window and have made another bid for norwich midfielder alex pritchard . it is understood the terriers have made a significantly improved offer after one of Â£ 5million was rejected , and they are now waiting for a response . former england under-21 international pritchard is understood to be open to moving to the john smith 's stadium after 18 months in norfolk . norwich want to keep pritchard , who has impressed after returning from an ankle injury in november , but with promotion from the sky bet championship looking unlikely , huddersfield 's latest bid will test their resolve . ",
        "the canaries are 13th in the table and nine points adrift of the top six after an inconsistent first season under head coach daniel farke . pritchard , 24 , has made nine appearances this season and scored eight goals in 43 games for norwich since joining from tottenham in 2016 . terriers boss david wagner confirmed he was interested in pritchard but will not be held to ransom . `` pritchard is not my player , he is a norwich player , '' he told the huddersfield examiner . `` i like him , but i have my doubts if he will play for us because i know how expensive british players are in this window . ",
        "`` if we are able to get some british players in they have to be reasonable prices . at the end it is all about quality . if it 's one new signing with the quality to help us , good . if it 's two , i 'll take two . we need to be focused on the quality . ''   "
