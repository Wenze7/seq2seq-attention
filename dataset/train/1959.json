        "balukhali - attackers on monday killed a rohingya representative in a bangladesh refugee camp , the second such death in three days as tensions mount over the planned repatriation of some 750,000 refugees to myanmar . sources said the dead man yusuf ali was a camp leader at the balukhali camp on the border with myanmar . mohammad yusuf , a leader in the neighbouring thaingkhali camp , was shot dead last friday . yusuf ali , 60 , was stabbed to death , district police chief iqbal hossain told afp . another police official described him as a rohingya `` majhi '' or camp leader . ",
        "the dhaka tribune described the earlier victim , mohammad yusuf , as a pro-repatriation leader . his wife jamila khatun , 35 , said some 20 armed and masked men stormed their home and and shot her husband in the head . `` he shouted ` oh allah ! ' and they shot him again in the mouth . he fell down , '' she told afp . `` they spoke rohingya . they were saying to my husband : ` why did you put our name on the list ? ' they were furious , '' she added . ",
        "she did not say which list the attackers were referring to . bangladesh authorities have been trying to draw up a list of rohingya , among nearly one million in camps on the border , who could be sent back to myanmar . bangladesh has been besieged with an influx of more than 680,000 rohingya since myanmar 's military launched the latest crackdown on the muslim minority last august . following an agreement with myanmar , bangladesh authorities had wanted to start the repatriations on tuesday but have delayed the operation -- saying they need more time to prepare . ",
        "local media and a rohingya leader have linked the killings to fears of being sent back . police have rejected any such connection . hundreds of rohingya have taken part in protests against repatriation in recent days . local authorities in cox 's bazar on monday prevented hundreds of them from holding a rally at one large camp .
