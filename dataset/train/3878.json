        "a coming-of-age film which explores the taboos around gay love and sex has won plaudits and awards abroad , and is now in the running for an oscar . but back home in south africa , the movie is under fire for lifting the veil on secret initiation rites practised by one of the country 's largest ethnic groups . the trailer alone led to its stars receiving death threats , and opponents have fought to stop it from being screened in local cinemas . `` the wound '' delves into the world of ritual initiations in the country 's xhosa community , following the experiences of an initiate and two older men who all experience same-sex attraction . ",
        "acclaimed by critics , the film was last week short-listed for the `` best foreign language film '' category for the academy awards , the winners of which will be announced in hollywood in march . but the boost to its international profile has enraged many in the xhosa community which the drama attempts to portray . `` it 's a daring film , it 's a brave film . all of us took a bold decision , '' said actor niza jay , 22 . `` this story had to be told . the kind of xhosa characters depicted in the film , they exist -- it 's people i know . ",
        "`` jay plays kwanda , a young gay man from johannesburg whose father dispatches him to the mountains of the eastern cape to take part in the `` ulwaluko '' -- the xhosa initiation into manhood . - ` not simply a gay love story ' - while there he meets xolani , a quiet , closeted gay man who is charged with looking after him . the plot twists when kwanda discovers not just xolani 's orientation but that he has a secret sexual relationship with a senior initiation leader who is a violent alcoholic -- and a married father . ",
        "`` it 's not simply this gay love story set in the mountain , '' jay told afp in a johannesburg cafe , wearing hair extensions and high-heels . `` it 's an exploration of way more than just the ritual -- or gayness -- it 's an exploration of respectability politics , seniority , manhood , masculinity . `` the film also depicts the circumcision process and the often basic after-care given to initiates . `` the ulwaluko is a very sacred and very important ritual for xhosa people , my people . it 's an environment where you learn your place among men and within your culture , '' said jay , who is himself xhosa -- like nelson mandela . ",
        "leading figures in the xhosa community are careful not to criticise the gay storyline . rather , they are incensed that details of the ulwaluko are revealed , as only initiates are entitled to know them . `` the ritual should not be on screen , it 's a secret . if our kids see this they wo n't want to go to the mountains , but it 's our traditions , '' said nkosazana bam , a member of the congress of traditional leaders of south africa . `` women , who raise boys by themselves , they could get scared to send them . ",
        "`` it must stop and it must not be screened in south africa . it must been banned totally , they do n't understand the importance of the ritual . `` bam added that she had been contacted by many xhosa people angry after seeing the trailer . - ` exploiting our culture ' ? - among them was kamvalethu spelman , a student at johannesburg 's wits university , who organised `` the wound must fall '' movement against the film . `` they kill our culture , the legacy that we have , '' said spelman , 21 . ",
        "`` even if we 're poor , or black people , or we 're living in the rural areas , we need to be respected . `` they say we are being homophobic but it 's a lie , they just want to make money by exploiting our culture . `` the fact that the film 's director john trengrove is white opened another line of criticism in a country still wracked by racial tensions 23 years after the end of apartheid . jay said that everyone involved in the production believed in the importance of the story . `` we were all very protective , firstly of the culture and the tradition , protective of ourselves and the dignity of the xhosa people , '' he said . ",
        "`` the wound '' has been screened at a string of movie gatherings , including the sundance and berlin film festivals , and won 14 awards . the film is due make its full-screening debut in south africa in february , defying several attempts to have it banned .   "
