        "north korean delegates arrived in seoul on sunday on their way to inspect venues and prepare cultural performances for next month 's winter olympics , in the first visit by pyongyang officials to the south for four years . north korean delegates arrived in seoul on sunday on their way to inspect venues and prepare cultural performances for next month 's winter olympics , in the first visit by pyongyang officials to the south for four years . television footage showed a group of seven officials led by hyon song-wol , the leader of the north 's popular moranbong band , crossing the heavily-fortified border on a bus before arriving at seoul train station about an hour later . ",
        "the stony-faced officials , surrounded by hundreds of seoul police officers , then took a train to the eastern city of gangneung , where one of the planned musical concerts is due to be held . hyon wore a dark coat and fur muffler as she boarded the train without talking to throngs of journalists at the station . the two-day visit is the first by pyongyang officials to the south since before left-leaning south korean president moon jae-in , who advocates dialogue with the north , took office last may . the trip comes two weeks after the neighbours agreed to send pyongyang 's athletes , cheerleaders , artistic troupes and other delegates to the games , due to begin in the south 's alpine resort of pyeongchang on february 9 . ",
        "the international olympics committee on saturday endorsed the deal , saying the north would send 22 athletes in sports ranging from figure skating to short-track speed skating . the two nations also agreed to march together at an opening ceremony under a unification flag -- a pale blue silhouette of the korean peninsula -- and to form a joint women 's ice hockey team . under the cross-border deal , the north 's 140-member orchestra led by hyon will hold two concerts -- one in the capital seoul and another in gangneung -- during the olympics . seoul will also send skiers to the north 's masikryong ski resort for joint training with nothern skiers and hold a joint cultural event in the scenic mount kumgang area north of the border , according to the deal . ",
        "the delegation led by hyon will inspect venues in gangneung on sunday and those in the capital seoul on monday before returning to the north on the same day . - ` peace olympics ' - seoul and organisers hope that the games , which they have promoted as the `` peace olympics , '' could ease tensions on the peninsula that surged to new heights in recent months over the north 's nuclear standoff with the us . the north last year staged a nuclear test and test-fired multiple long-range missiles believed to be capable of reaching the us mainland . ",
        "the north 's ruler kim jong-un also traded colorful personal insults and threats of war with us president donald trump , sparking fears of another conflict on the peninsula once devastated by the 1950-53 korean war . moon has tried to use the winter games as an opportunity to defuse tension , even asking the us to postpone an scheduled joint military exercise during the event -- a request washington accepted . kim , who had remained silent to repeated calls by seoul to take part in the olympics , abruptly announced an intention to join in his new year address . ",
        "but the recent moves also irritated many in the south , who accused seoul of making too many concessions to the hostile , wayward neighbour that regularly issues military threats against the south . the deal over the unified women 's ice hockey team sparked fury in the south , where critics accused seoul of robbing some of its own players of the opportunity to compete at the olympics for the sake of politics . tens of thousands have joined online petitions on the presidency 's website urging moon to scrap the plan . even as two koreas reached deals over the olympics , the north 's state media accused the dovish moon of `` brown-nosing '' the us and threatened to withdraw its offer to join the olympics if seoul did not show enough respect .
