        "not long ago , shiny and i discussed a lot about how might we enable taiwan to be seen by others , by the world ? during our experience overseas , we often meet awkward situations . for example , people are confused between taiwan and thailand because of the similar pronunciations . also , when asking about characteristics of taiwan , lots of people get stammered . moreover , some people would throw us a question like `` are you japanese ? '' or `` are you korean ? '' ; maybe they just want to discuss with us more about oriental cultures they like , however , we might end this conversation by saying `` oh . ",
        "i 'm taiwanese . '' in fact , people around the world are not really familiar with taiwan and our culture , just like we are not really familiar with some countries in africa or in europe . it seems not easy for people to connect what represents taiwan . during our discussion about this challenge , we wrote countless post-it , we went through brainstorming and mind-mapping sessions , and we sort them out . we figured that the solution to create taiwan 's image is not just making an introduction video of taiwan . it 's more than that . ",
        "we want people to talk about taiwan in their daily conversation , and then gradually learn and get interested in taiwan . how might we can infuse taiwan 's image to people 's daily conversation ? as we were trying to find a way to implement our concept , we browsed and wrote down our observation . we browsed on every social platform we can think of , such as facebook , instagram , twitter , plurk , etc , we found that many people like to use emojis which make the post juicier . we realized that emoji is truly a universal language to allow people to communicate with each other even they are not speaking the same language . ",
        "however , we noticed that most of the emojis about oriental culture are related to japanese culture . there is only one emoji about taiwan , the flag of taiwan . what if we create a series of emojis that can describe everyone 's taiwan experience ? with our taiwan emoji project , we might able to open conversations with others around the world . we 've built on this emoji idea since then . from brainstorming to execution , we 've listed over 50 emojis that can represent taiwan , the inspiration has come from taiwanese food , architecture , commodity , culture , and etc. . ",
        "to demo our idea , we 've selected 24 emojis to get started . when designing our emojis , we were also amazed at how well designed the existing emojis were , for example , the food with smoke looks more delicious and the lighting and the shadowing bring emoji design into details and dimensions . other than the emoji design , we also made a one-minute video showcasing taiwan emoji project . ultimately , we hope to raise public awareness and support . at the same time , we launched a website not only to describe each emoji but to allow people to download the emojis freely . ",
        "we want people to use taiwan emoji to make taiwan a part of everyday conversation . this series of emojis are currently available for plurk users . for the upcoming phase , we would suggest other social media platforms such as facebook or twitter to use them . at the same time , we are planning to submit emoji proposals to unicode organization . we hope to make these taiwan emojis to unicode emojis and be used by people around the world . ◎ plurk / ig / fb ： @taiwanemojitaiwan emojis are available on plurk .
