        "so on instagram , there 's been a trend of commenting on a persons photo and basically admitting how drunk you 'd have to be to fuck a specific person who 's name is dm 'd to you . a female friend of mine texted me earlier saying that she really does n't like this trend because it 's basically saying that some people need alcohol to fuck somebody else . anyway , she suddenly brought up to me that my name had been the only guy name dm 'd to her multiple times . she again , unpromptedly , told me that her answer for anybody would be only a little tipsy and it would `` be a mistake '' and the `` person would deserve better '' and she would n't want to ruin the relationship if it were to happen . ",
        "now , i do n't mind her answers , but i do n't get why she went out of her way to tell me what she had answered about me and keep pushing that that 's the answer she would give for anybody , even though i never once asked . to me , i 'm starting to think that she has a crush on me and was trying to `` cover up '' her tracks by telling me directly what she said , so i do n't lose interest in her . am i just overthinking things here ?
