        "all i needed was the iphone x in my pocket . it was a radical idea , and one that i initially rejected : could i cover ces 2018 , tell the story of this massive consumer electronics show without a laptop , a stand-alone camera or even a tablet ? i was so unsure i could do it that i kept filling my backpack with not one , but two laptops , a dlsr with a 200 mm lens , and charging cables and lugging it to the show floor . suffice to say , the bag was heavy and uncomfortable to carry . ",
        "initially , i used my laptop a bit and even wrote one post for medium , but 99 % of the time , i used apple 's iphone x . this was n't a complete departure from how i 've covered previous ces conferences in las vegas . i 've been recognized as a top social media presence at the event in the past . however , i usually tried to write as much as possible , running from press conferences , meetings , and booths back to the press rooms and hallways where i 'd find random chairs and power outlets to write a post or two for pcmag and , more recently , mashable . ",
        "i thought i might fill medium the same way , but i soon realized i could share my ces experience in real-time to a social media audience with nothing but the phone . apple 's iphone x is a powerful computer in its own right , with a decent-sized , but not unwieldy , 5.8-inch screen . its 12 mp camera is capable of taking good photos , even in the sometimes sketchy light of the las vegas convention center , and it has a built-in 2x optical zoom . and while it 's not practical to pull out my laptop or even tablet to write or tweet on the run , i could , with the phone , post on twitter , facebook and instagram stories with one hand . ",
        "plus , the iphone x turned out to be the perfect , virtually-waterproof gadget for what will henceforth be known as the ces deluge . one reason i felt more comfortable using twitter as my primary content delivery platform is the new character count limit . it 's the first time i 've covered a tech trade show with the option of up to 280 characters per tweet . i rarely , if ever worried about character count . it was not , however , about using all the available characters . instead , i focused on telling a concise story in a handful of words , images and videos . ",
        "to ensure maximum visibility , i also made sure that every tweet included the hashtag #ces2018 and , where possible , a twitter handle for the product or company . the use of videos surely helped in that quest . a video , even one as short as 20 seconds can tell far more of the story than 280 characters . twitter supports videos as long as 2 minutes , 20 ' seconds , but i assumed no one would watch for more than 1 minute 30 seconds . most of my videos were considerably shorter . pretty much from my first ces meeting , i made it my goal to share what excited me as quickly and efficiently as possible . ",
        "i wanted people to share my excitement . when i saw lg 's roll-up 65-inch oled tv , i knew i had to tell the story right away . tweeting with a static image would n't do it justice . so i shot video with the iphone . turning stories around quickly meant that everything had to be done on the phone , including video production . i 've been editing 1080p video on the iphone in imovie for years . imovie is fast , easy to use and more powerful than people think . for my ces videos , i made sure to add text overlays for context . ",
        "with the lg video , however , i wanted to take it up a notch . i connected my earpods , found a quiet corner in the convention hall , and recorded a voice over in imovie . 30 minutes after i first saw the lg rollable display , i 'd posted the news on twitter and facebook . this became my model for daily ces coverage : lots of short-burst tweets from press conferences and the show floor with occasional longer-form videos for more important or interesting products . virtually every ces tweet included photos or short videos . ",
        "some of the videos were under 30 seconds and so self-explanatory , especially with the accompanying tweet , that i did n't bother with text or music . but for more interesting or newsworthy products , i would edit the video , add text and some theme music . i worked on them as i walked or sat for a few minutes and relied primarily on a surprisingly good lte connection to upload them . by day 2 , i cut down to carrying just one laptop and my dslr . after another day of them never leaving my backpack , i finally left behind them in my hotel room . ",
        "on my last day at ces , my bag was filled with an 10.5-in . ipad , a small tripod , an iphone plug and charging cable , and a battery pack . the latter was easily my second most important piece of equipment . when i periscoped from the eureka park startup village for almost two hours , i also drained the iphone batter to 50 % , and the day was not even half over . my pocket-sized , 500 mah puku charger proved invaluable . by the end of each day , i had fully drained the puku . ",
        "i was also very careful to manage my iphone x battery consumption buy putting it in low power mode early in the day and keeping my screen brightness as low as possible . it felt strange not churning out one 500-word ces post after another , but , ultimately , i think i told far more , albeit much shorter , stories to an audience anxious for the latest gadget news . instead of a dozen nuts and bolts pieces on the latest intel or samsung announcement , my audience got to see , through dozens of social media posts on twitter , instagram stories and facebook , what it 's really like to attend ces , sit in the press conferences , walk the floor , meet the people , and try the gadgets . ",
        "what i saw and touched , they did , too . obviously , there were things i missed , places i never made it to , and details i could n't share . ultimately , though , i came away with a deep sense of satisfaction . i told the tale of ces my way , with nothing more than an iphone x and a whole lot of caffeine .
