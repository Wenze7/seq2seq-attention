        "injured murray , 30 , shared the throwback picture to let fans know that the child inside him would love to be back playing tennis - and people spotted an uncanny resemblancewhen andy murray penned a 384-word public apology for pulling out of the brisbane international through injury , he might have expected a sympathy or even a backlash . but he almost certainly wo n't have predicted what he actually got . the british no. 1 has been forced to withdraw from the tournament due to an ongoing hip injury , which could also rule him out of the australian open this month . ",
        "he posted a lengthy message on instagram , explaining how he 's now considering surgery on the troublesome injury . the post was accompanied by an image of the 30-year-old scot as a child , apparently to illustrate how the youngster in him would love to be out on the court . and several fans could n't see past his striking resemblance to the kid in 2003 film love actually - namely sam , aka actor thomas brodie-sangster . here 's what they had to say ... . murray has not played a competitive match since limping out of wimbledon and withdrew from the us open at the last minute . ",
        "he pulled out of brisbane on tuesday . the post in full `` hey everyone . . just wanted to write a little message on here for anyone interested in what in going through right now . `` firstly i want to apologise for withdrawing at late notice and to everyone who wanted to come along to watch me play . the organisers could n't have been more understanding and supportive and i 'll always remember that . thank you . i 've obviously been going through a really difficult period with my hip for a long time and have sought council from a number of hip specialists . ",
        "having been recommended to treat my hip conservatively since the us open i have done everything asked of me from a rehab perspective and worked extremely hard to try get back on the court competing . `` having played practice sets here in brisbane with some top players unfortunately this has n't worked yet to get me to the level i would like so i have to reassess my options . obviously continuing rehab is one option and giving my hip more time to recover . `` surgery is also an option but the chances of a successful outcome are not as i high as i would like which has made this my secondary option and my hope has been to avoid that . ",
        "however this is something i may have to consider but let 's hope not . `` i chose this pic as the little kid inside me just wants to play tennis and compete . . i genuinely miss it so much and i would give anything to be back out there . i did n't realise until these last few months just how much i love this game . `` every time i wake up from sleeping or napping i hope that it 's better and it 's quite demoralising when you get on the court it 's not at the level you need it to be to compete at this level . ",
        "`` in the short term i 'm going to be staying in australia for the next couple of days to see if my hip settles down a bit and will decide by the weekend whether to stay out here or fly home to assess what i do next . `` sorry for the long post but i wanted to keep everyone in the loop and get this off my chest as it 's really hurting inside . `` hope to see you back on the court soon .
