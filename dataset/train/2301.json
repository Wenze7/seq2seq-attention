        "costa mesa , calif. . -- general manager tom telesco believes the los angeles chargers are starting to make themselves at home . telesco is thoroughly pleased by his team 's resilience during a tumultuous relocation season that began with a rocky 0-4 start , but ended with the bolts as one of the nfl 's best teams . the executive wants the chargers to take the momentum from their 9-3 finish into an offseason in which they can make further strides toward becoming an afc power . if they do it , telesco also believes the chargers will start to see a true home-field advantage at their temporary stadium in carson , where they won their final five games . ",
        "`` i think the longer we 're here , the better we play , the better the atmosphere will be , '' telesco said thursday . `` i think it 's a pretty neat place to watch a football game . but we 're the new kids on the block , and we 've got to show what we are , show that we 're an exciting team to watch , get in the playoffs and get people excited , and there will be more and more charger fans there . `` the chargers definitely were exciting , but they were n't quite a playoff team . ",
        "they finished one game behind afc west champion kansas city , which beat los angeles twice . the bolts then missed out on the afc 's two wild-card spots in a four-way tiebreaker due to their mediocre conference record . the chargers ' 84-mile move up the california coast was just part of a busy year that began with the near-simultaneous announcement of the move and the hiring of coach anthony lynn , who received praise from telesco for instilling `` a high level of grit and determination that we just lacked last year . `` telesco echoed lynn 's determination to keep his coaching staff intact aside from assistant offensive line coach james cregg , who is headed to lsu . ",
        "in particular , telesco wants to keep coveted defensive coordinator gus bradley , who immediately put together a solid unit for a team that finished third in the nfl in points allowed . continuity is a major goal for the chargers after the upheaval of the past year . `` we 've come a long way in the last 12 months , '' telesco said at the chargers ' training complex in orange county . `` think about where we were last year this time and where we are now . it 's been a lot of change and a lot of challenges , but we 're on the right pace . ",
        "we 're going in the right direction . `` more things to know about the chargers ' offseason : find a foot : telesco echoed lynn 's desire to secure a solid kicker next season after the chargers used five players at the position and made a league-low 68 percent of their field goal tries this year . the chargers ' first two losses were decided by late missed field goal attempts , and it cost them dearly . `` obviously our kicking game was not nfl-quality this year , '' telesco said . `` one of my biggest regrets this year i did not do a good enough job addressing that position . ",
        "i put our head coach , anthony , in a tough position as far as managing the football game . i 'm very confident we 'll be able to get that fixed . '' telesco did n't say whether he plans to pursue a tested veteran kicker . open gates : telesco praised 37-year-old tight end antonio gates as `` one of the greatest chargers of all-time , '' but did n't unequivocally commit to bringing him back . gates is a free agent after setting the nfl record for td catches by a tight end early this season . ",
        "after serving largely as a backup to hunter henry , gates played extensively the last two games and determined that he wants to keep playing in 2018 . `` i do n't have any answers right now moving forward , but we 'll get there , '' telesco said of gates ' future . got goals : telesco pointed out that the chargers were successful in two main points of emphasis this season : cutting down turnovers and protecting rivers . los angeles finished third in the league with a plus-12 turnover ratio after finishing 27th last season with a minus-7 , and the chargers allowed an nfl-low 18 sacks after yielding 36 last season . ",
        "rivers ' heir : the chargers do n't have a firm timeline for finding a successor to the 36-year-old rivers , the only quarterback to start a game for the club since the 2006 season opener . after rivers ' excellent 4,515-yard season , telesco confirmed that the chargers `` hope he 'll be around for a good amount of years , '' and they are n't headed into the offseason determined to draft a quarterback . `` he played really well for us this year , and i expect him to come back and do the same thing next year , '' telesco added . ",
        "stacked back : the chargers expect former pro bowl cornerback jason verrett to return at full strength after missing all but five games in the past two seasons with knee injuries . telesco wants verrett , fellow cornerback trevor williams , current pro bowler casey hayward and versatile defensive back desmond king all back on a defense that was the nfl 's third-best against the pass this season , yielding just 197.2 yards per game .
