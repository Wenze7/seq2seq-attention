        "melbourne - unseeded australian open debutant elise mertens blew away world number four elina svitolina in straight sets tuesday to reach a first grand slam semi-final . the belgian world number 37 , on a 10-match unbeaten streak after winning in hobart this month , knocked out the ukrainian 6-4 , 6-0 in 1 hr 13 min . mertens , who is yet to drop a set , is the first belgian to make the last four since kim clijsters in 2012 . `` i 'm lost for words . i do n't know what to say . i just gave my all today , '' she said . ",
        "`` i played my game today and tried to stay aggressive . '' mertens , 22 , trains with her coach and boyfriend robbe ceyssens at the kim clijsters academy in belgium and has seen her world ranking rise from 127 at the end of 2016 . she had never been beyond the third round of a grand slam before in four appearances . `` he means a lot , '' she said of the importance of ceyssens . `` he 's by my side all the time . since we have been together my game has only gone upward . ",
        "all credit to him . `` mertens made all the initial running , returning aggressively and mixing up her game cleverly , taking every opportunity to approach the net and cut off svitolina 's passing avenues . she broke the world number four in the third game and then again for a 5-2 lead . serving for the set , mertens tightened and a double fault on break point handed the ukrainian a way back . mertens still had a second chance to serve out . another double fault allowed svitolina a glimmer at 15-30 , but mertens composed herself and landed three first serves to secure the set 6-4 . ",
        "the belgian had powered 16 winners to svitolina 's eight and significantly won nine of 12 points at the net . svitolina was immediately in trouble at 0-40 at the start of the second . she saved those but a weak forehand into the net gave a fourth and mertens landed an overhead smack on the sideline to secure the break . another break followed , and a third courtesy of a sumptuous backhand pass took mertens to the brink of the last four at 5-0 . she completed the humbling of svitolina with little fuss and will face either second seed caroline wozniacki or unseeded carla suarez navarro for a place in saturday 's final . ",
        "if she makes it she will emulate clijsters , who won at melbourne park in 2011 . mertens had a message for her countrywoman and tennis great who she said would be following the match in the middle of the night back home . `` kim , thanks for watching and do n't get too stressed . ''   "
