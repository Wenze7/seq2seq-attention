        "brussels - the european union again behaved in a discriminatory manner by publishing a single country report on so-called `` market distortions '' in china , a leading trade lawyer told xinhua on friday . `` it could be argued that the eu , by publishing a country report only on china , again behaves in a discriminatory manner by singling out china , '' said edwin vermulst at vvgb advocaten , an independent international law firm based here . vermulst believed that the 465-page report relied on studies conducted several years ago or by stakeholders . the eu 's new anti-dumping legislation entered into force on wednesday after being proposed one year ago by the european commission , an executive body of the eu . ",
        "as the new rules require the proving of the existence of a `` significant market distortion '' for calculating dumping , the commission on the same day published its first country report on the so-called `` state-induced distortions '' in china , which the eu industry may rely on as evidence to continue using the analogue methodology in anti-dumping probes . the report describes certain aspects of the chinese economy , focusing on the country 's macro-economy , the main production factors used in all manufacturing processes , and certain sectors of the economy , including steel and ceramics . ",
        "`` it proceeds from a black and white world view that does not exist in the real world where differences between , for example , the economic systems of many eu member states and those of china are much more nuanced than the report suggests , '' the lawyer said . in november , in a crucial step to update eu protectionism arsenal , the european parliament gave green lights to the amended new legislation for anti-dumping and anti-subsidized imports from countries outside the eu . prior to the european parliament 's vote to approve the new anti-dumping legislation , china 's ministry of commerce told the eu that its new anti-dumping rules granting separate treatment for imports under `` significant market distortions '' were not in compliance with its wto obligations .
