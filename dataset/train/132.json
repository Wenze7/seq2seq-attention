        "vasyl lomachenko -- boxing 's pound-for-pound king -- has called out the floyd mayweather-backed boxing prodigy gervonta ` tank ' davis . the cuban master -- himself a two-time olympic champ -- quit after round six , meekly claimed a sore hand forced him to retire after a beating from his rival . the wbo super-featherweight king now wants to add to his growing scalp collection with davis , the undefeated 23-year-old who won the ibf junior lightweight strap in just his 17th fight . davis -- who lost the title for missing the weight for his second defence on the mayweather vs conor mcgregor undercard -- needs to get his career back on track after legal trouble . ",
        "but getting called out by hi-tech is not exactly the tune-up fine the softly-spoken baltimore beast needs so early on in his career . boxing fans thought loma called out the money man out of retirement with a cheeky twitter gif featuring wwe star the rock , who 's catchphrase was ` just bring it ' . but the madcap star revealed he was actually calling out his young protégé who is often seen ogling strippers and splashing cash with his 50-0 mentor . lomachenko wrote to mayweather : `` @floydmayweather it would have been an honor to fight you in your prime but i 'm not talking about you . ",
        "please stop hiding your fighter . '' pa : press associationmayweather has already tried to shield ` tank ' from the steam train that lomachenko is by throwing lightweight champ mickey garcia in harm 's way . garcia is aiming for a fourth weight world title when he challenges sergey lipinets for the ibf junior welterweight title on february 10 . and mayweather wants the two to meet at the 135 lb lightweight mark before his fighter gets involved . richard pelham - the sunmayweather said : `` `` if lomachenko is what they say he is , i think they should make him and mikey garcia . ",
        "`` i mean , that 's just my honest opinion . i think lomachenko and mikey garcia should lock up . great fighters always move up . we call that legendary . `` a lot of fighters are taking shots at tank . at the end of the day , tank is not perfect , but his boxing record is . ''   "
