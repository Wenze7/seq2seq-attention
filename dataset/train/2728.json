        "earlier this week , action on armed violence released a report detailing a staggering jump in civilian casualties from explosive ordinance in 2017 -- more than 15,000 were killed , up by 42 percent from 2016 . the report suggested that this increase was largely caused by airstrikes , primarily in iraq , syria and yemen -- so i got back in touch with chris woods , the man behind airwars , an independent monitoring group tracking civilian casualties in the war on islamic state , who we first spoke with in 2016 . i wanted to get a better idea of the factors that made 2017 an especially deadly year for civilians , and what -- if anything -- the us-led coalition has done to stem these deaths . ",
        "this interview has been edited for length . vice : first off , do the alarming findings of the report from aoav tally with what you have seen in terms of civilian casualties in 2017 ? chris woods : our focus at the moment is only on iraq and syria , and just in that theatre , 2017 was a terrible year for civilian harm . certainly there was a significant rise in civilian deaths that we tracked from international military actions in those two countries , which entirely chimes with the very bad news that other ngos and international agencies have been reporting . ",
        "when you see an uptick in reports of civilian casualties , what are the key factors you would usually expect to be driving that ? whether you are looking at allegations against russia , the coalition or iraqi ground forces , there are always a few strong determinates when it comes to civilian harm . allegations are usually clustered around specific offences , so with an attack on a particular town or city or region we will always see a spike in civilian harm . but what we also saw very strongly in 2017 was a correlation between the intensity of bombardment and outcomes for civilians . ",
        "so , bluntly , the more bombs and missiles dropped in a particular area , the greater the risk to civilians . that sounds obvious , but it 's actually quite difficult to get data that supports that . but we got a lot of it in 2017 . so there were more airstrikes overall , but what were the other factors that led to this alarming rise in civilian casualties ? the biggest issue we saw in 2017 -- particularly if we look at the us-led coalition -- was that the war moved very heavily into cities . that , more than any other single factor , resulted in the deaths of many more civilians and casualty events . ",
        "we saw a similar pattern at the back end of 2016 , when russia and the assad regime heavily bombed east aleppo . there 's a very strong correlation between attacks on cities and large numbers of civilian casualties . and frankly , it does n't matter who 's carrying out those attacks . the outcome for civilians is always dire . which changes to the way the war was prosecuted last year led to this move to urban areas and this increase in airstrikes ? one of the criticisms the trump administration levelled at obama was that he was too cautious in his war on . ",
        "but there was a reason for that caution , which was about limiting civilian harm as much as possible . we saw far fewer civilian casualties , relatively speaking , for the number of strikes under obama than trump . the one moment at which that shifted a bit was in the battle for east mosul , which began in november , 2016 . about six weeks into that campaign , the americans and iraqis took stock . it had been a very tough campaign for iraqi ground forces -- some accounts put casualties in iraqi special forces as high as one in three . ",
        "that 's a very high toll indeed for elite troops . the reason those casualties were so high is that they were going in and clearing houses by hand . one reason the iraqis gave for having to do that was that it was too hard to call in airstrikes . in the closing weeks of the obama administration the rules of engagement were changed , meaning it was far easier to call in airstrikes . we saw an immediate transfer of risk from iraqi forces onto the civilian population . when trump came in we saw a significant continuation of that . ",
        "things did n't get any better under trump for civilians -- in fact , they got a lot worse . one of the reasons for that was the intensity of the bombardment . we saw an absolutely ferocious bombing campaign by the us and its allies in both mosul and raqqa in 2017 . between those two cities , the coalition alone dropped 50,000 munitions . one bomb or missile was dropped on raqqa every 12 minutes , on average , for the duration of the four-month battle . you said earlier that it does n't really matter who 's doing the bombing , which might surprise some people , given the criticism levelled at russia in the past for its wide use of dumb-bombs over guided munitions ... can you talk more about the weapons used and how that impacts civilian casualties ? ",
        "when russia and the assad regime were bombing aleppo in late 2016 , we had assumed that a key reason for the large number of civilian casualties was down to the fact they were primarily using dumb-bombs . we have actually changed our modelling since then , based on what we have seen with the coalition in places like raqqa and mosul . the reason is that even when you use precision bombs on cities , really , the outcome for civilians is the same as a dumb bomb . you ca n't control for what the bombs do when they land . ",
        "we saw very little difference between russian and coalition strikes when it came to bombing cities . this is the big problem we have with a shift to urban warfare -- it 's really taking us to the limits of any benefits we might have in terms of protecting civilians by using precision munitions . the first time we spoke there was , you said , a huge disparity in terms of coalition members ' levels of transparency and accountability . has the mounting civilian death-toll forced any improvement in that area ? it 's been a surprise for us just how little transparency and accountability we 've had from most coalition members , including countries like the netherlands , france and canada -- countries you might have expected better from . ",
        "perhaps the other big surprise has been that the united states has been by far the most accountable nation in the war . indeed , accountability significantly improved for the majority of trump 's first year in office . that was against expectations and a very positive thing . the us admitted that civilian casualty event at al jadidah . had the strike been from one of the us ' allies , we may still have never had any formal recognition of that harm . how does the uk rate on this ? the uk is a real problem , as is france . ",
        "between them , they have conducted more than 3,000 strikes . in 2017 , most of those strikes were in urban areas . during the battle of mosul , michael fallon put out a statement boasting that british aircraft had destroyed 750 targets inside mosul , second only to the united states . and yet the uk claims zero civilian casualties from its strikes . the ap recently released a report suggesting that as many as 10,000 civilians died in mosul -- at least a third of them killed by air or artillery strikes . so something is clearly going very wrong with british monitoring of civilian harm . ",
        "interestingly , the uk are one of the most transparent members of the coalition -- they give us far more information about what they 're doing , where and when . that 's a good thing . but transparency has n't led to accountability for the british . we have been pushing for a proper independent inquiry into british battle-damage assessments . we just do n't think they are fit for purpose -- they are , it seems , incapable of detecting civilian harm . in terms of the raw numbers of casualties , just how bad was 2017 ? ",
        "this has been a long , hot war . we 're in the fourth year of the war on is , and it 's still not over . more than 100,000 munitions have been dropped , more than 30,000 airstrikes and artillery strikes . it 's a very intense war . it has seen the highest numbers of civilian casualties from western actions -- for the us and australia -- since vietnam . for the british and european allies , probably the highest numbers of civilian casualties in a conflict they have been directly involved in since korea . these are levels of civilian harm we have not seen in generations . ",
        "looking toward 2018 , i assume there 's a predicted dip in civilian casualties with the effective end of the battles for the key urban is strongholds ? the war -- especially in syria -- is cyclical . and coalition actions there have now declined . but russian actions have accelerated . there have been 30 alleged russian casualty events in the last week . the un is reporting that 70,000 syrians are on the move right now because of the russian and syrian offensive . so while coalition strikes might be going down for the moment , from the russian-led side they have gone up . ",
        "we are also worried that in 2017 there were some extremely worrying precedents set . there is no doubt that war is moving deeply back into cities in a way it has n't for decades . according to the un , the attack on mosul in 2017 was the biggest urban assault since wwii and resulted in thousands of civilian deaths . i think we are becoming far too complacent about this kind of shift in warfare . and our militaries and governments are not taking this seriously enough . there is no way we can protect civilians when war moves into cities . ",
        "yet , here we are , with our governments bombing in iraq , syria , libya , yemen , afghanistan pretty much day in , day out . this is not something any of us should be comfortable with .   "
