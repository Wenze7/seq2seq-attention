        "lincoln city began 2018 with an action-packed and controversial 4-2 defeat at league two leaders luton town . the imps led twice in a match which saw both teams have man sent off in the first half . town skipper alan sheehan was first to see red when he lashed out at matt rhead after just four minutes . michael bostwick then crashed home the resulting free-kick to give lincoln the lead . the hatters levelled through james collins but matt green soon restored city 's lead before harry anderson was dismissed after collecting his second booking . the imps bossed much of the second half and green almost made it 3-2 when he struck the post from long range . ",
        "but goals in the final 20 minutes from danny hylton and substitute harry cornick saw the hatters snatch all three points . match factshatters : stech ; justin , mullins , stacey , o. lee , hylton , shinnie , rea , berry , collins , sheehan . subs not used : cook , mpanzu , gamblin , shea , e. lee , famewo . goals : collins 32 , justin 43 , hylton 73 , cornick 82 . imps : vickers ; long , waterfall , raggett , habergham ; woodyard , bostwick , whitehouse ; anderson , rhead , green . ",
        "subs not used : farman , palmer , arnold , stewart . goals : bostwick 5 , green 33 . attendance : 9,659 . imps boss danny cowley made three changes to the side that faced forest green , with one being enforced . right-back neal eardley has been struggling with a calf injury and was replaced by sean long , while luke waterfall and elliott whitehouse came in for rob dickie and nathan arnold , who were both began on the bench . town manager nathan jones made five changes to the side which was thrashed 4-0 at port vale on saturday . ",
        "the game got off to an explosive start which saw the hatters reduced to 10 men , only for city take the lead seconds later . sheehan was then dismissed for clearly clashing out at rhead on the edge of the home box . bostwick then drilled in the resulting free kick from 20-yards , to the delight of 1,000-plus travelling supporters , but rhead was then booked for over-celebrating the goal . the striker was then roundly booed by the home supporters whenever he touched the ball for the rest of the tie . chris vaughan/camerasportroared on by the aggrieved town faithful , luton initially responded well to the double setback of going a man down and falling behind . ",
        "however , the imps almost doubled their lead on 26 minutes when raggett , in what was expected to be his last match for the imps , had a header tipped over acrobatically by keeper marek stech . the 10 men levelled on 32 minutes and , in keeping with the match , the goal came tinged with controversy . there were suggestions of handball against hylton as he held off long before squaring to collins , who fired home . however , it did n't take long for city to restore their lead . long 's ball forward was flicked on and green was in the right place at the right time , producing an acrobatic effort which was too fierce for stech to keep out . ",
        "the drama and controversy was unrelenting and the imps were reduced to 10 men too after anderson picked up two yellow cards for a pair of innocuous-looking challenges . now on a par numerically , town soon equalised again with justin crashing home a superb effort from more than 20 yards out on 43 minutes . rhead was withdrawn at half-time and replaced by josh ginnelly , who , along with whitehouse , supported lone front man green . compared to the fireworks of the first half , the early stages of the second period were relatively tame . the imps did an excellent job of quietening the home crowd and they almost retook the lead just before the hour mark . ",
        "luke waterfall found space from a corner . his header triggered a goalmouth scramble but town somehow kept it out with the ball looping just over the bar . ginnelly then had a sight of goal but took too long to get his effort away , allowing the home defence time to recover and the chance went begging . at the other end , olly lee saw a fierce drive blocked by waterfall with the home fans optimistically appealing for a penalty . playing as a lone striker , green was immense in the second half and he almost made it 3-2 when his superb long-range effort cannoned off the post . ",
        "that proved to be key moment as , soon after , town took the lead for the first time with 17 minutes to go when luke berry 's in-swinging cross was headed home by a diving hylton . with eight minutes to go , luton doubled their lead when cornick cut in from the left and hammered a shot past vickers .
