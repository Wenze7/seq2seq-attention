        "manchester united manager jose mourinho has purportedly recommended tottenham manager mauricio pochettino to real madrid 's president , florentino perez , as a replacement for zinedine zidane . the frenchman is under increasing pressure at the bernabeu , after madrid 's progressively worsening form has seen them fall 19 points behind rivals barcelona in the league , and reports have claimed real 's hierarchy will dismiss the 45 year old at the end of the season . in light of this , according to spanish publication mundo deportivo , via sport witness , perez has reportedly spoken to his former employee mourinho in regards to a replacement , with the 54-year-old offering up pochettino as madrid 's best option . ",
        "the former madrid manager has previously lauded the spurs manager for the job he has done in north london , with the argentinian nurturing an inexperienced team to second in the premier league last year , four places above mourinho 's united side . while such news will no doubt be a cause for concern for tottenham 's supporters , and indeed players , pochettino 's contract extension signed last year will provide some comfort . the 45-year-old tactician is signed up with spurs until 2021 , providing the tottenham hierarchy with the upper hand , if any negotiations were to take place . ",
        "however , the argentinian was admittedly coy when speaking to spanish radio station onda cero last week , declaring : `` i 'm happy where i am just now . now that liverpool have ended man city 's unbeaten streak will the citizens be able to go the rest of the epl season unbeaten ? yes - they 'll regroup and wo n't suffer another lossno - not after everyone knows they 're not invincible '' data-viewability = '' '' contenteditable = `` false '' > now that liverpool have ended man city 's unbeaten streak will the citizens be able to go the rest of the epl season unbeaten ? ",
        "yes - they 'll regroup and wo n't suffer another lossno - not after everyone knows they 're not invincible `` football will take me where i want to go . jorge griffa , who is like a father to me , once told me to not think too much , enjoy the present , be professional and responsible , and football will take you where you want .
