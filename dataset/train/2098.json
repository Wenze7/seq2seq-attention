        "which current player will people still be talking about 100 years from now ? greg wyshynski : if alex ovechkin stays on his current scoring pace this season , he 's going to clear 600 goals , and add a few more after that to his career total . he 's on track to become the eighth player to break the 700-goal mark . even if he does n't hit 800 goals in his career -- and he certainly could -- we 've witnessed one of the greatest goal scorers in the history of hockey doing his thing in this era . ",
        "he 's a dominant force , a rare combination of power and speed . he 's a rock star , helping to lift the washington capitals and the nhl out of the abyss of the lost 2004-05 season . unlike marcel dionne , mike gartner and brett hull -- all in the 700 club -- ovechkin could retire today with a trophy case 's worth of hardware : the calder trophy , the three harts , the three lindsays , the six rocket richards for leading the nhl in goals . he could also retire today and make the hall of fame . ",
        "yes , i know : this is where you mention that other bit of hardware he 's yet win . it 's a valid point about ovechkin 's legacy , considering how differently we view all-time great goal scorers without a stanley cup than those with multiple ones . but if we 're talking about `` who will be remembered 100 years from now ? '' ... well , would n't being the best hockey player of all time to never win a stanley cup make ovechkin quite memorable ? honestly ? emily kaplan : we 'll be talking about sidney crosby and this pittsburgh penguins dynasty for a long , long time . ",
        "we 'll also be gushing about connor mcdavid for decades to come -- as long as he and the edmonton oilers inevitably win all those stanley cups we prematurely handed them this offseason . but you know who i hope my grandchildren and great-grandchildren will be talking about ? the legend of jaromir jagr . there 's something mythical about hockey 's most famous mullet -- and , of course , the man who sports it too . i 'll never not be fascinated by the longevity of the 6-foot-33 , 230-pound lumbering czech , who somehow found a way to stay relevant at age 45 while the nhl universe shifted younger , faster and smaller . ",
        "jagr 's name will be atop the record books for some time . as of this writing , he trails only wayne gretzky all-time in points , he 's third in goals and , at 1,728 career games played , just needs to suit up four more times to pass ron francis for third on the all-time list . jagr bridges generations ; he 's only five degrees separated from the first nhl season . as jonathon jackson discovered last month : jagr played against guy lafleur , who played against gordie howe , who played against dit clapper , who played with and against cy denneny ... who played on opening night on dec. . ",
        "19 , 1917 . jagr was drafted with keith tkachuk in 1990 and now plays with his son , matt tkachuk , who was born in 1997 . he has suited up for nearly a third of the league 's teams in good times and bad . and the more guys he skates with , the more we 'll hear stories about his unusual midnight workouts , the time he launched his own peanut butter product , his odd pregame nap habits , and his grooming habits . and those are the types of stories that tend to stick . ",
        "chris peters : have we not already been talking about jagr for 100 years ? that 's a great pick by emily , as jagr 's career is unique among any in professional sports . he truly is a treasure . as i thought about my own choice , a lot of different names popped into my head . i think we 'll all be talking about crosby and ovechkin for generations . i also thought about erik karlsson , who has changed the way we view defensemen -- like bobby orr did -- as karlsson arrived not so long after the dead puck era . ",
        "the `` shutdown defenseman '' is not extinct , but if you look at the nhl draft picks over the past few years -- and ahead to the 2018 draft -- you 'll see that defensemen who are n't good skaters and ca n't move the puck quickly wait a long time to hear their names called . many will try to duplicate karlsson 's style , but it takes special talent to even get close . ultimately , however , i think connor mcdavid will be the player of this exciting young wave whom grandparents will be telling their grandkids they got to see years down the line . ",
        "there simply has ever been a player like him and i doubt that many future players will be able to even mimic him . he is the most breathtaking skater i 've ever seen , period . playing the game at the speed he does , with the ease he does makes him truly exceptional . there will be video to preserve all of his highlights and i 'm sure it will be compatible with whatever technology exists in 100 years , but mcdavid is best experienced live . watching him cover the length of the ice in a blink , seeing him weave through defenders without breaking stride , hearing the puck as it hits the back bar of the net , is all part of the mcdavid experience . ",
        "those of us living in the present are the only ones who get to experience that . now all of this comes with a big ol' caveat . a big reason i opted not to go with karlsson is that , as remarkable as he is to watch , legacies are built , solidified and literally preserved when one 's name is etched on the stanley cup , especially if it 's multiple times . karlsson , 27 , is deep enough into his career that getting a cup is going to be more complicated . mcdavid has time on his side , but in the salary cap era , a gm has to be able to build a contending team around him . ",
        "as we 've seen this season , the oilers remain in a somewhat precarious place and are going to need to do even more building before they can be viewed as a serious cup contender . mcdavid is a singular talent and i expect that one day he will lead a team to the stanley cup , but it 's not going to be entirely up to him .
