        "space-industry officials say this year could be one of the more important in recent memory because of the need to execute on planned major projects . the year will be marked by the florida coming-out party of jeff bezos ' rocket company blue origin , which recently completed a massive 750,000-square-foot manufacturing plant near kennedy space center . that facility is expected to employ 300 workers during its first few years of operation . oneweb , meanwhile , plans to launch at least five of its florida-built satellites on blue origin 's new glenn rocket in the near future . ",
        "the company could open its satellite manufacturing plant by the end of the year . united launch alliance and spacex , meanwhile , expect to continue a feverish launch pace on the coast , which saw multiple launches within a month several times last year . four launches were planned for january from florida , including the long-anticipated maiden test flight of spacex 's behemoth falcon heavy rocket . space florida has been trying to lure more companies to the region , though president and ceo frank dibello would n't specify which ones . `` you 'll see a couple of announcements of new companies here that add depth to the already growing aerospace and space economic base we have growing in florida as a whole , '' he said . ",
        "dibello described the potential arrivals as small-satellite manufacturers , rocket companies and `` unconventional transportation technology '' firms . `` florida will play a pivotal role in enabling control of the internet of things , '' he said , referring to satellites that enable location - and automation-based services on everyday objects . `` it 's iot of things that are flying in space , in the air or on the ground . '' the efforts come as the u. s. government plans to revitalize efforts to reach the moon , which president donald trump named as a target in a dec. . ",
        "11 space policy directive . the private industry would still be able to pursue a moon landing or other initiatives this year , dibello said . `` in spite of what mission nasa might have been given , there is n't enough money to accomplish the broad goals that the space council wants without access to private capital , '' he said . `` we need to quickly embrace what the commercial marketplace can provide . '' one area that appears set to grow is small satellites . oneweb will build them in central florida in a 120,000-square-foot facility that 's expected to employ up to 250 . ",
        "melbourne-based harris corporation , meanwhile , has plans to build smaller satellites that can hitch rides on rockets into space . the goal is to carve a niche in an emerging industry , said bill gattle , president of harris ' space and intelligence systems division . `` we are not going to compete with a boeing , a lockheed martin , a northrop grumman , '' he said . `` but on smaller missions , that 's a strong play for us . '' the fact that more launches are expected to take off this year have helped make that sector more appealing , gattle said . ",
        "`` a decade ago , a satellite would cost me $ 140 million just to get it into space , '' he said . `` now i can have a hosted satellite on a rocket for less than $ 1 million . it opens up a tremendous opportunity . '' elon musk 's spacex has plans to debut its falcon heavy rocket in a test flight this month . the heavy-thrust reusable vehicle , which uses the power of three falcon 9 rockets , would mark an advance in musk 's effort to get humans to mars . musk has identified that task as one of the driving missions behind his company . ",
        "ray lugo , director of the university of central florida 's florida space institute , said spacex and united launch alliance 's efforts to out-maneuver and out-innovate one another bodes well for the region this year . add in another year of development of nasa 's space launch system and the orion vehicle , he said , it establishes a competitive environment with no clear expected outcome just yet . `` is this a turning point where instead of being predominately led by the government , do we rely more on commercial companies ? '' said lugo , who previously served as director of nasa 's glenn research center in cleveland . ",
        "blue origin 's rocket plant throws in another wild card that should be factored into where the industry goes in 2018 , he said . `` i have a feeling that once he gets to flying , that will be the vehicle everyone wants to fly on , '' he said . new arrivals will open up opportunities for contractors . space coast is home to hundreds of companies that partner up with larger businesses to create components of their launch vehicles or provide other services . last year , craig technologies landed a deal to manufacture an adapter for nasa that helps anchor the orion spacecraft to the space launch system . ",
        "these deals have led to president and ceo carol craig predicting a hiring surge for the company in 2018 . the increase in activity has the company considering an acquisition for the first time since its 1999 opening . `` you need to take advantage of the opportunity , '' said craig , whose company employs about 160 people on the space coast . `` over the last year or two , activity has been ramping up .
