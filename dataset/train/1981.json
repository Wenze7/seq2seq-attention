        "personal development is a growing topic that is constantly written about these days and everyone seems to be a self help guru , hoping to be the next mr. tony robbins . personally , i have always believed the larger society loves to play to the broke . unfortunately , there is a market for it otherwise there would not be all of these self-help empowerment websites , `` gurus '' and seminars . ones looking to others for inspiration when really we just need to dig deep down within ourselves . anxiety , low self-esteem and depression are real and that is something that needs to be taken care of with help -- a professional aka a therapist . ",
        "finding a great one is essential because they are able to really keep you in check and be hard on you when need be . that is the difference between them and friends . however , going to seminars to search for answers to your own problems from other people is , i believe , to be self-defeating ... ... self-defeating because no one 's personal problems are the same as another . no one 's loss , grief , pain and low self-esteem is the same as another no matter how similar the situation could be . connecting with someone who has lost a loved one , for instance , when trying to deal with your own loss is not the same . ",
        "we all have different environments , different nurtures and unique experiences that allow us to deal with similar circumstances differently than even your own sibling . what is really in order , is your own mission . principles that you should have , written and understood -- that really define your own core as a human being . personally , at home i have my own commandments that i know are the essence of my being -- written on a white board , that i take a quick 2 minutes to look at on my out to the garage to get in my car , to take on the day . ",
        "key ? figure out what is true for you . 5 commandments that are mine , along with my personal recommendation : 1 . pressing onbeing very internally focused , pressing on is much harder than it sounds . through every day life we are facing challenges , opportunity and setbacks . once those setbacks hit , disappointment occurs and an unhealthy cycle could take place . analyze a situation , understand what happened , realize what worked and what did not , and give yourself some time -- but time is a precious commodity . shake it off , and use that experience to prepare for tomorrow . ",
        "2 . art of now `` you may delay , but time will not , and lost time is never found again '' -- benjamin franklinthe longer something really is pushed off , is something that never begins . we only have 24 hours in a day and 8 of that is dedicated to sleep . when you want to begin something , make a plan to begin it today -- even bits and pieces of it . that feeling when you start something that you want to do , is empowering in itself . procrastination is the enemy of growth and the confidant of stress . ",
        "3 . fulfillmentfinding this is a struggle for a lot of people . honestly , it is the key to your core as a being . hollywood even struggles with this . we see the glitz ; the glamour ; the money and the beauty hollywood celebrities throw at us . then whey do we hear a lot about tragic stories of lives lost very early due to drugs , and depression ? self-abuse with drugs have taken away the people , music stars and award-winning actors who were most perceived to be one of the more successful ones . ",
        "success is an empowering feeling and usually success is correlated with happiness . its a lie . although personally , success does indeed drive me . being successful is not the definition and factor of finding happiness . fulfillment is . consider yourself very blessed if you have found something that truly drives you and have been able to really build a living out of it . its not easy . most of us never bet on ourselves , once you do you will be surprised of what your truly made of . all of us have unique skills that we have not explored yet that we could really exploit and in this `` gig '' economy and technological era , we could really turn a hobby and passion into a fulfilling endeavor . ",
        "`` success without fulfillment , is the ultimate failure '' -- tony robbins4 . createsociety is split in to two pieces especially in the capitalistic arena . there are the capitalists and there are the masses : consumers . capitalists have gotten a bad reputation for being money hungry and being portrayed as the anti-thesis of robin hood . forget the political jargon . their attitude and mindset is what is notable . they create . they have an idea and vision and they build it out for the masses . this tactic is not supposed be in the mindset of building the next technological enterprise a la apple or google , but really honing in on your own craft . ",
        "examples : publishing an idea on medium = creationcreating your own blog about a topic that interests you ? = creationknow a lot about an industry , using your expertise for others ? = creationbuilding out your backyard patio that you have always wanted = creationpainting that exact beautiful scenery that you saw on a trip ? = creationcooking = creationthere are many ways to create -- using your own mind , experiments and trial and error for an end product . this is my favorite one , because it empowers you to take something you had in your mind and see it come to life . ",
        "5 . givethe commandment that is vital to understanding who you are and where you are . there are not many millionaires and billionaires that exist and a lot of us have stable consistent jobs that help us take care of our ultimate needs . a lot of us wish for more , want more and look to the rich as the ultimate guidance to freedom and happiness . giving is essential . it allows you to feel gratitude about yourself and thankful for where you are while understanding that there a lot of people who have it much worse than you , who are struggling , especially throughout the holiday season . ",
        "see a young girl raising funds for her dance group to travel outside your local albertsons ? $ 5 wont hurt your well-being . see someone who is suffering from hunger ? offer to help and furthermore , enter the grassroots of making a difference in your community . when you volunteer , especially towards a social cause -- you will feel that special feeling . that feeling of gratitude and fulfillment . there is just nothing like it . q : what are your 5 commandments ?
