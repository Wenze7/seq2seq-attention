        "new york -- what 's a bitcoin worth ? lately nobody knows for sure , but after a wild ride on friday , it 's worth a good deal less than it was thursday . after losses over the last few days , the digital currency fell as much as 30 percent overnight in asia , and the action became so frenzied that the website coinbase suspended trading . it later made up much of that ground , and slumped 9.5 percent to $ 14,042 friday , according to the tracking site coindesk . experts are warning that bitcoin is a bubble about to burst , but things might get crazier before it does : a lot of people have heard of bitcoin by now , but very few people own it . ",
        "`` bubbles burst when the last buyers are in , '' said brett ewing , chief market strategist for first franklin . `` who are the last buyers ? the general public , unfortunately . `` ewing said 40 percent of bitcoin belongs to just 1,000 people , and hedge funds and other major investors are going to start buying it soon . but those funds may buy bitcoin and also protect themselves by placing bets that it will fall . retail investors may just buy it only to see it fall . `` i think investors should approach it with caution and i think many people will dive into it not understanding what it is , '' he said . ",
        "as bitcoin skyrocketed this month , the volume of trading was unprecedented as investors hoping to catch a ride up piled in . prices have risen so fast , the friday returned the price of bitcoin only to where it was trading two weeks ago . the volatility has created a circus-like atmosphere . some companies that have added the word `` bitcoin '' or related terms to their names to get in on the action . the craziest thing is , it 's worked . long island iced tea corp. . until this week had been known for its peach - , raspberry - , guava - , lemon - and mango-flavored drinks . ",
        "then , on thursday , the company announced a radical rebranding . it 's changing its name to long blockchain corp. , shifting its primary focus from iced tea to `` the exploration of and investment in opportunities that leverage the benefits of blockchain technology . `` blockchain is a ledger where transactions of digital currencies , like bitcoin , are recorded . shares in long island iced tea soared 200 percent in one day . the hicksville , new york , company did what investors are doing , hitching a ride on a currency that raced from less than $ 10,000 at the end of november to almost $ 20,000 on sunday . ",
        "and it cost less than $ 1,000 at the beginning of the year . the rise of price of bitcoin , which is still difficult to use if you actually want to buy something , has led to heated speculation about when the bubble might burst . the currency has been , if nothing else , highly elastic , bouncing back every time it crashes , which occurs about once every quarter . it fell 11.5 percent over two days in early december and 21.5 percent over five days in november . curiosity has now driven bitcoin to the futures market , where investors bet on which direction it will go . ",
        "bitcoin futures started trading on two major exchanges -- the cboe and cme -- this month . those futures fell about 8 percent friday . if people get burned , it wo n't be because they were not warned . the securities and exchange commission put out a statement last week warning investors to be careful with bitcoin and other digital currencies . the commodities futures trading commission has proposed regulating bitcoin like a commodity , similar to gold or oil . financial industry regulatory authority , a financial watchdog , issued a similar warning recently .
