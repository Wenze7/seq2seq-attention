        "Â© laszlo balogh / reutersa woman in tennessee has given birth a baby daughter that was frozen as an embryo 24 years ago . it is believed to be a world record for frozen embryo to result in a successful birth . baby emma wren was born to parents tina and benjamin gibson on november 25 , local media wate , citing the national embryo donation center , which supplied the embryo , reports . tina was born in 1991 , her daughter was conceived just 18 months later , though the two were separated by an entire generation when the embryonic emma was cryopreserved in 1992 . ",
        "emma was implanted into her mother 's uterus earlier this year through a process called frozen embryo transfer . after a successful pregnancy , baby emma was born with a minimum of fuss and her parents could n't be happier . `` emma is such a sweet miracle , '' dad benjamin said . `` i think she looks pretty perfect to have been frozen all those years ago . `` nedc lab director carol sommerfelt recalled the moment she showed the couple a picture of the embryos at the time of transfer : `` i will always remember what the gibsons said when presented with the picture of their embryos ; ` these embryos could have been my best friends , ' as tina herself was only 25 at the time of transfer . '' ",
        "`` it is deeply moving and highly rewarding to see that embryos frozen 24.5 years ago using the old , early cryopreservation techniques of slow freezing on day one of development at the pronuclear stage can result in 100 percent survival of the embryos with a 100 percent continued proper development to the day-3 embryo stage , '' she added .
