        "london - struggling commodities trader noble group has completed the sale of its u. s.-focused oil business to the world 's largest oil trader vitol , but net proceeds from the deal are lower than a previously announced estimate , the company said on monday . in a statement , noble group said net proceeds from the sale of noble americas corp to vitol were estimated at about $ 400 million . in october , hong-kong based noble said gross proceeds from the deal would be about $ 1.42 billion and it expected to make about $ 580 million after repaying loans . ",
        "noble said the lower return on the sale was `` primarily due to operating losses of nac from 1 october 2017 to the closing date . `` the singapore-listed company , which had a market capitalization of $ 6 billion in early february 2015 , was plunged into crisis after a report by blogger iceberg research later that month questioning its accounting . noble stood by its accounts and rejected the report 's allegations but coupled with a major commodities downturn , the firm was unable to recover investor confidence . its market value has shrunk to around $ 200 million as it has progressively sold off large parts of its business to stay afloat . ",
        "noble also sold u. s. gas and power business to mercuria for less than previously announced - $ 168 million compared with $ 250 million . paul brough , a restructuring specialist who oversaw part of the liquidation of lehman brothers , was appointed chairman last year and said he was taking steps to avoid insolvency . the company has also been closing what remains of its global oil trading business , returning to its roots as an asian hard commodities trader .
