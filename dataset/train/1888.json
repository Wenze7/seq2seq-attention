        "right , so this week i tried to kill myself twice . first time was off a bridge but apparently this time of year they keep extra folks out watching for that kind of thing so after a hospital visit with some very chapped lips i got the bright idea to grab an officers gun , point it to my head and tell him exactly what i thought of the corruption , negligence and racism i 've seen daring him to do it in what would have been a really cool punisher speech and moment only to find out he was a traffic cop . ",
        "so yeah i decided it was probably time to take a break , try to get some therapy in . which is weird for me because it will be a first time thing . i was honestly just criticizing jay z a few weeks ago because i felt , ya know dudes like us . from places like marcy or bmore , that have seen or allegedly been participants in what some would call `` dirt '' you 're never supposed to snitch , talk about it , play chatty patty , what went down you have to take to your grave . ",
        "the only accepted answer to `` you alright ? '' is `` yeah i 'm straight '' . it 's a war , and you never get debriefed , no psych eval , group meetings , if you 're lucky enough to get out , you 're just out and the battlefield is your hometown reminding you every day , pedestrian vehicles on the road remind you of enemy combatants , years after you keep your head on a swivel for crown vics , cars riding too slow , and anyone walking like they have something in their waistband . ",
        "there 's almost i guess a form of stockholm syndrome because you always know someone that had and has it worse than you . to that end i never * thought * there was such a thing as working too hard when you 're working for yourself . after all you 're working on what you want to work on and how hard you work is going to show in what you get out of it . i looked at a calendar today and just realized for the exception of my sisters wedding and thanksgiving i worked every day this year . ",
        "sometimes isolated for days whether it was for animations or programming in my games and apps , working on tracks for my music career , it became so common for me to fall asleep on the couch i got one of those fancy neck supporting pillows to put it out there . so common for me to wake up and work i got a laptop for the bedroom . i know a lot of other people that go like this too whether it 's indie devs , other producers , artists , even twitch streamers and youtubers . your work is 100 % of your life . ",
        "a lot of social interaction happens on social media which is n't positive at all for the obvious reasons plus the fact you have to promote , be a living ad , while having reminders of everything you did n't do . `` i did n't do a live video on my midi fighter , i do n't have enough sets livestreamed , enough twitch subscribers , enough soundcloud listeners , more people are buying from that guys bandcamp instead of mine , we need sponsors that will actually work with us instead of trying to get us to trick our fans into fyre festival bullshit , everybody is remixing the hottest tracks before you , this indie game made 15 bajillion dollars and it was made by an irishman in a chinese cave what the fuck are you doing ? ",
        "why ca n't you be the smartest , funniest , most well informed person with purely positive opinions that make everybody feel great and go viral while dropping a new track a week and an app every month while doing daily how-to and review posts to establish yourself as an authority while remembering to take great selfies at every amazing event there is ? '' thursday and friday i did something i have n't done in a while and that 's just sit down with some friends , real friends , not networking friends , internet friends , club friends , and watched supergirl on netflix . ",
        "it 's easy to forget what regular human interaction is like . for my nerd friends all they have is the internet and there 's really no emotion there . even livestreaming , it 's either me talking to and interacting with a camera or typing in a friends room . for my club friends what they mainly have is the club and nobody is honest in the vip section . when i lived in la i used to watch roseanne at the end of the night just to remember what regular people do and talk about . in the weird version of heaven i was in after jumping off that bridge that show was still running . ",
        "just a weird detail i remember . point is both are places where people can seem great the last time you saw them and the next day it 's all coming apart for them . even worse as an artist sometimes somebody gets mad at another artist and puts out that person 's business in the street when they legitimately needed somebody . that makes you far less likely to ever talk about it . odds are your favorite artists are struggling more than their image would lead you to believe . especially when that image has to piss off the haters that want them to fail . ",
        "certain artists are n't doing chrismas tracks because everything is going great . but even with that normal human interaction there 's a problem when everyone just thinks you are playing around on a computer until you get a `` real job '' . and it 's like i 'm sorry i felt the world needed an app to help connect overdosing addicts and people in danger with help , or actually making fun games people can enjoy instead of making ten flappy bird clones with microtransactions , i 'm sorry i 'd rather make music from my soul instead of using the music theory i know as well as marketing trends i know to be a generic sound factory for people too young to know any better then spend the rest of my budget on payola spins and buying journalists . ",
        "as if i 'd * feel * anymore successful if my claim to fame was queen samples and mario pipes . but money is everyone 's barometer for success , and when you 're not working the locks it drives you to work harder , and it can make you kind of a prick . or it can make you question if what you were trying to stand for was worth standing for at all . i 'm not saying this to discourage anyone just to be mindful of themselves . there 's nothing greater to me than when i hear people are either using my apps , playing my games or enjoying my music . ",
        "but like i said i think i 'm going to need to take a break for a bit and pace myself a little better next year . one thing i 've learned through all of this is it 's ok to ask for help . both mentally and professionally . it was kind of an insane thing to do taking on all of this at the same time as well as marketing , managing travel then my major recent points of frustration was realizing i basically could n't solo play every instrument as well as actual rock band session players nor build an open world game on par with gta . ",
        "just remember to pace yourselves and take care of yourselves . i 'll try to do the same .   "
