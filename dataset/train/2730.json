        "when then-oakland assemblywoman march fong eu took a sledgehammer to a porcelain toilet on the steps of the state capitol in 1969 , it was more than the chains around the commode that she was smashing . fong eu , who died thursday at the age of 95 , gained notoriety in that crusade against pay toilets in california . but her career spanned decades in which she shattered barriers -- for women , and particularly for asian american women . fong eu `` was a pioneering woman who helped open doors to public service for more women and asian americans , '' gov. jerry brown said friday . ",
        "she succeeded brown as secretary of state when he became governor in 1975 . `` she was a true trailblazer , from being the first asian american woman elected to the state legislature to serving nearly 20 years as california 's first female secretary of state , '' said alex padilla , california 's current secretary of state . `` she was a champion for transparency and increasing voter access to registration and the ballot box . '' it was a different world for asian american women in 1922 , when fong eu was born in the stanislaus county town of oakdale . ",
        "raised in the back of a chinese laundry in san francisco , she went to high school in richmond , where a guidance counselor told the straight-a student to back off her dream of becoming a teacher because no school district would hire a chinese woman . it was n't much better at home , she said in a 1990 interview with the san francisco examiner . `` my parents had no perception of my possibilities , '' fong eu said . but as she proved in years of political battles , fong eu was n't worried about what other people thought . ",
        "she received her bachelor 's degree from uc berkeley , a masters from mills college and a doctorate in education from stanford university . she worked for years as a dental hygienist and spent three terms on the alameda county board of education before winning an assembly seat from a district that included oakland and castro valley in 1966 . at the time , fong eu , a democrat , was one of only three women in the legislature . from the beginning , fong eu made it clear she was n't willing to sit back and accept business as usual in the legislature . ",
        "in 1967 , she blocked the assembly from adjourning early for the press-legislature golf tournament , an annual -- and all-male -- event that she had been barred from attending . she presented a resolution calling for `` an end to this crass discrimination . '' she received the support of only two men in the 80-member assembly , which referred her resolution to the state commission on the status of women . and the members then headed out to their golf game . fong eu 's signature issue , a statewide ban on pay toilets in public buildings , was also a matter of gender fairness , she said , `` because women must pay twice as often as men . '' ",
        "her sledgehammer assault on the toilet , which attracted attention from news outlets across the nation , also showed fong eu 's political instincts for what would make a good show -- and resonate with voters . despite drawing plenty of ridicule as `` the pay toilet assemblywoman , '' fong eu saw gov. ronald reagan sign the ban in 1974 , just six weeks before voters elected her as secretary of state . she was re-elected four times , resigning in 1994 to become ambassador to micronesia . as the state 's top election official , she pioneered voter registration by mail and added candidate statements to the state ballot pamphlet . ",
        "fong eu also allowed voters to use absentee ballots for any reason , the first step toward the heavy mail-voter turnout now seen in every state election . fong eu 's political career also had it disappointments . in 2002 , she lost an attempt to win back her old post as secretary of state . but even more jarring was her decision to drop out of the 1988 u. s. senate race after her husband , singapore businessman henry eu , refused to release the family financial information required of every candidate . `` i am , to a significant degree , forced to choose between my marriage and my candidacy for the senate , '' she told the chronicle at the time . ",
        "`` put to such a choice , there is not contest . '' in 1998 , fong eu backed away from her democratic roots to support her son , republican state treasurer matt fong , in his losing race against democratic sen. barbara boxer . matt fong died of cancer in 2011 . fong eu was pleased with her place as a role model for women and asian americans . but she also had pride in her legacy as a lifelong public servant . `` people percent me as a non-politician , which is good , '' she told the examiner in 1990 . ",
        "`` i would say people know i 'm honest and have their trust . '' fong eu lived in recent years in orange county . no information about services has been released . john wildermuth is a san francisco chronicle staff writer . email : jwildermuth@sfchronicle . com twitter : @jfwildermuth .
