        "kemba walker is available , and the pistons are interested . could they acquire him before the feb. . 8 trade deadline ? they `` certainly will look at it , '' the free press reported on friday afternoon . `` as always in hearing things , question is what would it take to get it done . what 's their ask ? '' espn reported on friday morning that the hornets are open to trading walker in an effort to hit the reset button : . `` charlotte has been encouraging teams to make offers and appears eager to discuss attaching walker to a larger trade in which another team would take on one of the hornets ' several far-less-desirable contracts . '' ",
        "per espn , the hornets are looking for a `` good , young player or a first-round draft pick '' in any trade involving walker . the pistons are believed to be pursuing a point guard to compensate for the loss of reggie jackson , who 's sidelined for at least another month with a sprained ankle . detroit is 3-7 in his absence and has slipped to ninth in the east after a 14-6 start . any package for walker would likely include jackson . the 27-year-old walker , an all-star last season , is having another strong year . ",
        "he 's averaging 21.7 points and 5.8 rebounds and shooting about 35 percent from three . he 's due $ 12 million per year through the 2018-19 season . the hornets are trying to shed the contracts of the likes of nicolas batum , dwight howard , marvin williams and michael kidd-gilchrist . given the pistons ' bloated payroll , a third team would likely have to be involved in any trade bringing walker to detroit .
