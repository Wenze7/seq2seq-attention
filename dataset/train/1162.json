        "after sparkling against spartak , anfield 's finest struggled against mediocre everton and west brom , but at least they can count on mohamed salahpaul wilsonliverpool are starting to do the mid-season disappointment thing all over again . they hit a fantastic high with seven goals against spartak moscow , only to be held by everton in the next game and then by west brom three days later . both those drawn games were at home , both were against opponents who had struggled to the extent of changing their manager , and both looked like straightforward routes to three points on paper . ",
        "except liverpool -- and this is a pattern that has established itself over a longer period than a single season -- tend not to do things that way . `` nine days ago we were flying , '' jürgen klopp says , revisiting a theme he has explored several times before . `` now i see from your expressions we have problems once again . '' related : chelsea did not give mohamed salah his chance to make it , claims eden hazardthe liverpool manager understands criticism and a level of despondency are bound to follow two underwhelming performances -- `` that is normal , '' he says -- but before his side can take on arsenal on friday , the sort of test that normally brings out the best in his players , they have sunday 's visit to bournemouth . ",
        "there is scarcely any need to point out this is exactly the sort of fixture liverpool supporters have learned to approach with trepidation , since klopp 's side managed to lose it 4-3 just over a year ago after leading 2-0 and 3-1 . `` a club like liverpool has to win games on an average day , '' klopp says . `` i do n't think there is too much expectation surrounding the team . i think people should expect us to be good , they really should . and we were good against everton , we were just unlucky with the penalty . ",
        "west brom was different , we did not deserve to win and we have to accept it . `` those games are over and we can not get the points back but in football you can not take offensive fluency for granted . look at manchester city . they are a fantastic team playing fantastic football but they do n't always win 4-0 . in a couple of previous games they had to work hard for 2-1 wins with goals in the last seconds . that 's what football is like . `` you put in the work behind the scenes and hope it comes out in the games . ",
        "sometimes is does , sometimes it does n't . winning 7-0 against spartak might have looked like a 90-minute holiday but there was crazy pressure on us during the preparation . two games later we are not playing all that well but i can not judge the season on two games . we have to be ready to show we are in a good moment at bournemouth . '' city running away with the league is not helping klopp 's situation . every other manager is in the same boat but this is klopp 's third season at a club with a passionate desire to end a 27-year wait for a title , and each time he has seen a different rival build up an unstoppable momentum at the top of the table . ",
        "each breakaway since leicester has been stronger than the last , though klopp does not believe he has been unlucky . `` i think all the three teams deserved their success and it shows this is a league where you can make it happen for yourself , '' he says . `` i 'm not the kind of guy who is disappointed because it always happens to other teams . it only shows me it is obviously possible so you should try to do it by yourself . '' at least liverpool , up and down as they are , can rely on one performer to be consistent and influential . ",
        "mohamed salah has emerged as the star of the first half of their season , and despite not being signed or deployed as an out‑and-out striker the egyptian has been hitting the target more regularly than harry kane , sergio agüero and romelu lukaku . mo went to italy to prove himself . that is another difficult league for a forward but he did welljürgen klopp `` we were in the market for a very offensive-minded midfielder who can play as a striker if necessary but also has the ability to make and set up goals , '' klopp says of the player signed from roma for an initial € 40m . ",
        "`` that was the package we wanted and the scouting department did a fantastic job because that 's what we got . there were a few questions raised because mo had played in the premier league before and had to leave to get opportunities but the scouts did n't get out of our ears . they were sure , they were 100 % . he was ready and that 's how it looks now . '' klopp feels salah was young and not fully developed when he joined chelsea , where he found first-team opportunities hard to come by . ",
        "`` he was just a kid , '' he says . `` we all need confidence , especially a young player in a foreign league that 's very strong and demanding . `` chelsea had a fantastic team at the time , there was no one to blame , but the important thing is that mo did not start to think he might not be good enough . he went to italy to prove himself . that is another difficult league for a striker but he did well and proved everything . `` we watched him in a lot of games to make sure he was sturdy enough for the premier league ; if you watch him only on television he looks quite skinny , but as you can see he is now ready . ",
        "he still misses chances , he does not have a 100 % strike rate , but he now has much more composure in front of goal . we are really happy we could convince him to come here . ''   "
