        "nashville , tenn. . -- the tennessee titans hired houston defensive coordinator mike vrabel as their new coach in a fast search that wrapped up after three interviews and just five days after firing mike mularkey . the titans announced saturday they have agreed to terms with vrabel . a news conference was scheduled for monday . vrabel was the first person tennessee interviewed after firing mularkey on monday . mularkey , who also coached buffalo and jacksonville , went 21-22 and led the franchise to its first playoff victory in 14 years . this will be vrabel 's first head coaching job after 18 years in the nfl -- 14 as a player and four as a coach . ",
        "titans owner amy adams strunk said in a statement it was easy to see vrabel 's commanding presence and relationship with general manager jon robinson . the gm got his start in the nfl as a scout with the new england patriots , where vrabel won three super bowls as a linebacker . `` mike has a commanding presence and a deep understanding for how he will attack this head coaching opportunity , '' strunk said . `` throughout his football career , he has played for , been mentored by and coached with successful teams and organizations . he knows what it takes to reach that level of sustained success -- he has seen it firsthand . ",
        "we have a chance to build on the solid foundation that we established over the past couple of years and i believe mike is the right person to continue that progress . `` tennessee also interviewed carolina defensive coordinator steve wilks -- who satisfied the rooney rule requiring teams to interview at least one minority candidate -- and los angeles rams offensive coordinator matt lafleur . in a statement , vrabel thanked strunk , robinson and the titans for putting their faith in him . `` we want to build a culture around winning , competitiveness and toughness , '' vrabel said . ",
        "`` everything we do is going to be geared toward winning and being physical . we want to prepare our players so they know what to do , which will allow them to play fast and aggressive . `` the 42-year-old vrabel is coming off his first season as defensive coordinator for the texans . vrabel 's 14-year career as a player included stints with pittsburgh under coach bill cowher and new england under coach bill belichick , along with kansas city . in 2011 , he joined the staff at his alma mater , ohio state , coaching linebackers and defensive linemen . ",
        "vrabel went to houston in 2014 and coached linebackers with the texans for three seasons before becoming coordinator . the texans won the afc south in 2015 and 2016 thanks in part to strong defenses . the unit slipped this season amid injuries to players including j. j. watt and whitney mercilus . this was the first head coaching search since robinson was hired in january 2016 , two days before the titans took the interim tag off mularkey . robinson said in a statement he always has had a great deal of respect for vrabel as a player and as a coach . ",
        "`` he was the ultimate team-first player , and he embodies that same mindset as a coach , '' robinson said . `` he is intelligent , energetic , detailed and a leader whose deep passion for this game will resonate with our players . as a coach , i have seen him develop talent at both the college and nfl level , and put players in position for them to be successful .
