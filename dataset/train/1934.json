        "hi guys . this will be quick but important . that 's truly the number one tip to change your life perspective and how you approach your everyday life . this one technique is to think about your own death . yes morbid and scary but let me explain : write your own eulogy : write it exactly as you would like . without any suggestions from your spouse or friends . think what would the little girl , your grand , grand daughter say . do n't worry about the money . you will be dead by then . ",
        "do n't worry about your work related stuff . again six feet underground . it 's really eye-opening to think about actual human legacy you 've made . think about what you were like . always working without a time for family ? constantly tired , alone and miserable ? have you been a good father ? have you helped others ? were you mean ? did you change the world like you dreamed of ? have others asked you for advice nearly every day ? have you lived the life to the fullest ? that 's the legacy you want to leave ? ",
        "no it 's not . each one will be different but in everyone we will see that we all want to be loved . of course we want money and nice car or a house by the beach . but when you think about more important components of life , then the most important think would be how you behaved . how did you spend time with the loved ones . will they remember you ? think , and write . you want to be funny , candid and open , cheerful 24/7 , have a lot of time for family . ",
        "love the world and the world loving you . so i have to ask you . if this is your ultimate goal , mit of all mit 's cause it 's the last goal you will accomplish . then why the hell you are not growing and acting to make it happen ? read once more what you 've written . you will notice trends there . combine them . write in one sentence . write it then on your journal , wall even tattoo it on your wrist to see every day . does n't matter but you have to see it daily . ",
        "every damn day . by this you will constantly act to achieve the life your granddaughter , yes that little ginger girl with freckles and big glasses would be proud of and have tears in her eyes because of your loss . simple , harsh yet powerful and ultimate . this is the most important productivity advice ever . for me my sentence is : love them , help them , grow with them ! never give up ! you have one life and one family . be proud of it and leave the best legacy ever . much love .
