        "everton manager sam allardyce accused his outfield players of throwing in the towel during saturday 's 4-0 hammering at tottenham . the toffees gave a decent account of themselves in the first half and created enough to go into the break level after son heung-min 's opener in the 26th minute gave spurs the lead . harry kane then netted spurs ' second right after the interval and allardyce believed that to be `` the killer '' , before the england star added another just prior to the hour mark and christian eriksen wrapped things up late on . although spurs produced a commanding performance at wembley in the premier league clash , allardyce felt that everton aided their victory by giving up , suggesting that only goalkeeper jordan pickford played to his usual level . ",
        "speaking to bt sport , allardyce said : `` i think we thought the second goal was offside , i think the same with wayne 's -- just . pic . twitter . com/zaamiugp1z . -- everton january 13 , 2018 . `` when the second went in , that was the killer , but it does n't allow us to throw the towel in for me . `` too many of our players just decided not to defend anymore when tottenham had the ball . `` but for jordan pickford it would have been more . i 'm hugely disappointed with the professionalism of my players . ",
        "`` it was probably what was apparent before i got here and i 've got to cut it out , and cut it out starting tomorrow . `` i think we 're lacking in our physical abilities . we have n't got a lot of pace in the side . `` tottenham are capable of scoring a lot of goals against anybody , but certainly they should have had to work a lot harder than they did . '' one player who would certainly add pace to the team is arsenal forward theo walcott and everton are interested in signing him , but allardyce is awaiting updates from the club . ",
        "`` i do n't know at the moment , '' allardyce said . `` i will have to see tonight or tomorrow what the situation is . ''   "
