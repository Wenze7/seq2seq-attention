        "chief justice of india dipak misra on wednesday recused himself from hearing the aircel-maxis case , reported ani . misra sent the case to another supreme court bench hearing the 2g ` scam ' case . according to ani , the supreme court directed the enforcement directorate and the cbi to file a status report by 23 january in connection with investigations pending in the aircel-maxis deal case . the supreme court last week had directed the centre to file a status report on the probe conducted by enforcement directorate officer rajeshwar singh in the case . the apex court had said the centre should apprise it about the stage of the pending investigation in the case and what needed to be done . ",
        "additional solicitor general tushar mehta , appearing for the central bureau of investigation , had told the court last week that he would file a summary with regard to what has happened till now in the case and had sought 10 days time . on 15 december , last year , the top court had asked the cbi , the ed and the special public prosecutor appointed by it in the 2g spectrum ` scam ' case to file a status report . on 1 november , the apex court had restrained the government from taking any immediate action against rajeshwar singh , probing the multi-crore rupee aircel-maxis deal case and the 2g spectrum ` scam ' , following some anonymous complaints against him . ",
        "the court 's direction had come after singh alleged there was a `` conspiracy '' behind filing of `` frivolous anonymous complaints '' against him with the revenue secretary saying these were being entertained by the ed . he had said that such complaints were filed after the attachment of assets worth rs 1.16 crore allegedly of the accused in the aircel-maxis case . the name of the accused in the case was not taken by singh 's counsel . in september 2017 , the ed had reportedly attached assets worth rs 1.16 crore of karti chidambaram , son of former finance minister p chidambaram , and a firm allegedly linked to him in connection with its money laundering probe in connection with the deal . ",
        "the court had issued notice to the cbi , the ed and the department of telecom and sought their response . singh had told the court that it should direct a cbi probe into the alleged conspiracy of filing of complaints or for relieving him from the investigation into the 2g ` scam ' case .
