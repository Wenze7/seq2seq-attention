        "new zealanders who think selling golliwogs is ok `` need a wake-up call '' , the human rights commission says . a waiheke island gift shop-owner faced backlash at the weekend after claiming golliwog dolls she sells are an `` english thing '' and are n't racist . kat , who declined to give her last name , told stuff `` you have to be quick to explain to black americans '' . `` you just see the look on their faces and i get in quick and tell them they 're not what you think , '' she said .

        "read more : * store criticised for selling ` gollies ' human rights commission spokeswoman christine ammunson challenged this , saying golliwogs were `` racist caricatures that dehumanise black people '' . golliwog dolls were created in the united states in the `` jim crow era of racial segregation , '' ammunson said . `` they 're not harmless dolls and never have been . '' golliwogs are made from black fabric , and have black eyes bordered with white , red lips , white teeth , `` frizzy '' hair and minstrel dress . americans used ` black face ' to mock people of african descent . ",
        "a golliwog is an intentional caricature of black face . that is why they are racist . pic . twitter . com/emjviy1psq -- kenny williams january 6 , 2018 the dolls ' creator , florence kate upton , based the design on a black minstrel doll she played with in her childhood home in new york . minstrelsy was an american form of entertainment developed in the early 19th century which featured comic skits , music and dancing to mock people of african descent . minstrel shows were largely performed by white americans in blackface makeup . kat , who owns escapade boutique , said she tells concerned customers a different version of the dolls ' origins . ",
        "`` they started off as talismans in england . they were based off chimney sweeps and chimney sweeps were actually white people , '' she said . `` as far as i 'm concerned society has just gotten far too pc '' kat said , and believed there were `` more important things for people to get offended about '' . instead of trying to ` educate ' her african-america visitors `` this store owner could have learned a lot from them '' , ammunson said on sunday . the story , originally published on stuff on saturday , divided opinion among readers . ",
        "some responded on facebook saying golliwogs were `` gorgeous '' reminders of their childhoods . `` these dolls are part of many children 's childhood and i for one never viewed them as anything but a doll . they were never inferior to any other toy , just part of the collection . erasing them from history is such a terrible idea , in the same way that removing statues of southern generals is . we should embrace all history in order to learn from it , '' a reader said . `` good on ya , political correctness has gone mad , '' another said . ",
        "others said they saw no difference between golliwogs and dolls - such as barbie - which come in different skin-tones . however , others were outraged - with one commenting the sale of golliwogs confirms `` racism is alive and well in new zealand '' . `` of course they are racist . they are and were mocking black people , not based on white chimney sweeps . how ignorant , '' a reader said . `` it does n't matter if you collected them as a kid , they 're mocking a large group of people and they are offended by it , '' said another .
