        "maro itoje knows that alun wyn jones will want to get up close and personal when saracens take on ospreys in a crunch clash on saturday night . the battle between one of the outstanding forwards in rugby and the 113-cap wales international will be key in this european champions cup pool match at swansea 's liberty stadium . the players got to know each other well as room-mates on last summer 's lions tour to new zealand , starting the final two tests of the drawn series as the second-row partnership . that meant the pair frequently bound onto each other before each scrum but it was jones 's love of cuddles off the pitch that bemused itoje . ",
        "vunipola putting recovery on ice after making saracens comeback the 23-year-old lock explained : `` alun wyn is a really nice guy and i roomed with him on tour and he has an unbelievable work ethic . but he is probably too affectionate off the pitch and likes cuddles a bit too much and i am not as touchy and feely as him . i have played against him a few times and you can guarantee he is going to work hard and will push you . it is a challenge i am looking forward to facing . '' defeat tomorrow would leave saracens in serious danger of missing out on the quarter-finals with only one game of the pool stages remaining . ",
        "as there is so much on the line , itoje is playing with four metal plates in the jaw he broke last month and he will be put under pressure with jones aiming to dominate him . itoje came through his first game in a month last week , helping sarries defeat wasps and is confident of handling anything that jones and his fellow ospreys , including lions rhys webb , dan biggar and justin tipuric , throw at him . is he concerned about being tackled or targeted by the opposition who know all about his broken jaw ? ",
        "`` if you are thinking like that then you should n't be playing , '' added itoje . `` fortunately , i did n't feel like that and was fit to go last weekend . '' itoje and billy vunipola returned from injury against wasps and another key weapon in the sarries armoury is back for the ospreys game , with lion and wales wing liam williams having recovered from the groin injury he suffered in the autumn tests . marcus smith , who has signed a new contract with harlequins , is being rested by the club for tomorrow 's champions cup home game with wasps . ",
        "quins are conscious of the workload they have put on the 18-year-old and with the club having failed to win any of their pool games , he drops down to the bench .   "
