        "two us astronauts floated outside the international space station on tuesday to start a new round of repairs on the orbiting outpost 's aging robotic arm , nasa said . the spacewalk began at 6:49 am when nasa flight engineers mark vande hei and scott tingle switched their spacesuits to internal battery power , then made their way outside the airlock and into the vacuum of space . the goal of the six-and-a-half-hour spacewalk is to replace a spare latching end on the 57-foot canadian-made robotic arm , called canadarm2.the arm is used to grasp incoming cargo ships and to move items around outside the space lab . ",
        "the station 's robotic arm `` has experienced some degradation of its snaring cables , '' nasa said in a statement . the arm has been a key piece of equipment at the orbiting outpost for 17 years , but in august it lost its ability to grip effectively . in october 2017 , nasa astronauts completed three spacewalks to repair the robotic arm and replace cameras necessary to get a good view of the approaching cargo ships . tuesday 's outing was the first career spacewalk for tingle , and the third for vande hei . another spacewalk is planned for january 29 , including vande hei and flight engineer norishige kanai of the japan aerospace exploration agency , to continue the repair work .
