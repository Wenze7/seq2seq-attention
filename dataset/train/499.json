        "president trump attacked the national security agency 's surveillance powers in a thursday morning tweetstorm that came just hours before the house was set to vote on the reauthorization of a package of mass-surveillance activities known as section 702 of the foreign intelligence surveillance act . his intervention is in direct contradiction to his administration 's stated aim of reauthorizing the program . on wednesday night , a white house statement urged congress to preserve fisa powers . yet trump apparently took to his phone just a few hours later , writing , `` ` house votes on controversial fisa act today . ' ",
        "this is the act that may have been used , with the help of the discredited and phony dossier , to so badly surveil and abuse the trump campaign by the previous administration and others ? '' later , to the confusion of everyone who read the first tweet , trump added : `` with that being said , i have personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office and today 's vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land . we need it ! get smart ! ''   "
