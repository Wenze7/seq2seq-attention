'' johnson , the chair of the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee , also said that the panel has `` an informant that 's talking about a group that was holding secret meetings offsite . '' ",
        "the senator refused to identify the informant when asked for details , saying , `` i 'm not going to get into at all where we are getting this information . we protect our sources . '' he added , `` i do n't want to give any indication , because we are dealing with the world 's premier investigative agency here , and people that come forward to us fear retaliation . that 's true throughout government . people fear retaliation within government agencies , it 's rampant , and particularly within the fbi .
