        "accepting you ca n't change someone else is something most of us are n't good at . i for one hate that i ca n't make people do what i want . i struggle with this feeling daily . `` if only they would listen to me , if only they would do what i said '' . jesus probably felt the same way . humans do what we want . we make our own choices , and most of us ca n't handle the consequences , but we do it anyways . this is especially frustrating when it comes to loved ones . ",
        "watching someone hurt themselves , whether its through poor relationship choices or poor health choices is very disheartening . and no matter how much we plead , cajole , beg , or yell , its up to the person to do what they want or need to do . and we just have to accept it , right ? maybe . maybe on some things we have to accept it . we have to let the person go and love them anyways and hope that they will figure it out . but if you have a parent that needs to make better choices , there are some things that can be done to help them . ",
        "1 . make it their ideano matter how old you are , in the eyes of your parental units you are still a child , and they know more than you . you will discover this the first time you hear them say `` well dr. oz said that blah blah blah '' and you want to bang your head against the wall cause you 've been telling them that for years . but it took dr. oz saying it for them to listen . if you want them to do something , use the same tactics they used on you as a teenager - make it their idea . ",
        "slip the information in as a ` so i saw on oprah that ... '' or `` you know mr. smith down the street has been doing ... '' . expose them to the information without having it come from you . the minute we start saying things a wall is going to go up , whether they know they are doing it or not . that wall exists from years of the way we communicate as parent/child , and unfortunately it takes years of practice before we learn how to communicate any differently . do n't get frustrated with this . ",
        "get smart . 2 . guide them with the right information that comes from other sources this piggy backs on number one . leave the article you want them to read casually on the counter top when you are visiting them . find a documentary and watch it while they are around and get the conversation started . but have it as conversation only - not a pointed `` this is how you should be doing this '' . pick up pamphlets from your doctor 's office , or print things out from the internet . but avoid the `` here you should read this '' pushiness . ",
        "just make the information available . pique their curiosity and fingers crossed you can start a dialogue . then-3 . help make the changes easyit may not be that they are resisting change for changes sake , it may very well be that they are afraid of change , or that acknowledging the change makes them acknowledge their age or their health conditions , and that 's scary . so if they are at a point where they need or want to make changes but have n't yet , find ways to make the changes as easy as possible . ",
        "do they need to start exercising because of a health condition ? there are tons of free classes and programs they can sign up for to get them started . go with them the first time , or run through some exercises at home . are they home bound ? check out the hundreds of thousands of free videos on youtube . do n't live near them ? no tv ? find a college kid who might be willing to head over to their house a couple of times a week to get them exercising . most larger colleges have exercise science or kinesiology programs and these kids are looking for experience in the field . ",
        "you can pay them rather inexpensively - $ 12 to $ 14 an hour , and you can provide them with programming they can follow off the internet . if it 's their diet they need to change , before you tell them what they ca n't eat anymore , have alternatives that they can eat . type 2 diabetic ? so they give up lots of bread , but they can make paleo options that are delicious and low carb . heart disease ? the doctor wants them to give up saturated fat - they can still eat turkey bacon , low fat cheese , and veggies with low fat ranch . ",
        "yes , the planning might be more work for you . but in the end if you have a plan , and one prepared before you talk to them , then their level of resistance to change will be lower and it will potentially prevent or diminish the arguments you could get into . your goal is to make it as easy as possible . 4 . set them up for successthis goes along with make the choices easy . if their world has just been flipped upside down because of a health diagnosis , or you see they need to make choices to prevent an issue , set them up for success . ",
        "remember the last time you decided on january 1st that you were going to change everything ? all at once ? you were going to get up at 5 am , run 3 miles , drink your kale smoothie , stretch , not drink alcohol , avoid sugar , not watch tv ... . remember how long that lasted ? unless you have superhuman powers its almost impossible to make a whole bunch of habit changes at once , because it requires so much willpower we literally become exhausted by the efforts . which means if your parents need to make a whole bunch of changes , set them up for success . ",
        "pick one thing they need to change - ideally the thing that will have the most positive impact on their health , and focus on helping them change that one thing . then once that is a new habit , you can make other changes . if they have severe gastric upset / heart burn , see if you can narrow it down to the highest culprit food and then , building off number 3 , before you tell them they should stop eating it , have an alternative ready ! have them make one food change , then build . ",
        "taking away every food that they love in one foul swoop might crush their souls . if they need to start exercising , get them moving for 5 minutes 3 to 4 days a week . start small , and make it easy . then build . 5 . do n't be unrealisticmost of us wo n't get our parents to make every change we want them to , or think that they should . be happy if you can get them to adopt 30 to 40 percent of the changes they need to live healthier . there is a reason they say `` you ca n't teach an old dog new tricks '' - it 's not that they ca n't or wo n't learn , it 's that their behaviors are so ingrained into who they are its really hard to change . ",
        "they also might not care about it as much as we do . we may think using splenda is paramount to drinking chemicals , but they just might want something sweet and have to manage their blood sugar ... . the way their doctor told them they should . if you 've ever gotten overwhelmed with all of the health information out there , can you imagine what it would be like if you had twice as much information ?   ",
        "our parents have gone through : low fat , high carb ; high fat , low carb ; fake butter , real butter , eat eggs , do n't eat eggs , eat red meat , do n't eat red meat , drink the diet soda , diet soda will kill you , eat the cheese , do n't eat the cheese , get walking , lift weights , run , do n't run , stretch , do n't stretch , drink wine , do n't drink wine , take advil , do n't take advil ... and believe it or not i could keep going .",
        "most of them just want to be able to live out their lives in peace feeling moderately good . they 've lived through a time when modern medicine was the answer for everything , and now we are coming back to a place where not only does medicine have its limits , it may in some cases be doing more harm then good . so be patient with them . i know it 's hard , and frustrating , and can be discouraging . my goals with my parents are simple : i would like them to stretch occasionally , practice their balance regularly , walk some , do some weight lifting occasionally , eat their vegetables , and avoid as much processed crap as possible . ",
        "if i can get them to do 50 percent of that , i will be happy . because it is n't my life to live , it 's theirs . and as much as we care about them and want the best for them , they get to do what makes them happy . let me know what you think about this in the comments below , and feel free to add what has worked for you when helping your parents with their health ! call to actionlike this article ? want to receive more just like it ? sign up for our weekly email and be the first to receive the newest health , wellness , exercise , and rehab related articles from shawnanorton .
