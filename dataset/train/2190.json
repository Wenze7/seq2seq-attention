",
        "a former police officer , actor and pilot , perez leaped into the spotlight in june , when he stole a helicopter and used it to lob grenades and fire at government buildings in caracas . nobody was killed in the attack . perez , 36 , had been a fugitive ever since , periodically posting videos and calling upon venezuelans to take to the streets against what he called president nicolas maduro 's tyrannical government . perez early monday posted videos of himself -- blood dripping across his face -- holed up in a house under fire . perez shouted that the group wished to surrender , but that the police outside were set on killing them . ",
        "`` i want to ask venezuela not to lose heart -- fight , take to the streets , '' he said . `` it is time for us to be free , and only you have the power now . `` reverol said that troops arrested another six people identified as members , collaborators and financiers of the group . they also confiscated rifles , military uniforms , ammunition and smoke grenades .
