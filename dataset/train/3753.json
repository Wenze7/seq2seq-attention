        "los angeles -- after lamenting the turnovers that put them in an early hole , the mistakes that short-circuited key drives and the time of possession deficit that made it difficult to get in a rhythm , rams quarterback jared goff pondered the obvious question looming over his team 's early playoff flameout . did the rams ' playoff inexperience contribute to them falling flat on a night when they had a golden opportunity win over a market that has been slow to embrace them ? `` playoff inexperience , i do n't really understand what that means , '' goff said . '' ",
        "i think each game is the same . this one has a little more meaning to it of course , but we just did not play well . `` credit goff for not using the rams ' youth as an excuse for saturday night 's error-filled 26-13 home loss to the reigning nfc champion atlanta falcons , but perhaps he 'll feel differently with the benefit of a few years hindsight . because there were plenty of times when the rams looked like a team with a 31-year-old rookie head coach , a 23-year-old quarterback and a locker room with by far the least postseason experience of any of the nfl 's 12 playoff teams . ",
        "two turnovers , five penalties and a slew of dropped passes and errant throws contributed to the rams squandering their chance to build on the good feelings they fostered this season . they bounced back from last year 's nightmarish 4-12 debut season in los angeles to win the nfc west behind a youthful , star-laden offense headlined by a blossoming goff and a resurgent todd gurley . with the dodgers not making a big splash in free agency this offseason , the lakers staggering through another lottery-bound season and the chargers , usc and ucla football all sitting home , the rams had the los angeles spotlight all to themselves for however long their playoff run lasted . ",
        "this was their biggest , loudest crowd of the season at the coliseum on saturday night , and they wasted it in a hail of uncharacteristic mistakes . `` it 's frustrating because this team was good enough to really beat anybody , '' offensive tackle andrew whitworth said . `` we could n't seem to find a way to get the first down to get us rolling . `` the rams dug themselves a 13-0 early hole thanks largely to a pair of costly blunders by their all-pro return man . twenty-two-year-old pharoh cooper gifted atlanta 10 first-half points when he mishandled a punt midway through the first quarter and fumbled a kickoff return minutes later . ",
        "cooper said his mistake on the botched punt return was not shouting `` poison '' to alert his teammates to get out of the way of the ball . as a result , matt bosher 's punt hit blake countess ' foot and caromed off cooper , touching off a mad scramble for the ball that ended with falcons linebacker laroy reynolds recovering it at the rams ' 17-yard line . a determined stand from the rams defense managed to hold atlanta to a field goal , but they could not repeat the feat a few minutes later when damontae kazee stripped the ball from cooper as he returned a kickoff . ",
        "that set up a four-yard touchdown run by devonta freeman , putting atlanta ahead by two scores and leaving the towel-waving pro-rams crowd at the coliseum nearly silent . `` i had a bad game today , '' cooper said . `` i take full responsibility for it . you 've always got to protect the ball , and i did n't do a good job of that tonight . `` the rams might not have been so far behind if goff had gotten off to a better start . the most significant postseason games goff had played before saturday night came back in high school , and the falcons defense proved tougher to solve than mighty cardinal newman did . ",
        "with the falcons frequently loading the box with eight or nine defenders to make it difficult for todd gurley to beat them on the ground , the onus fell to goff make them pay through the air . the second-year quarterback floundered during a tentative first quarter , completing only 1 of 5 passes for three yards partially because the falcons ' corners were able to blanket the rams ' receivers and partially because he was holding the ball in the pocket far too long . goff did catch fire late in the second quarter , hitting cooper kupp for a touchdown pass that trimmed atlanta 's lead to six and then leading an effective two-minute drill before halftime that ended with a field goal . ",
        "as a result , the rams jogged off the field with the fervent belief that the league 's highest-scoring offense was set to explode in the second half . `` we felt good , '' goff said . `` we felt real good . we had a little bit of momentum there . `` what happened instead was the rams high-powered offense could n't get back on the field . freeman and tevin coleman ran the ball over and over again on two long third-quarter drives that ended with field goals , and a tiring rams defense playing without injured defensive lineman michael brockers could n't get off the field . ",
        "atlanta ran the ball more than twice as many times as the rams and held an advantage in time of possession by more than 15 minutes . they all but put away the game in the fourth quarter on a matt ryan touchdown pass to julio jones that made the score 26-13 with seven minutes left to play . `` they did what they were supposed to do when they got up , '' rams wide receiver robert woods said . `` they ran the ball and kept the lead . we had some good drives , but we have to finish drives with touchdowns . ",
        "no matter how long they held the ball , they were n't getting touchdowns , but neither were we . ''   "
