        "story highlightsx-rays showed hidden needles and drugs both swallowed and inserted in body cavities . a full-body scanner at the greene county jail has already proved itself since it went into operation in late september , said maj. kirk keller , the jail administrator . `` the amount of drugs that people were attempting to bring in has been effectively reduced , '' he said `` it has identified drugs -- drugs either in or on their body . so it 's been a great asset for us trying to keep the inmates safe . '' keller said more than a dozen scans have identified contraband on people , including needles and drugs both swallowed and inserted in rectums , but fewer people are attempting to smuggle because of the machine . ",
        "`` the numbers of positive scans that we 're currently getting are declining because they became aware we had this system , '' he said . `` many of them have ceased trying to bring drugs in . '' pat-downs were the most thorough search a county officer could conduct before the scanners were approved , keller said . ohio law prohibits pre-sentencing facilities like the county jails from performing strip searches without probable cause . `` the scanner permits a non-intrusive measure to allow us to see if there is something in or on a person that a pat-down might miss , '' he said . ",
        "montgomery county installed a new machine that will go into service as soon as it is certified by the ohio department of health . the cost of the systems has dropped in half over the last couple of years -- now about $ 120,000 -- making them more affordable for counties . butler and miami counties also added jail scanners during the past year . warren county is holding off on a scanner until construction of a new $ 50 million jail planned for 2020 .
