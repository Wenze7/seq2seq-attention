        "with the ever-growing influx of transplants coming to houston and falling in love with the area , many of them are wondering just when they can officially call themselves houstonians . and yes , it 's always been houstonian . it 's never been houstonite , which sounds like an exotic element that would power a spaceship . put your h 's up ! : things all houstonians have said at one time or anotherit 's not just about finding a place to live , settling on a neighborhood bar , weathering your first flood , or buying an astros hat . ",
        "a lot of being a houstonian is getting used to things like bad traffic , relaxed zoning laws , and professional sports heartbreak - and constant butt sweat from may until september . constant butt sweat would make a great band name , by the way . yes , being a houstonian is also being willing to accept the things you can not change but also having enough hope and drive to want to improve your surroundings . flashback : what did houston look like in 1997 ? most importantly , it 's about embracing the city in all its undeniable beauty , like the sunset heading west on i-10 during the early evening , or how five barbacoa tacos from your favorite taco place seem to smile back at you from the styrofoam plate upon which they sit . ",
        "so if you achieve everything we 've listed in the slideshow above , you just might become a houstonian . remember to politely nod and smile when one of us natives goes on and on about how awesome summers at astroworld were or waxes nostalgic about how much better used to be before everyone moved here . craig hlavaty is a reporter for chron . com and houstonchronicle . com . he 's an intolerable native texan with too much ink in his skin and too much brisket stuck in his teeth .
