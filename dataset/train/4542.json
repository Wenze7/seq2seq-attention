        "a conversation with an emotionally dependent personvictor ca n't get over alex. vic sent him cute messages , but alex tries to break everything that comes along his way . victor needs to realize that he only needs himself , even though it 's hard to let go without answering the questions his heart has . although , victor still has a lot to say . i 've been through this already . it 's like the same song on repeat . i say something , you say you do n't want me . i try to understand , you keep biting me . ",
        "you keep hurting me . it 's hard for me to stop caring about what you say . these past few months i 've been going through memories . i tried to rebuild things , fix broken pieces and eat . tried to be healthy and constructively manage my soul . the water that falls from the same tap keeps reminding me i am a desert without you . at first i thought i could live without it , but november arrived , and the autumn told me death was nearby . water or food . nothing could improve me , nothing could feed me . ",
        "only you could save me , if you stop eating me . i called you , i texted you , still got the same message . look for another one better than me , you deserve better , that 's what you 'd say . how hard is it to tell the truth ? i know you do n't want to hurt me with the aftermath of your lips moving . your tongue pulls out those words that hurt me deep inside , hitting on my cheeks , like with your lips once you did . protecting me with the `` 75 semi-automatic hurting me pistol '' . ",
        "by the way , that 's how i named your gun . december tried to knock me down . it 's like the end of the year brought the beginning of a decay . my soul , my heart , my brain and you ripped my guts out . i was on the floor , right here , where i am writing this right now . i pulled my phone out and texted you and received the same message again . but this time it was worst . it took you too long to decide that i deserved this song called new rules by dua lipa , i guess . ",
        "i was n't ready , i only sent you flowers and you paid me back with the hurting . i listened to that song , but i really could n't find a connection to the one i sent you few nights before . body smile by dvsn , that was my song , i remember . then i told you it was mean . however you told me you did n't know what to say . but do i deserve to know the truth ? do i deserve to know you do n't love me and you 'll keep kicking me out ? ",
        "do i deserve to know i am foolish for thinking i can keep you by my side ? just lie to me . so i can move on . you said i did n't nothing bad to you . then how come you keep pulling the knife out ? i just told you i needed you to listen to me . i needed you . but i guess you just can tear it down for me . we say soft , tender is for the meatthat 's exactly what you said , i keep recalling it . the funny thing is sometimes i feel like i am the meat . ",
        "you 're cutting this steak with dishonesty and not with your teeth . if i want you to hurt me , please let it be with a kiss , do n't let me fall at your feet . i told you i just needed you to be tender . but i guess you 're not meat , and you keep treating me like i do n't exist .   "
