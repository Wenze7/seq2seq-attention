        "the past month in major league baseball was dominated by the shohei ohtani and giancarlo stanton sweepstakes . now that those are over , it looks like the mlb offseason has turned collective attentions to orioles superstar manny machado . plenty of teams have shown interest in trading for the orioles third base stud . one team that seems to be constantly in the mix for everyone is the chicago cubs , who may have a more solid case for machado than people think , and it includes addison russell . why the cubs should make addison russell-for-manny machado blockbuster trade -- jesse rogers december 16 , 2017 . ",
        "right now , kris bryant runs third base in the north side , but machado himself has said he favors a move to shortstop , where addison russell currently resides . if the cubs are serious about landing machado for a long-term deal , then they can not let their feelings about russell get in the way . sure , he 's a good player that has a chance to be great , but the cubs ca n't get caught up in keeping him at the cost of losing out on a monster like machado . if addy 's got ta go , he 's got ta go . ",
        "machado not only boasts far better numbers , but he has also left his injury woes behind him , something that can not be said about russell and his nagging foot problem : now a pundit is suggesting the cubs trade addison russell and mike montgomery for manny machado pic . twitter . com/fbuim61aum -- bleacher nation december 18 , 2017 . having russell as the centerpiece to the deal would also be good for the orioles . he 's 23 years old and has three full seasons under his belt . his first arbitration year is 2018 , and he wo n't be an unrestricted free agent until 2022 . ",
        "even if it 's just for one year , machado in the middle of an already stellar lineup featuring kris bryant and anthony rizzo would again make the cubs a serious contender . the one thing chicago can not do is get emotional over losing russell , which i do n't think will be an issue if machado looks like a done deal .
