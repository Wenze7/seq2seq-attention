        "credit : image courtesy of iadecola lab , weill cornell medicine , new york , n. y . we are often warned of the dangers of high levels of salt in our diet , yet the risks of salt consumption and the effects of salt on the body , including the brain , are not entirely clear . in a new mouse study , scientists link changes in the gut caused by a high-salt diet to impaired blood flow in the brain . this reduced blood flow can eventually lead to impaired cognition that could be reversed by changing back to a normal diet . ",
        "the study , published in nature neuroscience , also provides molecular clues for treating these problems . `` for years researchers have wondered how a high-salt diet harms the brain , '' said jim koenig , ph. d. , program director at the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke , part of the national institutes of health , which supported the study . `` this mouse study provides a detailed cellular and molecular diagram for how the problems start in the gut and opens unexpected paths towards new treatments . '' in this study , mice were fed a high-salt diet containing 16 times the amount of sodium chloride typically found in their food . ",
        "after eight weeks , their brains showed a 20 to 30 percent reduction in blood flow compared to mice that ate normal food . this drop in blood flow was accompanied by the appearance of dementia-like symptoms , including defects in the ability of hsd mice to recognize objects , navigate a maze , and properly build a nest . when the mice were returned to a normal diet , both blood flow and cognition improved , suggesting that the negative effects of excessive salt consumption could be reversible . `` the brain is extremely dependent on getting the right amount of blood at the right time . ",
        "if blood flow is n't matched to what the brain needs , things go wrong , '' said costantino iadecola , m. d. , director and chair of the feil family brain and mind research institute at weill cornell medicine in new york city and senior author of this study . to study further how salt affects blood flow in the brain , blood vessels were taken from the brains of mice fed a high-salt diet and grown in a dish . normally , these vessels tighten to reduce blood flow or relax to increase flow . however , those taken from hsd mice did not dilate properly when stimulated to do so . ",
        "a closer look revealed a reduction in the function of the enzyme enos that is responsible for producing nitric oxide , a potent signal for blood vessels to dilate . when the amino acid l-arginine , which can increase enos activity and no production , was added to the dishes containing blood vessels from hsd mice , the cells responded normally . when l-arginine was injected into hsd mice directly , the defects in cognition were also rescued . `` these findings together show that a high-salt diet affects the activity of the enos enzyme , which in turn leads to problems with blood flow and cognition , '' said dr. iadecola , who is on the strategic advisory board and receives a consulting fee from broadview ventures inc. . ",
        "broadview ventures inc. . was created by the board of the foundation leducq trust , the supporting trust of foundation leducq , `` but the question still remained how the ingestion of salt could lead to these effects in the brain . '' one clue came from evidence showing that eating high levels of salt changes the immune system of the gut , a finding that was first reported by scientists studying salt 's effects in a model of multiple sclerosis . specifically , a high-salt diet increased the appearance of th17 immune cells . these th17 cells secrete a molecule , il-17 , that can have toxic effects on blood vessels . ",
        "because the researchers did not observe any th17 cells in the brains of hsd mice , they concluded that it must be il-17 , moving throughout the circulatory system , that was acting directly on the brain 's blood vessels . the combined results of three additional experiments helped to confirm this hypothesis . first , hsd produced no effects in the brains of mice that lacked the gene for il-17 . second , the effects of hsd could be reversed by treating mice with an antibody that binds up il-17 and prevents it from affecting blood vessels . third , effects similar to those produced by hsd were seen in normal mice that were injected directly with il-17 . ",
        "together , these findings suggest that it is il-17 , released from cells in the gut in response to a high-salt diet , that acts on the blood vessels in the brain to affect blood flow . in humans , high levels of salt in the diet has long been associated with high blood pressure , and increasing evidence has linked blood pressure and brain health . however , the blood pressure of hsd mice was not affected , suggesting a very specific and independent mechanism for the changes seen here . `` this study adds to our growing understanding of how the gut can modulate brain function , '' said dr. koenig . ",
        "`` from a public health perspective , the fact that these effects can be reversed by halting the ingestion of salt is very important and could help us improve health in areas where many people eat a high-salt diet . '' in future experiments , dr. iadecola and his colleagues plan to further investigate further how decreased no production and reduced blood flow leads to changes in cognition . this work was supported by the ninds , the american heart association , and the fondation leducq . reference : . faraco et al. . dietary salt promotes neurovascular and cognitive dysfunction through a gut-initiated th17 response .
