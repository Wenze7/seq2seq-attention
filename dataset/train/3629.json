        "it 's rightly said in the book , `` most people went to school and never learned how money works , so they spend their lives working for money . '' if you have not yet read this book believe me you are missing a lot to learn about the financial literacy in your life . this post is for people who either have not read this book and need to peak inside what all can they learn , or for the people who have already read this book but who wants to refresh their learning from this book . ",
        "lesson 1 : the rich do n't work for moneyas quoted in the book , the poor and middle class work for money . the rich have money work for themalways remember , more money wo n't solve your problems . there are people who earn hell lot and yet ca n't pay their bills . most people , given more money , only get into more debt . that 's because most people do n't know how to make money work for them . it 's fear that keeps most people work for money : the fear of not paying bills , loans , emi , the fear of being fired , the fear of not having money . ",
        "most people become slave to money -- and then get angry at their boss . most people never study the subject of money . they go to school , have fun at their work , get their paycheck , balance their checkbooks and that 's it . then they wonder why they have money problems . they think that more money will solve the problem and do n't realise that it 's their lack of financial education that is the problem . the author explains very well that how people 's lives are forever controlled by two emotions : fear and greed . ",
        "he very well explained , if you do n't first handle fear and desire , and you get rich , you 'll only be a highly paid slave . lesson 2 : why teach financial literacy ? there are a lot of stories where people get rich instantly because of some lottery and they suddenly loose money and become poor . you need to understand that if you want to be rich you need to be financial literate . it 's not how much money you make . it 's how much you keep and how many generations you keep . ",
        "if you want to be rich you must know the difference between an asset and liability and you must buy assets . this may sound absurdly simple , but most people have no idea how profound this rule is . most people struggle financially because they do not know the difference between an asset and a liability . `` rich people acquire assets . the poor and middle class acquire liabilities that they think are assets . rule 1 : you must know the difference between an asset and a liability , and buy assetsan asset puts money in your pocket . ",
        "a liability takes money out of your pocket . the diagrams show the flow of cash through a poor , middle-class , and wealthy person 's life . it is the cash flow that tells the story of how a person handles their money . there is a reason to `` why the rich gets richer ? '' the asset column generates more than enough income to cover the expenses , with the balance reinvested into the asset column . the asset column continues to grow and therefore , the income it produces grows with it . the result is that rich gets richer ! ",
        "the rich buy assetsthe poor only have expensesthe middle class buy liabilities they think are assetslesson 3 : mind your own businessto become financially secure , a person needs to mind his own business . your business revolves around your asset column , not your income column . the rich focus on their assets , while everyone else focus on their income statements . the assets fall into following categories which every rich should buy : business that do not require my presence i own them , but are managed or run by other people . if i have to work there , it 's not a business . ",
        "it becomes my job . stocksbondsincome-generating real estateroyalties from intellectual property such as music , scripts , and patents . anything else that has a value , produces income or appreciates , and has a ready market . start minding your own business . you should keep your day time job , be a hardworking employee and start buying real assets , not liabilities . lesson 4 : the power of corporationscorporations are considered one of the biggest secret of rich people . people actually do n't know that corporation is not a thing . a corporation is merely a file folder with some legal documents in it , sitting in some attorney 's office and registered with a state government agency . ",
        "it 's not a big building or a factory or group of people . a corporation is merely a legal document that creates a legal body without a soul . using these , the wealth of rich gets protected from tax . always remember , the harder you work , the more you pay the goverment . hence , rich use corporations to save taxes as corporation 's income tax rate is less than individual income-tax rate . lesson 5 : the rich invent moneythe single most powerful asset we have is mind . we need to train our mind with financial intelligence . ",
        "if mind is trained well , it can create enormous wealth . financial intelligence is made up of following things : accounting : ability to read numbers . having analytical mindset . investing : it is science of money making money . understanding market : it is science of supply and demand . the law : it is the awarness of accounting corporate , state and central rules and regulations . with the combination of above 4 skills , one can be successful in pursuit of wealth . rich dad believed that the words ` i ca n't afford it ' shut down your brain . ",
        "` how can i afford it ? ' opens up possibilities , excitement , and dreams . getting started on journey of financial literacy : find a reason greater than reality : the power of spirit -- you need a reason deeply rooted in you to become wealthy . this reason should be emotional which brings that fire inside you which do n't let you stop with first few defeats . make daily choices : the power of choicechoose friends carefully : the power of association -- stay away from people who always tell you why something wo n't work . ",
        "stay with people with whom you grow daily . master a formula and then learn a new one : the power of learning quickly -- the skill of learning quickly is seriously pricessless . in this today 's world , it 's not what you know anymore that counts , because often what you know is old . pay yourself first : the power of self discipline -- before paying monthly expenses , allocate some money to your asset column first . pay your broker well : the power of good advice -- you should not hesitate to pay people who are smarter than you in certain aspect for gaining knowledge from them . ",
        "be a giver : the power of getting something for nothinguse assets to buy luxuries : the power of focuschoose heroes : the power of myth -- follow an expert , a person who inspired you . by having heroes in your life we tap into a tremendous source of raw genius . find someone who has successfully done what you want to do . teach and you shall receive : the power of giving -- always remember , to move forward in life you need to give back . the key to financial freedom and great wealth is a person 's ability to convert earned income into passive and/or portfolio income .
