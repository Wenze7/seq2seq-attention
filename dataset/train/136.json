        "sampdoria midfielder dennis praet has denied reaching an agreement to join juventus at the end of the season . reports in italy last week suggested the serie a champions have struck a deal to sign the 23-year-old this year for less than his release clause , which is said to be € 25million . praet has not denied that juve have shown interest but insists nothing has been finalised when it comes to his future . `` yes , but it was n't like they wrote , that everything is done , '' he told tuttosport when asked about the juve reports . ",
        "`` the interest of juventus is pleasing but they 're just words for now . i 'm very happy here , even though things have gone less well in recent times . `` praet joined from anderlecht in 2016 for a reported fee of € 10m and his performances in italy have led to rumours of interest from foreign clubs , including newcastle united in the premier league . the belgium international has played 18 times in serie a this season for samp , who have won just one of their last seven matches in all competitions during a difficult run . ",
        "one player who has left samp is filip djuricic . the club announced on thursday he has joined bottom side benevento on loan for the remainder of the campaign .   "
