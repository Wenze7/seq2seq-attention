        "la jolla , calif. , december 14 , 2017 - a new study led by researchers at sanford burnham prebys medical discovery institute describes the biology behind why muscle stem cells respond differently to aging or injury . the findings , published in cell stem cell , have important implications for therapeutic strategies to regenerate skeletal muscle in response to the normal wear and tear of aging , or in cases of injury or muscle diseases such as muscular dystrophy . `` our study is one of the first to look at muscle stem cells in their native tissue with resolution at the level of a single clone , '' says alessandra sacco , ph. d. , professor at sbp . ",
        "`` this allowed us to probe the dynamic heterogeneity of the cells , a measure of their flexibility to respond to exercise , injury , and the normal wear and tear that occurs with aging . using this approach , we found surprising differences in the degree to which stem cells can maintain this heterogeneity , depending on what they are asked to do . '' adult muscle stem cells are essential for repairing and regenerating muscle throughout life . these cells are located between muscle fibers and exist as a heterogeneous population that need to `` self-renew '' to maintain the stem cell population , as well as differentiate into myogenic cells that proliferate , differentiate , and fuse to create new muscle fibers . ",
        "`` muscle stem cells must maintain a spectrum of functional abilities to be prepared for the overall changes that occur from injuries , diseases and aging , '' says sacco . `` here , we focused on studying how the pool of muscle stem cells responds to age or after an injury to the muscle . `` our goal is to understand how stem cells uniquely cope with or yield to these different pressures . then , we can use this information to create new approaches designed to specifically prevent muscle stem cell loss and/or dysfunction linked to sarcopenia -- the medical term for age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength -- or in association with muscle diseases that are characterized by chronic tissue damage , such as dystrophies , '' adds sacco . ",
        "sacco 's research team used a technology called in vivo multi lineage tracing to follow the self-renewal capacity and range of progeny produced by individual stem cells . repetitive injuries cause muscles to undergo multiple rounds of repair , and are used as a model for diseases characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness , such as muscular dystrophies . `` the results were quite different from what we expected -- aged muscle stem cells maintained a diverse assortment of cells in the overall pool , despite being less able to proliferate and multiply sufficiently . the outcome was flipped when we caused an injury and watched how the pool responded to tissue damage , '' explains matthew tierney , ph. d. , a former graduate student of sacco , now a postdoctoral researcher at the rockefeller university . ",
        "`` in the case of injury , the stem cell pool becomes less diverse , but maintains its proliferative capacity . `` our findings lead to several interesting questions about the potential causes of these observed differences -- muscle stem cells are asked to function in a very different local environment with age or during regeneration due to injury , and we suspect this may contribute to some of the distinct behaviors we observed , '' adds tierney . `` this study has shown clear-cut differences in the dynamics of muscle stem cell pools during the aging process compared to a sudden injury , '' says sacco . ",
        "`` this means that there probably is n't a ` one size fits all ' approach to prevent the decline of muscle stem cells . therapeutic strategies to maintain muscle mass and strength in seniors will most likely need to differ from those for patients with degenerative diseases . '' co-authors of this collaborative study include : michael j. stec , , steffen rulands , , and benjamin d. simons . this study was funded , in part , by nih grants r01 ar064873 , f31 ar065923-03 , and sbpmdi start-up funds . about sbp . sanford burnham prebys medical discovery institute is an independent nonprofit medical research organization that conducts world-class , collaborative , biological research and translates its discoveries for the benefit of patients .
