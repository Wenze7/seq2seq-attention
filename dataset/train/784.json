        "charlotte , n. c. -- nic batum said it felt like old times having coach steve clifford back on the bench wednesday night . `` even when we were up 25 points , he was still screaming at us , still was n't happy , '' batum said with a laugh . `` he was n't happy after the game either . i missed him a lot . it 's cool to have him back . `` michael kidd-gilchrist scored 21 points , dwight howard had another double-double and the charlotte hornets used a record-setting first half to beat the washington wizards 133-109 in clifford 's first game since dec. .

",
        "`` the hornets made 12 of their first 13 shots and scored a franchise-record 77 points in the first half to build a 16-point lead . they extended that to 28 in the second half in a game that was never close . kemba walker had 19 points , howard had 18 points and 15 rebounds and jeremy lamb had 16 points for the hornets , who won for the fifth time in their last seven games . the hornets shot 65 percent from the field in the first half , including a pair of four-point plays from walker and marvin williams . ",
        "`` they had everything . everything they wanted they had , '' wizards coach scott brooks said . `` give them credit , they were playing great basketball . good to have coach cliff back and i 'm sure they were inspired by it and they played well . they made shots , they moved the ball , and they competed . `` bradley beal had 26 points for the wizards , whose five-game road trip got off to a rocky start . brooks was upset with his team 's play and suggested changes are coming . `` you just have to find guys that are going to compete , '' brooks said . ",
        "`` it 's not about nothing else . it 's not about shots . it 's not about how many minutes . it 's not about how many shots you get . it 's about competing . we all get paid to compete , regardless . `` tip inswizards : have allowed at least 100 points in 16 straight games . ... were outscored 50-30 in the paint . hornets : the 10 straight field goals made to start the game are the most to start a game since 2002-03 . ... with a 23-point lead in the fourth quarter , hornets fans started chanting `` we want monk .

",
        "i think the game got a little out of hand . things happen . `` with the wizards down by 20 , brooks elected to have howard , a 52 percent free-throw shooter , come off the bench to shoot carter-williams ' free throws . with the crowd booing brooks ' decision , howard walked on to the floor and sank both free throws . he glanced over at the wizards bench and raised his palms incredulously as if to say , `` why ? `` the crowd roared with delight after howard made both shots , and clifford quickly removed him from the game .
