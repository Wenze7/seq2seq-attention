        "leon britton hopes to guide swansea city to premier league safety from the pitch after stepping back from his recent sojourn into coaching at the liberty stadium . the midfielder -- who is currently nursing a calf injury - stepped into the breach as a player-assistant coach under paul clement when claude makelele left to take over at belgian side eupen . when clement was dismissed by the rock-bottom swans , britton was then tasked with leading the first team against crystal palace and liverpool . he earned a point in the home clash with palace before christmas , but was on the receiving end of a 5-0 thrashing by jurgen klopp 's reds on boxing day .

        "swansea turned to carlos carvalhal on thursday and rather than be part of the portuguese 's backroom staff , britton is determined to make an impact on the pitch . `` in fairness to the manager and chairman , they offered me the opportunity to stay as part of the new coaching set-up , '' britton told the club 's official website . we 've arrived at vicarage road ! pic . twitter . com/sxn468i9zu . -- swansea city afc december 30 , 2017 . `` they left the decision entirely down to me , and i had to decide whether i wanted to be a coach or a player . ",
        "`` i thought long and hard about it and while i enjoyed the coaching experience and learnt a lot in a short space of time , i still feel i can have a positive impact on the pitch as a player . i think that will be more beneficial to the club at this stage of the season . `` i am not ready to retire as a player yet , so i will review things again at the end of the season . '' carvalhal has named joao mario and bruno lage as his coaches , with jhony conceicao and paulo sampaio joining as analysts -- the latter three having been part of his team at sheffield wednesday .
