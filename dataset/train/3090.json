        "the portrait of a late parihaka elder has been immortalised on a hotel wall in downtown christchurch . a large mural of whero o te rangi bailey , known to many as poppy , has been painted on the back of the crowne plaza hotel on the corner of colombo and armagh streets , a little more than a year after her death . the mural was painted by canadian street artist kevin ledo and was one of 10 to go up in central christchurch , lyttelton and new brighton as part of the new street prints ōtautahi festival . ",
        "artists from new zealand , australia , spain , canada and britain began their paintings on december 21 and many were still working on the large pieces the following week . read more : one of taranaki 's great kuia , bailey died on december 1 , at the age of 80 . raised at parihaka , bailey was a teacher , counsellor and a staunch supporter of iwi and hapū initiatives in taranaki . her knowledge of te reo māori , waiata , poi and weaving were also highly regarded . ledo has painted murals and exhibited his artwork in many places across the globe , notably in the modemuseum in hasselt , belgium and arsenal in montreal , canada . ",
        "he was unable to be reached for comment but in a post shared to his social media of the mural he explained the image was a reinterpretation of a photograph taken by stu robertson in 2015 . the new zealand photographer took the picture of bailey as part of his peace in 10,000 hands project . the global art project saw a single white rose being photographed in the hands of 10,000 people from every country in an effort to challenge and renew the conversation for peace . the day ledo arrived in christchurch he met with robertson to discuss using an image from the project , ledo said in his post . ",
        "`` soon after starting the mural , the daughter of the woman i was painting , maia , reached out to me with the kindest words and appreciation , '' he said . `` i then learned more about her mum . `` i could not have ended the year with a better experience . '' bailey 's daughter maia hoengarangi bailey said while she did n't know why ledo had chosen her mum 's image to paint from all pictures on offer , she was glad he did . `` as a family , we are humbled and honoured that mum 's image has been selected and we know mum would have been humbled as well , '' she said . ",
        "`` mum was always full of surprises , turning up when we least expected her to , and now she 's turning up again in christchurch . '' bailey said her mum had travelled far and wide for ngā toi māori - all things relating to māori arts , language , culture , tikanga , te reo , whakapapa , history , and was involved in groups in christchurch . she said bailey was a humble woman who radiated a peaceful and loving energy which was felt by all . `` maybe that 's the reason why her photo was selected ? ",
        "`` if mum were alive today and she saw that painting , she would smile that lovely smile and nod ` ka pai ' '' .   "
