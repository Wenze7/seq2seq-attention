        "world no 1 dimitrij ovtcharov is confident that titleholder china can be upset at the upcoming world table tennis championships in halmstadt , sweden . `` maybe we have a much better chance to beat the chinese team this year than we had in the last five or six years , '' the 29-year-old german said in a recent interview with kicker magazine . `` to beat the exceptional quality of the chinese , usually three top players are needed . but when timo boll and i can give 120 percent in such a tournament , we might be able to achieve a surprising success , '' ovtcharov said of the competition , which runs april 20 to may 6 . ",
        "ovtcharov said he is relying on chinese support in preparing for the championships , as he has invited chinese players ranked narrowly below the national-team level to his training camp . `` sometimes i get assistance from the german association to get chinese training partners , but i know many of them since i played in the chinese super league . therefore i am happy to invite them to train with me , '' ovtcharov said . `` you can adjust your own game to their catchy racket coverings . you get to know their training system better and their training frequency . ",
        "they know all about table tennis and training . it 's not by chance that china is the leading nation in table tennis . '' ovtcharov said he is extremely proud to be the world no 1 , becoming the second german to achieve the top ranking after timo boll , who did it in 2013 . on beating china 's legendary fan zhendong at last year 's german open , ovtcharov said : `` he is one of the best and is regarded as nearly unbeatable . to defeat such an institution gave me the confidence to be near that outstanding level ... and proved i can make it . '' ",
        "as for the sport 's relatively low profile in his home country , the german predicts some changes . `` unlike the chinese stars , we can more or less walk on the street and live a normal life . chinese stars ca n't just walk out on the street because the fans know them so well . `` some slight innovations might raise the game 's profile and make it more interesting to germans . to have a sudden-death situation at 10-10 , for example , could really increase the excitement . `` also , we should have more table tennis on german television . ",
        "we have to address the needs of modern times and provide more entertainment . '' xinhua .   "
