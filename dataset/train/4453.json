        "philadelphia -- the end of net neutrality may be here . the republican-led federal communications commission voted thursday to approve a controversial plan to repeal obama-era net neutrality protections . the repeal passed 3-2 , along a party-line vote . the vote came amid mounting protests from the tech industry , consumer advocacy groups and even some republican members of congress who 'd urged the fcc to delay or cancel the vote . in what may be a sign emotions running high on the issue , the net neutrality vote was briefly interrupted due to a security threat . fcc commissioners and the audience were forced to evacuate the room . ",
        "`` sorry for the interruption , '' ajit pai , the chairman of the fcc , said after returning to the room . `` we were acting on the advice of the federal protection service . where was i ? '' the net neutrality rules , approved by the fcc in 2015 , were intended to keep the internet open and fair . internet service providers like comcast and verizon were explicitly prohibited from speeding up or slowing down traffic from specific websites and apps . under the approved proposal , the fcc would do away with rules barring internet providers from blocking or slowing down access to online content . ",
        "the fcc would also eliminate a rule barring providers from prioritizing their own content . pai , appointed to run the fcc by president trump , has been a longtime critic of the net neutrality rules . last month , he pitched his repeal proposal as a way stop the federal government from `` micromanaging the internet . '' `` it is not going to destroy the internet . it is not going to end the internet as we know it . it is not going to kill democracy . it is not going to stifle free expression online , '' pai said in his remarks thursday . ",
        "pai 's plan has been praised by the telecom industry , which argues the earlier regulation was a drag on broadband investment and innovation . in a blog post this week , comcast downplayed concerns , saying customers `` will continue to enjoy all of the benefits of an open internet today , tomorrow , and in the future . period . '' but net neutrality advocates have sounded alarms that the repeal could give internet providers too much control over how online content is delivered . it may also make it harder for the next generation of online services to compete , if they have to pay up to be placed in a so-called internet fast lane . ",
        "related : the end of net neutrality : what it all meansdemonstrators gathered outside the fcc building on thursday and piled flowers on the ground in an apparent memorial for the internet as we know it . twitter , reddit , kickstarter and other websites posted messages on their sites this week ahead of the vote in support of net neutrality . protesters mobilized in front of verizon stores around the country . and some of the creators of the internet penned a letter calling on the fcc to cancel the vote . `` the internet industry opposes chairman pai 's repeal of the 2015 open internet order , '' michael beckerman , president and ceo of the internet association , a trade group representing amazon , facebook , google and other tech companies , said in a statement thursday . ",
        "`` relying on isps to live up to their own ` promises ' is not net neutrality and is bad for consumers . '' on the eve of the vote , pai attempted to play down these concerns with a series of playful videos in partnership with a conservative news site , suggesting americans will still be able to binge watch and make memes without net neutrality . the issue may ultimately end up being decided in court . congress can also choose to pursue a legislative solution . a coalition of net neutrality advocacy groups is now shifting to petitioning congress to overturn the fcc vote . ",
        "the internet association said it 's also weighing legal options . `` while the fight to preserve net neutrality is going to be longer than we had hoped , this is far from over , '' alexis ohanian and steve huffman , the cofounders of reddit , wrote on thursday . ahead of the vote , some republicans also expressed concerns with pai 's plan . sen. susan collins , a republican from maine , joined sen. angus king , an independent , in issuing a last-minute call thursday for pai to cancel the vote . `` this is a matter of enormous importance with significant implications for our entire economy and therefore merits the most thorough , deliberate , and thoughtful process that can be provided , '' the senators wrote in a letter . ",
        "`` the process thus far in this important matter has not met that standard . '' the repeal vote comes more than six months after the fcc kicked off the lengthy process to roll back the net neutrality protections . it received millions of comments during a review period , with the majority supporting the current protections . there has also been mounting scrutiny in recent weeks over rampant fraudulent comments submitted during the review period . new york attorney general eric schneiderman said last month the fcc had been uncooperative in his office 's investigation into the comments . ",
        "`` i dissent from this rash decision to roll back net neutrality rules . i dissent from the corrupt process that has brought us to this point . and i dissent from the contempt this agency has shown our citizens in pursuing this path today , '' jessica rosenworcel , one of two democratic commissioners at the fcc , said in a statement thursday . `` this decision puts the federal communications commission on the wrong side of history , the wrong side of the law , and the wrong side of the american public .
