        "** red spoiler alerts ** last sunday 's episode captured the story-telling in a very star trek manner . there was an element of surprise but , truly , there was n't . in fact , if they had gone anywhere else with this episode it would have harmed the series . at least , speaking in logical terms . they foreshadowed the trans-dimensional jump in the previous episode when they discussed the inherent possibilities in the mycelium network . what made this show even more interesting was the time travel conundrum it discreetly snuck in there this week . ",
        "`` it cites another starfleet vessel uss defiant . `` saru : `` how is that possible ? at last review , the defiant was patrolling sector six in our universe . '' `` there may be some kind of temporal anomaly at play . '' `` it 's unclear , but data suggests that in the future , defiant will encounter a phenomenon that 'll bring it into this alternative universe 's past . `` it seems like they are speaking about a uss defiant in their timeline . so , around 2255 and 2260 , because time has passed since the battle at the binary stars . ",
        "also , stardates have been missing in dis and there really is no hard and fast formula until tng for stardates . what we know for certain is that dis takes place 10 years before tos . the original series ' five-year mission started in 2265 . here is a good timeline . in 2268 the defiant is stuck between dimensions by a tholian tri-cobalt warhead , gravity well inducing , phenomenon . three weeks later enterprise and kirk arrive at the scene and the defiant is unstuck but ends up in the mirror universe . in star trek enterprise , that same uss defiant makes an appearance . ",
        "between 2150 and 2155 . apparently , when the defiant entered the mirror universe a temporal anomaly it sent them back to archer 's time . therefore , discovery 's uss defiant find , in the mirror universe , seems to be the same uss defiant as the one that appears in tos and in ent . after the events of the tos it was sent through the dimensional time/space divide into , not only , another dimension -- the mirror universe -- but also back in time . a hundred years later discovery and her crew are either in a different time in the mirror universe or the defiant has stuck around for a hundred years . ",
        "◎ 2268 -- defiant becomes stuck in tholian web ◎ 2268 -- kirk and enterprise free defiant only to send it into the mirror universe ◎ 2150 -- 2155 -- archer and crew from enterprise find the defiant when they enter the mirror universe in their own time ◎ 2250 -- 2260 -- discovery crew finds defiant information on rebel ship what seems probable is that the defiant will appear in future episodes of dis . another possibility , if discovery has been thrown back in time , as well as trans-dimensionally , is that we might find terran counterparts to the characters from ent . ",
        "that would be far-fetched , but a thoroughly enjoyable thought-experiment . either way , the threading of this episode within the larger star trek universe is superb . correction to the original article by james harrod . originally article stated three years before kirk 's enterprise found the defiant .
