        "afp / tony ashby roger federer and belinda bencic lift the hopman cup after defeating alexander zverev and angelique kerber of germany in the mixed doubles final in perth , on january 6 , 2018roger federer paid tribute to the influence of countrywoman and former hopman cup team-mate martina hingis on his career after guiding switzerland to their third success in the mixed teams tournament in perth on saturday . federer looked primed for his australian open title defence when he came from a set down to beat world number four alexander zverev in the men 's singles , before angelique kerber accounted for belinda bencic in straight sets to level the tie against germany . ",
        "the swiss duo then claimed the tournament with a straight-sets win in the deciding mixed doubles . for the 36-year-old federer , it was a second title in perth , having also been part of switzerland 's previous victory back in 2001 , when he teamed with hingis . at that time , federer was just 19 and was yet to win at an atp event . he said the time spent with hingis in perth had a profound effect on his career , which now includes 19 grand slam singles titles . hingis was the youngest ever grand slam champion and world number one , spending 209 weeks at the top of women 's tennis and winning five grand slam singles titles . ",
        "federer visited perth with hingis twice , once as a hitting partner and then in 2001 as her team-mate , and said it shaped his career . `` i could look up to her and think , wow , how is she being so mentally strong and so consistent at such a young age , '' the swiss star recalled . `` it made me also believe with hard work and dedication you get really far , because i did n't believe it that much at that point when i was younger , i thought it was more all talent , '' he added . ",
        "`` definitely she helped me to become the player i am today . `` federer was thrilled to add a second hopman cup to his glittering resume and said it was a very different feeling to the first . `` it is totally different to when i won it with martina because i was the apprentice and she was the master , '' he said . unbeaten in his three singles matches in the tournament prior to the final , federer dropped the first set against the 20-year-old zverev , but recovered to win in three sets , 6-7 , 6-0 , 6-2 . ",
        "zverev beat federer at the hopman cup last year and came out all guns blazing on saturday in a high-intensity first set where both players produced moments of brilliance and each holding multiple break points . federer 's frustration was obvious as the set slipped away , dropping his racquet after missing an easy volley and then launching a ball towards the roof . however , he turned the match around by approaching the net more often and using drop shots to catch zverev napping . the frustration changed sides of the net as the german copped a code violation for an audible obscenity after disputing the chair umpire 's decision to replay one of his serves during the second set . ",
        "zverev 's serve , and resolve , was broken in the third game of the third set and fittingly it was a federer drop shot which sealed the win . kerber , who is ranked 21st after starting last year at number one , then maintained her perfect singles record during the event to beat bencic 6-4 , 6-1 to level the tie . bencic , who was ranked seventh in the world before injuries stalled her progress , started brightly but kerber soon took control and raced through the second set with breaks in the fourth and sixth games . ",
        "that set the scene for the mixed doubles , where bencic produced some stunning returns on the zverev serve and teamed superbly with federer to claim the title with an emphatic 4-3 , 4-2 win under the fast4 format .   "
