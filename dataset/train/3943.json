        "in its quest to bring the entire world closer together , facebook has always had a small problem : small people . in many countries , children are not allowed to join the company 's eponymous site . for example , in the united states , the children 's online privacy protection act dictates that sites that collect user information can not sign up users under 13 . understandably , facebook ceo mark zuckerberg has spoken out against this restriction . facebook 's newest app may present a win-win solution . after consulting the national parent teacher association and online security experts , the company is launching facebook messenger kids , a stand-alone app that allows children ages 6 to 12 to message parent-approved contacts . ",
        "a key selling point : there will be no advertising on messenger kids . patience is a virtuewhat 's separated facebook from other social-media failures like myspace is zuckerberg 's patience . early in the product 's existence , the young ceo resisted calls for immediate monetization , instead focusing on user growth . in the book the accidental billionaires , notably adapted into the film the social network , zuckerberg is portrayed as rebuffing fellow founder eduardo saverin 's attempts to heavily monetize the site , and the two fell out over saverin placing unauthorized ads on the site . ",
        "zuckerberg 's patience was also noted in his handling of instagram . before facebook 's initial public offering , in 2012 , zuckerberg announced a deal to pay $ 1 billion for the photo-sharing site , a surprising figure for a company with no revenue . instead of placing ads on instagram or incorporating the app into facebook , zuckerberg allowed instagram to continue to grow its user base unimpeded before slowly introducing ads on the site . facebook addresses concernsfacebook has long faced concerns about user privacy . these concerns are heightened with pre-teen users , who often are unaware of the impact of their online activity . ",
        "the company appears to have addressed many of these concerns by incorporating the following privacy and family-friendly features : parental control no advertisingno auto-migration to facebook or instagramplaying the long game will pay offfacebook has seen strong competition for youngsters from new entrants , most notably from snap inc. 's snapchat . facebook has continued to grow its considerable monthly and daily active users , but much of this growth is coming from older adults and seniors , while most advertisers prefer younger demographics . understandably , messenger kids is an attempt to introduce children to the social network 's sticky ecosystem before they 're able to open a snapchat account . ",
        "the wall street journal notes messenger kids mimics snap by incorporating many of the popular features of the photo-sharing app , such as the filters that overlay graphics onto a user 's face . for investors , this will not show up in facebook 's results . if anything , this is a short-term expense that will weigh against earnings , albeit slightly , as the costs of developing and maintaining the application are expensed while there 'll be no discernible revenue source . however , zuckerberg has shown a willingness to be patient with monetization while growing the company 's user base . ",
        "messenger kids would probably be no different in this regard .   "
