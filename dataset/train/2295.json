        "- siri and alexa will soon be facing stiff competition , at least when it comes to cars : mercedes is set to become the first carmaker to introduce its own voice-activated assistant . anyone who steps into one of their cars greets the console with the words `` hey mercedes '' will be able to control virtually all vehicle functions , from radio to seat heating , through verbal commands . according to mercedes , this will let drivers and passengers pick music , ask about the weather or even get directions . the new voice control feature will initially be available in 13 languages . ",
        "it is part of the mercedes-benz user experience unveiled at the recent ces trade fair in las vegas . the mbux comes with a new generation of instruments and a fresh operating system , which has led mercedes to upgrade its wide touchscreen consoles across its product line . the new screens will offer more complex graphics , greater information density and more personalization options . in addition , mercedes will continue to expand the touch fields on the steering wheel and the upgraded touchpad along the centre tunnel . according to the manufacturer , however , these various inputs will be used less and less frequently in the future , as improved artificial intelligence will allow the car to get to know its driver or drivers over time , and automatically suggest specific settings or adjustments . ",
        "the technology will first be used in the new a-class , which will mark its debut at the geneva international motor show in march and go on sale by mid-2018 . thereafter , mercedes hopes roll out the technology across its product line quite quickly . `` by 2020 , it will be in all our cars , '' the german carmaker says .
