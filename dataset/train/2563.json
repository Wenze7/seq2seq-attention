        "republican sen. jeff flake on sunday said he does n't think it would be helpful for president donald trump to get involved in government shutdown discussions . `` i just do n't think it helps for him to be involved at all , '' he said outside the senate chamber . `` the white house really has n't been involved from what i 've seen . '' `` it 's going to be very difficult to pass anything out of the house without the president 's support . our hope is to pass something in the senate that then gets the president 's support , '' he added . ",
        "senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has a 1 a. m. cloture vote scheduled for monday if an agreement is n't reached before then and flake on sunday confirmed it would still take place at that time . democrats on late friday filibustered a republican bill to fund the government in order to secure a deal for daca recipients . the deferred action for childhood arrivals allowed people who illegally came to the united states as children with their parents to stay if they met certain criteria . president donald trump in early september announced he was ending daca and giving a gridlocked congress until march to decide what happens to the 800,000-plus young people affected .
