        "at least once a week , my three-year-old son , ollie , asks to see pictures of himself when he was a baby , a request i gladly oblige . we scroll through my instagram feed on the couch , laughing together as i point out silly snapshots and tell him stories from when he was `` little '' -- what he was like , trips we took as a family , funny things he did . recently , though , he caught me off guard , asking me to stop as i thumbed past a black-and-white photo of my husband and me on our wedding day . ",
        "`` stop ! who 's that , mama ? '' he asked me . `` that lady looks like a princess ! '' i laughed and told him those two youngsters were his dad and me , explaining that this picture was taken a long time ago , before he came into the world . but beneath the laughter , i realized his innocent question had brought to light a struggle i had been internalizing for a long while . of course , i do n't blame my pre-schooler for not recognizing me in a tiny photo : i was a good 50 pounds lighter than i am now and wearing a grecian-style gown with a side-swept updo and more makeup than he 's ever seen me in . ",
        "the harder part was that i hardly recognized myself . most days , i do n't spend too much time thinking about the size or shape of my body . part of it is that in this phase of my life , my body serves a more practical purpose : chasing after ollie , breastfeeding my 10-month-old , pounding out words on the keyboard while they both sleep . but when i try on clothes in poorly lit fitting rooms or catch a quick glimpse of my soft , round body in a store window , i 'm faced with a choice . ",
        "will i punish myself with self hatred or be kind to the hard-working body that gave me my two sons ? for the first few years of motherhood , i chose the former -- but instead of motivating me to take care of my body in healthy ways , this toxic perspective stole me from my kids and , ultimately , from myself . i obsessed over what i ate , and often , instead of eating the potentially unhealthy kid foods in my house , i did n't eat at all , which damaged both my mental and physical health . ",
        "i nearly lost my breast milk supply as a result of calorie restriction and then got mastitis when i tried to build it back up . my anxiety eventually skyrocketed to the point where i could hardly leave the house . as it turns out , my obsessive effort to return to a version of myself i sacrificed when i chose to have kids was not only fruitless but also was altogether destructive . my life had fundamentally changed when i became a mom , but i just could n't accept that my body would too . the irony is that during that deep , dark struggle with post-baby body image , i was much smaller than i am now . ",
        "i gained a lot more weight during my second pregnancy due to a nasty combination of hyperemesis gravidarum and crippling anxiety and depression . but for some reason -- maybe due to the time constraints of trying to freelance with two kids around or because i 've grown up a little emotionally -- i care far less about how i look now . i see photos of myself after my first son -- photos i cringed at when they were taken -- and have to laugh . i was tiny ! but i was n't happy . all i cared about was how i felt , how i looked , what other people thought of me . ",
        "i feared other moms would think i `` let myself go , '' or worse , pity me for my inability to lose weight . i was absolutely obsessed with myself . so much of motherhood is toggling between caring for yourself and caring for your kids . i realize now that i ca n't give myself to my babies if i do n't eat enough , and i also ca n't be present with them if i do n't take care of my mind and heart . so in this season , to care for me is to care for them . ",
        "before , i thought `` caring for me '' meant returning to an arbitrary number on the scale , a number by which i defined myself for so much of my life . now , i see that self-care means being kind and gracious toward myself -- and it means eating to nourish my body , not punish it . yes : my post-baby body is covered in hot-pink stretch marks . my belly hangs out over the waist of my pants , and at least once a month , a stranger asks me if i 'm pregnant . physically , i 'm the biggest i 've ever been , and i doubt i 'll be getting too much smaller anytime soon . ",
        "but i 'm also the freest i 've ever been , the most emotionally stable and content . i have two little boys who enrich my life , and there 's no way i would ever go back . follow us on twitter @britandco !   "
