",
        "a 1-0 win over gremio last weekend retained the club world cup and the brazil international is not giving up on domestic matters . `` so far they are doing well , '' casemiro told dazn . `` they are fine in laliga , they are fine in the champions league too , but i prefer to talk about what my team-mates are doing . `` at the end , we will know everything : who will win the league , who will win the champions league . `` when zizou took control over the team we were n't doing well in laliga or in the champions league , and in the end won the champions , and our fate changed completely . ",
        "`` we have to keep working hard because football keeps changing , so we have to keep on working and i 'm sure our situation will change , and we are working on that . `` may is where all it counts and we want to win some titles at the end of the season . but at this stage we must be in a good position too , we ca n't forget it , because maybe barcelona and the rest of the teams far from us in la liga . `` we know the most important thing is the title and we always have to fight with the title in mind . '' ",

",
        "`` he just won an award as the world 's best manager because of his work . so for us it is an honour to have a manager like him , and it is very important for us to have a trainer who knows the dressing room . ''   "
