        "saffron and turmeric are two ingredients used often in indian cooking . the first sits at the center of the crocus flower as three deep orange , thread-like stigmas waiting to be picked ; the latter grows hidden , deep inside the earth . in addition to their flavors , both are highly valued for their ability to impart color to food : saffron gives a golden orange hue ; turmeric a bright yellow color . saffron has historically been , and remains , one of the most expensive spices in the world . it grows in very few spots , but it 's the ones from iran and the indian state of kashmir that are highly prized . ",
        "it also must be harvested by hand , which raises the price . to put this in perspective : approximately 160 flowers yield about a gram of saffron . turmeric , on the other hand , is obtained by digging out the stems from the ground either by hand or by machine . both fresh and ground turmeric is used in cooking and is inexpensive . while most vendors sell saffron as a few delicate dried strands in a tiny container , you might come across a ground version , too ; avoid this . due to its exorbitant price , saffron makers started to sell adulterated forms that are ground to a fine powder , and then mixed with other pigments and spices . ",
        "a few weeks ago , i visited a spice plantation in goa , india , and learned that the color and fragrance of saffron can be mimicked by a combination of 1/2 teaspoon turmeric , 1 teaspoon annatto and the ground seeds from one green cardamom pod . this mixture is sometimes called the `` poor man 's saffron , '' though i found this imitation comes nowhere close to the real thing . thankfully , you never need to use large quantities of saffron when cooking at home . a tiny pinch of a few strands goes a very long way . ",
        "use too much and it can get overpowering and leave a pungent taste in food . so , you might ask : what 's a pinch of saffron ? depending on the quality , i use about 15 to 20 full strands as a `` pinch '' in both sweet and savory preparations . here 's a dish where saffron and turmeric are cooked separately but come together in one meal at the dinner table . saffron strands are added to pearl couscous , which take on the deep golden orange color as they cook to tenderness in the vegetable stock . ",
        "meanwhile , the fish is seasoned from the inside with a turmeric-chile seasoning that 's mixed with fresh lime juice and then cooked until the skin crisps up in the pan . nik sharma is a two-time iacp award winner and is working on his first solo cookbook , `` season '' , which comes out in fall 2018 . email : food@sfchronicle .
