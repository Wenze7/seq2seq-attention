        "the orlando magic fell behind early and never truly recovered . their defense abandoned them and they fell in a blowout to the chicago bulls . on the orlando magic 's first offensive possession , the team ran through their two best players . nikola vucevic got the ball at the elbow and jonathon simmons flared out toward the corner . nikola vucevic tried to loop the ball over to him . but jonathon simmons lost control of the ball and it trickled out of bounds . meanwhile , the chicago bulls kept scoring . contested shots ? sure . ",
        "but the bigger problems were the way denzel valentine and kris dunn and jerian grant darting through the lane . chicago took a 12-0 lead off the bat . orlando was climbing uphill . and the bigger problem ? those came at the end of the first and second quarters . at the end of the first quarter , after the magic had cut the deficit to one , they began to unravel . a 3-pointer from bobby portis followed by a three-point play as the buzzer sounded from kris dunn after poor defense from d. j. augustin , a late rotation from jonathan isaac and a late charge attempt from shelvin mack . ",
        "it was a 6-0 run that put the game seemingly out of reach . another quick run to end the second quarter showed just how much the magic had unraveled . even the little bit of momentum the team had built to keep the game close in the second quarter was undone with a series of poor offensive possessions , turnovers and poor transition defense . chicago had its way against orlando in a 112-94 win at united center on wednesday . the magic had no answers and no fight , taking another devastating defeat . orlando is still struggling with injuries and it is no surprise the offense continues to flounder . ",
        "the magic finished the game shooting 39.3 percent . they hit on just 5 for 27 on 3-pointers , with d. j. augustin hitting three . it was not a good offensive performance at all , with the team often trying to force the ball through nikola vucevic , jonathon simmons or elfrid payton . and the magic 's defense opened up consistently . orlando was unable to get stops consistently . the bulls shot 50.0 percent from the floor . and , reminiscent to last year 's penultimate game in that same building , orlando seemed to lose its fight , allowing the deficit to grow too big .
