        "san clemente , calif. . -- rep. darrell issa of california announced wednesday that he will not seek re-election , the latest sign that republicans could face another grim year at the ballot box in the nation 's most populous state . with his decision to step aside after nine terms , issa joins a string of gop lawmakers who are retiring rather than take on what would be a difficult re-election battle . the risks for republicans are especially acute in california , where the party has been fading away for years . democrats hold every statewide office and control both chambers of the legislature by hefty margins . ",
        "in the 2016 presidential election , democrat hillary clinton crushed republican donald trump in the state by more than 4 million votes . democrats with plans to retake control of the house hope to oust a handful of california republicans whose districts clinton carried . issa 's seat , the coastal 49th district , is among them . a central battleground will be orange county , a one-time republican fortress that was home to president richard nixon . democrats think they can flip control of as many as four house seats . issa 's district cuts through san diego and orange counties . ",
        "in san clemente , a hillside city overlooking the pacific ocean that was home to nixon 's western white house , voters greeted issa 's announcement with sadness or relief , reflecting the closely divided politics of the district . `` that 's like a christmas present , '' said donna martin , a retired community college teacher and registered democrat . but tanya johnson , also a retired teacher , said she would be disappointed to see issa leave , crediting him with keeping an open door for constituents . she recalled sending issa an email expressing her concerns about the recent federal tax overhaul , and issa responded . ",
        "he voted against the proposal , saying residents in his district could see higher taxes . `` i really believe he ... cared , '' said johnson , a republican . democrats had made defeating issa one of their top priorities for 2018 . the risks were obvious for the incumbent . issa survived by about 1,600 votes in his last election and democratic challengers have lined up to take him on in a midterm election that generally favors the party not in control of the white house . moreover , his ties to trump in a state where the president is unpopular would almost certainly increase his vulnerability . ",
        "republicans account for only 1 in 4 voters in the state , while democrats count a 3.7 million edge in voter registrations . the last republican presidential candidate to carry the state was george h. w. bush , in 1988 . a surge in immigrants transformed california and its voting patterns . the number of hispanics , blacks and asians combined has outnumbered whites since 1998 . meanwhile , the state 's new voters , largely latinos and asians , tend to vote democratic . issa 's announcement followed that of rep. ed royce , the republican chairman of the house foreign affairs committee , who announced tuesday that he would not seek a 14th term . ",
        "national republicans said they were n't giving up on retaining the two california seats . gop officials said the party has solid recruits in both races . they 're also holding out hope that so many democrats are running in each race , that it will enhance the gop 's prospects . under california 's election rules , known as the `` jungle primary , '' the two candidates who advance to a november runoff are the top vote-getters regardless of party . `` with the jungle primary , they will cannibalize each other 's votes and make it easier for a republican to get to the general election , '' said rep. steve stivers , the chairman of the national republican congressional committee . ",
        "`` then we just have to win the general election . `` but democrats were gleeful over the retirements and what it could mean in reaching the 24 gop-held seats they need to win in order to take control of the house . `` we 'll keep a watchful eye on both of these congressional districts to see which republicans come forward , but in the end , these retirements do not bode well for our republican colleagues '' said rep. ben ray lujan , d-n . m. , and chairman of the campaign arm of the democrats in the house .
