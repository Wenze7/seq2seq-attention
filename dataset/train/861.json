        "here is what 's left of the hellscape that greeted new york 's bravest at thursday night 's deadly fire in the bronx . the entry hallway of 2363 prospect ave. is now a charred , dank shell -- but on thursday , as hose-lugging firefighters from the borough 's 18th battalion broke down the building 's front door , they were in a darkness made darker still by billowing black smoke . then , they nearly stumbled . at least three people were collapsed onto the mosaic tile floor . two were adults . one was a child . ",
        "all were motionless , not breathing . `` i 'm dealing with three bodies , and i 'm not even 10 feet into the building , '' a chief at the battalion , jeffrey facinelli , recalled . the three were among the 12 dead and the four critically injured from the worst fire in new york city in more than 25 years . `` if you ever see a come out of a fire with soot on them , it kind of changes the way you look at the fire , '' added ems bronx division commander michael fields . ",
        "`` it kind of changes everything . '' facinelli and fields were the first officials to reach the scene ; both were startled to see an early-evening fire already so fully in flame . `` i would expect that kind of fire at 3 , 4 in the morning , when people are sound asleep , not at dinner time when everyone is awake , walking the streets , awake in your apartment , '' said facinelli . `` why are we seeing this much fire ? '' on that first floor , a toddler had been playing with the stove and started a kitchen fire that grew quickly to mammoth proportions , fueled by oxygen from the door the mother left open as she grabbed her kids and ran . ",
        "only years of training could prepare the heroic bravest for what greeted them inside that drafty , fire-swept hallway . `` there 's several people laying there , blocking the path for us to get in , '' recalled facinelli . `` so immediately we have a life hazard that needs to be addressed before we can even get the hose in the building . '' the firefighters dropped the hose and carried out the victims , laying them on the sidewalk . other arriving first responders began doing cpr as the first firefighters went back inside . `` once our guys started going up , they started finding people all over the place , '' facinelli said , grimly . ",
        "`` in the public hallway upstairs , in apartments . it was heavily damaged , but our firefighters are well-trained . they worked extremely hard under very difficult circumstances . `` do n't forget , on the outside , things are icing up now . `` you 're dealing with zero visibility inside the building , high-heat conditions , ca n't see hand in front of the face type of thing . `` i ca n't speak enough for how well they operated . and for me , i 'm just going by what i 'm hearing on the radio . ",
        "`` these guys are on their hands and knees , and they 're crawling around looking . i know because i 've done it . i know how tough it is . '' within minutes , facinelli 's radio `` started lighting up , '' he recalled . `` we have another ` 45 , ' facinelli said , referring to the 10-45 code used to relay fire injuries . `` we have three more here . we have two here . the numbers just started escalating . '' in all , 22 families were left homeless , according to the red cross . ",
        "many of those survivors remained furious saturday with the 25-year-old mother whose unsupervised child started the fire . the woman 's name has not been released by authorities , who say she left both of her children watching cartoons as she took a 20-minute shower . `` her apartment is right behind mine , '' said shevon stewart , 45 . `` you do n't call for help ? from the moment you see fire , call somebody . and if you do n't have a phone , knock on doors , do something . '' the mother had only faintly called out `` fire ! ",
        "fire ! '' before sitting on a curb across the street , said stewart , who said she ran back in herself to alert neighbors . stewart 's sister , karen stewart-francis , 37 , who lived on the fifth floor , died along with her daughters kylie francis , 2 , kelly charmela francis , 7 , and niece shontay young , 19 . stewart 's brother-in-law , holt francis , is on life support at jacobi medical center . `` he is hooked up to a machine . he ca n't breathe on his own . . . ",
        "all we can do is hope and pray , '' said francis ' cousin hainsley clarke . emelia acheampong , 42 , who also was left homeless , joined in raging at the young mother . `` i 'm angry , i 'm very angry . you got to be watching your kids . they got to know better . i mean , my roommate is dead , '' said acheampong , who was staying in a queens hotel room provided by the red cross . others were quick to avoid putting blame on the toddler 's mom . `` i 'm not anyone to judge her , '' said rosa arias , 43 , a home health aid and mother of two kids , who said she escaped only because she saw smoke coming under the third-floor apartment door . ",
        "`` i did n't hear an alarm . there was n't one , '' she said . still , `` i feel blessed , '' she said . `` my children are ok . '' on saturday , authorities released the names of the previously unidentified victims : gabriel yaw sarkookie , 48 , justice opoku , 54 , solomon donkor , 49 , william donkor , age unknown and hannah donkor , 17 . additional reporting by georgett roberts , stephanie pagones , ruth weissmann and gwynne hogan .
