        "more than two decades after hanging up their skates , the mighty ducks are preparing to return to the rink . a tv series based on the iconic '90s hockey movie trilogy is in the works , according to the hollywood reporter , with the films ' original screenwriter steven brill drafting a script for abc signature studios . jordan kerner , who produced the movies , is also attached . the mighty ducks trilogy -- which began with 1992 's the mighty ducks and concluded with 1996 's d3 : the mighty ducks -- starred emilio estevez as gordon bombay , a down-on-his-luck attorney who became the coach of a minnesota-based youth hockey team . ",
        "despite brill 's involvement , none of the films ' stars -- including names like estevez , joshua jackson and marguerite moreau -- are attached to the series , which is reportedly still in the earliest stages of development and is not yet attached to a network . in fairness , this is n't the first time the ducks have appeared the small screen . mighty ducks : the animated series -- which had no connection to the movies , save for its name -- ran from 1996 to 1997 as part of abc 's `` disney afternoon '' block of programming .
