        "large corporations vs lean startups has always been a remarkable questions to job seekers , entrepreneurs and professionals . we compare these two as a well dressed-professional-growth oriented and challenging-cool-learning oriented sectors . however , these two types of organizations can learn from each other as well . this write-up is focused on what a corporation can learn from a startup . 1 . keeping things simplein startups , there 's a scarcity of human resources always . so , they needed to find a way to make things done with that limited resource . so , what did they do ? ",
        "they kept things simple . they have reinvented collaboration based teamwork . here , no one is designated for anything specific , rather everyone is designated for everything . there 's small email loops , fewer departments and small hierarchy structure to keep things simple . this actually helps the startups to get in touch with their end customers very easily and also make more out of the available resources . 2 . working fastworking fast is another important phase of learning for corporations . what happens in corporations when a problem is found ? here 's the process , you find out the problem , have a group discussion , find out the problem , consult with the supervisor , get approval from the department head , execute the solution , report effectiveness and so on . ",
        "but in startup culture , it is very much appreciated to do these things faster . the basic reason of this cultural build up is investment deficiency . as most of the startups has limited investment , they are bound to work fast and skip the unnecessary mail loops . through this , the maximum output is ensured in the minimum amount of time . 3 . hyper-collaborationnow many of you might know the terms ` hyper-collaboration ' and ` experience partners ' . hyper-collaboration defines a certain form of collaboration among multiple ventures to support each other in certain activities ; so that they can grow together . ",
        "and experience partnership is a strategic move between two organizations who can share their resources systematically to make sure the optimum output . for example , i knew a saas product company and a image based ai company working together in a shared office space . they share one 's technical resources with the other to maintain minimal technical support . on the other hand , the other company provides branding support to the ai based startup . the concept here is to find the solution with multiple partnership and to ask the wider community to share expertise whenever the firm lacks experience . ",
        "4 . being brave to uncertaintyif you ask me one single strength that startups have , i will say it is ` to deal with uncertainty and failure ' . these lean businesses always face uncertainty and failure in financial , operation and resource related aspects . and they became stronger while developing the survival instinct . in a corporation , most of the time there is a plenty of resources to get a job done ; besides the financial backbone is strong mostly . so , if any uncertain situation occurs or any failure show no mercy ; it does n't hurt the corporation much . ",
        "or , i will say , in most of the case it does n't even feel the lack of comfort . but it affects in long-run . renowned corporations ended up getting merged or sold off majority shares to another corporation for this lack of discomfort in uncertain situations . the learning of not being afraid is a very important one . google develops hundreds of products in times , and an huge number of these products are thrown away just because those did n't work . if you don ; t experience it how can you embrace it ? ",
        "so , getting afraid of failure/uncertainty is not an option , rather learning from it , is . most of the big corporations now-a-days have been established a long time ago . now , the scenario has changed . now is takes more to survive , takes more to impact . so , the learning is focused on keeping things simple , working fast to achieve a goal , collaborating with wider communities and being brave to face uncertainties or learn from failures . this story is published in the startup , medium 's largest entrepreneurship publication followed by 271,476 + people .
