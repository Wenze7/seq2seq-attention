        "carl frampton says he needs a victory on saturday if he wants to challenge for a title again . carl frampton and nonito donaire , two former fighter of the year winners looking to get back to world title form , will fight each other in an effort to advance their goals . they will meet in a 12-round featherweight showdown april 21 at the sse arena in belfast , northern ireland , frampton 's hometown , promoter frank warren announced on tuesday . the fight , which has been ticketed for the past couple of months , was initially eyed for april 7 . ",
        "`` it 's a brilliant fight , a four-weight world champion against a two-weight world champion , '' frampton said . `` has a bigger ` away ' fighter ever come to fight in belfast before ? i do n't think there 's been a bigger name than nonito donaire and he 's coming to fight a local guy in his hometown . `` but i think both of us are in the same situation -- a slip-up here and one of us might never fight for a world title again . there 's a lot on the line for both guys . ",
        "`` donaire said he has no issue traveling to enemy grounds for the fight . `` this is exactly the type of fight i live for -- going in against one of the best in the world in the lion 's den of his hometown of belfast , '' donaire said . `` i ca n't wait for the first bell . i know i 'll have to be the best i can be on fight night . make no mistake : i 'm already training like never before . `` i plan to put on a spectacular show for my fans , his fans and boxing fans in general . ",
        "when i walk out of the ring victorious , it will have all been worth it . `` frampton has won world titles at junior featherweight and featherweight and won the 2016 fighter of the year award when he unified junior featherweight belts by outpointing scott quigg in a major rivalry fight and then came to the united states and turned back a stiff challenge in his first fight with leo santa cruz to win a featherweight belt by majority decision . frampton , 30 , lost a majority decision in the rematch last january and then changed his promoter , manager and trainer . ",
        "he returned for a 10-round decision win over horacio garcia on nov. . 18 . donaire , 35 , a philippines native fighting out of las vegas , has won world titles at flyweight , bantamweight , junior featherweight and featherweight and was the 2012 fighter of the year , when he won four fights , won a junior featherweight belt and then unified two titles . in november 2016 , donaire lost a junior featherweight belt by controversial decision to jessie magdaleno and then , in his first fight after parting ways with top rank and signing with promoter richard schaefer of ringstar sports , won a lopsided 10-round decision against ruben garcia hernandez in september . ",
        "`` this is a fight between two of the best featherweights in the world , with multiple world titles between them . these are two fighters who are never boring in the ring , two fighters who come forward and love to engage , '' schaefer said . `` if styles make fights -- well it does n't get any better than this . `` if frampton wins , warren said he would get him a summer world title fight at windsor park , an outdoor soccer stadium in belfast . frampton , with expectations to defeat donaire , said the fight is the perfect way to get him ready for a world title bout , possibly against wales ' lee selby . ",
        "`` he 's been at the top of four divisions , but he was in the same weight division as me for quite a while and he 's someone i 've always kept an eye on , '' frampton said of donaire . `` he 's someone i admire as well and i think he 's a great fighter , but i think this is the perfect fight to get me ready for a world title fight in the summer . `` said warren : `` this is a guaranteed barnburner between two elite featherweights . both men have held multiple world titles and know that a win will lead to another shot at world glory . ",
        "if carl comes through this fight , then it 's the big one at windsor park in the summer next . that is what we promised him and that is what we will deliver if he gets the win in april . ''   "
