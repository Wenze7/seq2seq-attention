        "with all of the uncertainty that surrounds the atlanta braves going into next season , one thing is for sure : they have a deep farm system . and it 's likely to be one arm shallower for the best reason entering 2018 , as no . 6 prospect , luiz gohara appears a likely candidate to be part of the braves ' starting rotation next season , according to projections . `` i 'm ready to just show i can make the starting rotation with the other guys , '' gohara said after his first start in the majors last year . ",
        "`` that 's my goal for next year . to break with the team in spring training and make the rotation . `` after being promoted in september last year , gohara started five games for the braves and went 1-3 with a 4.91 era . he 's going to have to get that era down a bit , of course , but even while scuffling on the surface , he posted an exciting 31 strikeouts and only eight walks in those five games . what makes him even more intriguing and ready to launch is that he 's only 21 years old and can already hit 100 mph with his fastball . ",
        "it may take some time for the braves to really start competing again , but if the future looks anything like gohara , they 'll be back in playoff contention sooner rather than later .   "
