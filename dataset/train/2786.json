        "new york -- joel embiid wanted to give sixers fans the gift of a win on christmas day . he and his teammates accomplished that with a 105-98 victory over the knicks . the sixers snapped a five-game losing streak and improved to 15-18 on the season . kristaps porzingis garners attention in any game and is `` the '' player on the knicks to watch , but this one turned into a battle of the centers . enes kanter put up a massive 31-point , 22-rebound double-double . embiid was right behind with 25 points and 16 boards in 34 minutes . ",
        "- embiid played after going through pregame warmups to test his back . taking the court on christmas day was significant to him . `` to me it 's special because i 've been here four years and we 've gone through a lot and a lot of losing , '' he said before the game . `` to be in this type of matchup , especially with the whole world watching on christmas , i 'm excited . '' - turnovers crept in toward the end of the game . after simmons put the sixers up 103-95 with a two-handed fastbreak dunk , new york 's courtney lee stole the ball from embiid with 30 seconds to go .

        "lee drained a three on the break and embiid fouled porzingis on the play , setting up a potential four-point play . but porzingis missed the free throw and embiid secured the rebound . - embiid took spills throughout the game , including one chasing a ball out of bounds and another colliding with jarrett jack during a drive to the basket . jack was called for a flagrant 1 , which sparked a free-throw shooting flurry by embiid , who finished 7 for 8 from the line . - t. j. mcconnell has a flair for playing against the knicks . ",
        "remember , he hit a game-winning buzzer-beater on them last season . on monday , he contributed a season-high 15 points off the bench . mcconnell became the first sixers reserve player to score 15 points on christmas day since 1988 when ron anderson and gerald henderson both reached that mark . - jj redick made his return after missing the last two games because of right hamstring tightness . the veteran quickly got into a rhythm , scoring 15 points in the first half . he finished with 24 . - both dario saric and robert covington had off-shooting afternoons . ",
        "covington went 2 for 8 from the field and 1 for 4 from three . saric kept looking for his shot when it was n't falling , going 4 for 15 from the field and 0 for 6 from long range . - before the game simmons gifted all of his teammates with beats by dre headphones . - the sixers played on christmas day for the first time since 2001 , when they competed in los angeles against the lakers . historically , the sixers are 6-5 against the knicks on christmas day , but have not faced them on dec. .
