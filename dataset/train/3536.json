        "as reported by the daily mail , manchester united are showing interest in augsburg left-back philipp max ahead of the january transfer window . what 's the story ? the left-back position has been a problem for jose mourinho all season , failing to find a permanent solution despite the emerging form of ashley young . adding competition to that area would serve the united squad well and with a transfer window just around the corner , it 's the perfect to make such a signing . one player who could do the job for united is augsburg defender philipp max , a left-back impressing in the bundesliga this term . ",
        "the daily mail say he 's on jose mourinho 's radar , with united sending scouts to track his progress alongside premier league rivals liverpool and tottenham hotspur . who is he ? a regular for augsburg , who are chasing a european qualification position in the german top-flight this season , max has been in excellent form and is potentially on the brink of his first senior german national team cap . he 's scored one and provided eight assists from left-back so far this term , an excellent contribution from a defender , clearly demonstrating he is n't afraid to get forward and support his attacking teammates . ",
        "it 's fair to say that 's a style that would go down a treat at old trafford . he may not have big club experience , but producing consistently in germany demonstrates he could be ready for such a move and with united looking for a permanent long-term solution in the position , he could be a fantastic choice .
