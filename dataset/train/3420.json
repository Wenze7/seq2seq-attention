        "another year has passed , quicker it seems than the last . it is a time of new beginnings and promises . a time for making up for the things that you did not do , or did not go well , the previous year that you have the opportunity to do again . a fresh start . expectations for 2017i did n't set a new years resolution last year , nor will i set one for this year , purely due to my own fear of failure . however , i did set myself the task of thinking positively . ",
        "so , each day , i wrote at least one positive thing down that had happened that day and on new years eve i will read them all . as well as this , i mentioned the determination to reach 2018 . unfortunately , i did lose this drive . but looking back on this year and what i would have missed out on , it keeps me the power and motivation on my dark days to keep going . reality of 2017it was / will be an unforgettable year . i had the most amazing experiences and met so many incredible people . ",
        "it was a year i could not even vision . i did n't think i 'd get here or live through the year , but i am so glad i did . i am , and will be , forever grateful and indebted to those who looked after me at the beginning of the year . that was rock bottom . they were the worst days and my brain was so foggy i hardly remember january to easter , i just know things that happened and people who i thought were close friends left my life . because of this , i learned who my true friends were and have made numerous global connections and friends this summer . ",
        "i know who is there when i need a little extra help and encouragement to push through , and that being alive is enough . reflecting on 2017i would n't change a thing about this year . everything happens for a reason and the worst days help me appreciate the good days . i ca n't say i do n't fight my demons every day . each morning a battle to leave the safety of my bed occurs . they are always there and arise at the most inconvenient times , but i am slowly learning how to deal with them better , the more i learn more about myself and self-care . ",
        "i may be living on what feels like borrowed time but because of this i have enjoyed and appreciated everyone , everything and opportunity so much more . i do n't usually believe in regrets , but i do regret how much i hurt other people this year . and for that i am sorry . from the bottom of my heart i am genuinely sorry . it was never my intention to hurt you . i just wanted the pain to end and believed my demons . i would not be where i am and who i am without these experiences . ",
        "good and bad , 2017 made me `` me '' for 2018 and for the rest of my life . lessons learnt : 2017 taught me what is truly important in life . the best things are the people you meet and love , the places you 've seen and the memories you 've made along the way - each one has a purpose and lesson in your development . i have also learned about my triggers and warning signs meaning i can better prevent or am stronger to fight through `` no days '' . but most importantly , i learned to stop living my life for other people . ",
        "you ca n't make everybody happy , so do what makes you happy regardless of what others think . they can leave you if they do n't like something but you ca n't leave yourself . 2017 taught me how to be free and how to be me . i do n't even care how cheesy that is ! happy 2018 !   "
