        "on thursday , amazon was the day 's biggest business story after the company released a list of the 20 cities still in play to house its second headquarters , dubbed `` hq2 . `` this location is not meant to replace its original seattle headquarters , but serve as a second headquarters equal in size and scope to the seattle home base . amazon has said it will hire 50,000 workers for this location . and most notably , amazon 's list included three locations in the greater dc metro area -- washington , d. c. , montgomery county , maryland , and northern virginia . ",
        "and that two of these are not cities , but regions , shows that while the retail giant has clearly made this bidding process for its next headquarters an exercise in trying to extract the most generous tax breaks from municipalities , in a perfect world amazon would plant `` hq2 '' in the nation 's capital . washington is where amazon ceo jeff bezos wants to be .   ",
        "as demographer lyman stone noted on twitter on thursday , this list makes clear that amazon 's initial criteria -- which included access to international airports with daily flights to nyc , san francisco , seattle , and d. c. -- appears to be heavily weighted towards access to d. c.one city stood out in amazon 's list of finalists for its new headquarters -- washington , d. c. and while the company had also highlighted its desire to be in a metro of over 1 million people , with colleges nearby to provide tech talent , a `` stable and business-friendly environment , '' not all of these criteria were created equal .",
        "it 's also not surprising that so many of the finalist cities are concentrated in the eastern part of the continent , with several of the finalists within a 90-minute flight of washington , d. c. -- pittsburgh , philadelphia , newark , new jersey , new york city , boston , raleigh , north carolina , and toronto . even at the outset of this process , it would 've been a surprise to see amazon double down on the west coast . additionally , bezos ' connections to d. c. can not be ignored -- bezos owns the washington post through his personal investment fund , and bezos also bought a 27,000 square foot property in the city last yearbut it should also not come as a total surprise that amazon , one of the company 's most-often targeted by president donald trump , is looking towards the nation 's capital as a place to solidify its presence . ",
        "like all major companies , amazon has a significant lobbying presence in d. c. , but looking out to the next ten or twenty years of the relationship between u. s. policymakers and businesses , it seems likely the cozy relationship the tech sector has enjoyed with government changes . at least in some form . and while facebook and google have both taken criticism from lawmakers for their role in spreading misinformation during the 2016 presidential election , amazon 's size and questions about whether some of its business practices are anti-competitive and bad for consumers are not likely to go away in years to come . ",
        "the relationship between companies and sectors and the government will ebb and flow over time . but as amazon takes an even more central role in selling american consumers goods , and ventures into potentially more lucrative spaces like pharmaceuticals , the government is n't likely to ignore the power the company enjoys . and being more closely embedded in a city which , right now , has no major corporate identity would seem to be the kind of forward-thinking idea that ceo jeff bezos has favored since founding the company , and which has helped make him the richest man in the world .
