        "happy winter , everyone ! ca n't believe all this snow we 're having ! kayden 's home from school today because he skips class on the regular , and it 's a perfect day for us to do some fun indoor activities : reading over his shoulder while he composes an instagram comment on becca 's bikini selfie ; asking him for the third time to please shovel the driveway ; standing in the doorway and watching him lace up his boots ; overhearing him ordering pizza from the basement ! i have to say it : god , i love this age . ",
        "this is such a fun age . by 312 months , their language is really starting to develop in new and fascinating ways . sarcasm , random grunting and dramatic sighing when asked literally any question , and strange and silly new words that only make sense in their sweet little imaginations , such as `` woke '' and `` bae '' and `` tinder '' ! i 'll never forget when kayden was about 300 months , we were making cookies , or i was anyway -- he was snopcharting with becca -- and he looked up at me and out of nowhere he goes , `` mom , i 'm calling an uber 'cause i got ta bounce . '' ",
        "bounce ! to describe the act of leaving a place ! at this age , there 's just no limit to how inventive and unique their self-expression can be ! gosh , i still laugh about that . it 'll be a great little anecdote to tell at his wedding one day . although he 'll kill me , i know ! i got ta say , though : 312 months is n't without its challenges . at this phase , they 're putting everything in their mouths -- waffles , wings , hot dogs , rum and coke , joints . ",
        "it 's normal , but it requires us moms to be a little extra vigilant ! the other day , get this : i turned my back for four seconds and kayden was in the middle of putting a bud lite lime into his mouth . `` kayden no '' i shouted , because that beer is a crime against humanity . i snatched it from his lips just in time . eyes open , moms ! these little devils move fast ! it 's okay . we both recovered . i know i 'm biased but i think he 's adorable . ",
        "becca has said several times that she agrees , so clearly i 'm not that biased ! and boy are they learning the word `` no ! '' by 312 months , everything 's all `` no no no ! '' kayden , do you need me to buy you condoms ? ?? ? kayden , have you applied for that scotiabank internship ? ?? kayden , do n't you think it 's maybe time for some new boots ? ?? ? it 's just miraculous to see them assert their independence . my little boy is growing pot ! ",
        "oops , i got ta go . think i hear kayden crying . he did shrooms last night and he 's spent all morning overwhelmed by the beauty of clouds . sounds like someone might need a third nap !   "
