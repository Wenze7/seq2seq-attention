        "spanish goalkeeper adrian almost joined newcastle united in the summer but is looking forward to seeing rafa benitez againwest ham united goalkeeper adrian has praised rafa benitez ahead of the clash at the london stadium this weekend . the spanish stopper was a target of benitez in the summer when the magpies looked at a swap deal with west ham involving karl darlow . however , the deal fell through and adrian has fought back to win the number 1 spot with the hammers . speaking to the west ham programme about meeting up with benitez again , adrian said : `` to be honest , the start of this season was the hardest three or four months i have had at west ham . ",
        "deandre yedlin faces up to newcastle united 's premier league results crisis `` at the end of last season , i got my position in the starting eleven again and i played well and we finished well so to be out of the team at the start of this season was hard for me . `` i knew that , if i worked hard , this opportunity would come , initially in the cup games , and possibly in the premier league , to show my level . `` i have known rafa for a long time . `` he is a very good manager and did a very good job at newcastle when they were in the second tier . ",
        "`` they started the season very well but they have not got good results in their last few games , so it 's a good time for us to give our maximum in our own stadium and get the three points . `` i wish rafa benitez the best but not on saturday ! ''   "
