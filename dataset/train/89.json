        "snapchat is rolling out a major new update , which is leaving some users confused and frustrated . the company has made significant changes to the app , and they have n't gone down well with fans , who are calling for them to be reversed . however , that 's unlikely to happen anytime soon , as the alterations are designed to help the company make money . here 's how to use the new version of snapchat . where to find storiesyou used to be able to access your friends ' stories by swiping left on the main camera screen . ",
        "the update changes this . now , you have to swipe right on the camera screen , to the new friends screen . sponsoredthe friends screenas well as stories , the friends screen contains your friends ' snaps and messages . it looks somewhat messy , and snapchat 's decision to bunch all of these updates on one page appears to be the biggest source of confusion for users . how to watch storiesif one of your friends has posted a story you have n't yet watched , you 'll see a circular preview bubble net to their name . ",
        "to watch the story , tap the bubble . after you watch a friend 's story , you 'll see a preview of another friend 's story . you can tap the screen to watch it , swipe to skip it or swipe down to exit . to re-watch a friend 's story after you 've already seen it , you need to open their profile by tapping their bitmoji on the friends screen . how to find your friendsstories are no longer ordered chronologically . the friends screen instead ranks your friends `` based on who you keep in touch with the most and who 's contacted you most recently '' , snapchat says . ",
        "that means the easiest way to find new stories from anyone who does n't qualify as a top friend could be to type their name into the search bar at the top of the friends screen . how to send snapswhen you take a snap and try to send it to someone , you 'll find the new-look send to screen . the eight people you interact with most on snapchat sit front and centre of this , and right at the top are options to add a new story to my story , our story or group stories .
