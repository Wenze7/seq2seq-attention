        "the last time manchester city managed a victory at anfield was 2003 - they have won at every other premier league ground since the takeoveranfield is the final frontier in manchester city 's bold trek to the stars . the blues have won at every other premier league ground since the 2008 takeover transformed the club , but liverpool remain the last team to hold out after city won at sunderland , southampton and stoke in 2014-15 . but with pep guardiola 's team on a staggering unbeaten run in the premier league , now is as good a time as ever to end the jinx .

        "city have won five times at united since sheikh mansour 's revolution , three times at chelsea and have even managed a couple of victories at their old hoodoo ground , arsenal . but in ten trips to anfield , in league and league cup , city have come away with five draws and five defeats . the last time they won there came courtesy of nicolas anelka 's double against his old club in 2003 , the only success in 36 years . it is a curious stat , especially as the blues have dominated the scousers at home , with five wins and three draws in nine league meetings , culminating in that 5-0 thrashing earlier in the season .

        "yaya toure , who has been involved in most of the meetings in the last seven and a half years , mused on the possibility that liverpool raise their game as a last show of defiance by english football 's old guard . it is clear from social media that many liverpool fans and ex-players have a jealous distaste for the new money at the etihad stadium . kevin de bruyne gives man city contract updateso is that the reason they always double their efforts when city are the visitors to their famous old ground ? said yaya : `` for four or five years now city have been strong and able to win trophies -- and teams like liverpool and united have been on the top of the english league for a long time .

        "`` they are not delighted when we win . so it will be a big battle . `` and i do n't think liverpool will defend . they have a fantastic side , but we have as well , so it will be a great game . '' city 's latest defeat at anfield came on new year 's eve last season , when a georginio wijnaldum header punished them for a slack performance . yaya toure in new claim about controversial carabao cup ballthat damaged their flagging title hopes then , but toure believes that a victory this time around could galvanise the team in the same way as the 1-0 triumph at chelsea did in september . ",
        "that win , at stamford bridge , took city to a new level . said toure : `` i have bad , bad memories of this field . it 's always difficult there -- they are a good team with a good manager and will be a big test for us . `` but if we can get a win there it will be so big for our confidence until the end of the season .
