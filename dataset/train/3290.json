        "christmas spirit . there is nothing more satisfying than walking past a window of a home with a dressed christmas tree glowing back at you . the pretty lights , the fairy on top of the tree and the instant magical feeling you get from even smelling the tiniest bit of cinnamon or gingerbread . wandering past shop window displays with faux snow and mistletoe , the local high-street is transformed into a glistening winter wonderland . and there , at the end of the road is a person dressed up to the nines on a work christmas party . ",
        "slumped on the floor , head in hands adorned with a father christmas hat . but father christmas is n't smiling and handing out presents . father christmas is being sick into his own lap with his or her friend frantically moving out of the way of the vomit . a night in the pub over christmas can go from drinking mulled wine , cosy in front of fire place , to downing fluorescent coloured shots very quickly . i used to get so drunk i would go home and not remember a thing , which would mean i 'd have drunk myself to the point of a black out . ",
        "negotiating my safety , and my mental health the next day . but one christmas , whilst sitting inside a pretty sitting room , mince pies in the oven and beautiful twinkling fairy lights sparkling away on the christmas tree , there could not have been more of an ugly scene . i was being sick into my own lap , for another reason . chemotherapy . after returning from a boozy holiday in benidorm , sleeping all day and drinking for most of the night , i was given the terrifying news that i had grade 3 breast cancer . ",
        "at 25 years old , i was told i only had a 30 % chance of survival . chemotherapy , radiotherapy , herceptin treatment , ivf treatment to freeze my eggs , and delayed reconstructive surgery . bugger . that 's my social life out the window , was one of my first thoughts . i was angry at myself . i blamed myself for getting cancer for a long time , and still do . had it been the booze ? or perhaps the cigarettes ? i 'll never know the cause of my breast cancer , but i had a self-indulgent , excessive lifestyle , and did n't think twice about my health before the day of my diagnosis . ",
        "breast cancer was my new cruel companion now . my breast removed , my hair fallen out from the chemotherapy . and months of treatment ahead . and just like that , i could n't join in with conventional socialising . my social life turned from last orders at the bar , to gossiping with other cancer patients in chemotherapy wards about our ailments . the drinking stopped , the smoking stopped , and my lifestyle dramatically changed . i love socialising , but i learned that i could do this without the added wingman of ` booze ' holding my hand . ",
        "i went on my first ever date - sober . facing my own mortality , i had nothing to lose . terrified and pessimistic , i wondered what sort of fun were we going to have on this date ... go for a walk ? it was just us ... no dj , no alcohol infused confidence . but we talked . and listened . we could hear each other 's words and it was a mutual exchange of conversation . and the next day , i remembered everything . including that i wanted to marry this man . over time i have learned to love myself as a woman , and feel without the excessive consumption of alcohol i have a better chance . ",
        "i also remember my good times the next day , rather than agonise about the lack of memory . and what 's more , i have learned that alcohol is n't synonymous with having fun . i could have a christmas drink , but i know it wo n't stop with one . having been through breast cancer , i knew i could n't go on living the unhealthy lifestyle i used to live , and for me , that means not drinking . i will always love and treasure of the spirit of christmas , i just do n't need to drink vodka to do it . ",
        "enjoy christmas and new year , but spare a thought for your body . dry january is a fantastic way to give talking , instead of toasting glasses , a go . to sit back and reflect on a peaceful christmas . i know i want to remember it . experts estimate that 6 per cent of breast cancers in women are linked to regularly drinking alcohol . breast cancer now , the uk 's largest breast cancer charity , have teamed up with alcohol concern for dry january , to raise awareness that drinking alcohol increases a woman 's breast cancer risk .
