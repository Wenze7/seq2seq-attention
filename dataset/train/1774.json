        "courtesy of zerohedge . view original post here . authored by lew rockwell via mises canada , as the financial crisis of 2008 took shape , the policy recommendations were not slow in coming : why , economic stability and american prosperity demand fiscal and monetary stimulus to jump-start the sick economy back to life . and so we got fiscal stimulus , as well as a program of monetary expansion without precedent in us history . david stockman recently noted that we have in effect had fifteen solid years of stimulus -- not just the high-profile programs like the $ 700 billion tarp and the $ 800 billion in fiscal stimulus , but also $ 4 trillion of money printing and 165 out of 180 months in which interest rates were either falling or held at rock-bottom levels . ",
        "the results have been underwhelming : the number of breadwinner jobs in the us is still two million lower than it was under bill clinton . economists of the austrian school warned that this would happen . while other economists disagreed about whether fiscal or monetary stimulus would do the trick , the austrians looked past this superficial debate and rejected intervention in all its forms . the austrians have very good theoretical reasons for opposing government stimulus programs , but those reasons are liable to remain unknown to the average person , who seldom studies economics and who even more seldom gives non-establishment opinion a fair hearing . ",
        "that 's why it helps to be able to point to historical examples , which are more readily accessible to the non-specialist than is economic theory . if we can point to an economy correcting itself , this alone overturns the claim that government intervention is indispensable . possibly the most arresting example of precisely this phenomenon is the case of the depression of 1920 -- 21 , which was characterized by a collapse in production and gdp and a spike in unemployment to double-digit levels . but by the time the federal government even began considering intervention , the crisis had ended . ",
        "what commerce secretary herbert hoover deferentially called `` the president 's conference on unemployment , '' an idea he himself had cooked up to smooth out the business cycle , convened during what turned out to be the second month of the recovery , according to the national bureau of economic research . indeed , according to the nber , which announces the beginnings and ends of recessions , the depression began in january 1920 and ended in july 1921 . james grant tells the story in his important and captivating new book the forgotten depression -- 1921 : the crash that cured itself . ",
        "a word about the author : grant ranks among the most brilliant of financial experts . in addition to publishing his highly regarded newsletter , grant 's interest rate observer , for more than thirty years , grant is a frequent commentator on television and radio , the author of numerous other books , and a captivating speaker . we 've been honored and delighted to feature him as a speaker at mises institute events . what exactly were the federal reserve and the federal government doing during these eighteen months ? the numbers do n't lie : monetary policy was contractionary during the period in question . ",
        "allan meltzer , who is not an austrian , wrote in a history of the federal reserve that `` principal monetary aggregates fell throughout the recession . '' he calculates a decline in m1 by 10.9 percent from march 1920 to january 1922 , and in the monetary base by 6.4 percent from october 1920 to january 1922 . `` quarterly average growth of the base , '' he continues , `` did not become positive until second quarter 1922 , nine months after the nber trough . '' the fed raised its discount rate from 4 percent in 1919 to 7 percent in 1920 and 6 percent in 1921 . ",
        "by 1922 , after the recovery was long since under way , it was reduced to 4 percent once again . meanwhile , government spending also fell dramatically ; as the economy emerged from the 1920 -- 21 downturn , the budget was in the process of being reduced from $ 6.3 billion in 1920 to $ 3.2 billion in 1922 . so the budget was being cut and the money supply was falling . `` by the lights of keynesian and monetarist doctrine alike , '' writes grant , `` no more primitive or counterproductive policies could be imagined . '' ",
        "in addition , price deflation was more severe during 1920 -- 21 than during any point in the great depression ; from mid-1920 to mid-1921 , the consumer price index fell by 15.8 percent . we can only imagine the panic and the cries for intervention were we to observe such price movements today . the episode fell down the proverbial memory hole , and grant notes that he can not find an example of a public figure ever having held up the 1920 -- 21 example as a data point worth considering today . but although keynesians today , now that the episode is being discussed once again , assure everyone that they are perfectly prepared to explain the episode away , in fact keynesian economic historians in the past readily admitted that the swiftness of the recovery was something of a mystery to them , and that recovery had not been long in coming despite the absence of stimulus measures . ",
        "the policy of official inaction during the 1920 -- 21 depression came about as a combination of circumstance and ideology . woodrow wilson had favored a more pronounced role for the federal government , but by the end of his term two factors made any such effort impossible . first , he was obsessed with the ratification of the treaty of versailles , and securing us membership in the league of nations he had inspired . this concern eclipsed everything else . second , a series of debilitating strokes left him unable to do much of anything by the fall of 1919 , so any major domestic initiatives were out of the question . ",
        "because of the way fiscal years are dated , wilson was in fact responsible for much of the postwar budget cutting , a substantial chunk of which occurred during the 1920 -- 21 depression . warren harding , meanwhile , was philosophically inclined to oppose government intervention and believed a downturn of this kind would work itself out if no obstacles were placed in its path . he declared in his acceptance speech at the 1920 republican convention : we will attempt intelligent and courageous deflation , and strike at government borrowing which enlarges the evil , and we will attack high cost of government with every energy and facility which attend republican capacity . ",
        "we promise that relief which will attend the halting of waste and extravagance , and the renewal of the practice of public economy , not alone because it will relieve tax burdens but because it will be an example to stimulate thrift and economy in private life . let us call to all the people for thrift and economy , for denial and sacrifice if need be , for a nationwide drive against extravagance and luxury , to a recommittal to simplicity of living , to that prudent and normal plan of life which is the health of the republic . ",
        "there has n't been a recovery from the waste and abnormalities of war since the story of mankind was first written , except through work and saving , through industry and denial , while needless spending and heedless extravagance have marked every decay in the history of nations . harding , that least fashionable of american presidents , was likewise able to look at falling prices soberly and without today 's hysteria . he insisted that the commodity price deflation was unavoidable , and perhaps even salutary . `` we hold that the shrinkage which has taken place is somewhat analogous to that which occurs when a balloon is punctured and the air escapes . '' ",
        "moreover , said harding , depressions followed inflation `` just as surely as the tides ebb and flow , '' but spending taxpayer money was no way to deal with the situation . `` the excess of stimulation from that source is to be reckoned a cause of trouble rather than a source of cure . '' even john skelton williams , comptroller of the currency under woodrow wilson and no friend of harding , observed that the price deflation was `` inevitable , '' and that in any case `` the country is now in many respects on a sounder basis , economically , than it has been for years . '' ",
        "and we should look forward to the day when `` the private citizen is able to acquire , at the expenditure of $ 1 of his hard-earned money , something approximating the quantity and quality which that dollar commanded in prewar times . '' thankfully for the reader , not only is grant right on the history and the economics , but he also writes with a literary flair one scarcely expects from the world of financial commentary . and although he has all the facts and figures a reader could ask for , grant is also a storyteller . ",
        "this is no dry sheaf of statistics . it is full of personalities -- businessmen , union bosses , presidents , economists -- and relates so much more than the bare outline of the depression . grant gives us an expert 's insight into the stock market 's fortunes , and those of american agriculture , industry , and more . he writes so engagingly that the reader almost does n't realize how difficult it is to make a book about a single economic episode utterly absorbing . the example of 1920 -- 21 was largely overlooked , except in specialized treatments of american economic history , for many decades . ",
        "the cynic may be forgiven for suspecting that its incompatibility with today 's conventional wisdom , which urges demand management by experts and an ever-expanding mandate for the fed , might have had something to do with that . whatever the reason , it 's back now , as a rebuke to the planners with their equations and the cronies with their bailouts . the forgotten depression has taken its rightful place within the corpus of austro-libertarian revisionist history , that library of works that will lead you from the dead end of conventional opinion to the fresh air of economic and historical truth .
