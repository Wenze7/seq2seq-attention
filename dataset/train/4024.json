        "los angeles -- ethan and aiden dvash-banks are toddler twins who share almost everything : the same toys , the same nursery , the same clothes and the same parents . everything but a toothbrush and us citizenship . to remedy what their parents , a gay married couple , view as an injustice , ethan dvash-banks became a plaintiff at the tender age of 16 months in a federal lawsuit against the us state department that seeks the same rights his brother has as a citizen . `` what we 're trying to do is pursue justice for ethan , '' said elad dvash-banks , his biological dad , `` and correct a wrong that the state department is continuing to pursue that might affect other couples . '' ",
        "the lawsuit was one of two filed monday by an lgbtq immigrant rights group that said the state department is discriminating against same-sex bi-national couples by denying their children citizenship at birth . the cases filed in los angeles and washington by immigration equality said the children of a us citizen who marries abroad are entitled to us citizenship at birth no matter where they are born and even if the other parent is a foreigner . the state department said it does n't comment on pending litigation , but pointed to guidance on its website that says a father who is a us citizen must be the genetic parent for the child to become a us citizen at birth . ",
        "aaron morris , executive director of immigration equality , said the state department is wrongly interpreting a policy for children born out of wedlock to married same-sex couples . `` if a mother and father walk into a consulate and have a marriage certificate and birth certificate , they 're never asked any questions about the biology of the child , '' said aaron morris , executive director of immigration equality . `` but the converse is also true and every same-sex couple will be asked that . '' the other case filed monday involves two women , one from the us and one from italy , who met in new york , wed in london and each gave birth to a son . ",
        "the state department did n't recognize the couple 's marriage , the lawsuit said , and only recognized the citizenship of the mother who was born and raised in the us . andrew dvash-banks was studying in israel when he met his future husband , elad , an israeli citizen . because they could n't marry at the time in the us or in israel , they moved to canada , where they wed in 2010 . each boy was conceived with donor eggs and the sperm from a different father , but born by the same surrogate mother minutes apart in september 2016 . ",
        "everything seemed fine until the couple brought their cranky infants to the american consulate in toronto a few months later to apply for citizenship and the woman at the counter began asking probing questions they found shocking and humiliating . she told them she had discretion to require a dna test to show who the biological father was of each boy and without those tests neither son would get citizenship , . the men knew that andrew was aiden 's biological father and elad was ethan 's but they had n't planned on telling anyone . `` i started crying , '' andrew dvash-banks said . ",
        "`` these are twins , how can you differentiate between them ? they were born minutes apart . '' after submitting the dna test results , the couple received two envelopes from the us on the same day in march . a large one included aiden 's passport inside . the other was just a letter notifying andrew that ethan 's application had been denied .
