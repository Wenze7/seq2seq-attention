        "washington -- anchorage , alaska , was warmer tuesday than jacksonville , florida . the weather in the u. s. is that upside down . that 's because the arctic 's deeply frigid weather escaped its regular atmospheric jail that traps the worst cold . it then meandered south to the central and eastern united states . and this has been happening more often in recent times , scientists say . ___ why is it so cold ? super cold air is normally locked up in the arctic in the polar vortex , which is a gigantic circular weather pattern around the north pole . ",
        "a strong polar vortex keeps that cold air hemmed in . `` then when it weakens , it causes like a dam to burst , '' and the cold air heads south , said judah cohen , a winter storm expert for atmospheric environmental research , a commercial firm outside boston . `` this is not record-breaking for canada or alaska or northern siberia , it 's just misplaced , '' said cohen , who had forecast a colder than normal winter for much of the u. s.is this unusual ? yes , but more for how long -- about 10 days -- the cold has lasted , than how cold it has been . ",
        "on tuesday , boston tied its seven-day record for the most consecutive days at or below 20 degrees that was set exactly 100 years ago . more than 1,600 daily records for cold were tied or broken in the last week of december , according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration . for greg carbin of the national weather service 's weather prediction center , the most meaningful statistics are how last week 's average temperature was the second coldest in more than a century of record-keeping for minneapolis , chicago , detroit and kansas city , third coldest in pittsburgh and fifth coldest in new york city . ",
        "is it just the u. s. ? pretty much . while the united states has been in the deep freeze , the rest of the globe has been toastier than normal . the globe as a whole was 0.9 degrees warmer than normal tuesday and the arctic was more than 6 degrees warmer than normal , according to the university of maine climate change institute 's analysis . what 's next ? the cold will continue and could actually worsen for much of the east coast this weekend because of a monster storm that 's brewing in the atlantic and caribbean , what meteorologists are calling a `` snow hurricane '' or `` bomb cyclone . ",
        "`` but forecasters do n't think the storm will hit the east coast , keeping most of the snow and worst winds over open ocean , although parts of the northeast are still likely to get high winds , waves and some snow . `` for the northeast , this weekend might be the coldest of the coldest with the storm , '' said jason furtado , a university of oklahoma meteorology professor . `` we could be ending with a big hurrah . `` what makes the polar vortex move ? this is an area of hot debate and research among scientists and probably is a mix of human-caused climate change and natural variability , said furtado . ",
        "climate change has n't made the polar vortex more extreme , but it probably is making it move more , which makes the weather seem more extreme , he said . a recent study by potsdam institute climate scientist marlene kretschmer found the polar vortex has weakened and meandered more often since 1990 , but that study focused more on europe . ongoing research shows that there seems to be a similar connection for more frequent arctic cold snaps like what the u. s. is now experiencing , kretschmer said . how can it be so cold with global warming ? ",
        "do n't confuse weather -- which is a few days or weeks in one region -- with climate , which is over years and decades and global . weather is like a person 's mood , which changes frequently , while climate is like someone 's personality , which is more long-term , furtado said . `` a few cold days does n't disprove climate change , '' furtado said . `` that 's just silly . just like a couple down days on the stock market does n't mean the economy is going into the trash .
