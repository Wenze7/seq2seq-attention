        "the miami heat may have had their ups and downs so far this season , but when it comes to clutch situations , they know what they 're doing . following the miami heat 's nail-biting overtime victory over the new york knicks on friday , the heat 's couper moorhead tweeted out a noteworthy stat about the team 's clutchness . heat are now 15-7 in clutch games , the second-most clutch wins in the league trailing only boston . -- couper moorhead january 6 , 2018 . miami 's 15 victories in clutch situations rank them third in the nba , in good company behind the boston celtics and cleveland cavaliers . ",
        "their . 682 win percentage in the clutch , adds even more noteworthy names to the mix , with the san antonio spurs and the golden state warriors in the top five . with dion waiters out indefinitely , and hassan whiteside only five games back from missing 13 with a knee injury , that the heat survive close games with two of their three leading scorers in rocky waters , is a testament to the cohesion among miami 's players . the biggest difference between miami and others of the nba 's clutch-leading teams is their unassuming nature . ",
        "since dwyane wade 's departure in 2016 , the heat have lacked a definitive option for clutch situations . whereas the cavaliers and celtics can all but guarantee that lebron james and kyrie irving will have the ball in their hands as the clock ticks down respectively , the heat have opted for a more organic approach to closing out late games . if josh richardson is in his rhythm , maybe the heat defer to him . or , if whiteside is having his way in the post , running a play for a quick lob and slam could be miami 's best option . ",
        "while fans still revel in the glory of waiters ' pull-up-and-pose 3-ball against the warriors last season , the ability for head coach eric spoelstra to cater to the hot hand and surprise defenses in the clutch , has been important for miami 's success . additionally , not relying on a single player in game-winning situations has given the heat the luxury of avoiding forcing bad shots at the buzzer . consider the november matchup against the washington wizards . rather than make a risky move towards the hoop to extend their one-point lead to pressure the wizards , the heat wait for the foul as time winds down , sending james johnson to the line who knocks in the pair . ",
        "however , against the knicks last friday , the heat let the sharpshooting wayne ellington stay in the game late , threatening the shots from the perimeter , even though he took and made just one shot from beyond the arc . leaving scoring options on the floor but not overusing them , keeps the opposition guessing on defense , allowing for exploitable mistakes . staying above . 500 in the clutch is surely a net-positive for the any team , and seeing the heat among the league 's best , definitely breeds confidence in the squad 's late-game heroics .
