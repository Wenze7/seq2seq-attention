        "olivier giroud will push for a move away from arsenal in january if a tempting offer is made , admits his agent michael manuello . the french striker has not rocked the transfer boat so far , despite struggling for starts under arsene wenger . he has , however , admitted that he will be left with little choice but to consider his future at emirates stadium once the winter window opens -- with world cup ambitions at the back of his mind . giroud 's representative has now reiterated that a switch could be made , with arsene wenger called upon to respect the 31-year-old 's wishes if a suitable approach is received . ",
        "manuello told foot mercato : `` it can make things complicated , but a clash , that kind of thing is not in olivier 's nature , nor in mine . `` now , depending on the offers , we will sit around a table and talk . the most important thing is to know what will be offered or not this winter , to find a better project . `` there will be approaches . all clubs looking for an attacker are likely to come . we must be careful and , if there is something obvious that will appear , we will try to convince arsene to return to what has been said . '' ",
        "giroud was heavily linked with everton over the summer , and a stay in england would appear to be among the preferred options . a return to his homeland was also mooted for the experienced frontman during the last window , with marseille said to be leading the chase , but manuello has ruled out a move to ligue 1 . he added : `` olivier will not come back to france . unless there is a change in his state of mind , to date the intention is not to return to france . `` there has been no new approach from marseille . ",
        "i have no information that marseille was trying to contact us . '' giroud has been handed just one premier league start by arsenal this season . he has , however , found the target seven times in 24 appearances , with the 2017-18 campaign seeing him pass the 100-goal mark for the gunners and match ole gunnar solskjaer 's record for most efforts netted from off the bench in the english top-flight .
