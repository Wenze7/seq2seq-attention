        "washington -- michael wolff defended his newly released book on the trump white house in the face of attacks from the president , white house staff , and his legal team . in his first interview on `` today '' regarding `` fire and fury : inside the trump white house , '' wolff was asked about a cease and desist letter sent on thursday by trump 's lawyer , an effort to stop the publication of the tome : `` where do i send the box of chocolates ? '' `` not only is he helping me sell books , but he is helping me prove the point of the book , '' wolff said . ",
        "`` this is extraordinary that the president of the united states would try to stop the publication of a book . this does n't happen , has not happened from other presidents , would not even happen from a ceo of a mid-sized company . '' as excerpts from the book have been published and details have been leaked , the fly-on-the-wall quotes and assertions have been a sensation in washington and the media world , and are likely to be picked apart for days , if not weeks . trump himself weighed in late on thursday , sending a tweet in which he said he `` never spoke to him for the book . ",
        "'' `` full of lies , misrepresentations , and sources that do n't exist , '' trump wrote . in the interview , wolff said he did talk to trump , and `` whether he realized it was an interview or not , i do n't know . but it certainly was not off the record . '' `` my credibility is being questioned by a man who has less credibility than , perhaps , anyone who have ever walked on earth at this point , '' wolff said . his publisher , henry holt & co. , moved up the release date to friday despite the legal threat . ",
        "`` one of the things that we have to count on is that donald trump will attack , '' wolff said . `` he will send lawyers ' letters . this is a 35-year history of how he approaches everything . '' the book portrays trump as woefully unfit for office . wolff said `` 100 % of the people around him '' question his ability to do the job . `` i will tell you the one description that everyone gave . they all say , he is like a child , '' wolff said . he also said he has material to back up his claims in the book . ",
        "`` i work like every journalist works , so i have recordings , i have notes . i am certainly and absolutely in every way comfortable with everything i have reported in this book , '' he said .   "
