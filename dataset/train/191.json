        "1 . be authentically you : many times we start to concern ourselves on how to get more clients or how do i get others to follow us on social media or to like our stuff . the worst way to do so is try to be something your not or trying to be what others like . be yourself and those who recognize real will follow you . when willie from duck dynasty asked bill clinton `` why do you like my show ? '' bill responded `` because it is real . '' be you and be comfortable in your own skin . ",
        "2 . embrace your story : many of us become ashamed of our past and spend the rest of our lives trying to escape the shadows of our background but we must learned to embrace our short comings and not look at the past as negative but as grass roots that set a standard on who we were met to be . your story is yours and it should be looked at as learning experiences or even something to laugh at and poke fun with . 3 . do n't take yourself so serious : sometimes you have to relax into success . ",
        "make fun of yourself and be light hearted , the light hearted are the greatest communicators and influencers because they give the audience the excuse to relax and be in a good mood . when people associate you with pleasure the more they will want to be around you . we also learned about real estate investing , stocks and bitcoin . i will explain more in latter blogs . i hope this helps a little with your personal branding and how to stand out amoung the rest .
