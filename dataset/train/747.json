        "jon rahm is still getting to grips with the meteoric rise sparked by his victory in the 2017 farmers insurance open . the 23-year-old spaniard 's first us pga tour title here last year pushed him into the top 50 in the world rankings . he arrived at torrey pines for his title defense ranked number two in the world . `` it 's kind of hard to process it , to be honest , because i live my day-to-day life with my girlfriend and my team around me and they do n't change their behavior based on what i do , '' he said tuesday . ",
        "`` i got a little bit of it when i went back to spain and i realized what a huge deal my year had become over there , but i feel like the less i think about it , the better . `` rahm 's win at torrey was followed by back-to-back top-five finishes in world golf championships events . then came wins in the european tour 's irish open and season-ending dp world tour championship . he supplanted three-time major winner jordan spieth as number two in the world on monday after winning the careerbuilder challenge in la quinta , california , at the fourth hole of a sudden-death playoff against andrew landry . ",
        "rahm capped his final round at torrey pines last year by rolling in a 60-foot eagle putt , but he said the key to his round was his second shot out of a fairway bunker at 13 , which left him an 18-footer for eagle . `` if i do n't put that ball on the green , which is actually a lot harder than making that putt , the back-nine charge would have never happened and this year might have never happened , so that shot is the one that made everything possible , '' he said . rahm is the fourth spaniard to rise as high as he has in the world rankings , following in the footsteps of seve ballesteros , jose maria olazabal and sergio garcia . ",
        "he said he wo n't be focusing his attention on seizing the number one spot from american dustin johnson . `` i 'll try to focus more on what 's going on this week rather than what comes with it if i win , '' he said .   "
