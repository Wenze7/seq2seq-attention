        "payroll provider adp said it is acquiring workmarket , a startup that specializes in workforce management software that operates across a wide range of employees and contractors , for an undisclosed sum . the software aims to create a kind of unified interface for managing an extended workforce that can include a variety of workers with different employment status , from contractors and freelancers to full-time employees . as many companies work with contractors -- and a lot of companies are already tapping a much wider swath of workers that are n't full-time employees -- software for managing extended workforce could be increasingly valuable . ",
        "workmarket includes payment systems , management for extended employee networks , as well as a marketplace for piecing together a workforce that can fill the gaps for a company that 's looking to operate outside of the traditional range that full-time employees might operate . all these tools , which the startup looks to wrap into a more straightforward and less complex product , are hallmarks of a company looking to woo small businesses before they hit a point that necessitates larger and more robust workforce management products . for adp , it would seem to give the company that traditionally specializes in payroll another tool to convince enterprises to use it as part of a larger system of workforce products . ",
        "while adp has been a larger incumbent , these kinds of acquisitions are important to show that it can be agile and compete with smaller companies that are gobbling up small businesses by pitching easier-to-use tools that help remove the headache of implementing complicated systems . workmarket , founded in 2010 , has raised more than $ 50 million from firms like union square ventures and spark capital . the startup raised $ 25 million from accenture and foundry group in april last year . this article originally appeared on techcrunch .
