        "in early january , iran experienced its biggest protest wave since the suppression of the green movement in 2009 . in spite of shaking the islamic republic , these demonstrations did not produce any major political changes . leaderless and without a clear political goal , the protesters could not sustain the initial momentum . they had no support from the political elites ; even reformists did n't back them fearing `` syria-isation '' of iran or losing their share of power . iran 's coercive apparatus did its job and cracked down on the protests with severity . this and other protest movements in the future are unlikely to win the battle with the security forces as long as hardliners call the shots in iran . ",
        "yet , there might soon be an opportunity for change from the top . one of the biggest barriers to change and political reform in iran has been supreme leader ayatollah khamenei , who has stood behind hardliners and promoted conservative politics . but ayatollah khamenei is 78 , and according to many reports , in poor health as well . so what happens when khamenei dies ? who will choose the next leader ? if khamenei dies or is deemed unable to fulfil his duties , a three-member council will take over his functions . the council includes the iranian president , the head of the judiciary and a theologian of the guardian council , a conservative body in charge of interpreting iran 's constitution . ",
        "they will have the powers of the supreme leader until the assembly of experts , a body of 88 upper-level muslim leaders , chooses the successor . members of the assembly of experts are elected by the iranian people for eight years , after first passing through the filter and approval of the guardian council . how and who the experts of the assembly will choose as the next supreme leader would depend on a lot of factors . one of them is the ideological make-up of the assembly . the last election for the assembly took place in 2016 . ",
        "some interpreted the result as a victory for moderates , who claimed they won 59 percent of the seats and unseated prominent hardline members . but some also saw it as a victory for the radicals , as the assembly chose one of the most prominent hardliners , ayatollah ahmad janati , as its chairman with 51 votes . as a result , it seems the assembly is divided into three main groups : pragmatists , hardliners , and independents . the independent group is the most important one because their swing votes can change the outcome . in addition , various political players will influence the decision of the assembly , including the islamic revolutionary guard corps , the office of ayatollah khamenei , various muslim leaders and the government . ",
        "a chance for changeayatollah khamenei has mentioned that his successor should be a revolutionary and has asked members of the assembly of experts not to be `` timid '' in selecting his successor . his office , iran 's deep state , is likely to support a hardliner ; radical muslim leaders and the irgc are likely to back the same candidate . however , the current iranian president , hassan rouhani , who is also a senior muslim leader and considered a pragmatist , also stands a chance of being selected as the next supreme leader . this likelihood is even higher if khamenei leaves office or dies , while rouhani is still president . ",
        "as a member of the assembly of experts , president rouhani has more power to lobby and influence the selection process . as a recently leaked video of the session in which the assembly of experts chose khamenei in 1989 shows , a small group of members can wield a lot of power in selecting the leader . rouhani is the most powerful man among the current members of the assembly . as president of the republic , he can co-opt and coerce the others and his bureaucratic , security and clerical background could help him set up alliances with different groups and power blocs . ",
        "he is the most experienced and respected muslim leader on the international arena and is less ideological compared with the other members of the assembly . as a pragmatist , he has the support of technocrats and iran 's bureaucracy . he also has the backing of traditional muslim leaders , who support the separation of religion and politics in seminaries . although the irgc commanders mainly belong to the hardliner camp , the irgc itself is not a monolithic entity . there are a number of pragmatists in high positions within the corps , including rear admiral ali shamkhani , the secretary of the supreme national security council . ",
        "rouhani himself has extensive experience in iran 's military and security apparatus . he used to be deputy to second-in-command of iran 's joint chiefs of staff , member of the supreme defence council and deputy commander of war in the 1980s . he was also national security adviser under presidents akbar hashemi rafsanjani and mohammed khatami . although iranians who want to see a transition from theocracy to a democratic state know that rouhani would not push for such radical change , they would still prefer to see him as supreme leader than a hardliner . if he indeed makes it to the position of supreme leader , hardliners would be sidelined and technocrats and apolitical muslim leaders would be empowered . ",
        "rouhani has adopted his mentor rafsanjani 's model of development for iran ; he wants to see this country become the `` islamic version '' of china with a strong military and economy . he wants iran to be a country which operates independently of the west but has a good relationship with it . if rouhani assumes the position of supreme leader , he would not bring radical political liberalisation . however , he would improve iran 's economy and expand civil liberties for the general population . rouhani as a supreme leader would also have the power to reign in the security apparatus and curb its brutality . ",
        "these policies , which would move iran towards normalisation and socioeconomic liberalisation would be welcomed by iranians who do not want to see foreign intervention or another revolution . rouhani 's bid for the position of supreme leader is wrought with challenges . unlike khamenei , who did n't have any strong rivals in 1989 , rouhani has many challengers and is likely to face fierce opposition . if he does win , however , iran would likely experience a major transformation . the views expressed in this article are the author 's own and do not necessarily reflect al jazeera 's editorial stance .
