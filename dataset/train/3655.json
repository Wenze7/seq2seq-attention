        "word of 2018i was asked what my word for 2018 will be and i realised i 'd given it no thought whatsoever - too busy working , procrastinating , and feeling like an imposter . giving way to certain yearnings , i 've always wanted to be able to say what i 'm feeling . i 'm always catching myself looking on enviously at those that can and do say what they 're thinking and feeling . repercussions of such actions has always led me to stay pretty silent . the word ` honesty ' sprang to mind but to me , that almost gives a sense of carte blanche -- a ` fuck you , i 'm just being honest ' , moral compass and empathy be damned attitude . ",
        "dismissing that , perhaps ` authentic ' . authentic to me is not just an honesty in feelings but an honesty in actions and behaviour . to align ones own values , to have them settle deep within and not be swayed off course by trying to fit in , by trying constantly to be right , or for the fear of hurting another . its a fucking tall ask though ! this adoption of authenticity will challenge my practices , my ego , my relationships , my narrative but , to be authentic is to be free . all the best in 2018 .
