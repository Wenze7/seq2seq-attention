        "`` whosoever is delighted in solitude is either a wild beast or a god . '' -- aristotlei woke up today feeling blah . but then i decided to make some coffee , build some sort of a nest on my floor and just write my way through this emotional pain . so lets go ! grab a snack . get some butter . let 's go on this journey together . loneliness . the almighty loneliness . it has finally creeped up on me and i feel oh so lost . i used to love to hang out by myself . ",
        "but on most days now ... . them good old lonely thoughts take over . and it sucks , because about a month ago i had an epiphany , a realization in life ... of what i want . like really want . i am finally letting myself feel emotions i have been pressing down for a year or so . yet ... . why do i feel so disconnected from myself even though i thought i was on the right path ? i read somewhere that it 's part of the `` waking up '' experience . that you just need to face the loneliness and experience it . ",
        "i do feel that being by yourself is a necessity to achieve . especially when going through self-actualization , which i think is happening to me . self-actualization , according to maslow , represents growth of an individual toward fulfillment of the highest needs ; those for meaning in life , in particular . i guess i identify with that . so what do i do ? where do i start ? i 've done all the things that i thought would kill the loneliness . online dating . going out with my friends . hitting on hot boys and girls . ",
        "having casual sex with them . building a large social circle . bla bla bla blargh . but here i am , feeling lonelier than ever . so the best way to solve a problem is to resolve its root cause . and i 've realised ... it 's me . i 'm the problem . even though i am so happy about how i 'm finally growing as a person . i need to find ways to connect with myself again . i want to experience the beauty of life alone and feel happy . not sad and shitty about the fact that i am experiencing it alone . ",
        "as i feel ... however much i try , i will end up alone anyway . why run from it ? i want to try and embrace this loneliness now . figure it out now . as nobody is going to fill that void of mine . i need to stop distracting myself . i need to face the music . fucking embrace it . so i 'll go on a walk now and later i 'll dance around in my room like a maniac . and nobody will get an invite . not today . today will be all about me . ",
        "i guess i 'll start with that . because god damnit , i 'm the best form of entertainment i have .   "
