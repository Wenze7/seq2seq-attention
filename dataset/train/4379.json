        "boston -- it appears the patriots are looking to add to their defense ahead of the final week of the regular season . veteran linebacker/defensive end james harrison is spending his tuesday at gillette stadium visiting with the pats , according to several reports . harrison , 39 , was released by the pittsburgh steelers on saturday and went unclaimed on waivers . according to a report from cbs sports over the weekend , the patriots and baltimore ravens are both interested in adding the veteran to their mix . the patriots and steelers are currently vying for the top seed in the afc , while the ravens currently sit in one of the afc 's wild card spot heading into week 17 . ",
        "pittsburgh 's all time sack leader , harrison did not do much for the steelers this season and played just 40 defensive snaps this season . it 's worth wondering what he has left in the tank , but the patriots could certainly use another body on defense with several players dinged up . new england has trey flowers , rookie deatrich wise and eric lee at the top of their depth chart , with linebackers kyle van noy and marquis flowers filling in along the edge depending on the patriots ' defensive set . marquis flowers played great in sunday 's win over the bills in van noy 's absence , leading the team with 10 tackles and 2.5 sacks , but the pats could use more depth at linebacker without dont ' a hightower . ",
        "veteran david harris saw an uptick in playing time when hightower was lost for the year in week 7 , but did not play on sunday despite being on new england 's active roster . harrison has 82.5 career sacks , the eighth-most among active players . he recorded five sacks to lead the steelers last season , and recorded his only sack of the 2017 season back in week 6 in a pittsburgh win in kansas city .
