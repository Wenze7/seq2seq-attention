        "afp/file / jeff pachoud froome said the uci was `` absolutely right '' to scrutinise the test results . four-time tour de france winner chris froome had twice the permissible amount of asthma medication in his system during the vuelta race in september , the uci and his team revealed on wednesday . cycling 's governing body said an anti-doping test that the british team sky rider took in spain on september 7 showed more than the allowable level of 1,000 ng/ml of the drug salbutamol in his body . team sky gave more information , saying the test showed the presence of 2,000 ng/ml -- twice the allowed limit -- but said froome had taken the medicine because he had suffered from asthma towards the end of the race , which he went on to win . ",
        "the team insisted however that 32-year-old froome had taken no more than the amount allowed under the rules . the uci has asked froome to provide more information but in line with world anti-doping agency guidelines has not suspended him . team sky said in a statement : `` during the final week of the vuelta , chris experienced acute asthma symptoms . on the advice of the team sky doctor , he used an increased dosage of salbutamol in the run-up to the 7 september urine test . `` sky said froome had declared his use of the medication , adding : `` the notification of the test finding does not mean that any rule has been broken . ",
        "`` froome himself said the uci was `` absolutely right '' to scrutinise the test results . he said that during the vuelta he had `` followed the team doctor 's advice to increase my salbutamol dosage '' . `` as always , i took the greatest care to ensure that i did not use more than the permissible dose , '' he said . `` together with the team , i will provide whatever information requires , '' he added . - raises questions - froome was notified of the test on september 20 , the day he finished third in the world time-trial championship in bergen , norway . ",
        "he has not competed since then , but has announced his intention to try to win at least two of the three big tours , in france and in italy , in 2018 . froome , widely considered the greatest tour rider of his generation , is scheduled to race the giro d'italia in may 2018 ahead of defending his tour de france title in july 2018 . sky 's aim for next year was to have froome enter a clique of riders who held all three grand tour titles at the same time , and for him to clinch a record equalling fifth tour de france title after his victories in 2013 , 2015 , 2016 and 2017 . ",
        "the test is bound to raise new questions about british cycling following the scandal surrounding the only previous british tour de france winner , bradley wiggins , over his use of so-called therapeutic use exemptions . it emerged that wiggins received tues in order to take a corticosteroid before his three biggest races in 2011 , 2012 and 2013 , including his 2012 tour de france win . wiggins and sky have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing , saying the drug was prescribed to treat a longstanding pollen allergy . in 2008 italian sprinter alessandro petacchi was given a 12-month ban and stripped of five stage wins in the 2007 giro d'italia despite having a tue for salbutamol , having also exceeded the limit .
