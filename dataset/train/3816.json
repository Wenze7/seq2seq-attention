        "by caleb gibbons , cfa , frm , -- originally at ibankcoin . few things are viewed with as much distain as us treasuries , or more generically the `` rates '' market for 2018 and beyond . finding the correct instrument to short the rates market and perhaps more importantly choosing the right tenor is difficult for the average investor . 10 year ust sold off by 7bp today and went out yielding 2.55 % , the cheapest of the year . estimates are for a 3 handle and even 4 % 12-18 months out . barron 's recent poll saw 10 year ust estimates ranging from 1.95 % to 3.10 % with the median estimate 2.65 % . ",
        "ht patrick burbon @pbourbon . all the `` big guns '' have declared open season on the long duration us rates market , it appears : . gundlach holds the current title of bond king having built doubleline from scratch post tcw to > $ 100bln in aum in just a few years . dsl , doubline income solutions is only $ 2bln of this aum , but continues to impress . jeff is calling the current environment the era of quantitative tightening , driven by a hawkish ecb . stateside gundlach sees a us$ 1.9 tln in 19 â€² bond supply . ",
        "he also noted that it is a very poor time to buy corporate bonds and gundlach sees a negative return for the s&p in 2018 as the rates rout eventually gives the equity market the yips . gundlach see the 10 year ust yield getting to 3.25 % in short order . everyone seems to need to comment on bitcoin too , jeff thinks the highs have been printed . bill gross from janus capital group , who built his > $ 1bln wealth at allianz 's pimco and was the bond king until gundlach wrestled it from gross 's arthritic hands , is also a bond bear . ",
        "gross stated today that 25 year trend lines in both 5 and 10 year treasuries have been broken , signaling a bear market . sovereign buyers are taking pause with respect to incremental ust purchases as the hedging costs to bring the assets back to their home currency have become prohibitive , in some cases . the big players are reticent to place large ust positions on unhedged given most are marked to market , with the degree to which they are offside promptly reported . significant career risk indeed . while 10 year ust closed out 2017 almost the same yield as 2016 , much has transpired with respect to curvature , namely curve flattening . ",
        "5-10 's closed the year sub 0.20 % , whereas 2-10 's went out at 0.518 % , from a relatively steep 1.28 % to start 2017 . best to stay clear of long bonds on any bearish bets , as term preference and relative value could see yield well contained in the long end , on a relative basis . while bond bears are numerous , the view in not unanimous . the california public employees retirement systems at $ 342.5 bln aum is the largest public pension fund in the usa . calpers made a watershed move to increase their bond allocation to 44 % from 19 % in november of 2017 . ",
        "calper 's resultant return expectation has been lowered by 0.5 % to 6.5 % to reflect the more conservative asset allocation , leaving their funded status at an unimpressive 68 % . outright losses on a bond allocation of this magnitude would result in overall calpers returns being impaired by more than 50bp , for the actuaries out there . the new allocation went into effect january 1 , 2018 and changes are made every 4 years . if you are in the bond bear camp , the next decision is your optimal means to short the bond market . ",
        "there are several alternatives . proshares ultrashort 20 + year treasury has $ 2bln in aum and provides an etf solution to shorting the us treasury market . the payout is -2 x the daily performance of the ice u. s. treasury 20 + year bond index . etfs are a fully funded solution . i am leaning towards , for tactical positioning , is interest rate swaps . just as the natural inclination for the stock market in a given year is positive , the natural interest rate curve is positive , as in upward sloping . positioning for higher interest rates via shorting treasuries or paying fixed on an interest rate swap are negative carry trades . ",
        "there is a trading adage that the road to hell is paved with positive carry trades . it is important to know the mechanics of the trade you are contemplating entering . to show this by way of an example , if one were to pay fixed on $ 500,000 notional 10 years you would pay 2.612 % in the current market . in exchange for paying fixed you receive 3 month usd libor flat , hence for the 1st 3 months of the interest rate swap you have a negative carry of 91.20 bp , approx . $ 1,140 on $ 500k notional . ",
        "each 3 month forward rate agreement going forward will reset at the then current 3 month libor and if you are correct about fed fund futures underestimating the pace of fed rate hikes the trade will `` flip '' at some stage , earlier than expected by the market , to a positive carry trade as 3 month libor sets above the fixed rate you agreed to pay at trade inception . at trade inception , the difference between the fixed rate payments committed to and the expected floating rate payments should be equal to zero . product _ summary . ",
        "interactive brokers is now offering eris swap futures platform access to their 400k + person account base . this is an exciting development as the margin requirements are modest and there is no better way to replicate over the counter swaps available in the market at present . the uses are varied ; those in an adjustable rate mortgage can potentially hedge their interest rate risk for much cheaper than a refinancing . those long credit with concerns about the rate market can hedge their rate exposure , creating synthetic floating rate notes . those looking to speculate of further a further sell-off in the rates market can participate with surgical financial precision . ",
        "trading hours are new york , but this is to be expected for a us dominated product . most would hedge in new york hours regardless , but stops could be executed cross market in a pinch . follow me on twitter @firehorsecaper . jcg .   "
