",
        "these games were not recognised by the international school sports federation , the parent international body . the indian contingent had around 120 members . four of the five girls were rescued by local surf lifesavers on sunday while the fifth one was found dead after resumption of search operation this morning . her dead body was recovered near a rocky breakwater , the same section of beach where the two migrant boys drowned last year . the sports ministry has ordered an inquiry into the unfortunate incident . sgfi secretary general rajesh mishra confirmed that the dead body of the girl was recovered early this morning by the local australian officials . ",
        "`` we have got the message from australia that the dead body of the girl was recovered this morning after a massive search operation . it is a very unfortunate incident and i send my heartfelt condolences to her family , '' mishra said from agra on phone . `` before returning home , the sports manager had taken some players to sea beach last evening . out of them five girls from the football team had gone down into the seawater and were taking selfies . they must not have seen a huge wave coming from behind , they fell down and all the five were swept away , '' he said . ",
        "four of them were rescued by the lifesavers stationed at the beach , with the help of around 40 indian players and coaches . `` helicopters came and the four girls were taken to nearby hospitals but the fifth one went missing . the local australian officials continued the search and i can confirm that the dead body of the fifth girl was found this morning , '' mishra said . he said all the five school girls , including the one who died , were from delhi . `` out of the four who were taken to the hospital , three have been discharged while the fourth girl is likely to be discharged shortly . ",
        "she was kept at the icu but is now out of danger and will be discharged tomorrow , '' mishra said . asked why the school girls were allowed to go to the dangerous area of the beach , mishra said , `` we have sent an official of the sgfi to probe the matter and the federation will take action on the basis of that report . `` it is a matter involving the death of a person and so the local australian police will deal with the issue . of course the indian high commission is also involved . ",
        "sports ministry has also ordered an inquiry and we have been told to submit some documents and we have done that . '' the sports ministry tweeted before the news of the girl 's death : `` the very disturbing news from glenelg beach in australia . h'ble mos sports , yas is in touch with @meaindia and h'eam @sushmaswaraj ji . '' `` indian high commission is providing all support . our thoughts & prayers w / the players . thorough investigation is ordered , '' the ministry said on its official twitter handle . mishra admitted that these games were not recognised by the international school sport federation but the indians had participated through the government on the invitation of the school sports australia . ",
        "`` this is not recognised by the isf but we have done nothing wrong while participating in the event . in fact , the invitation letter from the school sports australia first came to the sports ministry which forwarded it to us , '' he said . `` the sgfi then asked our state units whether they are interested in sending their players . some state units like delhi , chhattisgarh and madhya pradesh said yes . '' he said the governments of delhi , chhattisgarh and mp sanctioned funds for these school children to take part in the games . ",
        "`` the state units of the sgfi have state government officials as members . so the governments of delhi , chhattisgarh and mp wanted to send their school children as part of sports promotion . '' asked if the sgfi got sanction from the sports ministry , he said , `` under sports ministry rules you can take part in tournaments outside the country at your own cost . so the sports ministry did not give any funds but the invitation letter from the australian federation was forwarded to us from the sports ministry . `` so , there was no need to get sanction from the sports ministry .
