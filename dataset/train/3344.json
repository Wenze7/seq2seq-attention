        "kylian mbappe is from `` another planet '' but is still yet to reach his potential , according to former france international marcel desailly . mbappe , who is on an initial loan deal at paris saint-germain from monaco , is widely considered one of the brightest young stars in the world after scoring 26 goals last season . the 18-year-old has already netted nine times in 17 games this campaign for psg , the club he is expected to join on a permanent â‚¬ 145million deal . desailly , a world cup winner with france in 1998 , hailed his countryman , but feels the teenage forward still has another level to go to . ",
        "`` even at his young age , he does n't have to prove how exceptional a player he is , '' he told omnisport . `` the first thing he will have to prove is that he can get into the national team and be its leader . and that 's what matters before thinking he could be a great player during the world cup . `` it is the same for neymar , cristiano ronaldo or messi , even suarez . they already have a key status . `` mbappe does n't have one yet . he just arrived . ",
        "he 's one very promising player with great potential . `` neymar has a status and we hope he can become this amazing player of this new generation . he has a status already but mbappe does n't . `` he has however amazing potential . it 's magical , coming from nowhere . he 's from another planet . '' @kmbappe pic . twitter . com/4zzvhwtx5t . -- psg english december 5 , 2017 . mbappe will look to star in russia next year as france eye a second world cup crown , having been drawn with australia , peru and denmark in group c . ",
        "however , desailly believes two nations -- brazil and germany -- are the favourites for the showpiece event . `` we have the name already , it 's brazil . again . the same nations every time , but that 's brazil , '' he said . `` when we see how collectively and individually they perform , brazil , and germany straight after . these are the main contenders . '' marcel desailly was speaking at an event to celebrate the end of the uefa champions league group stage , where he and nissan put football fans through the ultimate challenge . "
