        "having always been closely involved in the startup world , i was excited when a fellow coworker shared an opportunity to apply as a facebook 's startup garage as a station f mentor in paris . in partnership with station f , the biggest startup campus in the world , the startup garage team from facebook selected an initial group of start-ups and 12 mentors for the pilot program . as mentors , we helped to guide them on ways they could accelerate their businesses . each startup spent six months at the startup garage from facebook within station f starting in september . ",
        "the startup i spent the most time with was welcome to the jungle , a platform that matches job seekers to companies , using exclusive video content as an inside look at company culture . as a medium-sized startup with over 50 people led by experienced founders , welcome to the jungle faced a very different set of challenges than other smaller start-ups with only a few people . the facebook startup garage program gives startups a chance to get the perspective of a mentor with experience from facebook and facebookers a chance to flex their skills in a new way . ",
        "here are some main takeaways from this program : your job is to help keep them user-centric , outcome-focused . in working with one of the smaller startups on auditing their branding and messaging , it was immediately apparent that the team was so deep in their own work that they were struggling to pull back and see the experience from fresh eyes -- or a new user perspective . we 've all been there . at facebook , we have the luxury of going in-field and hearing things straight from the mouths of users at focus groups how right or wrong we are . ",
        "it keeps us grounded , focused , and able to form specific hypotheses rooted in insights . startups rarely have that luxury and zooming out to use a user-centric , outcome focused lens is challenging when faced with the onslaught work on a day to day . in a 2 hour working session with a startup , i walked them through every single piece of outward facing communication they had across all their owned and earned channels . from their facebook page , to their app store description , to the blog . using the messaging hierarchy frameworks that pmms here are so accustomed to , i was able to help identify gaps in their product storytelling and outline all the touch-points to help improve their funnel . ",
        "hands-on workshops trump sharing resources and frameworks . as a pmm , i am obsessed with frameworks , briefs , requirement documents -- anything that helps me streamline a high volume of complex information into a structured , digestible format that is easily shared and understood across different functions . naturally , i shared all my favorite templates with the startups , looking forward to see how they might discover insights or achieve some greater efficiency within their team from using them . sadly , my cherished templates remained untouched as teams either did n't have time to fill them out or were unsure how to fill them out in a way that would be effective . ",
        "however , sitting down to explain and complete them together in working sessions completely changed their minds . guiding them on what to look for and pushing them to challenge their own messaging in person helped them see where they were stumbling . mentoring is n't the same as coaching or managing . in a valuable wrap-up discussion we had in paris , the mentors discussed the nuances of different types of interactions with our startups . for facebookers who have taken situational leadership , mentorship requires a keen awareness of the nuances in a variety of factors about your startup : who you 're interacting with from the startup , the current size or state of the startup , where they feel the most stuck , their level of familiarity with the area where they feel the most challenged , etc. . ",
        "flexing your style to match what they need is the hardest part of mentorship and where you 'll see the most progress . with welcome to the jungle , i stayed mainly hands off in working with their social media marketing lead , but needed guidance on how best to use all of facebook 's features or make the most out of their content marketing . so instead of forcing them to fill out messaging frameworks , i kept our 1:1 s open to the main challenges he was facing every week and used them as metrics review and brainstorm sessions . ",
        "startups often under-estimate the importance of repetition and have a hard time finding their growth loops . in both messaging and product user journeys , many of the startups i worked with were inconsistent with what they presented to users . whether it was the language they were using or the various user journeys they had created , it was often hard to follow a -rrb- what they were trying to say b -rrb- what i , as a user , should be doing , c -rrb- what i would expect if i came back . helping to emphasize how and why repetition and consistency is crucial , especially in the early stages , for building user understanding and habit was something i had to continue to reiterate . ",
        "especially when it came to content marketing , many startups were using different messaging and creative variations , which means they would fail to drive home the brand positioning and key messages with the reach and frequency of the ads they were running . while being able to visit paris was certainly a perk , the best part of this experience hands down were the people that this opportunity allowed me to meet . from the startup garage team that worked so hard to put this program together to the other mentors in the program , being in this new experience together was like a startup of its own .
