        "by chris emma -- before an offseason of work , golf and game nights with the harpers could begin , cubs star kris bryant was stuck watching the thrilling seven-game world series like the rest of america . the cubs ' championship defense had ended in disheartening fashion , with the dodgers winning the national league championship series in five games , so they went home and began an offseason that seems far too long . bryant planned to shut down from baseball but could n't help himself from viewing the world series , where a new champion was crowned . ",
        "`` obviously , the dodgers did great smashing us and getting there , '' bryant said . `` but the astros were an unbelievable team . i thought it was just great for baseball . '' there was no championship media tour or wedding planning for bryant this offseason . he and his wife , jessica , traveled to europe and spent time relaxing back home in las vegas . bryant even managed to find time for his hometown friend , nationals star bryce harper , a free agent next offseason , trolling the baseball world in the process through pictures on harper 's instagram . ",
        "`` i do get extremely jealous of those , too , by the way , '' anthony rizzo joked to the cubs convention crowd . but this offseason was far more than fun and games for bryant , who produced another stellar season in 2017 but one short of his mvp form of 2016 . he posted a slash line of . 295 / . 409 / . 537 , raising his walk rate and dropping his strikeout rate . but bryant did n't hit for the kind of power we 've come to expect . bryant , who turned 26 this month , saw his isolated power drop . ",
        "20 points to . 242 . he hit 29 home runs after crushing 39 a season before and posted 73 rbis after driving in 102 in 2016 . bryant was proud of the personal performance but also recognized it could 've been better . last offseason , bryant set the goal of working his power to the opposite field -- what he believed to be the evolution of his swing . while he hit five home runs to right field last season -- four more than in 2016 -- bryant was n't pleased with what the adjustment brought , and the numbers reflected a different hitter . ",
        "bryant took a different approach to his swing this offseason . `` hit it where it 's pitched , '' bryant said . `` that 's kind of a good focus on mine . not necessarily trying to hit it . and punish the balls when they make mistakes . `` nothing really crazy in terms of me thinking and overthinking things . it 's been a nice , calm offseason for me when it comes to that . '' mellow was another word bryant used to describe the last three months since the cubs were eliminated from the playoffs . ",
        "the concept of a world series hangover seemed arbitrary as the cubs were sluggish through much of 2017 , but it was clear at the annual convention this team is refreshed . kyle hendricks celebrated his new marriage while rizzo duped instagram with a `` fake married '' photo with his fianc√©e , but this was otherwise the kind of offseason the cubs needed to regroup in 2018 . kyle schwarber slimmed down , ben zobrist got his wrist healthy and jason heyward has been working on his swing . count bryant among those pleased with the fruits of his labors to be better this season . ",
        "`` you look around the league , other teams are getting better , too , '' he said . `` so it 's important for us to kind of keep up with them . the group that we have here is a really good one .
