        "the tech news gods can have a funny sense of humor sometimes . not long after i wrote that amd faced an uphill battle in early 2018 due to stiff competition from intel and nvidia , the company was gift-wrapped what initially looked like a big selling point for both its pc and server cpu lines . it came in the form of an article discussing a major security flaw reportedly affecting all intel cpus to ship in recent years . but intel 's response to the story raises questions about how much amd stands to gain . and even before the response , the market 's reaction to the news -- at one point , intel shares were down over 6 % , and amd shares up over 10 % -- felt excessive , a classic case of investors fearing uncertainty and pricing in a worst-case scenario . ",
        "intel 's sales might be hurt by the security flaw in the coming weeks -- its server cpu sales to cloud giants especially could be affected -- and the company will almost certainly face class-action suits over the issue . but that does n't necessarily mean intel 's biggest customers are going to abandon the company . late on jan. . 3 , the register reported that systems relying on intel processors sold over the last decade have a vulnerability that can allow programs to access sensitive info in the `` protected '' memory areas of an operating system 's kernel , despite lacking the necessary privileges . ",
        "intel has n't yet shared details about the vulnerability , but is expected to do so soon . the good news : the vulnerability can be removed via operating system patches that serve to isolate a kernel 's memory page tables from regular os user processes . microsoft and linux developers are already working on patches ; microsoft 's could arrive on tuesday . and apple appears to have already dealt with the problem via its dec. . 6 macos 10.13.2 update . the bad news : the patch yields a performance hit . the register suggested the hit could be in a range of `` five to 30 per cent slow down , depending on the task and the processor model . '' ",
        "however , it added that newer intel cpus have features such as process-context identifiers that could diminish the performance hit . in its statement issued on wednesday afternoon , however , intel said any performance impact from security patches is workload-dependent and `` should not be significant '' for the `` average computer user . `` a test involving the use of the postgresql database on a linux system running intel 's high-end core i7-6820hq notebook cpu turned up a 7 % performance hit when pcid was enabled , and a 16 % hit when it was disabled . another test from the same developer that tried to `` get closer to the worst case '' produced a 17 % hit when pcid was enabled , and a 23 % hit when it was disabled . ",
        "a big reason amd popped on the news : in an e-mail shared on a linux forum on dec. . 26 , amd engineer tom lendacky says his company 's processors `` are not subject to the types of attacks that the kernel page table isolation feature protects against . '' the cited reason : amd 's cpu microarchitecture does n't support `` speculative '' memory references that allow processors to execute a program 's code before checking the program 's privilege level . amd 's reported comments naturally fueled hopes that intel customers -- whether consumer pc buyers , corporate pc buyers or enterprise and cloud server buyers -- will be more willing to buy amd-powered systems that do n't need a performance-damaging os patch . ",
        "and those hopes , of course , are strengthened by the fact that amd 's cpu lineup is much stronger than they were a year ago , thanks to the launch of chips based on its new zen cpu core architecture . specifically , those zen chips are the ryzen , ryzen mobile , ryzen threadripper and epyc processor families . however , on wednesday afternoon , intel responded to the register 's report by suggesting that `` many different vendors ' processors and operating systems '' are affected by the vulnerability in question . the company added that it 's working with amd , cpu ip giant arm holdings and several os vendors to `` develop an industry-wide approach to resolve this issue promptly and constructively . ",
        "`` further complicating the story : a patch from linux developers prevents amd x86 cpus from being affected by the security fix . as a result , some are speculating only amd 's arm-architecture products are impacted , and that x86 cpus such as zen-based chips are n't . later on wednesday afternoon , amd officially responded to the controversy by stating that its processors are n't susceptible to any of the three attack threats caused by the speculative code-execution vulnerability in question . `` due to differences in amd 's architecture , we believe there is a near zero risk to amd processors at this time . ",
        "we expect ... security research to be published later today and will provide further updates at that time , '' the company said . following intel 's statement , its shares pared their losses and closed down 3.4 % to $ 45.26 . likewise , amd shares pared their gains and closed up 5.2 % to $ 11.55 . should the security patches cause only a modest performance hit to typical pc workloads , as intel 's remarks suggest , it 's unlikely that intel will lose a significant amount of pc cpu share as a result . that 's particularly true since the company is in the midst of rolling out 8th-gen core i3 , i5 and i7 pc cpu lines that on many benchmarks have yielded 30 % - plus performance gains relative to comparable 7th-gen chips . ",
        "corporate pc buyers are especially unlikely to jump ship . many subscribe to a `` no one ever got fired for buying intel '' mindset , and a small performance dip caused by a security patch should n't weaken that mindset much . in the server cpu space , things are a little more complicated . database and benchmark tests do point to meaningful performance hits for certain i/o-intensive workloads , and that ca n't sit well with buyers of servers meant to run such workloads . cloud giants such as amazon . com and alphabet/google , whose performance demands have led them to seek custom xeon server chips from intel , are especially likely to be on edge over the matter . ",
        "it 's possible that some of these clients could reduce their xeon purchases while intel scrambles to develop server cpus that do n't have the kernel memory security flaw in question . and assuming amd 's cpu are indeed immune to the flaw , it 's also possible that some could take a closer look at amd 's aggressively-priced epyc cpus for the time being . however , that 's a short-term problem for intel , rather than a doomsday scenario . for now , a lot remains unknown about the scope of the problem intel is facing , as well as how quickly and effectively it can deal with it . ",
        "but there are already reasons to think the initial panic-selling seen in intel shares was excessive . jim cramer and the aap team hold positions in nvidia , microsoft , apple and alphabet for their action alerts plus charitable trust portfolio . want to be alerted before cramer buys or sells nvda , msft , aapl or googl ? learn more now . more of what 's trending on thestreet : tax reform will be especially sweet for luxury retailersapple could easily buy netflix now , but here 's why it would be a surprising movehow death and widowhood affect social security benefits13 cool cars from the '80s and '90s are absolutely worthless collectibles .
