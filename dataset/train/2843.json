        "every now and again , i see something and my brain ca n't help connecting it to something far less successful -- yet eerily similar -- from the sometimes recent past . i started making a list of these things a few days ago and i thought i 'd share them with you . kerbango streaming music from the internet is ubiquitous today . phrases like `` alexa , play classical music '' or `` ok google , play they might be giants '' and `` hey siri , play my new music mix '' are part of our everyday lives . ",
        "music immediately comes out of our phones , tablets , bluetooth speakers , televisions , and cars . when i look on the retail shelves at the latest bluetooth speaker boxes from sonos , bose , and that company that puts giant plus and minus signs on its gear , i ca n't help but be reminded of the kerbango internet radio . the kerbabngo was developed when the state of the art in portable audio was the 32 megabyte diamond rio . the product was conceived , developed , aquired by 3com , and ultimately killed off before the introduction of apple 's itunes , rip . ",
        "mix . burn . , or the ipod . yeah , the thing had knobs and a screen , an interface that has migrated to whatever device you are summoning music from , or disappearing altogether behind a voice assistant . it also did n't have a deep catalog of individual tracks available . instead it was essentially an embedded computer running linux . it streamed internet radio stations in mp3 and realaudio formats at bitrates that we would scoff at today . the thing that probably killed the kerbango were its requirements : a broadband internet connection and a wired ethernet connection . ",
        "broadband was a thing at the time , but dialup was still good enough for a large chunk of internet connected households . many if not most broadband connected households also connected their cable or dsl modems directly to a single computer rather than a hub or a switch . even if you did have a local network , in order for the kerbango to make any sense , you would have to run wired ethernet from wherever your network connection was to wherever you wanted to use the device . if you wanted to listen to internet radio near your computer , you would probably just pull up winamp , realaudio player , or your software of choice on your computer . ",
        "3com audrey just after the dot-com crash was a pretty bad time to launch any product , let alone a $ 500 internet appliance designed for the kitchen . the audrey from 3com was supposed to be the first in the ergo brand of internet appliances suited to different rooms througout the house . it was the last . i remember following the announcement and rollout of the audrey . it ran a version of unix called qnx that lots of us linux dorks were rooting for . it had a really playful design language , and really did look like it would do well in the kitchen . ",
        "i also remember the day that the audrey was discontinued . i drove over to circuit city to see if they were selling any cheap . i 'm not sure if someone beat me to it or if there just were n't any in stock , but by the time i got there only the demo model was available , and it was n't for sale . while it 's too early to call them successful , at the time of this writing you can walk in to a store and play with a line of samsung refrigerators with giant touch screens on the front . ",
        "so that 's a thing . grocery store delivery so many companies tried to figure out grocery delivery during the dot-com bubble . a few , like peapod , actually achieved quiet success . most of them , like webvan , streamline . com , kozmo . com , and a ton of other dot-com 's did n't . webvan basically burned through a bunch of cash on warehouses and infrastructure before figuring out a smaller market . they became one of the poster-children of the dot com bust that shortly followed . kosmo . com also covered some interesting territory at the intersection of amazon prime now and favor , providing delivery services for music , movies , and stuff you might find at a convenience store . ",
        "fast forward to today and most every major grocery chain is executing on their own in-house pickup if not delivery service . companies and services like instacart , amazon fresh , and google express are everywhere too . takeout taxi adjacent to grocery delivery is `` i want some food but i do n't want to go out to get it . '' this is a niche currently well-served by favor , uber eats , amazon restaurants and others . for a time , uber eats had tasty lunches driving around in cars just waiting for you to order . ",
        "i do miss those venture capital subsidized days of convenience . most of these services can get you food in a major metro area in about 30 minutes today , which is still pretty solid . it 's pretty easy to trace this convenience right back to a service called takeout taxi , a business profiled in this washington post article from 1994 . their target demographic was dual-income households and as a student i only think i used them once or twice , but it was handy . one of the biggest barriers to a successful transaction back then was menu distribution . ",
        "either you knew what you wanted or you had to call and have someone fax you a menu . they did do a pretty fantastic job at embedding their contact info at the bottom of menus at participating restaurants . they also did an effective job at advertising in strategic locations in the phone book , which was like a primitive version of yelp minus the reviews . microsoft tablet pc while microsoft have been successful with their surface line of tablets recently , it 's easy to forget that they had a much beloved line of tablets with contemporary laptop parts inside almost a decade before the ipad was launched . ",
        "i remember seeing these at tech conferences at the time , mostly in the convertible notebook/slate form factor , though more exotic configurations such as dual-screen booklets and removable keyboard slates were available . if i had to guess why they did n't take off and have staying power , i 'd have to cite their cost compared to traditional laptops , and the fact that you often had to pay more for slower specs . they found their niche in specialized environments but never became as popular as things that came after them . microsoft spot watch while the wearable frenzy seems to be dying down a bit , there have definitely been lots of successes -- many of them fitness related -- over the past few years . ",
        "lots of watches can connect to mobile phones via bluetooth , or local networks via wifi . a few such as the apple watch link up to cellular lte signals as well . back in 2004 , microsoft launched a series of internet-connected watches that used fm subcarrier frequencies to deliver one-way information in major metropolitan areas right to your wrist . the local weather , traffic reports , and news could be beamed directly to your wrist . you could even receive email and calendar notifications . there were a few other broadcasty channels of information like stocks and maybe horoscopes ? ",
        "i wore a fossil abacus for a year or so , and it was really nice to have that information available . the screen resolution was pretty low though , and there was only so much information that could be displayed on a single screen . if anything it usually prompted me to look up information on a more capable device , which was helpful but not standalone . its one-way communication also limited its usefulness in the end . what are we working on right now that will be a flop today but a huge success later ? what will change between now and say 10 years from now that will make today 's failures a good idea again ?
