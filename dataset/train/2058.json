        "madrid -- lionel messi and luis suarez scored as barcelona beat 10-man real madrid 3-0 saturday in the spanish league , dealing a huge blow to its fiercest rival 's title defense . suarez struck in the 54th minute of the `` clasico '' and messi added a penalty 10 minutes later after madrid 's dani carvajal received a direct red for stopping a goal-bound header by paulinho . messi also set up substitute aleix vidal to round off the commanding win in stoppage time . the victory by ernesto valverde 's team left barcelona 14 points clear of madrid , which remained in fourth place with a game in hand . ",
        "barcelona increased its lead to nine points over second-place atletico madrid , which lost at espanyol on friday . `` we took another step forward in the league , '' said barcelona midfielder andres iniesta . `` but i do n't rule out madrid . this is a long-distance race . madrid is a very good team and they are not out of the title race . `` barcelona also extended its unbeaten streak to 25 matches across all competitions since losing to madrid in the spanish super cup in august , when barcelona was reeling from the departure of neymar to paris saint-germain . ",
        "that all seemed light years away on saturday with barcelona resisting an early push by the hosts before imposing its will . the match was a contrast in tempos : madrid wanted a frantic , up-and-down shootout , with ronaldo having space to roam , while barcelona wanted to hold the ball and let messi pick his moments . ronaldo beat messi for the ballon d'or earlier this month but the portuguese failed to make a decisive impact on saturday as messi took his `` clasico '' record to 25 goals in 37 matches and his season-leading tally to 15 in the league . ",
        "madrid coach zinedine zidane left spain midfielder francisco `` isco '' alarcon on the bench in a surprise move . instead , he gave mateo kovacic his first league start of the season , hoping to repeat his success from the spanish super cup when the croatian was charged with man-marking messi . ronaldo had an early goal disallowed for offside before the madrid star completely missed making contact with toni kroos ' pass in his best chance to score in the 10thafter barcelona shook off madrid 's early intense pressure , helped by the more physical kovacic , the catalan club made madrid look clueless . ",
        "barcelona went close to scoring when messi found paulinho with a forward lob , only for goalkeeper keylor navas to tip his strike over the bar in the 30th . it was then marc-andre ter stegen 's turn to get his foot on ronaldo 's strike to turn it past the post . paulinho tested navas again with a header from another pass by messi to culminate barcelona 's attack with one-touch passes . madrid responded by again attacking through left back marcelo , whose cross karim benzema headed off the post in the 42nd . barcelona grabbed control after the interval , and suarez forced a save from navas before the uruguay striker scored the opener . ",
        "sergio busquets cued barcelona with a forward pass for ivan rakitic , who pushed down the middle before playing sergi roberto wide . the right back 's one-touch pass found suarez arriving from the left to drill his shot under navas . madrid collapsed after falling behind , losing ball after ball to barcelona . messi seized the moment by playing suarez clear . after suarez hit the post , carvajal blatantly used his arm to stop paulinho 's header from going in , a decision that earned him a direct red card and sent messi to the penalty spot to fire his strike into the corner of the net . ",
        "trying to spark a comeback , zidane sent on forwards marco asensio and gareth bale , who drew a save from ter stegen in the 77th . `` we will start 2018 in a difficult position , '' said madrid defender raphael varane . the game came only two days after separatist political parties in catalonia , whose capital is barcelona , won a majority of seats in the regional parliament . ___ ap writer joseph wilson contributed from barcelona , spain .
