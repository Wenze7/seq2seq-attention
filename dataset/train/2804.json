        "pronounce designers yushan li and jun zhou made their second appearance at london fashion week : men 's as guests of gq china . their vibrant collection , a mish-mash of colors , textures and styles , blended in with the city 's anything-goes attitude . loose tailored pieces were updated in eye-popping pinks and purples and matched with less formal items such as puffers and long belted cardigans -- a styling approach that mirrored an ongoing trend on the london catwalks this season , which focuses on a more relaxed , mix-and-match attitude when it comes to tailoring . ",
        "the designers also continued to infuse elements inspired by their chinese heritage in the range , which included traditional mao suit jackets that blended in nicely with more traditional wide-leg tailored pants . texture played a key role , too , with velvet and wool oversized jackets mixed with metallic leather , worn denim or shiny pink patent leather to create heavily layered looks . launch gallery : pronounce men 's fall 2018related storiesj js lee mounts installation and unveils men 's wearlondon fashion week men 's fall 2018 : ones to watchben sherman teams with henry holland on capsule for fall 2018 .
