        "irvine was handed the title of most improved place in scotland last week . the scottish urban regeneration forum panel praised the irvine vision , a drive by north ayrshire council , in partnership with the local community , to deliver a strategic approach to the town 's economic and physical development . the award recognises the radical , ongoing regeneration taking place in the town and the spin-off benefits it aims to bring to local residents . and the irvine herald readers had their say on irvine scooping the award . some welcomed the accolade , while others questioned the new title . ",
        "alan woodison said : `` every town needs investment . they have all suffered as retail moves online and council income streams have failed to keep pace with inflation . `` i enjoy visiting irvine because the harbour is attractive and i can walk for miles with my dog at the beach park . it 's the only town with the three biggest supermarkets within walking distance . `` the shopping mall is a bit manic but at least shoppers can stay dry and the elderly and disabled do n't have to cope with traffic and unlevel pavements . `` i also like being able to park free , down the harbour , behind the shops , in the mall , in the many retail parks . ",
        "`` yes , irvine has its faults and its good points . but , in my view , the place and the people take some beating . `` alan caldwell said : `` an improved town with no public toilets and a shiny new swimming pool that 's in the wrong place and never open . `` awards for folk that like to slap their own backs . a joke that 's not funny . `` brian mathieson said : `` there 's plenty for kids and families . my kids are at different clubs almost every night , most of them run by volunteers . ",
        "`` the portal seems like a decent venue from what i can see . it 's not the best town award , it 's the most improved . `` instead of running the place down , actually look about your local communities and you 'll see a lot of good people doing good things . `` anne thornhill said : `` we just moved to irvine harbourside from saltcoats this year and we feel so fortunate to have shops , train , beach and pubs and restaurant right on the doorstep . `` the community spirit and the events put on in the few months we 've been here have been brilliant . ",
        "`` alasdair houston said : `` my main issue is the state of bridgegate and the rest of the town , investment is needed to create more local jobs , bring new and better quality shops , clean up the riverside and harbour , make the beach park a family oriented place , things that will attract people to the town . `` moira broom added : `` i do n't think the people of irvine would agree with that statement . `` the town is a disgrace , no real places for families of kids to spend quality time , apart from a swimming pool that is more often closed than open . ",
        "they must be hard up for choices if irvine won the award . ''   "
