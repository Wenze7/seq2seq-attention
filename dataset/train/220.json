        "credit : mary ann liebert , inc. , publishers . new rochelle , ny , december 7 , 2017 -- as a gene therapy cure for hemophilia a moves closer to reality , a new study sheds light on a challenging complication in which a host autoimmune response inhibits the production of normal clotting factor viii from the transferred fviii gene . researchers compared the levels of multiple pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in a mouse model of hemophilia a that received fviii gene therapy at different ages and either did or did not exhibit fviii inhibitor formation , as presented in an article published in human gene therapy , a peer-reviewed journal from mary ann liebert , inc. , publishers . ",
        "the article is available free on the human gene therapy website until january 7 , 2017 . the article entitled `` a retrospective study of cytokine profiles changes in mice with fviii inhibitor development after adeno-associated virus-mediated gene therapy in a hemophilia a mouse model '' is coauthored by junjiang sun , gene therapy center and eshelman school of pharmacy , university of north carolina , and colleagues from unc , university of saint joseph school of pharmacy , northern jiangsu people 's hospital , chinese academy of medical sciences , and peking union medical college . the researchers reported a shift in the cytokine profiles of mice with fviii inhibitor development , including significantly increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin -1 and il-6 and tumor necrosis factor - alpha , among others . ",
        "they also showed a negative correlation between risk factors for fviii inhibitor development and age at which gene therapy was administered . `` immune responses represent an important limitation to gene therapy for hemophilia , '' says editor-in-chief terence r. flotte , md , celia and isaac haidak professor of medical education and dean , provost , and executive deputy chancellor , university of massachusetts medical school , worcester , ma . `` the paper from dr. sun 's group and their colleagues begins to address factors that may predispose certain individuals to mount a greater immune response against the therapeutic protein produced by the gene therapy vectors and thus benefit less from the therapy . '' ",
        "about the journal . human gene therapy , the official journal of the european society of gene and cell therapy , british society for gene and cell therapy , french society of cell and gene therapy , german society of gene therapy , and five other gene therapy societies , is an authoritative peer-reviewed journal published monthly in print and online . led by editor-in-chief terence r. flotte , md , celia and isaac haidak professor of medical education and dean , provost , and executive deputy chancellor , university of massachusetts medical school , human gene therapy presents reports on the transfer and expression of genes in mammals , including humans .
