        "new york - americans shopped with greater gusto at malls and online this holiday season amid a strong labor market and cold winter weather , retail sales experts said tuesday . shoppers in the world 's biggest economy spent generously over the `` black friday '' weekend in late november that kicks off the us holiday shopping season , and buying picked up further in december , analysts said . retail experts wo n't have the final tally on the overall holiday season until january . that will include figures from the day-after christmas , `` boxing day , '' which is usually one of the busiest shopping days of the year . ",
        "but early figures point to a good year overall . mastercard spendingpulse estimated sales growth for the season at 4.9 percent , the strongest annual boost since 2011 . `` overall , this year was a big win for retail , '' said sarah quinlan , senior vice president of market insights at mastercard . `` the strong us economy was a contributing factor , but we also have to recognize that retailers who tried new strategies to engage holiday shoppers were the beneficiaries of this sales increase . `` ihs markit pointed to strong macroeconomic factors such as a 17-year high in us consumer confidence in november and a 17-year low in unemployment that allowed consumers to open their wallets . ",
        "chilly weather in much of the country also supported sales of jackets and other winter apparel , said chris christopher , executive director at ihs markit . `` there was a significant ramp-up of holiday sales , '' said christopher , who shifted his projection midway through december to 4.7 percent growth for the season from an earlier mark of 4.2 percent growth . `` everything is pointing to a good holiday season . `` the passage of a massive tax cut bill by republicans in congress and pushed by president donald trump also likely lifted spending somewhat , although christopher noted that `` things were going strong before that . ",
        "`` analysts also noted the favorable calendar with christmas falling on monday and allowing last-minute shopping over the weekend . - retail reprieve ? - the upbeat appraisals boosted shares of leading retailers , a sector that has seen myriad bankruptcies and store closures with the growth of amazon and other online retailers , at the expense of the traditional american shopping mall . most brick-and-mortar chains saw their share prices rise in afternoon trading monday , including wal-mart stores , up 1.0 percent , macy 's , up 4.6 percent , gap , up 1.5 percent and mall operator simon property group , up 1.4 percent . ",
        "while the higher stock valuations reflect an improved outlook , most leading chains wo n't report earnings until february . in recent years , retailers have struggled to maintain solid profit margins due to the need for aggressive price promotion and enhanced spending on e-commerce initiatives . amazon gained 0.7 percent after announcing a number of records of its own , pointing to strong increases of `` prime '' subscribers and of sales of its artificial intelligence `` echo '' devices . amazon said its biggest day in terms of customer `` fulfillment '' -- or the delivery of packages to customers from its network of suppliers and warehouses -- was december 19 .

        "the most requested recipe to amazon 's alexa program was for chocolate chip cookies , while the most sought-after christmas carol was `` jingle bells . ''   "
