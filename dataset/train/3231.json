        "chicago , dec 11 - u. s. agricultural cooperativesare building new soybean crushing plants at the fastest rate intwo decades as farmers in the world 's top producer prepare tosow another record area with soy . the growth worldwide in the number of consumers with incometo spend on pork and chicken has led to a rapid rise in demandfor food to raise animals . crushing plants produce high-proteinsoymeal feed for livestock and soyoil for food and fuel . u.s. processors are expected to open plants with capacity toprocess at least 120 million bushels of soybeans in 2019 , uparound 5 percent from existing capacity of an estimated 1.9 billion bushels . ",
        "the last time outright capacity grew that much was in1997-98 , according to u. s. department of agriculture and soyindustry data . strong demand for feed has boosted crushing margins , themeasure of profitability for the plants . margins stand at morethan a $ 1 per bushel , the strongest for 18 months , according tothe cme group . the margins have encouraged processors to build more plants . `` margins on soybean processing were very good , some of thebest we 've had in many years . and when the industry has goodmargins , you expand production , '' said mark sandeen , vicepresident of product marketing at farmer cooperative agprocessing inc . ",
        "growth in feed demand means crushing capacity worldwide willneed to expand further . global soy production would have to increase by 20 percentover the next decade to keep up with feed consumption , said tomhammer , president of industry group national oilseed processingassociation . u.s. soy plantings totaled a record 90.2 million acres thisyear and the usda in a preliminary forecast set plantings nextyear at 91.0 million acres . and while industry capacity couldreach 2 billion bushels in under two years , the usda saidcrushings likely will not reach that level until 2020-21 . agp broke ground earlier this year on a new soy plant inaberdeen , south dakota , that will have annual capacity toprocess 40 million bushels . ",
        "another cooperative , north dakota soybean processors , planned to build a similarly sized facility for an estimated $ 287 million near the town of spiritwood . the plants will increase demand for local soybeans , potentially pushing up prices that farmers nearby will receivefor their crops , and reducing transport costs . ryan wagner , who grows soybeans about 50 miles away from thenew soy plant in south dakota , said the processor could add 10to 15 cents to the local soybean price - an amount that mightmean the difference between making or losing money . chicago board of trade soybean futures on friday were $ 9.89-3 / 4 per bushel , down 2-1/4 cents . ",
        "`` that basis will be nice but in the long run i think thegreater economic impact will be the attraction of moreopportunities for raising livestock because of the new supply ofsoybean meal , '' wagner said . `` we are already starting to see interest in our area formore pork and poultry production since the announcement . `` family-owned zeeland farm services plans to build the secondplant in the state of michigan with capacity of 40 millionbushels , to open in 2019 . the company built michigan 's firstsoybean processor in 1996 in zeeland . the company will supply soybean meal to hog , turkey , dairyand aquaculture farms in michigan and export both soymeal andsoyoil , said cliff meeuwsen , president of zeeland . ",
        "due to a lack of processing plants in michigan , much of thesoybeans there are shipped to ohio where merchant giants archerdaniels midland co , bunge ltd and cargill inchave plants . soymeal then gets shipped back to michigan to feed animals , raising costs . `` we hope to cut those costs out , thereby raising the priceof soybeans to producers and cutting the cost of feed andprotein to livestock producers , '' zeeland 's meeuwsen said . earlier this year perdue farms opened a processor withcapacity for 17.5 million bushels in pennsylvania , that state ` sfirst large-scale soy crushing plant . ",
        "many of the new facilities are in places outside the centralu . s. midwest soy belt , taking advantage of increased suppliesfrom farmers in those areas that have switched to soybeans fromless profitable crops such as wheat . grain handlers will increase their profits by building theplants , as the margins are bigger for crushing than they are forsimply buying and shipping soybeans , said mike steenhoek , executive director of the soybean transportation coalition . `` the old adage is it 's better to export meat than mealand better to export meal than soybeans . you are always tryingto export that higher-value product , '' steenhoek said .
