        "foxboro -- for as much talent as the jaguars trot out onto the field defensively , there 's no clear-cut answer for how they 'll cover rob gronkowski . `` hope they do n't throw him the football , '' jaguars coach doug marrone answered when asked how to guard the patriots tight end . `` hope he drops it . there is no secret formula . i 'd like to watch a game where someone has been able to do it . he is going to make his plays and you hope those plays do n't end up killing you . ",
        "`` more patriotsthe jaguars rank 20th in the nfl when it comes to defending tight ends , according to football outsiders , allowing 44 yards per game on six targets . against pittsburgh 's vance mcdonald and jesse james in the divisional round , jacksonville was gashed for 11 receptions and 124 yards , including 107 yards after the catch . on paper , the jaguars should match up better against tight ends than what they 've shown . they have a pair of athletic linebackers who have the size/speed combination to run with bigger pass-catchers and contest them at the catch point . ",
        "they also have a long and hard-nose corner in jalen ramsey , who does n't shy away from the physicality associated with defending a tight end . but talk to patriots defenders , the same ones who try to match up with gronkowski on a daily basis , and it 's not that simple . in general , linebackers just ca n't match the first-team all-pro 's athleticism in the passing game . corners , who are accustomed to playing on top of their responsibilities in coverage in order to protect against the big play , are too easily boxed-out . ",
        "even the tough ones . that 's why safeties are so often the choice when coaches try to determine who should check gronkowski . patrick chung is gronkowski 's toughest matchup on his own team . tennessee 's all-pro kevin byard was competitive for a time last week , but gronkowski eventually had his way with the rookie . the results were even worse for pittsburgh safety sean davis back in week 15 . the jaguars will throw a different look at the patriots . their cover-3 scheme -- run by defensive coordinator todd wash , who spent two years in seattle as the defensive line coach -- is reminiscent of what the seahawks showed the patriots in super bowl xlix . ",
        "like the seahawks , the jags will `` match '' out of their zone at times , meaning their defenders wo n't necessarily be anchored to one spot on the field , dedicating themselves to one particular zone . for instance , if the patriots place three receivers on one side of the field , ramsey and corner aj bouye could end up aligning in close proximity to one another . that 's how the jaguars ensure that they have the best chance to match skill-sets with the receivers running through their zones . that kind of defense , though , could play right into new england 's hands when it comes to gronkowski 's usage . ",
        "in super bowl xlix , the patriots went with three receivers to tom brady 's left and lined up gronkowski wide to the right all by himself . seattle did n't have a corner go out on the island with the 6-foot-6 , 265-pounder . it was linebacker kj wright . gronkowski ran right by him for a 22-yard touchdown . jacksonville 's linebackers myles jack and telvin smith are as athletic as any pair in the league , but if a similar situation pops up on sunday , brady 's decision should be just as easy . if the jaguars choose to match gronkowski over the middle of the field with one of their two interchangeable safeties -- tashaun gipson or barry church -- they 'll be opting to cover new england 's top offensive threat with two of their weakest defenders . ",
        "plus , gipson is dealing with a foot injury that has held him out for two practices this week . if he 's at all limited , that could press second-year safety jarrod wilson , undrafted out of michigan last year , into action . how the patriots use gronkowski in the afc title game will be fascinating to watch . will they use him as one of four vertical threats to stress jacksonville 's three deep defenders ? will they have him try to puncture the soft spots in the intermediate areas of wash 's zone scheme ? will they incorporate him in the screen game , as jerod mayo suggested on this week 's quick slants the podcast , to take advantage of an aggressive defensive front ? ",
        "or will the patriots isolate him on the outside , trusting him to win his one-on-one matchup ? if the jaguars come up with the answer to slow down gronkowski , without outright doubling him , they 'll be the first to do so in some time . he 's averaging 109 yards per game in his last five , and he has four touchdowns in that span . nbc sports boston schedule .
