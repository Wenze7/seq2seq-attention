        "if head coach jim caldwell is ultimately fired by the detroit lions , look no further than the loss to the cincinnati bengals as the reason why . i 'm not passing judgement about whether or not i think jim caldwell is a good coach . i 'm no expert on the situation and ca n't say for certain whether it 's the right or wrong move . following sunday 's highly-disappointing loss at cincinnati though , all signs point to the same outcome : jim caldwell 's time as the detroit lions head coach is coming to an end . ",
        "if caldwell fails to survive the nfl 's annual `` black monday '' next week , it wo n't be because the lions missed the playoffs . it will be because this game is the one that 's going to keep them out . let 's say the lions won their last four games to finish 10-6 , but the falcons also won next week . could you really blame caldwell for ten wins in a crowded field ? or , say aaron rodgers stayed back and surgically orchestrated yet another week 17 heart extraction on the lions . that sucks , but that 's what aaron rodgers does . ",
        "it would be controversial , but i can envision caldwell being given one more chance next year in that case . let 's say those two inches at the goal line back in week 3 were the only thing separating detroit from consecutive playoff appearances . bob quinn would have a difficult decision to make . caldwell would have a chance though . the cincinnati game puts all of those what-ifs to bed once and for all though . losing the way they lost , against the team that beat them , against the coach that out-coached him ... that 's easy . ",
        "marvin lewis = `` tremendous `` in the lead-up to the cincinnati game , jim caldwell was asked about marvin lewis , the soon-to-be former bengals head coach . caldwell had some very nice things to say about his colleague . the guys at the free press ripped him apart for it . and what happens ? an underachieving and undermanned marvin lewis team with little to play for eliminates them from playoff contention . i 'm not saying i agree with the `` win the super bowl or you suck ! '' mentality that many fans seem to have . ",
        "i 'm not saying i agree with the `` lose and you 're fired ! '' mentality that all owners seem to have . i actually agree with a lot of caldwell 's sentiment towards marvin lewis . lasting 15 years as an nfl head coach these days really is pretty `` tremendous '' . you 're saying you would n't take four division titles and seven playoff appearances right about now ? a few things in this situation are undeniable though . if you 're fighting for your job , your team ca n't come out completely flat in a true must-win game . ",
        "on the two biggest possessions of the season , your team ca n't self-destruct . your team ca n't get torn apart by the one rushing attack in the entire league that 's worse than their own . to make matters worse , it was the backup tearing them up . symbolically , that tells you all you need to know about caldwell 's future in detroit . as fans hoping for a playoff return , maybe it 's for the best to be put out of our misery one week early . as for caldwell , he 'll have to wait one more week , but he 'll likely soon be put out of his as well .
