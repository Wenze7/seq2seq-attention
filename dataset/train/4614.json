        "credit : witan hexateuch via wikimedia commonsthe idea that there is a common anglo-saxon ancestry based on biology is gaining currency among some right-wing and religious groups in the uk and us . in the uk , the new leader of the uk independence party , henry bolton , suggested in a radio interview in october that `` in certain communities the indigenous anglo-saxon population is nowhere to be seen . `` in august , a religious group called the odinist fellowship wrote to the church of england demanding two churches as reparations for a `` spiritual genocide '' which it claims began in the seventh century ad . ",
        "the odinists use old icelandic texts to reconstruct the `` indigenous '' religion of the anglo-saxons which they claim was oppressed with the arrival of christianity . the anglo-saxons are commonly believed to have migrated into briton in the fifth and sixth century ad . iceland by contrast was inhabited in the ninth century by viking settlers . in the us , this mixed up medievalism is associated with the white supremacist alt-right who use anglo-saxon and viking motifs . but archaeological research , which examines ancient dna and artefacts to explore who these `` indigenous '' anglo-saxons were , shows that the people of fifth and sixth century england had a mixed heritage and did not base their identity on a biological legacy . ",
        "the very idea of the anglo-saxon ancestor is a more recent invention linked closely with the english establishment . what dna evidence showsfor decades , archaeologists and geneticists have sought to identify anglo-saxons in england . an early attempt in 2002 relied on modern dna with a study of the male y chromosome suggesting there had been a 95 % population replacement of britons by the anglo-saxons , comprised of different people from northern europe . but another study , based on mitochondrial dna which is inherited from the mother , found no evidence of significant post-roman migration into england . ",
        "a third paper suggested that the genetic contribution of the anglo-saxons in south-eastern england was under 50 % . the discrepancies between the findings are because these three papers used modern dna and worked backwards . work my colleagues and i have undertaken looked at the question from the other direction -- by working with ancient dna . the results from our recent study were published in nature communications and included evidence from an anglo-saxon site i excavated in oakington , cambridgeshire . in total ten skeletons where investigated . these included seven early medieval graves dating to between the fifth and eighth century -- four from oakington and three from hinxton -- and three earlier iron age graves from cambridgeshire , dating to between the second century bc and the first century ad , to provide the genome of the antecedent inhabitants of briton . ",
        "we used a novel method called `` rarecoal '' to look at ancestry based on the sharing of rare alleles , which are the building blocks of genes . our research concluded that migrants during what 's now thought of as the anglo-saxon period were most closely related to the modern dutch and danish -- and that the modern east english population derived 38 % of its ancestry from these incomers . the rest of britain , including today 's scottish and welsh , share 30 % of their dna with these migrants . the analysis of dna of four individuals from the oakington anglo-saxon cemetery identified that one of them was a match with the iron age genome , two were closest to modern dutch genomes , and one was a hybrid of the two . ",
        "each of these burials was culturally anglo-saxon because they were buried in the same way , in the same cemetery . in fact , the richest assemblage of anglo-saxon artefacts came from the individual with the match for iron age genetic ancestry , and so was not a migrant at all . excavating at oakington . credit : duncan sayerit shows that these ancient people did not distinguish biological heritage from cultural association . in other words , someone who lived and died in the fifth or sixth century anglo-saxon village of oakington could have been biologically related to an earlier inhabitant of england , a recent migrant from continental europe or a descendent of either or both -- they were all treated the same in death . ",
        "writing anglo-saxons into historybiologically then these people were a mixed group who shared what we consider anglo-saxon culture . but they did not think of themselves as anglo-saxons . the idea of the anglo-saxon is a romanticised and heavily politicised notion . when gildas , a sixth century monk wrote de excidio et conquestu britanniae he referred only to saxons . writing 200 years later , the venerable bede used the word `` anglorum '' in his ecclesiastical history to describe a people unified under the church . in the ninth century , alfred the great used the term anglo-saxon to describe the extent of his realm -- but this description did not persist . ",
        "it was not until the 16th century that pre-norman people were consistently described as anglo-saxons . previously , stories like the 1485 le morte d'arthur , by thomas malory , romanticised arthurian antagonists who defended britain from invading saxons . this origin story was important enough to late medieval englishness that henry viii installed a round table in winchester castle . it was not until the 19th century that anglo-saxon poems such as beowulf the seafarer and the wanderer were translated into english as interest in anglo-saxons grew . in london 's national portrait gallery , there is a statue of queen victoria and prince albert of saxe-coburg and gotha dressed as anglo-saxon monarchy -- a commission that equated their germanic descent with that of their subjects . ",
        "this anglo-saxon origin story has its roots in politics , downplayed when anti-german sentiment during world war i prompted the royals to change their name from saxe-coburg-gotha to windsor in 1917 . a convenient , but inaccurate labelthe people of the fifth , sixth and seventh century certainly did not think of themselves as anglo-saxons and would not have understood the description . migration into the uk took place in deep prehistory , throughout the roman and post-roman periods -- a fact which the classicist mary beard was lambasted for defending on twitter in august . migration then continued with viking settlement in the ninth and eleventh centuries . ",
        "dutch and european migration into england was present throughout the middle ages and particularly pronounced in the 16th and 17th century as flemish weavers fled religious persecution . today , the term anglo-saxon is a convenient label for those opposed to future immigration . while it collectively describes some post-roman and early medieval culture , it has never accurately described a biological ethnicity nor an indigenous people . the dna evidence points to an integrated people of mixed ancestry who lived side by side . anglo-saxon ancestry is a modern english myth -- the english are not descended from one group of people , but from many and that persists in our culture and in our genes .
