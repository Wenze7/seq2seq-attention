        "if you 're an entrepreneur who 's not based in the us or eu , chances are that payment processing ranks among the top 3 headaches for your business . regulations , restrictions , hidden costs , keeping track of processing fees are phantoms that take you by surprise when you 're trying to get your hustle on . in my survey with our facebook group of 650 + e-commerce entrepreneurs , i found that payment processing fees were among the most common factors that completely destroyed roi expectations . as with any good startup idea , fattmerchant took this problem head-on with its service when there were n't many other solutions available . ",
        "they offer a payment processing solution at the cost of a small semi-flat processing fee that appears to be cheaper than all the other options out of the box . this immediately solves a lot of problems that medium-to-large sized businesses face in terms of scaling without negotiating payment fees ; leading to potentially massive cost savings . fattmerchant recently got funded for a cool $ 5m and i had the pleasure of talking to their cto jacques fu about their industry as well as its effects on e-commerce . here 's 3 things i learned from it . 1 : if you cant disrupt the industry , disrupt the business model `` i think the difference for the vision for fattmerchant was that we really just wanted to be there to serve the customers . '' ",
        "said fu when i asked him how they managed to get their break in such a competitive market . `` we wanted to offer a membership instead of trying to make money on the actual processing . this is why we do n't consider our company as a payment processor first but rather a technology company with an saas model . '' - the more i thought about it , the more i realized how smart this approach was . essentially , in an industry where everyone was trying to make money based on the volume of transactions , all fattmerchant had to do was to take the volume out of the equation and implement a model that was already standard in other b2b markets : saas . ",
        "2 : successful entrepreneurs know which problems not to focus on `` having a small team of very driven and smart people ; we 're always trying to solve every single problem . what we realized early on is you really have to make sure is that you 're not reacting to everything that holds your attention throughout the day . '' jacques said on his biggest challenges . `` ... sometimes that means that you 're not going to immediately respond to a customer or do something that 's very hard for you to not react to ... but you really need to make sure you focus on thousands of customers having the best experience in the future . '' ",
        "-- this bit sounded like it came from a long period of tough times figuring many things out for the first time . indeed , this was definitely among many of the reasons why 60 % of all startups fail . 3 : being good can also mean being `` too good to be true '' i 'd like to point to this scene from hbo 's silicon valley for this one . when i asked him about challenges in terms of converting business leads , jacques said fattmerchant had faced difficulties from both sides of the spectrum . smaller businesses never realized how big payment processing costs could get until they scaled up . ",
        "bigger businesses had the opposite reaction ; they 'd been burned too often by other services to the extent that fattmerchant did n't sound plausible at all ! `` so our toughest job becomes educating micro merchants on what they 're missing out on . usually as they grow to become mid-sized businesses , they eventually realize that the cost of payment processing was n't exactly on their radar from the start . '' `` on the other hand , for businesses that have been operating for a while , they get it . the worst that happens there is sometimes they 're a little suspicious just because they 've been burned so many times by other payment processors to the extent that it just sounds too good to be true in some cases . '' ",
        "so there you have it , a refreshing chat from a truly inspiring entrepreneur . i strongly suggest you read the full interview which contains some in-depth and revelatory insights about the payment processing industry . if you liked the whole read , give a brotha a clap and tweet to me about it @harharharris .
