        "what internet is doing to our brains is something i keep thinking about . technology is thought to improve our lives . among other , it connects us with people around the world or automates work that had to be done manually in the past . it is everywhere , not only on our computers or mobile devices but in our watch , in our tv , in the cars that we drive ... internet was a tremendous revolution , and a lot of companies are running their businesses on it . they offer all kind of services of which we are users : the task management app that we use to track our daily tasks . ",
        "the running app that tracks my workouts and shows me how people around me are doing . the platform that allows me to buy grocery stuff and get it delivered to my place in a matter of hours . the gossip apps that let me know about everyone 's life . the amount of services , apps , and internet-based products that we can find nowadays is huge . you can subscribe to producthunt to get an idea of how many of them are being launched every day . creating a company has never been so easy , you do n't even need an office , or a lot of bureaucracy . ",
        "these internet-based companies need a service to offer , and users that are the source of incomes and that make the business sustainable . users and kpisusers are a crucial element in any company because having a lot of users is something positive . it is a signal of an excellent service , and also of potential high revenue . that 's why the number of users is usually a kpi for many companies . for companies that have no clear business model and have to appeal to investors having a high number of users is critical . for the investor it means , well if they do n't have enough revenue it is ok , it might come in the future , or the company will get acquired , and i 'll get money back . ",
        "take my money and find any strategy to have a business model or get attractive to potential buyers . getting users to use your service , and retain them is something very tricky . you can use marketing campaigns and target people on different social networks , you can build something with tremendous value for people and expect it to expand organically , or you can get people addicted to your service/product and leverage that sort of brain manipulation to grow your business . i know it sounds creepy when you read it , but it 's something many companies are appealing to . ",
        "stimulating our brainsour brain likes stimulus . brains feel good when they are given something that they want , something that they do n't need a lot of energy to process . stimulating brains in the past was harder because we were n't that connected . if they tried to stimulate us to sell us something we could easily ignore them . nowadays is very easy to sell us whatever they want , or be the product they want us to be to sell ourselves to companies . they successfully built a habit on us that they are leveraging to manipulate us towards their business goals . ",
        "it 's most times invisible to us because it 's covered up in a way that we do n't perceive what their final goal is . have you ever wondered why your facebook timeline is infinite ? have you ever wondered why instagram strive to add more filters and features to their stories ? have you ever wondered why push notifications exist ? it 's not because they want a better world , or because they want us to be more social than ever . it 's just simply because they want us to be addicted . addiction means control , and control can be used to manipulate people towards specific goals , in case of a company business profitability and success . ",
        "we are increasing their kpis towards future pitches in front of investors , or getting more money from marketers . who cares ? sad but true many companies are doing this sort of practices nowadays . and they can do it with no control at all from any regulatory law or organization . as i said many of these methods are covered up , and we ca n't see the impact they have in the society until they are extensively used . by the time we realize it , it 's too late to give any step back : could we have prevented all the people that are addicted to instagram stories nowadays , sharing every single moment of their days , or watching other people 's lives to have some gossip to talk about ? ",
        "could we have prevented , that unconscious think in our brain that makes feel that we are missing something if we are not using our phone or computer ? could we have prevented new generations spending a lot of time playing online or catching pokemons on the street rather than playing football or going for a walk ? probably we could have , but who cared ? the prevention of these things requires an analysis from angles companies do n't usually care about . they are driven by kpis so looking from angles like the social impact , or the ethics is not worth the effort . ",
        "who cares whether people have problems communicating with other people in the real world if they can do it using my product without any problem ? who cares if people suffer from anxiety problems because of the social pressure my product can create ? who cares if people have issues socializing if the online version of them do n't ? not many companies care , no one can force them to care , but they hypocritically seem to care . we , developers are told when we work for any company that one of the most important goals is to increase some given kpis that will make the business successful . ",
        "when discussions are going on about how to increase those numbers , we rarely think about the users . we instead think about them as a mean and not as a human with feelings , problems , goals . the only angles that are considered when it comes to planning new features are typically : does it increase number x ? how should it be shaped in a way that user likes it ? is feasible technically speaking ? is there any limitation ? we are so kpi and business-driven that we forget that we are building something for users not leveraging users . ",
        "leading the changeit 's been proven the negative impact that manipulation is having on people 's brain . we developers and designers can help raise awareness in our companies and people around us . we humans , have a mind with an enormous capacity to think , feel and connect with other people and we should n't let all these companies numb our minds . it 's all in our hands . we can raise the awareness and say no to these practices . we can open up discussions where kpis are not the only discussion point . the less we use our mind , the easier will be to manipulate and not only by companies that want us to sell products but by governments that want us to believe in them . ",
        "use your brain , do n't be a product , and make the most of the life with yourself , friends and family . referencesthis article was originally published on my personal website , ppinera . es . i hope you liked it and that it helped you reason about how you use the technology nowadays and to to use it more thoughtfully .
