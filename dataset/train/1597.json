        "unless you 've been hiding under a rock for fear of nuclear war with north korea , you may have heard that a winter storm is developing on the east coast of the united states . while that storm is shaping up to be a doozy , it 's already reaching headlines for bringing some rare chilly weather and frozen precipitation to the south . yes , folks , today it snowed in florida . not used to the snow , floridians were pretty pumped to see the white fluffy stuff for a change . this pup , however , was very confused . ",
        "south carolina also saw a good amount of snow . and so did north carolina . people in georgia were trying their very best to make snowmen . some were better than others . the fire chief for valdosta , georgia , even made a snow angel . snow-covered palm trees are a pretty rare sight . ill-equipped and unaccustomed , some roads were closed with just a dusting . a fountain even froze in atlanta . while this is exciting to many who live in the south and rarely see snow , this storm is part of an explosive `` bomb cyclone '' that 's expected to pummel the rest of the east coast wednesday night into thursday .

        "be careful , and stay warm out there . with love , from sunny los angeles .   "
