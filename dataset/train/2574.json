        "i recently had the opportunity to talk to st. louis cardinals minor leaguer tyler bray about his time in the cardinals farm system and his goals for the 2018 season . the st. louis cardinals have a strong farm system and a member of this strong supporting core is tyler bray , a young pitcher climbing the ranks of our beloved cardinals . below is my one-on-one with bray . josh mcdonald : first and foremost how 's your offseason going ? what have you been up to ? tyler bray : `` it 's going good , just getting ready for next year , not trying to be who i was last year , just better . ",
        "just keep working . `` josh : speaking of last year , you seemingly had a breakout season with a 2.91 era at springfield and that 's with a pretty rough may , what do you think allowed for this next step in your game ? tyler : `` i just think talking to some of my friends that have made it up higher , just being consistent . you ca n't let one bad week or one bad game or one bad month even , get to your head , just stay level and slow things down . just believe in who you are , know over time the results will come , regardless of what one day , week or month might have . ",
        "that was the biggest thing for me really . `` josh : you made a lot of changes through the year , what was it like making the jump from palm beach to springfield and then to memphis all in one season ? tyler : `` i mean , it 's really just a testament to the cardinals . they tell us every year at spring training that if you play good , you move good . it 's just kind of how it all fell for me . they have been really good to me , you know i 'm a 26th rounder , late guy , they really did n't have to move me at all . ",
        "but they stood by their word , you play good you move good . that 's kind of been what they 've told me since day one , just believing in it and trusting in their way . just doing what jason simontacchi has taught me and dernier orozco and niemann down in palm beach . all those guys had one goal in mind for me . they had a vision and it 's me believing in their vision and what they need from me . `` josh : since you mentioned him , what do you think the loss of jason simontacchi will mean for the cardinals minor league system ? ",
        "tyler : `` i know i am very happy for him . it is well deserved ; he 's gon na be a big league pitching coach one day , for sure . he 's just incredible , how he relates to the players , he 's been there . that 's one thing that i 've noticed is even when i 'm working in the offseason with younger kids , it 's kind of hard to relate back to that high school mentality and where they 're at . simo has just done an incredible job with understanding what we 're going through , putting himself back in our shoes and remembering everything . ",
        "he just remembered everything that he did through his career , tell stories about maturing . it 's gon na be a huge loss , to me i know he has helped me out so much . he 's well deserved of a big league job in my opinion . `` josh : it was clearly a small sample size , but what do you think was the toughest part of your time in memphis ? tyler : `` it was just getting used to how they approached me . i feel like i can definitely pitch there . first time through the first inning i felt good with them and i felt like i can pitch here for sure . ",
        "just going out there and believing in myself . one of my good friends told me , if you make the pitch it 's no different at any level , it 's when you miss the pitch is whenever they get you . toughest part for me was just getting acclimated to the lineups , knowing the hitters . as far as the competition i know i can pitch there for sure . it 's just a matter of getting in there and sticking my nose in . `` josh : do you expect to start the season with memphis ? ",
        "any idea what your role might be ? tyler : `` no , i 'm just going into spring training with the mindset of doing everything they ask me . i plan on being wherever they want me to be . if they send me to peoria and they think that 's in my best interest , that 's where i 'm going . i do n't really try and think too much about where i 'm going to be or what tomorrow might have . `` josh : what would you say is your ultimate goal for the season ? ",
        "tyler : `` just a consistent year , i want to limit my walks as much as possible . i want to control things that i can control . i think a lot of minor leaguers as they mature and get older they learn that , i can only control what tyler bray can control . unfortunately , i do n't get paid the big bucks to play gm to peoria , springfield , state college or memphis . my job is to take care of myself , take things one day at a time , one pitch at a time and everything outside of that is not up to me . ",
        "`` josh ; you 've made your way through the cardinals farm system and you mentioned simo , is there a specific coach who has had the biggest effect on you in your time in the minors ? more from redbird rants st. louis cardinals : the cardinals off-season conundrum2d ago st. louis cardinals : comparing the cubs and cardinals using war2d ago st. louis cardinals : debating greg holland and alex colome2d ago st. louis cardinals : brett cecil , the bad choice incumbent fall-back closer2d ago st. louis cardinals : half-way off-season grade for the cardinals2d ago tyler : `` all of them honestly , orozco was with me whenever i was in peoria and in state college , so he definetly sticks out for me . ",
        "he was there when i had a 7 era at 24 years old and i 'm wondering if i 'm going to be coming home at that low point in my baseball life . niemann , i 've worked with so much in spring training and in my short time at palm beach and simo for sure . those three guys have been there for me a lot . `` josh : how about a player who has had the biggest effect on you ? tyler : `` i 'd say daniel bard , he 's helped me out a lot with the game , knowledge of the game . ",
        "we 'd sit in the hotel room and talk , he was a big influence . there 's so many . just watching everyone 's routine , i ca n't really point to anybody , you take so much from everybody you play with and try to make your own way . `` josh : is there a hitter who sticks out to you as the toughest you 've faced in your time in the minors ? tyler : `` i do n't really want to say i 've struggled with anybody , i want to say i can get anybody out whenever . ",
        "i do n't really worry about the double , home run hitter , guys that drive balls deep . normally they tend to have a little longer swing , tend to like to get their hands extended and i feel really comfortable with those guys . it 's the short , skinny , leadoff , nine hole hitter that kind of slaps the ball around the park . those guys tend to get to me better than a big strong guy for sure . `` josh : just one more question , anything specific you will be focusing on this year ? ",
        "tyler : `` just being consistent , just believing in who i am as a pitcher . not trying to be somebody else . i 'm just trying to be the best tyler bray that i can be and just be a team player . i want to continuously prove that i 'm a competitor and let my team know that i 'll fight for you . i 'm a team player , that 's what 's most important to me is for those guys to know that . `` next : rotation reviewtyler will report for spring training with the rest of the pitchers and catchers on february 13th with an eye on continuing his progress . ",
        "look for tyler to continue to build on his success from the 2017 season . wherever he does end up , know his mind set wo n't change and he will look to compete wherever he is sent . i recently had the opportunity to talk to st. louis cardinals minor leaguer tyler bray about his time in the cardinals farm system and his goals for the 2018 season . the st. louis cardinals have a strong farm system and a member of this strong supporting core is tyler bray , a young pitcher climbing ...
