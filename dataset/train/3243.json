        "groucho marx once said that politics is the art of looking for trouble . new york mayor bill de blasio and city council speaker melissa mark-viverito have found it in a playground named for the comedian and his brothers in their old neighborhood on manhattan 's upper east side . the two officials support a developer 's $ 1 billion plan to build a 760-foot-high tower -- the tallest north of 60th street -- on 1.5 acres of land where kids have played ball for generations . the project would include as many as 1,200 apartment units in one building , as well as the first schools to be built in the neighborhood in almost 50 years . ",
        "the developer , avalonbay communities inc. , has spent more than $ 300,000 on lobbyists , filings with the city clerk show , and won state legislature approval to move forward in june . then neighbors and open-space advocates got governor andrew cuomo to slam the brakes after arguing that the parcel is n't just a school playground ; it 's parkland protected from development . that question awaits a determination by his state parks commissioner . `` the discontinuation of the marx brothers playground as parkland circumvents a 100-year-old zoning principle , '' said caroline harris , an attorney representing carnegie hill neighbors , a group that opposes the project . ",
        "`` the proposed actions unfairly favor a private development . '' high-risesthe dispute has emerged in the context of a broader citizens ' rebellion against the rise of luxury towers casting shadows on their neighbors . a lightning rod for public outrage stands almost 1,400 feet above 57th street at 432 park avenue , with 104 condos that have attracted billionaire residents , including saudi property developer fawaz al hokair , who last year purchased the penthouse for a reported $ 87.7 million . avalonbay has said it is committed to bringing affordable housing to east harlem . in exchange for the ballfield , it agreed to make about 300 of the 1,200 units `` affordable , '' with rents for a two-bedroom at about $ 800 to $ 2,400 a month . ",
        "median rent on a two-bedroom upper east side apartment is about $ 6,700 a month , according to the real-estate website trulia . com . new schoolsin addition to the 68-story tower at the corner of 96th and second avenue , three new schools would be built at no cost to taxpayers , said david simpson , a company spokesman . the city 's educational construction fund would issue $ 300 million of tax-exempt bonds , and the developer would pay the debt service with revenue from residential and retail rent . though avalonbay plans to build a new playground in the center of the complex , the existing one would be closed during construction , which is expected to take five years . ",
        "neighbors also worry that the recreational area would be overcrowded by the influx of students and residents , and cast in shadow . cuomo expressed broader concerns , saying that the project would set a precedent that could allow more than 250 similar city-owned properties to be gobbled up by developers . his halt to the project is the latest of many feuds with de blasio . `` confirming the status and nature of the land has significant legal implications for new york city and residents who want assurance that they will have access to outdoor recreation , '' cuomo said in an oct. . ",
        "23 memorandum . groucho marxthe playground , which opened in 1947 and was named after the marx brothers who lived on east 93rd , has been used by an adjacent vocational high school . carter strickland , a former city environmental commissioner who is new york state director for the trust for public land , a national conservation organization , said it 's the `` only full-size playing field for five miles on the east side . '' `` as more people move to new york city we must plan to add more parkland , not less , '' strickland said . ",
        "silve parvianen , 52 , a participant in east 96th neighbors , a community group , said the project makes her concerned for her neighborhood . `` it 's humongous , taller than anything between midtown manhattan north of 60th street and boston , and totally inappropriate for our space , '' she said . mark-viverito , the council president whose district includes the site , said she saw the avalonbay development as a way to provide one more lasting benefit to her latino political base . one of the schools to be built on the site would vacate a building that also houses the julia de burgos performance & arts center , giving it room to expand . ",
        "the decision could come any day , said mark-viverito , who leaves office dec. . 31 after 11 years . park advocates , though , do n't expect the issue to be decided until the legislature returns to albany in early 2018 . `` i understand that some people do n't want to see it happen but i believe the community benefit outweighs any concerns that have been raised , '' mark-viverito said . `` the investment is the legacy i leave behind .
