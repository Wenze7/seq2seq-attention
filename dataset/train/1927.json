        "live st. john 's more streams after four days of cancellations , marine atlantic ferries were back in action monday , with an extra boat in the water to help ease congestion at its ports . crossings in the cabot strait have been cancelled since thursday morning because of bad weather . there were about 200 commercial vehicles waiting in port aux basques and north sydney , according to darrell mercer , a spokesperson for the company . all scheduled sailings for monday were expected to go ahead . a third boat , the atlantic vision , left north sydney monday morning with a load of about 75 commercial vehicles , said mercer . ",
        "there were also between 150 and 200 passengers held up at the two ports , he said . mercer said the backlog should be cleared by monday night , but that would depend on how much traffic was on the highways , heading for the ferry ports . not over yet and though smooth sailing was expected all day monday , there 's another system on its way , he said . `` right now we 're not exactly sure what that impact will be , but our captains will be monitoring the forecast throughout today and into tomorrow , and they 'll make a final decision as to whether there will be an impact at that time . '' ",
        "it has been a `` very bad '' month for weather and cancellations for marine atlantic , mercer said . `` what we 're seeing over the last three weeks is at least one storm system moving through each week , and of course disrupting our service for multiple days , '' he said . `` it 's not normal to see this type of weather patterns , but we 're hoping we 'll soon see an improvement .
