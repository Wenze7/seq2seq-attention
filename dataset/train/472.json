        "whales and humans have long had a complicated relationship . for centuries , we hunted the massive sea creatures for their oil and meat until they were almost extinct . that stopped last century when replacement materials made it possible to recognize the value of living whales . but human behavior still threatens some species with extinction . this year , the north atlantic right whale experienced what experts at national oceanic and atmospheric administration call an `` unusual mortality event . '' seventeen of these endangered creatures were found dead off the coasts of new england and canada , and marine biologists on dec. . ",
        "5 said that they believe the species could be extinct within 20 years if no official action is taken to save them . in a presentation at last week 's new england fishery management council meeting in newport , rhode island , noaa 's endangered species act consultant mark murray brown sounded a dire warning . he called on american and canadian officials to work closely with commercial fisheries on efforts to protect the endangered whales . if they did n't , he said , the north atlantic right whale , which can weigh up to 150,000 pounds and grow as long as 48 feet , might disappear . ",
        "there are only about 100 breeding females of the species left , say scientists , and these sea creatures are increasingly being hit by commercial fishing vessels and getting caught in fishing gear like lines and traps . of 17 dead right whales found this year , six were killed by blunt-force trauma , which noaa believes was caused by collisions with vessels . in 2017 , there were reports of five right whales freed from entanglements in fishing nets ; three appear to have survived , but two have since died , scientists say . the good news is that efforts to change commercial fishing methods have proven to save whales and can protect the endangered species . ",
        "in 2009 , north american fisheries were required to sink 27,000 miles of floating lines deep in the water in order to prevent such entanglements , and in 2014 nearly 3,000 more miles of fishing lines were removed from north american waters altogether . `` we recognize and appreciate that the fishing industry has made many sacrifices to drastically reduce the number of lines in the water column , reducing the risk of serious injuries and mortalities to whales , '' notes murray-brown in his presentation . but given the low birth rate of this whale species , `` the current status of right whales is a critical situation , '' he writes . ",
        "murray-brown is hopeful that further improving the management of commercial fishing methods and making fishing gear even safer for right whales will prevent their extinction . he believes if marine biologists and commercial fishing companies in the north atlantic work together , they can prevent whale deaths by tracking the creatures , adding more lights to fishing equipment , changing vessel routes as necessary , and continuing to monitor line and trap placement .
