        "minneapolis -- if you take one very quick step outside , it surely feels like winter -- but take a look and it 's not measuring up to what we 're used to in minnesota . so far this season , the twin cities has had 7.2 inches of snow , which is about 16 inches below average . that 's compared to the 18.1 inches of snow we had last year by this time . less snow means less shoveling , but there are many people who would prefer the opposite . standing outside a home in new brighton , the front yard looks pretty normal with a slight coating of snow , but to the frustrated artists who live there , it 's a canvas -- and sadly for them , it 's blank . ",
        "`` it 's been pretty lame compared to most winters , '' austin bartz said . `` kind of hard to build a sculpture when you do n't have anything to build it with , '' his brother trevor said . the bartz brothers , including a third named connor , are well-known for their annual snow sculptures that attract people from all across the twin cities . over the past six winters , they say their sculptures are have been finished by new year 's day . but a dusting or just an inch of snow here and there , like they 've had in december , do them no good . ",
        "`` we probably need about four more inches of good , plowable snow , '' connor said . `` we just need it to be able to be plowed so we can get some bigger piles . '' snow removal companies have taken a hit as well . tiny sandman 's lawn , snow and painting services in south minneapolis has kept relatively busy . the company focuses mainly on residential snow removal using snow blowers and shovels . michael anderson , the company 's owner , can clearly tell the twin cities is seeing about 16 inches below average in terms of snowfall . ",
        "`` it 's just not like it used to be 10 to 15 years ago for the snow business , '' he said . anderson said 75 percent of customers pay a monthly rate , meaning he makes money with or without snow . but the customers who pay per service have n't called as much . `` we were probably out there twice , '' he said . it 's possible his business could pick up come february or march , but the clock is ticking for the bartz brothers who are hopeful their next creation will be on display in time for the super bowl . ",
        "`` if we do n't get snow within the next week , it 'll make things extremely difficult , and i do n't know if we 'll be able to do it this year , '' autsin said . `` just because will be back at school and it 'll only be me at home . ''   "
