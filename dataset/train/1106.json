        "baltimore 's mayor says repairs are being expedited at city schools in hopes of resuming classes monday after freezing conditions inside classrooms forced closures this week . mayor catherine pugh says she has enlisted city engineers in addition to the department of public works to expedite repairs , according to a statement released friday . the mayor tweeted out photos of work being done at a number of city schools saturday . the issue of cold inside city schools drew national attention this week , with pictures posted of students bundled up inside their classrooms . governor larry hogan said on friday that he 's outraged , and he wants answers from school administrators . ",
        "and he 's not the only one . on wednesday , former nfl player and current baltimore teacher aaron maybin posted a video of himself talking to his students about the cold on twitter . in the post , he wrote : `` this . is . unacceptable . '' `` the water is cold ! '' said one mother who spoke with wjz , chastity spears . `` it 's unbearable . there 's icicles in the classroom . the cold water jug is frozen solid . it 's inhumane for these children . '' schools elected to close completely on thursday and friday , but some parents pulled their kids from class even before then . ",
        "gov. hogan : ` highly funded ' baltimore city school system to blame for cold classrooms . `` i 'm outraged at the failures in baltimore city , '' governor hogan said friday . he said he wants to trace the money trail , after reports that city schools have returned $ 66 million in state money that could have funded dozens of new heating systems . `` the average school system in maryland spends over 50 percent of their budget on schools , '' hogan said . `` baltimore city spends 11 percent . '' `` they 're one of the few jurisdictions in the state that has n't addressed these problems , in spite of the fact that i believe they might be the most highly funded school system in america , '' hogan went on to say . ",
        "`` we 've got to get to the bottom of what 's going on on north avenue . '' baltimore city public schools district office is located on north avenue . in a statement friday , city schools called that `` misleading , '' saying specific requests for heating systems -- including one for douglass high school -- were deferred by the state . `` it is also important to note that for the current school year we have allocated $ 17 million in funding for maintenance issues and have increased that amount to $ 19 million for next year , '' pugh said in friday 's statement . ",
        "despite their differences of opinion , officials agree the main focus is getting the doors back open for students .   "
