        "los angeles -- diego rossi drew the attention of scouts worldwide last year while playing a prominent role in penarol 's championship season in his native uruguay . so why would a touted teenage striker choose to continue his rising career at los angeles football club , which has never played a game and has n't even revealed its jersey ? `` to write the history , '' rossi said monday after the first training session in franchise history . nearly 39 months after a deep-pocketed ownership group secured major league soccer 's 23rd franchise , lafc finally took the field on a sunny january morning at ucla for its inaugural workout under coach bob bradley . ",
        "the club does n't yet have a fully stocked roster or a finished stadium , although both of those projects will be completed shortly . building a true team will take a bit longer , but bradley is confident he has a group that can make an immediate impact in the growing north american league . `` i 've seen a lot of first days , but i thought overall , there were some good signs , '' said bradley , the former boss of swansea city and the u. s. national team . `` of course , i see all the things that still need work , so there was a little bit of yelling and screaming and demonstrating , but that 's all part of the work every day . '' ",
        "bradley is the only coach in mls history to win a title with an expansion club , leading the chicago fire to a championship in 1998 . he has n't coached in his domestic league since leaving chivas usa in 2006 , but lafc seems to have the ingredients to build another compelling team immediately . lafc might not have jerseys yet , but rossi 's shorts featured a no . 9 , underlining his expected role as the striker . the no . 10 shorts were worn by carlos vela , the versatile mexican playmaker who left la liga 's real sociedad to become lafc 's first designated player . ",
        "rossi and vela could be a compelling tandem , but they 're only part of a roster already studded with international talent including belgian defender laurent ciman , egyptian midfielder omar gaber , costa rican forward marco urena , ghanaian forward latif blessing and americans benny feilhaber and walker zimmerman . `` the players ' names come pretty easy to me , '' said feilhaber , a ucla product who had mixed emotions about leaving sporting kansas city after five seasons . `` we 're still getting to know each other , but it 's fun to get out on the field with players that are as talented as this . ",
        "we 're just getting our feet wet , but it 's going to be exciting . '' gaber played for bradley on the egyptian national team , and he was excited when lafc acquired him from fc basel in switzerland 's top league . `` once they started to speak with me , i felt they are so professional , '' gaber said . `` i felt for sure i had to come . yes , maybe it 's a risk to be with a new club , but we have very good players , coaches and staff . the people are so professional . ",
        "we have big ambitions , and we want success . i am sure we will achieve good things together . '' lafc is n't done building , either . rossi filled the club 's second dp spot , but a third remains open . the club has n't decided whether to fill it now or after the world cup , but there 's little doubt lafc has the financial might to contend for top mls-level talent . the club 's resources also will be on display in late april when banc of california stadium opens in downtown los angeles . ",
        "located next-door to the historic coliseum , lafc 's privately funded , soccer-specific home is expected to be a festive gathering place for la 's burgeoning downtown population of relocated professionals and locals alike . after a handful of preseason friendlies , lafc will open its first season with six road games , starting in seattle on march 4 and including its first date with the la galaxy on march 31 . `` i 'm excited about the potential of this club , '' vela said . `` i think it 's going to be incredible .
