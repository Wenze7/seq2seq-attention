        "lima - peru 's jailed ex-president alberto fujimori , who was serving a 25-year sentence for corruption and rights abuses , has been pardoned on humanitarian grounds , the presidency said on sunday . the announcement came after fujimori 's son kenji split the opposition vote in parliament , allowing peruvian president pedro pablo kuczynski to avoid impeachment and sparking speculation about a pardon as political payback . `` the president of the republic ... has decided to grant a humanitarian pardon to mr alberto fujimori and seven other people in similar condition , '' the presidency said in a statement that did not name the other pardon recipients . ",
        "a medical team `` determined that mr fujimori suffers from a progressive , degenerative and incurable illness and that prison conditions represent a grave risk to his life , '' the statement said . kenji fujimori hailed the decision . `` on behalf of the fujimori family , i would like to thank president pedro pablo kuczynski for the noble and magnanimous gesture of giving my father alberto the humanitarian pardon , '' he wrote on his twitter account . alberto fujimori was transferred from his cell to a clinic saturday suffering from low blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat . ",
        "the 79-year-old had a `` sudden drop of pressure with marked arrhythmia , '' doctors said . `` he is making adequate progress in the intensive care unit , '' said his physician alejandro aguinaga . `` he will remain hospitalized for as long as necessary , until he has stabilized . `` fujimori , in office from 1990 to 2000 and imprisoned since 2005 , was admitted amid rumors that he could be pardoned this christmas . - quid pro quo ? - he has been hospitalized on several previous occasions , the last time in september , and has had heart , back and stomach trouble as well as several operations to remove cancerous growths from his tongue . ",
        "despite his conviction for human rights abuses , fujimori retains a level of popularity in peru for having defeated guerillas and for stabilizing the economy after a period of crisis . under him and his hardline security chief vladimiro montesinos , state forces virtually wiped out the leftist shining path and tupac amaru rebels . fujimori also clamped down hard on his political rivals . in 1992 , he staged an internal coup , dissolving the legislature with the knowledge of only montesinos and military chiefs . speculation about a pardon arose after kenji fujimori broke ranks on thursday with the ex-president 's daughter keiko , who leads the peruvian opposition and was pushing to impeach kuczynski . ",
        "kenji , whose more moderate line has set him at odds with his sister recently , was followed by other deputies from the party whose votes were crucial to securing the impeachment . that allowed kuczynski -- who was accused of lying to cover up $ 5 million in payments received from disgraced brazilian construction firm odebrecht -- to survive the vote . `` kenji is a sort of santa claus who appeared with his christmas sleigh bringing 10 congressional votes , '' said political analyst luis benavente . keiko lost to kuczynski in last year 's presidential election and is herself facing questioning linked to the sprawling odebrecht graft investigation .
