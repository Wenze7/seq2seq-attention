        "it might seem like a distant memory but , once upon a time , smartwatches were made by smartphone makers . having lost interest in what was deemed a business failure , the wearable market was salvaged by fashion and luxury brands instead . one of the first such saviors is tag heuer who just last year launched the connected modular 45 android wear smartwatch . this time , it 's announcing the connected modular 41 , designed for smaller wrists . its petite size , however , can be deceiving . the `` 41 '' in the name refers to its 41 nm diameter . ",
        "it 's not exactly a huge step down from 45 , but that 's the way tag heuer is selling this new smartwatch . at least it 's also selling it with an appropriately smaller price tag , though , like its size , the difference is n't exactly earth-shattering . the specs , however , do change a bit , fortunately for the better . thanks to the smaller real estate , the screen , which has a resolution of 390 Ã— 390 , enjoys a higher pixel density of 326 ppi than the connected modular 45 's 287 ppi . ",
        "it 's also claimed to be brighter at a maximum of 350 nits . after all , outdoor visibility is even more important for a smartwatch than it is for a phone . the memory configuration has been upgraded as well . now it 's 1 gb of ram and 8 gb of internal storage , double that of what most android wear smartwatches have today . the processor remains an intel atom , one of the very few to find their way into a commercial wearable device . as for that price tag , the tag heuer connected modular 41 costs $ 1,200 , versus the nearly $ 1,600 of the larger , older model . ",
        "there are new strap colors to choose from as well , including pink , blue , and white leather . not to leave lovers of bigger timepieces empty-handed , tag heuer also announced a new connected modular 45 full diamond edition with 589 vvs baguette size diamonds that you probably wo n't be able to buy . source : tag heuer .
