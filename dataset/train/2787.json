        "trans actors , from left , mj rodriguez , indya moore and alexia garcia at st. peter 's episcopal church in the bronx , where their film , `` saturday church '' was shot . if hollywood ' € ™ s 2017 revealed anything , it ' € ™ s that queer cinema is on the rise . from the historic academy award win for ' € moonlight ' € early in the year to the releases of ' € battle of the sexes ' € and ' € professor marston and the wonder women ' € from major studios ' € '' not to mention this year ' € ™ s oscar contenders ' € call me by your name , ' € a fantastic woman ' € and ' € the wound ' € ™ ' € '' films by and about lgbtq people are receiving more attention and delivering more complex storylines . ",
        "the trend looks to continue in 2018 , and the upcoming ryan murphy-created series ' € pose ' € on fx could take things even farther on television with a historic lgbtq laden ensemble in a portrait of ' € ball culture ' € in ' € ˜ 80s new york . but despite these obvious steps forward for increased representation across all screens , narratives around transgender people are often still limited in their scope . we are the only people who know our lived experiences , what it 's like to be trans and the things we go through . ' ",
        "€ '' mj rodriguez ' € we continue to see productions that are focusing on the death of the experience of what it is to be a trans woman , ' € said trans actress indya moore . ' € but we have lives and experiences that aren ' € ™ t just about the struggles of being trans and on the margins . where are where our transness is not ? ' € moore is part of the ' € pose ' € cast and also stars in ' € saturday church , ' € a film opening jan. . ",
        "12 in los angeles and on digital platforms , which attempts to help lead such a charge . from first-time writer-director damon cardasis , ' € saturday church ' € is the story of 14-year-old ulysses , a shy and effeminate kid grappling with questions about gender identity . their journey to self-discovery takes a turn after meeting a group of trans and gay folk who take ulysses to ' € saturday church , ' € a program for lgbtq youth held in the basement of a local place of worship . there , the teen discovers a passion for , and family in , new york ' € ™ s ballroom scene . ",
        "margot bingham plays ulysses ' € ™ single mother and regina taylor is the devoutly conservative aunt opposite marquis rodriguez and trans actresses moore , mj rodriguez , alexia garcia and kate bornstein . ballroom , as seen in docs ' € paris is burning ' € and ' € kiki , ' € is portrayed as a place of acceptance for participants who find themselves otherwise marginalized . most are black or latinx and they belong to cliques known as ' € houses . ' € led by a mother or father figure , houses serve as families for their members , some of whom have cut ties with their biological kin . ",
        "those houses are named after fashion designers such as chanel or balenciaga or carry the name of a legend in the community , like willi ninja or pepper labeija . voguing , the now almost mainstream dance form , hails from this community . trans actors , from left , indya moore , mj rodriguez and alexia garcia star in `` saturday church . '' cardasis was influenced to pen ' € saturday church ' € by an actual lgbtq outreach program in new york held at the west village ' € ™ s episcopal church st. luke in the fields . ",
        "he learned of the program , called art & acceptance , through his mother , an episcopal priest in the bronx , and volunteered with the group for a number of months . ' € after meeting the kids in the program , i was inspired by their narratives and their strength and creativity and their sense of empowerment when they performed , ' € he said . ' € took shape from there . ' € while his intention was to just ' € tell a very human story , to show the challenges this character was going through , ' € cardasis knew that for the film , which includes song and dance numbers , to feel authentic to the world he had volunteered in , people from that very program and the ballroom scene needed to be involved . ' ",
        "€ there was no question in my mind that the characters needed to be played by people within the community , ' € he said . ' € it was harder to put together a movie casting ' € ˜ unknown ' € ™ or first-time actors , there was no other way of doing it . ' € the result is a supporting cast of primarily trans women with varying degrees of acting experience but who all intimately know the experiences of the characters they play . many of the extras are either from the church ' € ™ s program or members of the ballroom scene . ",
        "garcia ' € '' who is a member of the house of xtravaganza ' € '' was always interested in acting , but she had never auditioned for anything . ' € i did n't see a lot of trans actresses on television so i did n't think it would even be a possibility , ' € she said . ' € it never really crossed my mind . ' € the same goes for moore who has minor acting experience from attending a theater arts high school but had never made moves to break into the film industry . ",
        "because cardasis reached out to house father jose xtravaganza and forwarded casting info , she credits being involved in the scene for the opportunity . ' € it ' € ™ s awesome to see how the industry reaches out to the ballroom scene and culture to portray the ballroom scene and culture , ' € she said . ' € it ' € ™ s been a blessing to help express some of what i ' € ™ ve come from through our gaze . ' € and therein lies what separates ' € saturday church ' € from other narrative depictions of the ballroom scene and trans and gender nonconforming lives . ",
        "there ' € ™ s a raw authenticity present in the film that ' € ™ s tough to achieve from simply helicoptering in , said bornstein . ' € damon , by diving into the world prior to making the film and listening to all of us actors , used whatever privilege he has ' € '' yes , gay men have some privilege ' € '' to ease somebody else ' € ™ s suffering , ' € she said . ' € and he didn ' € ™ t impose his voice on any character in the film . ",
        "on that level , this film is groundbreaking . ' € she also notes that his use of the xtravaganzas and members of the house of labeija as consultants and the casting of trans women as trans characters helps this effort , a lesson hollywood at large can learn . mj rodriguez , whose acting credits include ' € nurse jackie , ' € ' € luke cage ' € and an off-broadway revival of ' € rent , ' € agreed . ' € we are the only people who know our lived experiences , what it 's like to be trans and the things we go through , ' € she said . ' ",
        "€ we can bring that to the role . ' € it ' € ™ s a striking contrast to the long list of cisgender heterosexual actors who have played trans women in high profile roles , including jeffrey tambor in ' € transparent , ' € eddie redmayne in ' € the danish girl ' € and jared leto in ' € dallas buyers club . ' € ' € they don ' € ™ t have the emotional pull of what it 's like to exist in that margin , what it 's like to be unloved and rejected and the layers of trauma that come with being rejected so often by friends , family , loved interests and for men to feel like it 's okay to abuse you and have their way , ' € added moore . ' ",
        "€ when we create productions that focus on the gaze of other people who are not trans , we ' € ™ re getting these stories that are putting our transness under a microscope to be dissected . our experiences and the trauma we go through are being tokenized for people to gawk at and to fetishize . these people do n't know what it 's like to be rejected because you exist . ' € , it ' € ™ s not acting . we ' € ™ re actually pulling from an authentic place . ' € . "
