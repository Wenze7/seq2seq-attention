        "atlanta -- female members of the congressional black caucus are asking republican leaders to let alabama democrat doug jones join the senate immediately or delay legislative votes . but the move is unlikely to sway the gop as it tries to get a tax bill to president donald trump 's desk . in separate letters to senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and alabama secretary of state john merrill , 20 house members say jones has been `` duly elected '' by alabama voters , adding , `` it is time for you to honor their decision . `` mcconnell rejected a similar call from senate minority leader chuck schumer , d-new york , after jones ' upset victory tuesday over republican roy moore . ",
        "mcconnell said appointed sen. luther strange will remain in the seat until january , when jones would be sworn in to complete the original term of attorney general jeff sessions . that allows republicans to maintain a 52-48 majority as they try to pass a tax overhaul . a handful of republican senators have wavered during late-stage negotiations , giving mcconnell little room to maneuver with democrats all voting `` no . `` jones has n't said plainly how he would vote , endorsing the idea of lower corporate tax income rates but criticizing the gop bill as too heavily slanted to corporations and wealthy individuals . ",
        "mcconnell 's move is helped by alabama 's routine election process . jones defeated moore by about 20,000 votes or 1.5 percentage points , but elections officials are still counting late-arriving absentee votes and write-ins . a final tally wo n't be certified until late december or early january , when mcconnell hopes already to have delivered a tax bill to trump . the black caucus letters , led by reps. bonnie watson coleman , d-new jersey , and terri sewell , d-alabama , do not mention the details of jones ' upset victory over moore , but the democrat was boosted by strong african-american turnout . ",
        "exit polls suggest black voters cast about 30 percent of 1.35 million ballots , despite being just 25 percent of the eligible electorate . the polls showed jones winning about 94 percent of the black vote , with near unanimous support among black women . coleman , sewell and their colleagues tried to boost their argument -- or at least make a political point -- by reminding mcconnell he 's been willing in the past to adjust the senate agenda based on the election calendar . in 2016 , the kentucky republican cited the looming presidential election as he refused to act on president barack obama 's nominee for a supreme court vacancy . ",
        "`` let 's let the american people decide , '' mcconnell said at the time , the letter recalls . after trump took office and made his own nomination , mcconnell quickly shepherded justice neil gorsuch to a confirmation vote . -- follow barrow on twitter at .   "
