        "london - british consumer sentiment fell to its lowest level in four years this month as inflation-squeezed households took a gloomier view of their personal finances , a long-running survey showed on thursday . the gfk consumer confidence index slipped to -13 , its lowest since december 2013 , from -12 in november , bucking expectations in a reuters poll of economists for it to hold steady and extending a downward trend seen for most of 2017 . gfk said britain 's departure from the european union and the bank of england 's first interest rate rise in a decade were weighing on consumers , who felt their personal financial situation had worsened and they were less keen to make big purchases . ",
        "inflation also hit its highest in nearly six years at 3.1 percent in november -- easily outstripping lacklustre pay growth -- and a separate survey showed on wednesday that households ' expectations for future inflation were the highest since 2013 . `` we need to see several issues move on before the downward trend of the consumer mood changes , '' gfk analyst joe staton said , citing brexit and the path of boe rates in particular . `` none of this will be resolved quickly so there 's every likelihood that 2018 will take us lower . '' britain 's economy has slowed this year -- in marked contrast to other major economies -- after initially performing well in the months after june 2016 's brexit vote . ",
        "imf managing director christine lagarde told britons on wednesday that her warnings about the financial cost of voting for brexit were being borne out , and said britain 's economy was only likely to grow by 1.5 percent next year . retail sales data so far have been mixed in the crucial pre-christmas season . official figures for november beat economists ' expectations , and the confederation of british industry said spending growth in early december was solid , despite tough underlying trading conditions . the gfk survey , conducted on behalf of the european commission , polled 1,998 britons between dec. .
