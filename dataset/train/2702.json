        "sacramento -- black city leaders joined sacramento city officials to call for peace . on monday afternoon , mayor darrell steinberg introduced a program called advance peace . the program aims to reduce gun violence , gun activity , and gun-related deaths . the sacramento city council passed a four-year , $ 1.5 million package for the program in august in the wake of a shooting in meadowview park . the program drew criticism from the law enforcement community , especially after a misleading article published by fox news claimed the program was a $ 1.5 million payoff to gang members . ",
        "black community leaders say the missing link to solving gun and gang violence is mentorship . they believe the new program will bring role models into the lives of at-risk youth and help them out of the street life . `` gang violence is ripping our neighborhoods and city apart , '' said eric robinson . it 's something 21-year-old robinson sadly knows too well . drugs and guns were a familiar sight for him growing up in south sacramento . `` i 've been a witness to gun violence , i 've been shot at two or three times , i always say , `` why me ? ' '' ",
        "robinson said . robinson says he 's lucky to be alive , but he lost his girlfriend to gun violence earlier this summer . `` i think about her every day , she was the love of my life , '' robinson added . tired of losing friends and loved ones , robinson began mentoring at-risk youth . he says he 's managed to help a few sever their ties with gangs and instead pursue an education . the problem , robinson says : `` we do n't have enough resources out here to reach out to a lot of kids in gangs . ",
        "'' `` we wan na give every gang member an opportunity to be a part of this program , '' said rick jennings , the city 's vice mayor . advance peace was unveiled monday by sacramento city officials . `` we wan na give them job training and job development skills , we wan na give them financial literacy life skills , '' said jennings . the program got its start ten years ago in the bay area city of richmond . by december 2016 , the city saw a 71-percent reduction in gun-related deaths . the program brings hope to black city leaders . ",
        "`` mentoring , getting people out of the community and exposing them to new , different things , it has a potential to work , '' said one leader . leaders say consistency is key to get black youth out of the fast life . `` this is a four-year commitment ; that 's consistency . if we can continue to keep that commitment and lift up this strategy i think we can see a change here in sacramento . '' the city is now hiring staff to do outreach and recruit at-risk youth to join the program . the city 's goal is to help at least 50 gang members and at-risk youth over the next four years . "
