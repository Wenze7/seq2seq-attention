        "hello , i am srihari unnikrishnan . a 14 year old coder . a few weeks ago , i was at jnu . one of india 's , biggest universities , to give a talk on django . it was a small scale event , but it was my first ever talk at a meetup or anything like that . when i told my friends about that , what i get is : `` how do you get so much time to do this ? '' quite frankly , my friends are all good scorers . but the thing which bothers me is that most children do n't try anything new . ",
        "this is not their problem . the children have to write exams every two months , they face tremendous psychological pressure from their parents . encouragement is zero . is our education system promoting students to learn new things and explore , or is it telling them to stick to and love the usuals ? i would leave it for you to decide . but back to my original question . how do i manage coding and high school ? i score alright . not too shabby . here 's how it goes . i wake up at six o'clock in the morning , in reality , my mum wakes me up at six in the morning . ",
        "i do the usuals , eat breakfast and go to school and come back at 2:30 in the evening . i usually watch tv till 4 and then . i sit down and do something i want to , maybe homework , maybe practice my drums . i am kinda busy till seven . then i eat dinnerbut wait . where 's the code ? i usually code the following days -- tuesday , wednesday , thursday , saturday , sundaythese are the days i usually feel the best . i put up some music and practice code for about three to four hours every one of these 5 days . ",
        "when do i study , you ask ? i study around two hours a day . i have an hour before and after coding sessions for that . if i could do it . so can you . ~ peace .   "
