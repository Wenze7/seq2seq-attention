        "as the starz-altice usa carriage dispute drags on , the lionsgate-owned network has filed two separate petitions with the fcc that aim to force the cable company to restore it on new york-area optimum systems . the no . 2 premium network has been dark for optimum 's 4.9 million customers since jan. . 1 . the petitions request the fcc to force altice to restore carriage of starz , starz encore and movieplex for the 30-day notice period required under fcc rules . it also asks the distributor to `` correct '' its `` misleading and false disclosures regarding its deletions of starz channels '' and `` respond to consumer inquiries and complaints , '' in compliance with fcc rules . ",
        "`` to our great disappointment , and to the disappointment of altice customers , starz and its affiliated channels continue to remain off the air in new york , '' said starz ceo chris albrecht . `` this disruption has caused high-quality programming that promotes diversity in its production , talent and content , to be taken from viewers with no notice . more than that , altice has continued a pattern of abusive consumer practices in avoiding the inquiries and complaints of its subscribers about the deletion . `` the filing of today 's petition is the next step in our effort to ensure that altice subscribers receive the full value of their subscription , including restoration of all starz channels , '' he added . ",
        "`` starz has never stopped transmitting its service to altice and it is time for them to do the right thing by either restoring the service or giving our customers a refund . '' last week , during tca winter press tour in pasadena , albrecht expressed confidence in a resolution but said it could take time . `` this thing is far from over , '' he said . `` these negotiations are always difficult -- it 's becoming increasingly a case of mvpds wanting to pay less but still be able to charge their customers more . obviously that does n't work for us . '' ",
