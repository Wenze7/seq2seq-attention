        "i have a confession to make : i am that person on public transport making out with her partner . i have been told to `` get a room '' . i am very private about my partner on social media , but on the street and with friends , we 're the smoochy couple , and i do n't care . pda still , in many ways , has a bad name . a study in 2016 found that people who indulge in them excessively in front of others are likely showing off , and displays of lovey-dovey behavior on social media have been linked to emotional issues and relationship insecurity . ",
        "but if it makes you feel good , who cares ? touching your partner has been shown to have benefits : physical connection and touch from a loved one have been demonstrated in studies to calm pain , increase empathy , and help ` sync ' you to your partner . public displays of affection are a personal choice , but for me they also resonate with the past , both personal and historical . in many periods in human history , women 's abilityto demonstrate emotional attachment in public was fiercely curtailed or thought to be dangerous . and in light of that , getting affectionate in public as a woman seems like an act of feminist rebellion .

        "in european civilization , public kissing was , for much of history , the domain of men ; researcher sheril kirschenbaum notes at the daily beast that , from ancient greece up to the early modern period in europe , formal kisses between dudes , on hands or cheeks , were signs of fealty , legal binding , loyalty , peace-making , and supplication : before the rise of christianity in rome , platonic lip kisses were actually seen as pretty normal among family members , but unmarried girls were excluded from this activity -- presumably because it might endanger their virtue .",
        "roman wives were celebrated for their `` chastity '' and propriety in public ; the poet ovid was actually banished from rome by the emperor augustus for his book the art of love , likely because of its racy content . kissing in public took on complicated overtones as christianity rose in europe , in part because while the bible promoted the `` kiss of charity , '' a kiss of greeting between fellow christians , it also noted that judas 's signal of betrayal was a kiss on jesus 's cheek . medieval couples were often meant to kiss in public only once , at their wedding ceremony , and there were strict restrictions on `` kisses of peace '' and other legal and formal activities , often excluding women . ",
        "by the 17th century in america , women could be prosecuted for adultery if they were seen with a man who as much as had his arm around them , and an 18th century conduct manual recommended that it was n't even acceptable to kiss a woman on the cheek when first introduced because it produced `` unhappiness '' for her . affection of any kind between men and women in public was threatening to a woman 's reputation and therefore a lessening of her value in patriarchal society . in 19th century england , it was n't even acceptable for unmarried women to speak to men without a married female chaperone present . ",
        "against that backdrop , the freedom to publicly embrace a partner , married or not , feels rather like a choice born of liberation . public displays of affection became more acceptable in the west in the 20th century , aided by early hollywood . in societies that retain stricter gender roles , public displays of affection remain , in many senses , taboo , particularly if the couple are unmarried . the atlantic reported in 2014 that couples across india staged public kiss displays as protests against `` vice police '' who opposed any pda as morally corrosive . ",
        "in spain , by contrast , public display of affection have become more accepted , as young people living with their parents face serious societal restrictions on bringing partners home for privacy . for queer women or gender-nonconforming folks , there 's an additional dimension to pda . public displays of affection for gender-nonconforming people are often carefully moderated to guard personal safety . violence against the lgbtq community for daring to publicly exist continues to be an issue , even in societies that are supportive of lgbtq people . in less tolerant places , the choice to hold hands , kiss or show signals of affection is one that remains off-limits for the sake of remaining unharmed . ",
        "to be able to kiss a partner in public is still , in many ways , a privilege accorded to heterosexual-presenting couples . this is an issue with which i 'm intimately familiar , as a person who has dated women -- and beenharassed on the street for holding hands with them . every kiss i experience with my husband in public carries the recognition that many , many women lack the same privilege with their own partners . i never stop feeling frustrated and furious that simple acts of public love are allowed due to my partner 's gender . ",
        "pdas are rarely simple . beyond demonstrations of love , they also encompass theories of gender , regulations of behavior , and ideas about human freedom and the validity of love . we deserve to make out with whoever we like in public , and we 're not sorry .   "
