        "in february 2015 , shortly after greece 's new anti-bailout government swept to power with promises of ending austerity , a little-known european official flew to athens on a secret trip to deliver a message , the ramifications of which continue to reverberate today . sitting down with a small group of government ministers , the austrian economist spelled out the consequences of greece defaulting on its loans . first , the country would be cut off from the international funds needed to pay salaries and pensions . as capital flight ensued , banks would collapse and the economy would follow . ",
        "his audience , however , was n't convinced , until his prophesies were all but realized six months later . thomas wieserphotographer : krisztian bocsi/bloombergthe trip , orchestrated by higher powers in brussels and berlin , highlights the key role played behind the scenes by thomas wieser , head of the influential euro-working group , in helping quell the crisis that racked the euro area . as wieser now prepares to leave his post at the helm of one of the bloc 's most powerful bodies later this month , the lessons learned during those turbulent times are informing the debate among governments on how to strengthen the 19-nation currency region . ",
        "the mandarin 's departure signals the end of an era for the old guard who faced unprecedented financial calamity , while the bloc 's attention has shifted from managing chaos to avoiding it altogether . on monday , euro-area finance ministers will appoint dutch treasury director general hans vijlbrief to succeed wieser , in a meeting that will otherwise focus on further steps to complete the bloc 's banking union and develop its crisis-fighting fund . greek pastathe sharp-witted 63-year-old wieser is little known outside eu institutions and finance ministries . but from his office on the third floor of the gray justus lipsius european council building in brussels -- where leaders have held countless emergency summits -- he has overseen the euro 's ascension , transformation and brush with disintegration . ",
        "since 2012 , wieser has led the officials that prepare the monthly meetings of euro-area finance ministers , known as eurogroup . the so-called ewg was notoriously powerful during the crisis , green-lighting emergency loans and leading discussions on issues such as banking rule overhauls and the bloc 's crisis-fighting apparatus . one month after his 2015 trip failed to convince the greeks to drop their brinkmanship , tensions between athens and its creditors were growing , and wieser was back on a plane to greece for a second clandestine mission . german chancellor angela merkel had invited greek premier alexis tsipras to berlin in an effort to break the deadlock , and wieser 's mission was to ensure the athens 's delegation was up to the task . ",
        "over pasta and chicken at then-finance minister 's yanis varoufakis 's house , he attempted to prepare the greeks for their first visit to the chancellery . the surreptitious trip was characteristic of wieser who , while never in the limelight , was always in the center of countless critical efforts that ensured the euro survived its greatest crisis yet . `` thomas wieser is a man who advances without seeking fame , '' valdis dombrovskis , the eu commissioner in charge of the euro , said in an interview . `` he is one of these skilled statesmen who will be little known to the large public , yet without whom history would not be the same . '' ",
        "squaring the circlewieser 's departure at the end of january , which aligns with the end of eurogroup chief jeroen dijsselbloem 's tenure , will likely rob the group of depth and experience just as the euro area enters a critical junction . with the worst of its crisis behind it , and helped by the election of deeper-integration advocate emmanuel macron in france , the bloc is now looking at strengthening itself in the face of future financial turmoil . normalcy returns thomas wieser and jeroen dijsselbloem led the eurogroup during the peak of the crisis source : eurostat `` as the first permanent ewg chairperson , thomas wieser leaves huge shoes to fill , '' said klaus regling , the managing director of the european stability mechanism , the euro-area bailout fund that was itself born out of one such crisis-meeting . ",
        "`` he was one of the key persons to ensure that the euro area has overcome the crisis successfully and that the integrity of the currency union remained intact . '' few cases illustrate wieser 's role in the euro 's survival better than his involvement in greece . whenever the country and its creditors failed to see eye-to-eye , he was among the few tasked with squaring the circle , even as everyone else had given up . after a eurogroup meeting in july 2015 concluded prematurely because the atmosphere had become too toxic , wieser , together with dijsselbloem , stayed until the early hours and , to the surprise of all sides , hammered out an acceptable compromise , a version of which was eventually agreed upon by euro-area leaders in a deal that brought greece back from the brink . ",
        "` linchpi n'to many eu officials , wieser is the ultimate brussels eurocrat : he 's deeply knowledgeable , technically proficient and has an an understanding of the political pitfalls his group 's decisions will face in eu capitals . to some critics , though , he represents the faceless `` brussels '' behind demands for tough austerity inflicted upon europe 's citizens by unelected officials sitting miles away in belgium . still , revered or loathed , few doubt the role he played in the euro 's most critical hours . speaking after a summit on the future of the euro-area in december , european commission president jean-claude juncker called the soon-departing wieser `` the linchpin of the eurogroup . ",
        "'' `` without him much would not have been possible , and thanks to him much was made possible , '' juncker said .   "
