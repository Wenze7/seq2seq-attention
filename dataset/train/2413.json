        "a bankruptcy judge who slammed bank of america corp. . for its treatment of a california couple over a foreclosure declined a request to tear up the scathing opinion , saying it was important `` to name and to shame '' the company in order to shed light on practices that affect consumers . u.s. bankruptcy judge christopher klein was labeled a `` hero judge '' by money magazine for his march ruling , which blasted bank of america for its `` heartless '' conduct against the couple , erik and renee sundquist , and awarded more than $ 45 million in damages . ",
        "the bank agreed to pay the sundquists several million dollars more than the $ 6 million they won at trial if klein 's opinion was expunged . `` this was a naked effort to coerce this court to erase the record , '' klein wrote in a thursday opinion . `` no chance . no dice . '' although the judge agreed to vacate the damages , he said `` trials have consequences '' and the litigation is no longer a two-party dispute . nonprofit consumer advocacy groups and law schools that had intervened in the case on behalf of the public had a `` potent point '' when they noted that the bank `` has shown no remorse , made no apology and promised no reform of the corporate culture practices illustrated by this case , '' klein said . ",
        "`` nothing suggests that the bank accepts responsibility for its actions , '' klein said . `` this court remains persuaded that the conduct warranting significant damages resulted from a corporate culture that facilitates , and is unwilling to correct , the problems that bank of america visited upon the sundquists . '' jerry dubrowski , a spokesman for bank of america , declined to comment on thursday 's opinion . the sundquists stood to collect $ 5 million in punitive damages and about $ 1 million for their losses , including for emotional distress and their costs of suing bank of america . ",
        "the intervenors were slated to receive $ 40 million . the sundquists agreed to donate $ 300,000 to the intervenors from their settlement , klein said . the sundquists were told during the recession that they needed to let their 6 percent mortgage go into default if they wanted to modify it , according to klein 's march ruling . when they did so , even though they could afford the payments , the bank never agreed to a modification and the couple ended up in bankruptcy court . the bank violated a rule requiring foreclosure actions to be postponed during bankruptcy proceedings . ",
        "by the time it realized it made a mistake and allowed the sundquists to return , their major appliances had been stolen . the judge noted that the ordeal led erik sundquist to attempt suicide and caused his wife to be hospitalized with heart-attack symptoms . `` to name and shame bank of america on the public record in an opinion that stays on the books serves a valuable purpose casting sunlight on practices that affect ordinary consumers , '' klein said . `` other persons dealing with bank of america will be able to gauge their experiences against what has been revealed in this case . ",
        "`` the case is sundquist v. bank of america corp. , 14-02278 , u. s. bankruptcy court , eastern district of california .   "
