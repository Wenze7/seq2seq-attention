        "british steel workers are suffering from bad financial advice which can encourage them to quit their valuable final salary pension schemes in favour of worse arrangements , mps have warned . advice is too often `` shoddy or just plain crooked '' , frank field , chairman of the influential commons work and pensions select committee , said in a letter to the financial conduct authority 's top supervisor megan butler . he added that the fca had been `` extraordinarily cautious '' by acting very slowly to protect savers . so far the fca 's action to help british steel pension scheme members `` remains grossly inadequate '' , mr field warned . ",
        "`` it is apparent that insufficient protections are in place to prevent consumers with defined benefit pension pots being seduced into a transfer against their interests , '' he said . the fca acknowledges that final salary scheme members will rarely benefit from transferring out of their pension , but professional services firm mercer estimates 210,000 people did just that with Â£ 50bn of savings between april 2015 and june 2017 . the letter comes after warnings that rogue advisers are specifically targeting the more than 100,000 members of the british steel pension scheme . those who do switch out give up an inflation-proofed income for life , instead bearing the risk of falling returns outside the scheme , and facing substantial fees to transfer . ",
        "from april to september more than 7,000 savers requested a transfer out of the defined benefit scheme . the fca 's own studies indicate that less than half of the advice given by financial advisers on transferring from defined benefit pension schemes is suitable . three million savers with ` final salary ' pensions have a 50:50 chance of losing up to a fifth of their incomeby contrast in the wider pensions advice market around 90pc of advice is deemed to be suitable . savers should be given easier access to information on which financial advisers are legitimate and which have been suspended by the fca , the letter said , while the mps also as if the regulator has `` considered the possibility of suspending all defined benefit transfer advice while reparative action is taken '' . ",
        "an fca spokesman said : `` the fca has received the letter and will , of course , respond to it . ''   "
