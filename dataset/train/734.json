        "by kevin mcguirethe debate over whether or not the philadelphia eagles should spend much time playing their starters in the regular season finale against the dallas cowboys will continue until kickoff , but a couple of players have already been ruled out of action for sunday 's matchup at lincoln financial field . defensive end brandon graham will be given the week off and linebacker joe walker has been placed on injured reserve on the last friday before the regular season finale . graham did not practice at all this week while he focuses his time off the practice field nursing an ankle injury . ",
        "given the situation this weekend , it was never expected graham would be pushed to get back on the field quickly , but the ankle injury will be worth watching over the next two weeks as the eagles prepare for their first postseason game at home . with graham out of action , the eagles will be able to bump chris long into a starting role at the defensive end position . the entire defensive line 's starting lineup could get an early rest as well if things start off well for the eagles on sunday . the eagles are a bit thin at linebacker with the loss of walker . ",
        "walker was placed on injured reserve after not practicing this week due to a neck injury . that does open up a position on the roster to fill , and the suspicion is the eagles may use this to activate second-round draft pick sidney jones . the cornerback has not played a game this season , but has been working his way back to full health . expect the eagles to give sidney jones a chance to get on the field on sunday , but what kind of impact he may have in his first professional game is anyone 's guess . ",
        "jones likely wo n't be a key player in the playoff run , but seeing what he can do in a low-stakes game may not be a horrible idea , either . cornerback jalen mills is officially listed as questionable for the cowboys game despite being available for full practices all week long . mills has been working on an ankle injury . because he has been available for full practices all week , it would seem he would be good enough to potentially play if needed . because the eagles already have the no . 1 seed in the playoffs wrapped up though , giving mills a light week would seem to make sense as the focus on keeping key players as healthy as possible is the first order of business this weekend .
