",
        "justice ruth bader ginsburg suggested a cap on georgia 's water use `` would prevent the situation in florida from getting worse . `` a special master appointed by the justices recommended that they side with georgia . ___ 12:55 a. m.the states of florida and georgia are set to air their long-running dispute over the flow of water in arguments before the supreme court . florida blames farmers and booming metro atlanta for low river flows that harm the environment and fisheries dependent on fresh water entering the area . florida argues that georgia takes more than its fair share of water from the chattahoochee and flint rivers and , because of that , too little is left by the time the rivers come together and pass into florida .
