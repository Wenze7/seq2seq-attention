        "chosen , a three-part chinese thriller , will be broadcast on netflix later this month , marking a milestone for mainland internet productions . wang kaihao reports . in recent years , many chinese have got used to watching productions by netflix , an american entertainment streaming media provider , on chinese online video websites . as a result , netflix works , like the tv series house of cards and black mirror have gained a huge fan following in china . but now change is in the air . last week , it was announced that chosen , a three-part chinese thriller , will be broadcast on netflix later this month , and is to become the first internet-tailored film from china to be released on the leading american broadcast platform . ",
        "the film is a production of iqiyi . com , an arm of chinese internet giant baidu and one of the country 's major streaming media platforms . it was first released on iqiyi on jan 7 , but the premiere date for netflix has not yet been decided . chosen was adapted from a tv series from the us of the same title , which was first screened in 2013 . the original series centered around a lethal game in which the protagonist receives a box , which contains a gun and a picture of a stranger , along with instructions to kill the person . ",
        "in the chinese adaption , the story is set around a chinese couple in sydney , australia . the cast includes actress deng jiajia , taiwan actor-singer lan cheng-lung and han pengyi , an actor best known for his stage performances . according to dou lili , the general manager of online films at iqiyi , some changes were made to make the production more attractive for chinese audiences . for instance , the lead role played by lan was changed from a lawyer in the original series to a physician , a profession more familiar to the chinese . ",
        "`` we also focused on family values and an exploration of human nature , '' he says . nevertheless , he says that efforts were made to make the film feel more `` international '' . to that end , an australian actor sam hayden-smith was invited to join the main cast . for now , it looks that the attempt to remake an american tv series with chinese elements and sell it to the american market is working . `` if we export our own films , overseas distribution is more difficult , '' says dou . `` but , an adaption of something familiar to american audience seems to make things easier . '' ",
        "distribution channels also matter . for chosen , sony pictures participated in the distribution of the chinese internet production for the first time . commenting on the new trend , huang dai , the vice-president of sony pictures in china who is in charge of film distribution , says : `` diversification is an irreversible trend for chinese films . `` but , as a traditional film distributor , we also need insights into what is favored by filmgoers , and more new methods of distribution . '' in april , iqiyi reached an agreement with netflix , and chosen has become the first result of this partnership . ",
        "and for chinese films tailored for the internet , the foray by chosen marks a milestone . in 2016 , as many as 2,500 films were distributed exclusively through online platforms , with 1,780 streamed by iqiyi . however , only about 1,900 , including 1,321 through iqiyi , went online in 2017 . dou disagrees with the view that 2017 marked a low point for chinese online films , but says the decline was the signal of an important change . `` online films now need to be high quality , '' he says . `` in 2015 , poor quality films with eye-catching gimmicks could easily make money through the internet , but that unhealthy situation has changed . ",
        "`` now , you can only achieve high ratings if you polish your productions , '' he says . `` this year , the internet film industry will become similar to the cinema . '' after chosen 's debut , more chinese series will also venture to the united states . for instance , tientsin mystic and burning ice , two popular iqiyi productions from 2017 are scheduled to be aired on netflix in the first quarter of 2018 . and , day and night by youku , another major streaming media platform in china , will soon hit netflix . ",
        "looking to the future , yang xianghua , the vice-president of iqiyi , says : `` better business models and distribution channels will help good chinese online productions succeed abroad , gain partners and widen the horizons of the industry .
