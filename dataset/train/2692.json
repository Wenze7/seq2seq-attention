        "st. louis -- -- a city of guns , gangs and deadly grudges awaits whoever gets picked to be the new police chief . with the city expected to hit 200 murders this year , the homicide rate was up 11 percent for the year through november -- and with some 2,500 gun crimes , gun assaults are up 24 percent for the year . whoever gets the badge to be the next police chief faces a city of rising violent crime and many citizens who distrust the police . criminologist professor beth huebner of the university of missouri st. louis has studied violent crime here for fifteen years . ",
        "`` whoever gets the job , i think it 's just important to get out and speak with the community , to speak with citizens and work on that trust , so people can understand that if the police come , they 're going to help , '' huebner said . an optimist , huebner says the slide toward violent crime in the past few years can be reversed , but she has some advice for the new chief . `` i think we need to focus on not just responding to homicides and gun crimes , '' huebner said , `` but also looking at prevention . ",
        "who are people linked to ? how can we link people and guns together to break up some of these long term beefs or masculine issues that we see on the streets of st. louis ? '' huebner says the new chief would do well to track the victims of non-fatal shootings , because often the survivor launches a quest for revenge that sparks more shootings and killings . also , she says there needs to be a strong commitment to processing ballistics evidence -- to tie together different shootings done with the same gun over time . and she says if the new chief is an out-of-towner , he needs to understand the neighborhood nature of local crime -- that st. louis gangs are not franchises of out-of-town gangs . ",
        "`` we do n't see la gangs . we do n't see new york gangs , or things like that , '' huebner said . `` we see loosely-connected , young -- primarily men , but also women as well -- who are tied to their neighborhood . and that 's where we see a lot of this retaliatory violence . '' on a positive note , huebner says gun violence is actually down from fifteen years ago , and many other categories of non-violent crime are down . she takes disputes anyone who thinks it will never get better . ",
        "`` i completely disagree . i love st. louis and i see a bright future for us . i think the police department ca n't solve this problem by themselves . we need business members , we need community members as well . but i think that we can reduce crime , because we have done it in the past . '' six finalists were scheduled for job interviews last friday with the mayor and director of public safety . of the six , three are from within the department , four are black , two are white , and one is a woman . ",
