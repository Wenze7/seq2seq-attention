        "a quarter of all knighthoods and damehoods in the new year honours list have gone to politicians , including the tory kingmaker graham brady who has theresa may 's political future in his hands as chair of the 1922 committee of backbenchers . the annual list makes knights of brady and nick clegg , the former lib dem leader , despite the prime minister 's promise to stamp out the cronyism of the david cameron era by focusing awards on those who contribute to their community . other politicians to get the highest honour include christopher chope , a rightwing conservative who was a junior minister under margaret thatcher and john major , and geoffrey clifton-brown , who served as a junior whip under william hague . ",
        "neither have held any role in the last two governments or even served as committee chairs . labour 's lindsay hoyle , the deputy speaker of the commons , is also knighted along with mark hendrick , who has served as labour mp for preston for 17 years and was previously the first mep from a minority ethnic background . the only female mp to get a top honour is cheryl gillan , who became the first female welsh secretary under cameron . she is made a dame . the list is notable for not awarding top honours to tory supporters and advisers , which became a feature during the tenure of cameron when knighthoods went to his election strategist lynton crosby as well as party and remain campaign donors . ",
        "however , it continues the tradition of giving out an array of knighthoods to politicians , some of which appear to be on the grounds of their longevity in parliament . six of the 25 knighthoods this year go to politicians , despite political service being one of eight categories from which to choose . last year three politicians were rewarded with knighthoods , plus one political donor . brady is the most powerful politician on the list , as his role as chair of the 1922 committee makes him the keeper of any letters of no confidence in the prime minister from conservative mps . ",
        "once they pass a threshold of 15 % of the party 's mps , it is his job to tell the prime minister that a no confidence vote should be held . for the moment , may and her brexit strategy command the support of the eurosceptic brady and the rest of his committee . another figure close to may who has got a reward in the honours list is mark sedwill , who was her trusted permanent secretary at the home office and became her national security adviser this year . clegg 's knighthood , which was widely reported in advance , is set to be particularly controversial among leave supporters , given his continued campaigning in favour of eu membership and his new book how to stop brexit . ",
        "jo swinson , the deputy leader of the lib dems , will receive a cbe , adding to the list of more than 15 of her party 's mps who have received honours or peerages since the coalition . the government insists the appointments are made by independent committees mostly composed of civil servants and independent members , but no 10 representatives are allowed to attend and the final lists are approved by the prime minister and the queen . this is the first list to be drawn up under new guidance set by may with a renewed focus on making sure it `` commands public confidence '' and `` rewards genuine public service '' . ",
        "however , the proportion of awards going to people who have undertaken outstanding work in their communities either in a voluntary or paid capacity has fallen from 74 % last year to 70 % this year . the proportion of awards going to women has dropped slightly , from 50 % to 49 % , and to people with disabilities , from 8 % to 5 % . the proportion of awards going to black , asian and minority ethnic recipients has remained unchanged at 9 % .
