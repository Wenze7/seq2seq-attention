        "back in mid-december 2017 , we covered a story from italy sending genoa right-back aleandro rosi to either leeds united or sheffield , but nothing came of it . the 30-year-old , whose contract runs out in june of this year , however , still has multiple suitors , and you could even consider them an upgrade . according to corriere dello sport , both bournemouth and brighton have expressed a ` concrete interest ' in signing the defender , although when for has n't been specified . embed from getty imagesconsidering we 're currently in the middle of the january transfer window , you would think a move could be done now , with genoa unable to ask huge amounts of money with just six months left on his contract , but the option of a free transfer could be too good to pass up for both the seagulls and the cherries . ",
        "neither side are in desperate need of new blood in the role , yet a younger options than bruno , liam rosenior or even simon francis could be of use to chris hughton and eddie howe . this is the first we 've seen of this interest , so we 'll wait and see if it becomes a thing before jumping to any conclusions . the post bournemouth and brighton share ` concrete interest ' in defender , potential free transfer appeared first on sport witness .
