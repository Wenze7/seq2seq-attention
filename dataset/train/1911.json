        "important resistance levels : 0.00001187 , 1/1 gann fanimportant support levels : 0.00000968 , 0.00000903 mana/btc is currently in the process of a bullish price pump . after arriving at the support level of 0.00000648 and breaking the ema , we saw an immediate reversal that resulted in an all-time high price of 0.00001202 . this price pump eradicated every resistance level that was once set in place to prevent the price from increasing in this manner . the bollinger bands tell us that this push may not be in its final stages just yet , seeing as they are currently still expanding and stretching , indicating that the bullish push is still relevant . ",
        "as we see the bollinger bands start to contract once again , we will be able to correctly determine when the price will enter a period of consolidation once again . if consolidation occurs , it will most likely be short-lived and use the 1/1 gann fan and 0.00001197 price level as support before reaching new heights . currently , the price is using these levels as resistance . if the price is not able to break through these points , the price is expected to heavily retrace and return to the volume that this coin is used to seeing .
