        "after such a promising start to the season for miami , the ending was relatively lackluster , for multiple reasons . first , and most obvious , is the fact that the ` canes dropped the orange bowl to wisconsin by a score of 34-24 . the second reason is that this morning it was announced that defensive end dj johnson would be transferring from the school : . according to reports , the decision to leave the school does n't have anything to do with johnson being unhappy with the coaching staff or anything like that . rather , he wishes to play football closer to his family in sacramento , ca . ",
        "as a 2017 recruit johnson received the most offers of any player in the class . he 's one of the fastest defensive linemen in the country so it will be interesting to see where he takes his talents . he did n't do much as a freshman at miami , registering just three tackles in eight games . miami is stacked on the dl , but losing johnson wo n't be good .
