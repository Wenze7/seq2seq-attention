        "a big part of that check is being drawn from middle-class accountssteven pressman , the conversation2017-12-20t17 : 00:50 z • 2017-12-20t17:00:50z • 0 commentsthe u. s. middle class has always had a special mystique . it is the heart of the american dream . a decent income and home , doing better than one 's parents , and retiring in comfort are all hallmarks of a middle-class lifestyle . contrary to what some may think , however , the u. s. has not always had a large middle class . only after world war ii was being middle class the national norm . ",
        "then , starting in the 1980s , it began to decline . president donald trump has portrayed the tax plan congress is wrapping up as a boon for the middle class . the sad reality , however , is that it is more likely to be its final death knell . to understand why , you need look no further than the history of the rise and decline of the american middle class , a group that i 've been studying through the lens of inequality for decades . the middle class , which pew defines as two-thirds to two times the national median income for a given household size , began to grow after world war ii due to a surge in economic growth and because president franklin delano roosevelt 's new deal gave workers more power . ",
        "before that , most americans were poor or nearly so . for example , legislation such as the wagner act established rights for workers , most critically for collective bargaining . the government also began new programs , such as social security and unemployment insurance , that helped older americans avoid dying in poverty and supported families with children through tough times . the home owners ' loan corporation , set up in 1933 , helped middle-class homeowners pay their mortgages and remain in their homes . together , these new policies helped fuel a strong postwar economic boom and ensured the gains were shared by a broad cross-section of society . ",
        "this greatly expanding the u. s. middle class , which reached a peak of nearly 60 percent of the population in the late ` 70s . americans ' increased optimism about their economic future prompted businesses to invest more , creating a virtuous cycle of growth . despite high taxes on the rich and on corporations , median family income more than doubled in the three decades after world war ii , rising from $ 27,255 in 1945 to nearly $ 60,000 in the late 1970s . that 's when things started to change . rather than supporting workers -- and balancing the interests of large corporations and the interests of average americans -- the federal government began taking the side of business over workers by lowering taxes on corporations and the rich , reducing regulations and allowing firms to grow through mergers and acquisitions . ",
        "since the late 1980s , median household incomes have increased very little -- from $ 54,000 to $ 59,039 in 2016 -- while inequality has risen sharply . as a result , the size of the middle class has shrunk significantly to 50 percent from nearly 60 percent . in addition , reagan cut taxes multiple times during his time in office , which led to less spending to support and sustain the poor and middle class , while deregulation allowed businesses to cut their wage costs at the expense of workers . this change is one reason workers have received only a small fraction of their greater productivity in the form of higher wages since the 1980s . ",
        "in contrast , household median income in 2016 was only slightly above its level just before the great repression began in 2008 . but according to new unpublished research i conducted with monmouth university economist robert scott , the actual living standard for the median household fell as much as 7 percent due to greater interest payments on past debt and the fact that households are larger , so the same income does not go as far . as a result , the middle class is actually closer to 45 percent of u. s. households . this is in stark contrast to other developed countries such as france and norway , where the middle class approaches nearly 70 percent of households and has held steady over several decades . ",
        "so how will the tax plan change the picture ? france , norway and other european countries have maintained policies , such as progressive taxes and generous government spending programs , that help the middle class . the republican tax package doubles down on the policies that have caused its decline in the u. s.specifically , the plan will significantly reduce taxes on the wealthy and large companies , which will have to be paid for with large spending cuts in everything from children 's health and education to unemployment insurance and social security . tax cuts will require the government to borrow more money , which will push up interest rates and require middle-income households to pay more in interest on their credit cards or to buy a car or home . ",
        "the benefits of the republican tax bill go primarily to the very wealthy , who will get 83 percent of the gains by 2027 , according to the tax policy center , a nonpartisan think tank . meanwhile , more than half of poor and middle-income households will see their taxes rise over the next 10 years ; the rest will receive only a small fraction of the total tax benefits . while republicans justify their tax plan by claiming corporations will invest more and hire more workers , thereby raising wages , companies have already indicated that they will mainly use their savings to buy back stock and pay more dividends , benefiting the wealthy owners of corporate stock . ",
        "so with most of the gains of the $ 1.5 trillion in net tax cuts going to the rich , the end result , in my view , is that most americans will face falling living standards as government spending goes down , borrowing costs go up , and their tax bill rises . this will lead to less economic growth and a declining middle class . and unlike the virtuous circle the u. s. experienced in the ` 50s and '60s , americans can expect a vicious cycle of decline instead .
