        "st. paul , minn. . -- inside jehovah evangelical lutheran church in st. paul hangs a simple plaque . it 's in remembrance of the 1981 day care christmas program , where children 's joy would so horribly turn tragic . `` it changed the city , '' said kathy white , the aunt of cassie hansen . her niece was only 6 years old when she was abducted from the stairwell leading to a church restroom . hansen was with her family attending a christmas program for her younger sister . she got up to go use the restroom and was never seen alive again . ",
        "police found the child 's body the next day in a dumpster . bringing the child 's killer to justice nearly cost dorothy noga her life . `` he said he was coming to cut my throat , '' said noga , who now lives in florida . cab driver stuart knowlton confessed his crime to noga on nov. . 11 , 1981 . she then went to police and became a key informant in the case and , at times , attempted recording their conversations . days later , knowlton became enraged and came to noga 's workplace and viciously attacked her with a knife . ",
        "`` i told her to open the door , and while i was doing that to open the door , he shoved the knife straight into my neck , '' noga said . she was bleeding profusely and managed to stumble away . fortunately , help was just seconds away when police officers arrived . `` the paramedics told us that there 's absolutely no way in the world that this woman ever should have lived , '' retired st. paul police officer jim groh said . she did , and the crime was later solved with her help . ",
        "knowlton was convicted and sentenced to life in prison . now , 36 years later , noga and three of the retired officers who came together on the case got their long overdue recognition . at the department 's western district with hansen 's family in attendance , the three officers and dorothy noga stood for the honor . `` this photo was always on my bulletin board , along with my kids , so you never forget , '' retired police sergeant rick klein said . it was the quick actions of former officer pat scott that saved dorothy from bleeding to death after the attack . ",
        "she survived that attack and her testimony at knowlton 's trial was crucial to his conviction . scott says she 's the true hero . `` without her , who knows how many little girls that monster would have gone on to kill ? '' he said . knowlton died in prison in 2006 . as for cassie 's family , wednesday 's reunion was bittersweet , yet a much deserved tribute to those who went above and beyond to bring her killer to justice .
