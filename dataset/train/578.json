        "a host of musicians including r. e.m. , killer mike and alison mosshart have called on u. s. government officials to protect net neutrality rules . members of america 's federal communications commission will vote on whether to repeal the consumer protection rules , which prevent internet companies from intentionally blocking , slowing down access to or charging money for specific websites , later this week . the musicians signed an open letter to fcc chairman ajit pai , urging him to keep the current rules in place as they claim changing the law could harm their ability to make a living . ",
        "`` as musicians , composers , producers , and independent labels representing diverse backgrounds , traditions , genres , and communities , we urge the federal communications commission to protect the open internet as a vehicle for free expression and collaboration , '' their statement reads . `` we 've built careers and big parts of our lives around our passion for music - creating it and connecting with listeners . today , the internet is one of the primary places this work happens . we rely on it for everything from booking tours to selling merchandise , to collaborating with musicians on the other side of the globe . '' ",
        "the musicians also state that ditching net neutrality rules would stifle freedom of expression , and could constrain artists and label executives ' ability to bring their music to listeners , as internet service providers would give those with financial backing preferential access to their customers . in addition to alison , mike and band r. e.m. , who signed as a group despite their 2011 split , others who added their names to the statement include punk rockers fugazi , wilco 's jeff and spencer tweedy , and neko case . the move to ditch the net neutrality rules has been backed by lawmakers from u. s. president donald trump 's republican party , but has provoked angry protests from democrats and members of the american public .
