        "after the blue jays have traded three minor league assets this offseason , including edward olivares , expect the focus to shift to free agency . i could be completely wrong about this , but i feel like the blue jays could be done with making any kind of significant trade again this offseason . so far they 've pulled off two moves , first shipping outfielder j. b. woodman to the st. louis cardinals for shortstop aledmys diaz , and then saturday then acquired yangervis solarte from the padres for edward olivares and jared carkuff . with the two acquisitions , the blue jays should feel a lot better about their middle infield depth for 2018 , and should have plenty of back-up for the oft-injured troy tulowitzki and devon travis . ",
        "the second move to bring in solarte was significant in improving the infield depth , but it was bit of a minor surprise as the blue jays are pretty high on olivares as a prospect . at 21 , he was ranked # 18 in the organization , and has the tools to potentially put together a bright future . that said , the front office is as aware as anyone that you have to give in order to receive , it just signalled a willingness to dip into the prospect pool , something i was n't sure they would do much of .

        "more from jays journal blue jays : are the new infielders better than barney and goins ? 12h ago blue jays : can marcus stroman use his social media to help the blue jays ? 13h ago blue jays : yangervis solarte could become a roadblock for travis14h ago blue jays : do n't mess with devon travis ' position15h ago blue jays new additions have no bearing on josh donaldson 's future16h ago one that that 's been pretty consistent since mark shapiro and ross atkins took over , is that they have n't been very positive about the way alex anthopoulos left their minor league cupboards . ",
        "in case you missed it , anthopoulos famously sent out a plethora of highly ranked arms including jeff hoffman , daniel norris , matt boyd , miguel castro and more in order to bring in troy tulowitzki and david price in 2015 . the new brain trust has had to rebuild things a little bit , and have frequently mentioned that they need to strengthen the minor league system from where it was when they took over . with that in mind , i do n't think we should expect a lot more in the way of trades this offseason . ",
        "despite the rumours , it seems impossible to convince the blue jays to move vladimir guerrero jr. . or bo bichette , and they do n't have a massive amount of high leverage , minor league assets , especially in the higher levels . for the remaining few holes on the roster , which could include a starting pitcher , maybe some bullpen help , an outfielder , and a back-up catcher , the blue jays should have sufficient funds to find some improvements , especially with how many reputable names are still waiting for a new contract . sure , they may like the acquisition costs more on the trade market , but i do n't see the front office being willing to dip into that resource a whole lot more . ",
        "using olivares to get solarte was smart for a variety of reasons , especially considering troy tulowitzki has three years left remaining on his contract , and the depth could be needed beyond this season as well . solarte has three years of control remaining as well , and at 30 years old and with a competent offensive skillset , he should be an asset for the blue jays at a reasonable cost , regardless of what role he ultimately settles into . next : do n't mess with devon travis ' positionbeyond that type of priority need being filled , i ca n't see the front office using the minor league pool a whole lot , at least in order to bring in impact players . ",
        "i could be wrong , but the rhetoric around the blue jays with this front office has always been about rebuilding the system , not depleting it to chase playoff glory . for that reason , i would expect the focus to shift to the available free agents , and there are plenty to choose from . after the blue jays have traded three minor league assets this offseason , including edward olivares , expect the focus to shift to free agency . i could be completely wrong about this , but i feel like the blue jays could be done with making any kind of significant trade again this offseason .
