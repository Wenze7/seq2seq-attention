        "after a decade of writing the character , writer dan slott is preparing to step down as the man in charge of marvel 's the amazing spider-man comic book series -- but he 's going to go out with a bang . marvel announced tuesday that march 's amazing spider-man no . 797 , by slott and artist stuart immonen , will launch the storyline `` go down swinging , '' which the publisher called not only `` the final battle '' between spider-man and the green goblin , but also `` the biggest spider-man story ever . '' in a statement from the publisher , editor nick lowe said , `` the last time we saw the green goblin was in ` goblin nation ' at the culmination of superior spider-man . ",
        "you 'd almost think that was the biggest green goblin story dan slott had in him . you 'd be wrong . '' lowe 's comment is somewhat misleading ; while the green goblin persona has n't been seen since 2014 , the man behind the mask -- norman osborn -- appeared as recently as this june , in a storyline that saw him use the green goblin 's weapons and iconography for his `` goblin army '' in an attempt to grab political power in eastern europe . that storyline ended with the villain pledging to reclaim his costumed identity , declaring , `` there is only one true osborn identity that matters . ",
        "the green goblin must live again ! '' to promote `` go down swinging , '' marvel released a trailer for the storyline , which teases the debut of a new goblin character : amazing spider-man no . 797 will be available digitally and in comic book stores march 7 , 2018 .   "
