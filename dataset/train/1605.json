        "troy -- in his first major speech since taking office , rensselaer county executive steve mclaughlin called for infrastructure investment and cooperation countywide to attract business and expand the tax base . speaking wednesday morning before the rensselaer county regional chamber of commerce , mclaughlin delivered a review of the county 's successful business projects during 2017 , and pointed to what he envisions as important development projects for his 10-day-old administration . ranging from downtown troy to rensselaer 's waterfront and commercial corridors in suburban towns , mclaughlin promised to work with local officials and businesses . he cited opportunities on columbia turnpike in east greenbush , the route 4 corridor in north greenbush , at the fort orange site in castleton-on-hudson , route 7 in brunswick , routes 9 and 20 in schodack , the rensselaer port and along troy 's riverfront . ",
        "he said development and modernization of the county 's infrastructure -- water , sewers and high-tech -- were priorities . `` too many areas of our county are underdeveloped , '' mclaughlin said . noting that the county invested $ 3 million in road improvements last year , he expressed hope it will be able to take advantage of proposed federal infrastructure investment . mclaughlin returned several times to his support for supplying water from the city of troy 's tomhannock reservoir to the eastern county towns of pittsfield , hoosick and petersburgh to spur development and provide drinking water to residents who were adversely impacted by pfoa contamination . ",
        "kate manley , president of the regional chamber , said she looked forward to cooperating with county economic development initiatives . `` it 's a lot of exciting opportunities , '' she said . richard hendrick , general manager of the port of albany , said he was encouraged by mclaughlin 's desire to spur development in the city of rensselaer portion of the hudson river port . hendricks said the port commission has worked closely with rensselaer mayor daniel dwyer on several projects .
