        "in the 10th anniversary year since a bone marrow stem cell transplant cured timothy ray brown of his hiv infection , despite disappointment over decreasing public desire to find a cure for hiv , timothy ray brown remains optimistic that the scientific and medical communities can and will achieve this if properly funded . he describes his most recent activities and the basis for his pessimism and optimism in the article `` timothy ray brown 's continuing activism toward curing hiv , '' published in the latest hiv cure research issue of aids research and human retroviruses . throughout his `` 10 cure birthday '' year 's busy schedule of activities , timothy ray brown `` learned a few things last year that i found disappointing ... i participated in two hiv cure seminars ... the responses from many surprised me . ",
        "perhaps i misinterpreted this but i would say most of them indicated that they were afraid of hiv being cured . this is mostly due to the fear of how it would worsen their lives , that they would stand to lose all or most of the benefits they have today . '' `` the development of drugs to treat hiv infection has saved countless lives but led to complacency about this horrible virus , '' says thomas hope , phd , editor-in-chief of aids research and human retroviruses and professor of cell and molecular biology at northwestern university , feinberg school of medicine . ",
        "`` in this update of his travels as an advocate of hiv cure research , timothy ray brown reminds us that we still need to advocate for funding and educate the public about the important impact that a functional cure for hiv would have on society while understanding the complex ways that a cure would impact people living with aids . his insights as the first person cured of hiv are fascinating .
