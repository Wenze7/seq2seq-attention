        "after taking the celtics to seven games in the eastern conference semifinals -- a series wizards fans think they should have won -- washington entered the season with high expectations . at the midway point of 2017-18 , however , they are only projected to finish with 44 wins according to 538 's nba predictions . john wall and bradley beal are an elite backcourt . wall averaged over 23 points and 10 assists per game last year , joining the likes of russell westbrook and james harden . beal averaged over 23 points per game while having an effective field goal percentage over 56 percent , joining only steph curry , kevin durant , lebron james and karl-anthony towns to do so in 2016-17 . ",
        "as a third option , otto porter jr. . earned a max contract by being a versatile and efficient wing . he led the nba in turnover percentage , was second in offensive rating and fifth in effective field goal percentage last season . markieff morris and marcin gortat are talented big men . kelly oubre , tomas satoransky and mike scott have all performed well off the bench . so outside of a few injuries , why has n't this team performed better ? to help answer that question , candace buckner joins the latest episode of fastbreak breakfast . ",
        "candace is the wizards beat reporter for the washington post , whose hectic lifestyle unfortunately has her regularly skipping breakfast . she also addresses : what is the severity of the chronic injury that has plagued porter his entire career ? with so many options for the wings and forwards , what is washington 's top five man combination ? is it matchup dependent or is there a clear best lineup they should be featuring ? are there any big trades or small trades on the way ? fans still clamor for a wall and demarcus cousins reunion , but what price do they want to pay to make that happen ? ",
        "and after unloading draft picks in the last two seasons to bring in morris and bojan bogdanovic , does the team have the appetite to trade their draft pick yet again ? all fastbreak breakfast episodes are also available for download on itunes and soundcloud . original music provided by codaphonicshould your new year 's resolution be to financially support content creators you enjoy ? you can support fastbreak breakfast and gain access to exclusive content and bonus features at patreon . com/fastbreakbreakfast . get the draft app and win money playing daily fantasy basketball against your friends . get started at draft .
