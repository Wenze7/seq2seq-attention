        "startupstockphotos / pixabaysome social platforms bloom early and gain traction quickly . others gain their momentum in a more controlled way . platforms are a lot like people . some peak young and stay the course their entire lives while others stay under the radar and then capture attention later in life . linkedin , often the fair-haired social stepchild , has now surpassed half a billion members . i remember reading that jeff weiner , linkedin 's ceo , said that scaling is not the millions but rather billions . today , linkedin is well on its way to reaching that so-called scale and it 's more important than ever to pay attention to where linkedin is going . ",
        "in 2011 when i launched intero advisory with little more than a 90-minute lunch 'n learn presentation , i had already been an active member for more than four years . i vividly recall the day , late in january , that i thought linkedin was finally hitting its tipping point . i also realized there would be a steep learning curve for many people , especially since there would be continual and often rapid change ahead for linkedin . when i read brian peters ' article , what marketers need to know about linkedin in entrepreneur , i appreciated seeing all of the stats and numbers . ",
        "peters says : `` what 's most astonishing is how fast linkedin has grown over the last six years . between 2011 and 2017 , linkedin 's user base grew from 140 million to 500 million -- shattering the growth rate in previous periods . '' while i did n't have a crystal ball back in 2011 , i could sense the potential and the enormous opportunity for those who figured it out and stuck with it . after all , you can learn how to play the piano , box , fish , paint , follow a fitness regimen , but if you do n't practice , you quickly forget the nuance , the technique and the strategy that it takes to excel . ",
        "social platforms and building a brand is no different . over the last six or seven years , linkedin has been building a platform that enables professionals to far eclipse looking for a job . it 's become a place for ceos , thought leaders , influencers , young professionals and regular folks to cultivate their expertise and their professional story . it 's become a platform filled with insight that informs people , businesses , and decisions . if you have tip-toed or played from the sidelines , you may need to consider the missed opportunities . it 's hard to calculate the misses since you may not realize the opportunity . ",
        "here are a couple of missed opportunities to consideryou 've just submitted a proposal to a new prospect . your buyer or someone on the buying committee go to google or linkedin and search you , your people and your company . the only thing that comes up is your website . all you have are executive bios on your website and , in fact , your site is a bit dated . what impression will your prospect have of you and your company ? you 've submitted a renewal agreement or a proposal to a current client . there is a new buyer or leadership team , and even though you 've been working with them for some time , they do n't know you . ",
        "they search and do n't see any meaningful information beyond your website . maybe not the best first impression . you need to hire and are looking to bring on a senior person or two and add younger staff . you post a job opening and wait for the job applications to appear , and they do n't . you end up working with a recruiter , and even they have a hard time convincing people they should talk to you . why ? you 've not given anyone a reason to be impressed or interested in your company . ",
        "people ca n't get a sense of your culture ; they do n't see a progressive , forward-thinking company in any of their research . your top salesperson , long-term customer service manager and cfo have all been recruited away to a competitor who has disrupted your industry with technology , marketing and brand awareness that goes beyond features and benefits . you never thought they would leave for a shinier company . they did . i could go on , but i think you get the idea .
