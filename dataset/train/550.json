        "credit : mark van kleunen . more and more plant species are introduced to new areas through humans . often , however , it is not clear which factors decide whether plants can permanently settle in their new environment . an international research team including mark van kleunen , ecology professor at the university of konstanz , shows for the first time how ties to different habitats control the human-induced spread of european plant species on other continents . the research results have been published in the current issue of the renowned scientific journal `` proceedings of the national academy of sciences . '' ",
        "several studies have clearly shown that the spread of animal and plant species through global trade has increased massively over the past few decades . worldwide , over 13,000 plant species have been carried by humans to other regions , with more than 2,500 species being from europe . by comparison : only around 12,000 plant species are native to all of europe , to germany a bit more than 3,000 species . `` our international team was the first to comprehensively investigate the role that the plants ' ties to their native region play in their naturalization in other areas of the world . ",
        "our hypothesis was that this factor is decisive for the naturalization of plant species '' , explains mark van kleunen . the international research team documented the occurrences in different habitats for approximately 10,000 plant species originating from europe - from which more than 2,500 have naturalized on other continents . subsequently the researchers studied whether plant species from certain habitats have spread particularly strongly on other continents . the result of the study was clear : species from european habitats that have been highly changed by humans , such as fields and fallow land , were extremely successful in the conquest of other continents . ",
        "so far , more than 40 percent of the plant species growing in these habitats in europe have been established on other continents . `` through colonization the europeans have ` exported ' many plants to other parts of the world '' . this often happened unintentionally - for example through earth from ships or contaminated seed , '' explains mark van kleunen . he adds : `` plants native to european habitats changed by humans had a head start : they have been spread more often , and the living conditions in their new homes were ideal . the study shows that biological globalization particularly favours certain plant species - namely those that have managed to naturalize in human-made habitats .
