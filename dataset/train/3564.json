        "`` impressive but expensive . '' that was how i summed up oomi 's crowdfunded smart home kit back in august , when i tested and reviewed the system out of the cnet smart apartment . with easy nfc pairing , stable , reliable performance and strong versatility -- everything from automation and color-changing bulbs to diy security and alexa voice controls -- oomi had an awful lot to offer budding smart home enthusiasts . but at $ 700 , it was also awfully tough to afford . oomi soon lowered the price of that starter kit to $ 500 , which was a big step in the right direction . ",
        "now , at ces 2018 , oomi 's team is taking another big step and changing up that starter kit 's offerings in order to make it even more affordable . specifically , oomi is cutting the once-mandatory oomi touch control tablet from the kit and offering it as an optional add-on instead . oomi says that will bring the cost of a starter kit down below $ 300 . the change means that the camera and sensor-equipped oomi cube will now take the oomi touch tablet 's place as the starter kit 's centerpiece . without the oomi touch , you wo n't be able to pair oomi 's accessories to your setup using tap-and-go nfc connections -- instead , you 'll link things up using oomi 's app . ",
        "in addition , oomi is introducing new , touch-capacitive light switches . the new accessories , simply called `` touchswitches , '' can be added as an upgrade to oomi 's existing in-wall switch controllers , and they 're designed to automatically detect the switch 's function , whether it 's dimming the lights , adjusting the curtains or controlling a ceiling fan . in addition to touch controls for all of those sorts of basic functions , you 'll also be able to use touch gestures to trigger your oomi scenes . no word on price yet , but they 're expected to arrive in the coming months . ",
        "oomi 's last ces announcement of the year is a new partnership with safetrek , a smart security startup that lets users contact emergency services with a single panic button press on their smartphone . that functionality will essentially copy over into the oomi app for any users that choose to purchase a paid safetrek account . by this summer , users will also be able to link their oomi setup to a paid monitoring service capable of dispatching emergency services automatically whenever the armed system detects a problem . colin marshall , president of oomi parent company fantem acknowledges that this will require a slightly higher safetrek fee , but adds that it will be `` still less than 90 percent of the monitored security options available today . ",
        "`` outlookboth the new touchswitches and the partnership with safetrek lean into oomi 's existing strength , and that 's the system 's versatility . meanwhile , the updated business model addresses oomi 's key weakness by making the system more affordable to get started with . both seem like smart moves as oomi heads into 2018 . when i last updated the oomi review to account for its first price drop , i gave the starter kit a 7.7 out of 10 , which reflects its stability , its ease of use , and the sheer volume of different ways you can put it to use . ",
        "the new kit loses that nfc selling point , but that seems like a fair trade given that it should cost at least $ 200 less than before . another review update might be needed in the coming months as a result . what to expect from the smart home at ces 2018 : we take a look at the smart home and appliance trends we expect to see this year . ces 2018 : cnet 's complete coverage of tech 's biggest show . ces 2018reading â€¢ oomi smart home debuts touch switches , lower upfront cost .
