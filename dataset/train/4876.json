        "contestants on `` the bachelor '' and `` bachelorette '' are rarely shown eating . there are always spreads of food , but they largely remain untouched . even when the couples go on dates to restaurants , they are n't shown eating . one of the most annoying parts about `` the bachelor '' franchise -- and there are several -- is watching as the contestants mindlessly chatter about their fictional futures together over a plate of untouched food . i mean , case in point : one-on-one dates will often end in some sort of dinner or dessert component , which is laid out romantically with gorgeous candles , flowers , and ample alcohol . ",
        "and yet , the contestants never seem to get to try any of it . many fans have noticed the phenomenon themselves : do they ever eat their food on the bachelor/bachelorette ?   ",
        "like they are always sitting at these fancy places with full plates 🙄 -- shay reims ♡ july 12 , 2016why do the ppl on the bachelor/bachelorette never eat their food while at dinner -- shelby nelson july 20 , 2016i wan na get hired to be a part of the bachelor/ette crew ... but just to eat all the food that goes to waste when they film 🙄 🍊 🍉 🍟 🌭 🍗 🧀 🍔 🌯 🍧 🍭 🍦 -- paige matthis july 26 , 2016but thanks to some in-depth reporting by alyssa hertzig at refinery 29 , we have an answer for why they never seem to eat -- the producers fill them up before the date even starts so they 'll do less chewing and more talking about how much they love each other .",
        "`` the food on dates is usually good , but the catch is that you are n't supposed to eat it ! no one wants to watch people stuffing their face on a date . if you 're eating , you are n't talking , '' jaclyn swartz , who has appeared on ben flajnik 's season of the `` bachelor , '' along with `` bachelor pad '' and `` bachelor in paradise , '' told refinery 29 . `` instead , we eat before the dates , as we are getting ready . the producers will bring room service to your room , or a plate of food to where you 're getting ready in the house . ",
        "`` some of the food prepared to be seen on-camera is still too good to pass up , so ashley spivey , a contestant on brad womack 's season of `` the bachelor , '' explains that sometimes the contestants or bachelor/bachelorette will chow down while their date is giving a one-on-one interview with a producer . `` you have to remember that the dinner portion can last two to three hours , '' says spivey . `` you usually talk and start eating . then , a producer will pull you aside to do a one-on-one interview . then , you go back to eat while the other person is doing their one-on-one interview . ",
        "this is when you stuff your face and hurry and eat before the other person gets back . `` the one thing they get to do a ton of though on-camera ? drink !   "
