        "people protest against tax reform on capitol hill in washington dc , the united states , on dec 1 , 2017 . the us senate on saturday morning narrowly passed the republican bill to overhaul the tax code in decades , moving one step closer to the first major legislative victory of the trump administration and congressional republicans . tax cuts masquerading as tax reform are the best way to describe the thrust of washington 's latest policy gambit . the case is largely political -- namely , the urgency of a republican congress to deliver a legislative victory for a republican president . ",
        "the consequences , however , are ultimately economic -- and , unsurprisingly , likely to be far worse than the politicians are willing to admit . taking the lead from us president donald trump , the political case for tax cuts is that they are essential to `` make america great again '' . over-taxed and cheated by bad trade deals , goes the argument , the united states needs tax relief to revive its competitive prowess . notwithstanding the political pandering to hard-pressed middle-class families , corporate america is clearly the focus of these efforts , with proposed legislation aiming to reduce business tax rates from 35 percent to 20 percent . ",
        "never mind that us companies currently pay a surprisingly low effective corporate tax rate , just 22 percent , when judged against post-world war ii experience . pay no attention to the latest tally of international competitiveness by the world economic forum , which finds the us back in second place . and , of course , do n't draw comfort from the lofty stock market valuations of the broad constellation of us companies . forget all that , republicans insist : cut business taxes , and all that ails the us will be cured . there are times when the politicization of economic arguments becomes dangerous . ",
        "this is one of those times . according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office , the cuts will result in a cumulative deficit of about $ 1.4 trillion over the next decade . the problem arises because the us ' chronic savings shortfall has now moved into the danger zone , making it much more difficult to fund multi-year deficits today than in the past . significantly , the us current account was in slight surplus during the big tax cuts of 1964 and 1981 -- in sharp contrast to today 's deficit of 2.6 percent of gdp . with fiscal deficits likely to push an already low domestic savings rate even lower -- possibly back into negative territory , as was the case from 2008-11 -- there is a great risk of a sharply higher current account deficit . ",
        "and a bigger current account deficit means that the already large trade deficit will only widen further , violating one of the main tenets of `` trumponomics '' , that making america great again requires closing the trade gap . it is at this point where the tale goes from fact to fiction . trump and the congressional republican majority insist that the proposed tax cuts will be self-financing , because they will spur economic growth , causing revenues to surge . this so-called supply-side argument , first advanced in support of the ronald reagan-era tax cuts , has been a lightning rod in us fiscal policy debates ever since . ",
        "reality has turned out quite differently than the supply-siders envisioned . yes , the economy recovered spectacularly from a deep recession in 1981-82 . but that was due largely to an aggressive easing of monetary policy following the federal reserve 's successful assault on double-digit us inflation . by contrast , the fiscal nirvana long promised by supply-siders never materialized . far from vanishing into thin air , federal budget deficits ballooned to 3.8 percent of gdp during the 1980s , taking public debt from 25 percent of gdp in 1980 to 41 percent by 1990 . not only did the supply-siders ' self-funding promises go unfulfilled ; they also marked the beginning of the end for the us ' balance-of-payments equilibrium . ",
        "far from a recipe for greatness , the trump fiscal gambit spells serious trouble . lacking in savings , outsize us budget deficits point to sharp deterioration on the balance-of-payment and trade fronts . nor will creative supply-side accounting alter that outcome . a `` dynamic scoring '' by the nonpartisan tax policy center suggests growth windfalls might prune the multi-year deficit from $ 1.4 trillion to $ 1.3 trillion over the next decade -- hardly enough to finesse america 's intractable funding problem . george h. w. bush said it best when he was campaigning for the republican presidential nomination in april 1980 . ",
        "he rightly criticized the `` voodoo economic policy '' of his opponent , ronald reagan . for today 's savings-short us economy , déjà vu is a painful understatement of what lies ahead . the author , a faculty member at yale university and former chairman of morgan stanley asia , is the author of unbalanced : the codependency of america and china . project syndicate .
