        "steve bannon 's future at breitbart , the site he once called his `` killing machine , '' may be in jeopardy following his feud with president donald trump , according to a wall street journal report . the former white house chief strategist has gone head to head with trump this week after excerpts from michael wolff 's upcoming book fire and fury were released saying bannon called donald trump jr. 's meeting with russians during the 2016 campaign `` treasonous '' and `` unpatriotic , '' and called ivanka trump `` dumb as a brick . '' now , bannon 's longtime benefactors , secretive manhattan billionaires robert mercer and his daughter rebekah , along with the rest of breitbart 's board , are considering ousting bannon as the company 's chairman , wsj reports .

        "a spokesperson for breitbart news and the mercers did not immediately respond to a townandcountrymag . com request for comment . republican megadonors robert and rebekah mercer . former bannon ally rebekah issued her first-ever public statement to the washington post thursday evening rebuking bannon . `` i support president trump and the platform upon which he was elected , '' mercer told the paper . `` my family and i have not communicated with steve bannon in many months and have provided no financial support to his political agenda , nor do we support his recent actions and statements . ",
        "`` it was revealed last year that the mercers are part-owners of the far-right nationalist website that bannon ran before joining the trump campaign , and where he returned after leaving the administration . and it was the mercers who connected bannon with trump during his campaign . originally backing presidential candidate ted cruz , the republican megadonors switched allegiance to trump after cruz dropped out of the race . they then reportedly suggested bannon and kellyanne conway take over running the campaign . the mercers and bannon have an extensive history . rebekah was reportedly a director for his government accountability institute , which funded research for the books clinton cash and bush bucks .

        "and she founded reclaim new york , a nonprofit focused on transparency and the city 's affordability , with him . in 2011 , the mercers invested $ 10 million to the then-relatively unknown site breitbart , according to bloomberg politics . after the site 's founder andrew breitbart died in 2012 , bannon took the reigns . when white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders was asked thursday whether breitbart should consider removing bannon , she said : ` i certainly think that it 's something they should look at and consider .
