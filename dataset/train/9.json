        "do n't expect interest rates to spike anytime soon in hong kong , where abundant liquidity has fueled spectacular rallies in the stock and property markets . that 's according to hong kong 's biggest lender hsbc holdings plc , which says a key measure -- the aggregate balance maintained by commercial banks -- would need to plunge by $ 10 billion for local rates to show any substantial gains . an outflow of that magnitude is n't likely to happen quickly barring a big market shock , said george leung , an hsbc adviser for asia-pacific who 's among the bank 's senior management . ",
        "`` unless there 's some unforeseen political crisis , i do n't see a very substantial outflow of capital out of hong kong , '' leung said in an interview on monday . `` to get this amount out of hong kong 's banking system it may still take quite a bit of time . '' with hong kong 's monetary policy essentially dictated by the u. s. federal reserve because of the currency peg , the city 's de facto central bank has been warning that rising interest rates could wreak havoc on the world 's priciest property market . ",
        "the hong kong monetary authority on wednesday ratcheted up banks ' capital buffers to limit the risks posed by booms in property prices and credit . leung is taking a more sanguine view on the implications of rising rates , saying that abundant liquidity means it will take time for the increases to have an impact . hong kong 's enormous cash pile has in part helped drive the world 's least affordable housing market to stratospheric levels and shares to the highest in a decade . home prices are more than double their 1997 levels , when the city 's housing bubble burst . ",
        "the local hang seng index gained for a 12th day on wednesday , the longest streak since the gauge was launched in 1969 . while the aggregate balance of interbank liquidity has more than halved from its 2015 peak , at hk$ 180 billion , it 's still more than a hundred-fold larger than what was typical before the dawn of u. s. quantitative easing in 2008 . the aggregate balance shrank since 2015 , mostly because the hong kong monetary authority sold extra debt , which was seen as a deliberate move to nudge rates higher . click here for a story on factors to watch for hong kong ratesunder the linked exchange rate system , local monetary conditions have to eventually converge with the u. s . ",
        "this could happen when the hkma sucks up liquidity in order to defend the hong kong dollar 's hk$ 7.75-hk $ 7.85 band . the local currency has weakened 0.1 percent this year to hk$ 7.8240 as hibor 's discount to the u. s. equivalent widened . another rate worth watching is the prime rate , which is set individually by banks and has n't been raised since 2006 . that rate is the basis for a cap on hibor-based mortgage rates , which made up 92 percent of new housing loans in november . the floating hibor has started to run into its cap , creating pressure for banks to raise their prime rates . ",
        "time for a raise ? hong kong 's floating mortgage rate has run into a prime rate-based cap since late-2017 source : centaline mortgage broker there 's a higher chance for local banks to raise their prime rates in the first quarter , alex cheung , head of the institutional banking group at dbs bank ltd. . said in november . even if local rates rise , it 's unlikely home prices will see a large fall amid a supply shortage , leung added . it will take a rate increase of at least 200 basis points to see any material impact on the property market , and only three u. s. rate hikes totaling around 75 basis points are expected this year , he said . ",
        "`` if interest rates are not going to rise too much , i think the property market will be stable , '' he said .   "
