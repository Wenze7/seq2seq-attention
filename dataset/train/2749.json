        "the primary school teacher from strathaven will find out tomorrow if she 's made the squad for south koreaaileen neilson is expected to be named in the team gb squad for this year 's winter paralympics . the strathaven wheelchair curler guided the team to a bronze medal in sochi four years ago and also represented her country at the vancouver games in 2010 , where they finished sixth . now she is set to make her third appearance when team gb announce their squad tomorrow morning for the 2018 games in pyeongchang , south korea . but it has n't all been plain sailing for the british team since their medal win in russia . ",
        "they were relegated to the world championships ` b ' section in 2015 and have battled their way back to elite level to qualify for another paralympics . ahead of the announcement , skip neilson said : `` if selected , it would be my third paralympic games and a real honour to be involved . `` the team has been working really hard together after sochi . `` it 's been a real rollercoaster ride since then after being relegated to the ` b ' section , but we have fought back and won bronze at the world championships in south korea last year . ",
        "`` we have a small group , but whoever goes out to the paralympics i think the team will be capable of medalling . '' twelve teams will battle it out in a round robin before the knockout stage and aileen feels squad togetherness will be key in south korea . she said : `` we train on a regular basis so we all know each other well . we were over in canada in the us for two weeks before christmas and practically living in each other 's pockets , so it 's important . `` we won the us open when we were over there , so i know that if the team play the way they have , we 're in with a shout . ",
        "`` we 're really looking for the play-offs , and it 's a marathon , not a sprint . `` we can afford to lose a game in the round-robin , but we have to be at our best in the play-offs . if we want to podium we have to bring our ` a ' game . '' channel 4 will once again screen coverage of the games and neilson reckons having the sport in the spotlight will encourage others to follow in her footsteps . `` with the paralympics and the olympics , people see it and they want to try the sports , '' said the 46-year-old primary school teacher . ",
        "`` as far as curling is concerned i would say get on the ice and try it . `` particularly for paralympics , the profile from the london 2012 games and the coverage that got helped . there was a lot on channel 4 that raised the profile enormously . `` i would be in shopping centres and people would be saying ` well done ' and things like that , and it really was in the forefront of people 's thoughts . if we get good coverage again it can raise the profile even further . `` what 's great is that people are realising that paralympic athletes work just as hard as able-bodied athletes and with guys like jonnie peacock on shows like strictly come dancing it shows people that it 's more about what we can do than what we ca n't .
