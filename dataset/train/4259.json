        "beijing/seoul - a tanker carrying iranian oil that collided with a chinese freight ship in the east china sea on saturday was still ablaze on monday morning , a south korean coast guard official said , as emergency rescue teams continued to search for the missing crew . the u. s. navy sent a military aircraft to assist with the search , which spanned an area of about 3,600 square nautical miles , but said in a statement it did not locate any of the tanker 's 32 missing crew members . the sanchi tanker run by iran 's top oil shipping operator , collided with the cf crystal about 160 nautical miles off china 's coast near shanghai and the mouth of the yangtze river delta on saturday evening . ",
        "chinese state media cctv showed pictures on sunday of the tanker ablaze and billowing plumes of thick dark smoke . china sent four rescue ships and three cleaning boats to the site , while south korea dispatched a ship and a helicopter . the panama-registered tanker was sailing from iran to south korea , carrying 136,000 tonnes of condensate , an ultra light crude . that is equivalent to just under 1 million barrels , worth about $ 60 million , based on global crude oil prices . the freight ship , which was carrying u. s. grain , suffered limited damage and the 21 crew members , all chinese nationals , were rescued . ",
        "the extent of the environmental harm and size of the spill were not yet known , but based on the tonnage the tanker was carrying , it has the potential to be the worst since 1991 when 260,000 tonnes of oil leaked off the angolan coast . to view a graphic on ship collision off china 's coast , click : hanwha total petrochemical co ltd in south korea was due to receive the cargo and was looking at ways to replace the lost barrels , a spokesman said . the company may use its own stock , ask iran for another cargo or seek alternative condensate supplies from qatar , he said . ",
        "the accident was not affecting its operations on monday , he said . colorless , odorless and harmful bad weather on sunday night made it hard for the rescue crews to get access to the tanker . trying to contain a spill of condensate , which is extremely low in density , highly toxic and much more explosive than normal crude , may also be difficult . it is only liquid in certain pressure and temperature conditions and often evaporates into air or dilutes into water when exposed to the atmosphere or spills uncontrolled . when liquid , condensate is colorless and virtually odorless . ",
        "surface spills of condensate are therefore difficult to detect visually , making them hard to manage and contain . tankers also carry shipping fuel , known as bunker , which is extremely heavy and toxic , when spilled , though much less explosive . shanghai maritime bureau 's navigation department said the collision did not affect impact traffic in and out of shanghai , one of the world 's busiest and biggest ports , or ports along the yangtze river .
