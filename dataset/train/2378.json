",
        "dortmund 's efforts were rewarded two minutes before the break , though . marcel schmelzer caught vazquez and varane 's replacement marco asensio idle near kovacic 's loose pass and the left-back whipped a brilliant delivery into the box that aubameyang headed beyond navas . within three minutes of the restart bvb were level as aubameyang stepped inside of sergio ramos and , after being denied by navas at the first attempt , showed incredible composure to chip the goalkeeper . a high press from isco gave ronaldo a chance to move into double figures in this season 's champions league , but the portuguese pulled wide from the right of the area . ",
        "vazquez saw a powerful drive held by burki as madrid stepped up a their attempts for a winner , which ronaldo thought he had when he swept home casemiro 's knockdown only to see the flag up for offside . it finally came when vazquez 's volley with the outside of his right foot beat burki low to his left , but kagawa fired a great chance to salvage a point over with just two minutes remaining . 2 - borussia dortmund is the 1st club in @championsleague history , which takes the 3rd place in a group with only 2 points and qualifies for europa league .
