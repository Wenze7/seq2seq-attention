        "jan 20 -- roy hodgson believes jack wilshere deserves a recall to the england national side following his impressive recent displays . the arsenal midfielder has not represented the three lions since they were surprisingly eliminated by iceland at euro 2016 which was also palace boss hodgson 's last game in charge of the national team . injury problems have been the main reason for wilshere 's recent absence , but he has managed to put his fitness issues behind him and is currently impressing as a regular starter for the gunners . hodgson has certainly been impressed by wilshere 's renaissance and has called for the 26-year-old to be recalled to the england set-up sooner rather than later . ",
        "`` i 'd like to see him available for selection , '' hodgson said . `` gareth will make that decision , but i think it would be nice if he had that option at least of a jack wilshere playing in the form he 's playing in at the moment , and the form i 've always known he 's had . `` i see no reason why the injuries should continue to prevent him . i hope it does n't happen for his sake , for england 's sake , because he really is an outstanding talent .
