        "the house intelligence committee is poised to question steve bannon , the onetime confidant to president donald trump , following his spectacular fall from power after accusing the president 's son and others of `` treasonous '' behavior for taking a meeting with russians during the 2016 campaign . bannon is scheduled to testify before the panel on tuesday , according to a person familiar with the committee 's plans . the person was not authorized to discuss private committee deliberations and spoke on condition of anonymity . the testimony comes just one week after a very public excommunication from trump 's closest confines following the publication of michael wolff 's `` fire and fury . '' ",
        "in the book , bannon accuses donald trump jr. , jared kushner and former trump campaign chairman paul manafort of `` treasonous '' behavior for meeting with a group of russian lawyers and lobbyists who they believed were ready to offer `` dirt '' on democratic candidate hillary clinton . more recently , bannon has said he was not referring to trump jr. . but rather to manafort . wolff contends the reverse . after the book 's release , trump quickly disavowed `` sloppy steve bannon '' and argued extensively there was no evidence of collusion between his presidential campaign and operatives tied to russian president vladimir putin . ",
        "bannon apologized a few days later , but was stripped of his job leading the pro-trump news site breitbart news . bannon last year had largely avoided the scrutiny of congressional investigators , who instead focused much of their energy on trying to secure interviews with top witnesses like manafort and former national security adviser michael flynn . but bannon played a critical role in the campaign , the presidential transition and the white house -- all during times now under scrutiny from congressional investigators looking for possible evidence of a connection between trump 's operations and russia . bannon recently retained the same lawyer being used by former trump chief of staff reince priebus and white house general counsel don mcgahn . ",
        "neither bannon nor his lawyer immediately responded to a request for comment on monday . the house intelligence committee is speeding toward a conclusion of its interviews in its russia investigation . the final result could be marred by partisan infighting , which has some members discussing the probability that republicans on the panel will issue one set of findings and the democrats will issue their own report .
