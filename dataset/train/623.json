        "file photo : a united airlines boeing 767-322 aircraft takes off from zurich airport january 9 , 2018 . reuters/arnd wiegmann/file photoby alana wisenew york - united continental holdings inc shares fell more than 6 percent in after-hours trading on tuesday as the airline said it plans to increase capacity , likely threatening its profit margin as it is locked in a price war with low-cost carriers . `` the best way to compete with low-cost carriers is to match their prices , '' one of its executives said on an earnings call with analysts and investors . `` we ca n't let low-cost carriers have price advantages in our hubs . ",
        "`` the warning spooked investors , who are keeping a close eye on united 's bottom line as the company tries to prevail in a fierce fare war that has sent some ticket prices tumbling . shares of delta air lines inc and american airlines group inc also fell more than 5 percent after hours . united said it expected to increase its capacity by between 4 percent and 6 percent in 2018 , and would likely grow by a similar amount in 2019 and 2020 , on the grounds that it would give the carrier a competitive edge in its fight against low-cost airlines . ",
        "the no . 3 u. s. carrier by passenger traffic earlier reported fourth-quarter net profit of $ 580 million , or $ 1.99 per share , compared with $ 397 million , or $ 1.26 per share , in the year-ago quarter , helped by costly last-minute ticket purchases . excluding special charges , united reported profit of $ 1.40 per share , beating wall street 's average estimate of $ 1.34 per share , according to thomson reuters i/b/e / s . in the current period , higher labor costs , costlier fuel and the ongoing pricing battle are weighing on the carrier 's profit margins . ",
        "united added to investors ' unease by saying it will continue to compete with low-cost airlines on price . in the fourth quarter , united posted a 0.2 percent increase in passenger unit revenue , a closely watched measurement of an airline 's success , after a posting a sharp decline in the prior quarter . the chicago-based airline 's results follow a strong fourth-quarter performance and quarterly outlook by rival delta air lines inc , which reported better-than-expected profit earlier this month .
