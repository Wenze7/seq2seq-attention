        "west bromwich albion manager alan pardew is the latest to find himself baffled at the prices on the transfer market . to be fair to the englishman , 56 , it does n't sound like he 's raving in ` old man yelling at the sky ' fashion . rather he thinks the numbers are hard for fans to gauge and perhaps it 's causing a disconnect . and for him , at least , it 's a challenge to sort out whether the prices he 's being quoted are reasonable relative to the market . that makes sense , considering that as newcastle boss in 2012 he sold fraser forster to celtic for about $ 3 million and psg bought yohan cabaye -- then 28 -- from him for $ 26 million . ",
        "both fees would be a little different right now , we think . `` it 's difficult with the prices now to gauge what 's good value , '' pardew said . `` we live in a hyper-inflated world because of the tv money received by the football clubs . therefore , transfers and wages are going way out of kilter with real life . i think we 're all losing the plot with the figures . it 's just becoming , ` oh okay , ' and not even reacting to things any more . `` now , to play devil 's advocate , if pardew is actually just old man yelling at the sky , he 'd better get out of the manager 's box . ",
        "the fees are n't changing for top clubs , which is why jonny evans is at risk from a man city bid but not newcastle united or crystal palace . and the tv money he talks about is going to allow clubs like wba to hold onto players by offering better wages if they choose that route . but it 's a fair sentiment regarding how to gauge these numbers . while it 's usually a bit laughable when fans and writers estimate whether clubs have paid too much or sold for too little , managers and administrators risk looking foolish if they agree too low or too high a fee relative to other teams .
