        "in the past few years , artificial neural networks allowed researchers make a rather big leap towards the accuracy of software that can interpret images and other content , and we 're now seeing the boom in the ai industry . yes , we are still nowhere close to the the plot of `` the matrix '' . unlike the human brain that can do and process multiple things simultaneously , nowadays robots need to be trained in a linear way , and scientists focus on teaching them to do one thing extremely well . however , deep neural networks have learned to drive cars , beat alphago champions , paint pictures , evaluate websites , and help scientific discoveries happen .

        "image and object recognition—Åapsule networks , invented by one of its fathers , geoffrey hinton , has almost halved the best previous error rate on a test that challenges software to recognize toys from different angles . with capsules , small bundles of virtual neurons , the ai system is able to analyze an object and its position in a three-dimensional space . using an increased amount of these capsules over various scans allows the system to better identify an object , even if the view is different than ones analyzed before . take a state-of-the-art network and train it on imagenet , the biggest database of labelled images and it will be able to classify objects better than a ph. d. student andrej karpathy who was trained on the same task for over 100 hours .

        "google 's deepmind uses a deep learning technique that is referred to as deep reinforcement learning . this method was used to teach a computer to play the atari game breakout . the computer was n't taught or programmed in any specific way to play the game . instead , it was given control over the keyboard while watching the score , and its goal was to maximize the score . after two hours of playing , the computer was an expert in the game . after four hours of playing , the computer began understanding the true strategy and realized that digging a tunnel through the wall is the most effective technique to win in the game .

        "the deep learning community is in a race to train computers to beat people at almost any game you can think of , including : space invaders , doom , pong , and world of warcraft . in the majority of these games deep learning networks are already outperforming experienced players . the computers were not programmed to play the games , instead they just played the games for hours and learned the rules by themselves . voice generation and recognitionlast year , google released wavenet and baidu released deep speech , both being deep learning networks that are able to generate a voice automatically . ",
        "the systems learn to mimic human voices by themselves and improve over time . when letting an audience try to differentiate them from a real human speaking , it is much harder to do than one might imagine . while we are not there yet in terms of automatic voice generation , deep learning is taking us another step closer to giving computers the ability to truly speak like humans do . another example : a deep network created by oxford and google deepmind scientists , lipnet , reached a 93 % success score in reading people 's lips where an average lip reader only succeeds 52 % of the time .

        "art and style imitationa neural network can study the patterns in the strokes , colors , and shading of a particular piece of art . from there , it can transfer the style from the original artwork into a new image based on the analysis . there are plenty of new creative ways of applying this technique on the internet . deepart . io creates apps that use deep learning to learn hundreds of different styles which you can apply to your photos . while it might look like a filter , what is actually happening is the neural networks are analyzing the style of an example work , something like van gogh , and applying it to the photo uploaded by the user . ",
        "the ai then reconstructs the photo from scratch . predictionsa group of researchers took 50 million google street view images and explored what a deep learning network can do with them . the computer learned to localize and recognize cars . it detected over 22 million cars including their make , model , body type , and year . this system was able to predict the demographics of each area by the car makeup . it also was able to make interesting ties based on the vehicle frequency , one example includes voter lines . based on the analysis , if the number of sedans encountered during a 15-minute drive through a city is higher than the number of pickup trucks , the city is likely to vote for a democrat during the next presidential election ; otherwise , it is likely to vote for a republican .

        "website designtoday , website builders are either using deep networks or are going to use them in their work . at ukit , we have implemented ai to upgrade old websites built with from different platforms to the modern ones in no time . one of our underlying technologies emulates an opinion of an average user about site appearance to provide the ai with the information whether the site design is good or bad . so , companies are working diligently to improve the intelligence of neural networks while giving the end user services that can utilize ai and deep learning -- and new ideas and improvements keep appearing .
