        "superhero fans have seemed to be in agreement over one thing : 2017 's wonder woman completely revitalized the action movie genre . director patty jenkins brought the iconic heroine 's story to the big screen after decades of fans demanding it , and the film met commercial and critical success . following its unprecedented level of success , talks of wonder woman receiving an oscar nomination surfaced , and as the nomination announcements on tuesday morning showed , the academy felt differently , completely snubbing the film from any categories . before the nominations were released , fans were hopeful that wonder woman would be recognized for more than just the customary special effects categories to which superhero films are often limited . ",
        "the story of warrior woman diana prince was a timely dose of girl power that excited viewers about the endless-seeming stream of superhero films turned out every year . although the film became the top-grossing superhero origin movie both domestically and globally , it raked up universal praise for other production elements , including a national board of review spotlight award for jenkins and title star gal gadot and a best action movie win at the critics ' choice awards . a 2019 sequel is already in the works , suggesting that the success of wonder woman has paved the way for more female superhero movies . ",
        "fingers crossed for a black widow story next ! such plans only emphasize that female-helmed films should n't be viewed suspiciously , as jenkins pointed out : leading up to the reveal of oscar nominations , some on twitter believed that wonder woman receiving at least a best picture nod would recognize the shift in hollywood inspired by the #metoo movement : the film was snubbed out at the golden globes and the sag awards , aka some of the biggest indicators of what performances the academy awards will recognize . amidst criticism of an all-male lineup of best director nominees at the golden globes , both jenkins and lady bird 's greta gerwig were previously excluded from mainstream director categories , despite both women directing two of the year 's most successful films . ",
        "gerwig did receive an oscar nomination for her directorial work , which happens so rarely for women and is a major achievement , but it does seema little unfair that jenkins revolutionized a genre and has been passed over . before oscar nominations came out , audiences were also invested in the possibility of gadot being recognized for best actress . she may have become a superhero icon this year , but as expected , fans were disappointed when gadot was officially left off the oscar nomination list . however , she was included in the first of the pre-category introductions that the academy produced in honor of the awards ' 90th year , so ... . ",
        "given how extensive the academy awards guest list often is , there 's still a chance of gadot making an appearance at the ceremony . she presented an award at the golden globes this year , suggesting that she could do the same at the oscars and satisfy her devoted fans . the academy members may not be fans of singling out action movies , but regardless of its snub , wonder woman has made its mark on cinema . here 's to more possibilities for female-led action films in the future . the academy awards air live on march 4 at 8 p. m. et / 5 p. m. pt on abc .
