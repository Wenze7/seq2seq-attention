        "image via saskatchewan rush youtubeput on your finest denim jacket and pour yourself a big glass of maple syrup , because we 've got a fine canadian controversy . it involves a man named rush hulk -- not his real name -- who is a fan of the saskatchewan rush box lacrosse team . the man , actually named kelvin ooms , wears a mask and hulk hands to rush games . last year , he wore that getup for a rush away game in calgary . this season , he 's looking to add a muscle suit to that outfit for a road trip rush fans have planned . ",
        "and the calgary roughnecks wo n't let him . the calgary herald reports : mike moore , vice-president of the roughnecks , said that ooms was welcome to attend the game `` as a fan , not as a mascot . '' `` we do n't believe it 's proper safety or security to have any official mascot or unofficial mascot of the visiting team in a home venue , '' moore said . `` it causes potential security issues and safety issues . '' moore said there 's a risk ooms could bump into other fans while dancing or cheering in costume and might provoke unhappy responses . ",
        "`` he does n't know the building . what if he does fall down or if he steps on somebody ? '' moore said . `` fans get intense and home fans get protective and when you 've got mascots from visiting teams . '' incidentally , saturday 's game is also star wars night . if only he were rush vader !   "
