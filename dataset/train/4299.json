        "in a randomized , controlled phase-2 clinical trial , an asthma medication increased the speed and safety of a protocol used to treat children for several food allergies at once , according to a study by researchers at the stanford university school of medicine . the study will be published online dec. . 11 in the lancet gastroenterology & hepatology . about 30 percent of people who have food allergies are allergic to more than one food . doctors tell them never to eat foods that trigger their allergies -- the consequences can be deadly -- but this requires constant vigilance . ",
        "`` patients find it very hard to live with multiple food allergies , '' said the study 's senior author , sharon chinthrajah , md , director of the clinical translational research unit at the sean n. parker center for allergy and asthma research at stanford university . `` it puts a huge social and economic burden on families . '' the trial was conducted at the parker center . the new trial examined oral immunotherapy , an allergy treatment in which patients are dosed daily with tiny amounts of the foods that cause their allergic reactions . over time , the dose is gradually increased until the patient can tolerate normal quantities of the food . ",
        "in the trial , the oral treatment was combined with omalizumab , an antibody medication that ramps down the allergic response . the new trial used a placebo-controlled , randomized design to determine whether omalizumab made it safer and faster for children to receive oral immunotherapy to desensitize them to multiple foods simultaneously . at the end of the nine-month trial , 83 percent of children who had received omalizumab could tolerate at least 2 grams of two different food allergens , whereas only 33 percent receiving placebo reached the same level of tolerance . ` excited to see the clinical efficacy ' `` we were excited to see the clinical efficacy of this combination approach using omalizumab and multiple foods , '' said chinthrajah , who is also a clinical assistant professor of medicine and of pediatrics at stanford . ",
        "`` this could be a very promising way to decrease the burden of living with food allergies . '' `` the study showed significant efficacy and safety improvements in multi-allergic patients treated with omalizumab and food immunotherapy , '' said co-author kari nadeau , md , phd , director of the parker center and professor of medicine and of pediatrics . `` multi-allergic patients are at much higher risk for anaphylactic reactions since they are allergic to more foods , and omalizumab can help change the course of therapy by making it safer and faster . `` the study included 48 children ages 4-15 . ",
        "thirty-six children were randomly assigned to receive omalizumab , and 12 children to receive placebo , during oral immunotherapy . the drug or placebo was given for eight weeks before oral immunotherapy began , and also for the first eight weeks of oral immunotherapy . immunotherapy continued without the medication or placebo for the next 20 weeks . the oral immunotherapy was tailored to patients ' individual allergies , with each child being treated for two to five of their food allergens . the foods included in the study were almond , cashew , egg , hazelnut , milk , peanut , sesame , soy , walnut and wheat , all of which are common causes of food allergies . ",
        "children taking omalizumab were desensitized significantly faster than those dosed with placebo . they also had fewer gastrointestinal side effects during therapy , such as nausea and abdominal pain , and fewer respiratory side effects , such as shortness of breath . twenty-two percent of oral immunotherapy doses in omalizumab patients and 54 percent of doses for placebo patients caused gastrointestinal side effects , while 0 and 1 percent of doses caused respiratory side effects in the omalizumab and placebo groups , respectively . none of the patients in the study experienced serious side effects , such as anaphylactic shock . ",
        "to maintain success of treatment for their food allergies , patients continued to eat each food daily after the study was completed . the trial found that after the nine-month immunotherapy procedure , patients continued to be able to eat the foods safely . larger and longer clinical trials are needed to understand how tolerance develops after someone stops eating the food every day and what makes the benefits of treatment last , the researchers said . the parker center is now engaged in such studies . the successful therapy made a big difference in the lives of children who participated in the trial , chinthrajah said . ",
        "`` patients and families say they 're so grateful , '' she said . `` they can broaden their food variety and participate in more social activities without fear of a bad allergic reaction . kids say things like ` i no longer sit at the allergen-free table at lunch ; i can sit with my usual friends . ' these tiny things that others take for granted can open their social world . `` the team 's work is an example of stanford medicine 's focus on precision health , the goal of which is to anticipate and prevent disease in the healthy and precisely diagnose and treat disease in the ill .
