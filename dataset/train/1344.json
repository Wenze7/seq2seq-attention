        "only darrelle is on revis island , where he 's too far from offensive players to make an effort at tackling them . the future hall of fame cornerback may have played the final game of his career saturday , when his chiefs fell apart in a 22-21 upset loss to the titans . revis , who stayed home until being signed by kansas city midseason , playing his first game dec. . 3 , first got torched on the field then by game analysts in the meltdown in which he did n't appear to have much invested . the first bit of damning evidence that revis quit came during an early fourth-quarter derrick henry touchdown run , when the running back navigated his way around blocks for 35 yards to bring tennessee to within 21-16 . ",
        "the 32-year-old revis may have had a shot at angling henry down -- if he had been running full speed . `` and that 's a terrible effort by darrelle revis , '' tony dungy said on nbc . the game ended similarly . with time waning and the titans at third-and-10 , needing a first down to seal it , henry bounced a run left . quarterback marcus mariota enabled henry to escape the backfield with a big-time block , while revis -- no . 24 -- came across the field and screeched to a full stop as henry bounded right past him , past the first-down marker and ended the chiefs ' season . ",
        "if this is the effort revis gives , broncos linebacker brandon marshall said he needs to give it up .   "
