        "kigali , rwanda -- a new report commissioned by rwanda 's government accuses france of supplying weapons to the perpetrators of its 1994 genocide in which over 800,000 people were killed , deepening a feud between the east african country and its former benefactor . the report by u. s. law firm cunningham levy muse cites evidence that purportedly shows french complicity before , during and after the genocide by ethnic hutu extremists against ethnic tutsi and some hutu moderates . french officials provided safe sanctuary to some genocide suspects and have obstructed attempts to bring them to justice , the report says . ",
        "the report is `` a damning summary of conduct by french officials '' at the time of the genocide , rwandan foreign minister louise mushikiwabo said in the report , which she said has been transmitted to the french government . there was no immediate comment from french officials . the report underscores the increasingly strained relations between france and rwandan president paul kagame 's government , which recently recalled its ambassador . last year rwanda published a list of 22 french senior military officers it accused of helping plan and carry out the genocide , including gen. jacques lanxade , france 's army chief of staff from april 1991 to sept. . ",
        "1995 . the publication of the list came after french investigators reopened an inquiry into the plane crash that killed rwanda 's president and sparked the genocide . militants from the hutu majority blamed minority tutsis for the death of president juvenal habyarimana , an ethnic hutu , sparking the slaughter . the cause of the crash has been a contentious issue . the plane had a french crew .
