        "destiny 2 players can look forward to a little romance in february . destiny 2 will play host to crimson days , a valentine 's day themed event last seen at its debut in 2016 . the event was one of the first led by destiny 's live team , and came under criticism , failing to return in 2017 . as part of destiny 2 's commitment to regular events , it will make its return . rumours of the return of crimson days broke when redditor ginsor datamined related assets , added to destiny 2 prior to the arrival of the holiday event , the dawning . ",
        "bungie community manager chris `` cozmo23 '' shannon then confirmed the news on reddit . `` the rumors are true . crimson days is coming back . it wo n't be the same as last time . we will talk about how it is changing in the blog update on thursday . '' stay tuned for the bungie weekly update tomorrow for all the details of crimson days will play out in destiny 2 -- but in the meantime we can make some educated guesses . we know the event will start witha quest run by eververse 's tess everis , who will award participants with a free engram . ",
        "however , lord shaxx will also offer a crimson days quest in destiny 2 , and maybe even tyra karn . crimson doubles , a 2v2 crucible mode , will also return to destiny 2 , and some of the art assets suggest you might be able to participate in crimson days in raid or other pve activities . rewards on offer seem to include the usual eververse fare -- emotes , shaders , sparrows , transmat effects and ornaments . they 're mostly themed around hearts , roses , and romantic gestures . in short , it does n't sound all that different from the dawning or past destiny events -- a time-limited loot box-driven affair . ",
        "destiny 2 players had a lot to say about how stingy the dawning was with loot boxes , so let 's hope bungie changes course before crimson days drops -- presumably in february , alongside valentine 's day .   "
