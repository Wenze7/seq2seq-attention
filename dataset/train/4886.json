        "the loving dad inderpal singh , from birmingham , is urgently trying to raise cash for the special car t-cell treatmenta jaguar land rover worker is in a race against time to raise £ 1.6 million for life-saving cancer treatment in the usa . the loving dad inderpal singh , from birmingham , is urgently trying to raise cash for the special car t-cell treatment . it is vital because the dad has been given the bombshell news that his leukaemia has spread to other parts of his body . inderpal , who has two young children -- yuuraaj , aged seven , and priya , who is four -- has been told by medics that the treatment is his only chance of survival . ",
        "`` we are trying to give inderpal the chance he deserves , '' says his sister gurpreet kaur . `` his children need a father , and his wife needs her husband . we are trying to raise the money as soon as possible so that he can go to texas for treatment . `` it 's his only chance left -- we just want him to get better . '' in 2013 inderpal , now 28 , was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and underwent chemotherapy . later , he underwent a haploidentical stem cell transplant -- where the donor is a part match to the recipient -- from his 27-year-old brother , hardeep . ",
        "but sadly , inderpal was told he had relapsed last month and his only option was to apply for treatment in houston as part of a clinical trial . now , the jlr worker 's family have set up a justgiving page to try to raise the money before time runs out . as of last night , the appeal had raised more than £ 9,500 so there is a long way to go . `` in october he was told that the cancer had spread to his stomach , '' says gurpreet . `` in 2015 , hardeep donated stem cells -- a direct match could n't be found because there is a real shortage of donors in the asian community . ",
        "`` it looked like it had worked but , a few weeks ago , we got this news . `` our whole family is devastated . for almost five years he has been battling this , and your life gets put on hold . `` when he was first diagnosed , his wife ramesh was eight months pregnant with their second child . `` we need to give him this chance -- he is an amazing father and husband , and he deserves to see his children grow up . `` if everyone could just spare £ 1 for my brother , it would mean everything to us .
