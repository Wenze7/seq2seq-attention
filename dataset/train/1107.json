        "cape town - virat kohli ' rivalry with fellow batting star ab de villiers is likely to provide a compelling side-show in the three-test series between south africa and india starting at newlands on friday . `` it 's not like only two guys are playing in this series , '' said kohli , playing things down when asked about de villiers , his royal challengers bangalore teammate in the indian premier league . `` ab is a great friend of mine , i respect the way he plays the game and i 've always respected him as a person as well , '' kohli said at india 's arrival press conference . ",
        "`` but when you 're playing against each other it 's just about wanting to get ab out and i 'm sure the opposition would want the same when i play or rahane plays or pujara plays as well . `` while rahane and pujara may be high-quality players -- in the same way that dean elgar and hashim amla are for south africa -- no player on either side can match the aura created by kohli and de villiers , whose thrilling stroke play can change the course of a match . kohli is india 's most glamorous and best-performing batsman since sachin tendulkar while de villiers has the rare distinction for a foreigner of having star appeal in india . ",
        "when south africa toured india two seasons ago , crowds put aside their passionate support for the home side and chanted `` abd , abd '' whenever de villiers walked out to bat . it could even be argued that de villiers contributed to south africa 's downfall in the test matches which followed a one-day series dominated by his dazzling batting . de villiers slammed three centuries in five matches , leading south africa to a series victory which had ravi shastri , india 's team director , grumbling about conditions which suited the visitors . it seemed no coincidence that the four test matches were played on spin-friendly dust bowls and were dominated by indian spin bowlers ravichandran ashwin and ravindra jadeja . ",
        "it brought de villiers down to earth , although he was still south africa 's best batsman , scoring 258 runs at an average of 36.85 . even kohli struggled in the conditions , restricted to 200 runs at 33.33 . kohli has only played in two other tests against south africa , when india toured in 2013/14 , but showed his ability to handle the pace and bounce of south african pitches by making 119 and 96 in the first test in johannesburg . de villiers has played 17 tests against india and his average of 40.10 against them is modest compared to his career average of 50.47 . ",
        "but he has enjoyed some big successes -- 217 not out in an innings win in ahmedabad in 2007/08 and south africa 's fastest test century , off 75 balls , in centurion in 2010/11 . kohli is coming off a spectacular 2017 , during which he hit three double centuries in compiling 1059 test runs at an average of 75.64 , while because of injury followed by a break from test cricket de villiers has only played in one test -- scoring 53 in the two-day rout of zimbabwe -- since january 2016 . de villiers professed his excitement about being back on the big stage . ",
        "kohli , in speaking of the hunger in the indian team , noted that he could n't speak for the opposition and that `` ab has n't played much test cricket since he played against us , and he 's coming back after a while . '' what seems certain when the world 's two top-ranked test teams square up is that there will be extra excitement and anticipation every time kohli and de villiers walk out to bat .   "
