        "there are only a few absolute certainties in the universe . gravity keeps your feet on the ground . the sun rises in the east . and having access to a personal vehicle carries an inescapable , ongoing expense -- regardless of whether you buy , lease , or rent a car . in fact , the only sure-fire way to know if you 're making a smart economic decision when it comes to your ride is to combine all the costs for purchasing , maintaining , insuring , and financing an automobile into a single monthly figure . so , we have to ask , how does that all add up ? ",
        "what is the true cost of car ownership ? how do financing , leasing and subscriptions compare ? according to the american automobile association , the magic number for your car 's total cost of ownership is probably between $ 600 and $ 800 per month . quibble about the exact number if you like . but depending on the make and model -- and how many miles you drive per year -- the monthly expense of keeping a personal vehicle in your driveway will be within that ballpark . let 's use a ford fusion se -- a mid-size right in the middle of the car market -- as the basis for this discussion . ",
        "what does it cost to finance a car ? depending on the engine size and the level of fit and finish , you can find a new ford fusion se with a sticker price of about $ 24,000 . but the minute you drive the car off the dealership lot , it loses thousands of dollars of its worth . after a year , that new fusion will have lost as much as 25 -- 30 % percent of its value -- in other words , how much money the same car could fetch if you sold it after just one year . ",
        "according to edmunds , a leading car-buying website , by the time you pay off your five-year loan , the value of the car will have been cut by 45 percent or more . in the case of the ford fusion se , if you do a good job of selling the car at a fair price , the depreciation of the car will be around $ 12,000 . without even thinking about it , you were spending nearly $ 200 a month over 60 months on car depreciation alone , the number one cost of owning an automobile . ",
        "well , $ 200 a month is not bad , right ? unfortunately , that 's only the beginning of your expenses . if it was provided at the going interest rate , then the financing of that loan likely costs around an average of $ 47 per month . what about licenses , taxes , and fees for the fusion ? that averages to another $ 47 a month . now add insurance -- generally estimated at 20-percent of a car 's total cost of ownership . depending on your policy and your driving history , insurance could easily set you back $ 120 per month . ",
        "add up depreciation , financing , licenses , taxes , fees , and insurance -- we have n't yet calculated maintenance , as well as replacing the tires every few years , and those cost start to add up . as you can see , the window sticker or television commercial might dangle an attractive purchase price or a monthly lease payment , but those `` big savings , '' as measured by real monthly cost , bring us back to reality . well , what about a lease ? common wisdom dictates that you buy an appreciating asset , but lease things that lose value over time . ",
        "that 's why many motorists acquire a lease on a new car every three years . not only does that provide the perk of driving a new whip on an ongoing basis , but the vehicle stays within a three-year warranty period the entire time -- so you avoid major repairs . in general , a lease is a form of ownership with a different name . that 's because the value of your lease is based on its pre-calculated depreciation cost -- the difference between the sales price and the set residual value at the end of the lease period . ",
        "truth be told , when you combine the amount of the lease down payment and the monthly lease checks , it often carries a cost that 's higher than the depreciation . it 's also more challenging to figure out if you 're getting a good deal on your car when signing a lease . the car dealer knows a lot more about a how a lease works than you do . haggle as much as you like over the base purchase price of the vehicle , but there are multiple aspects of a deal , including the down payment amount , residual value , return fees , and interest rates that can be complicated . ",
        "if you can get a bargain on a lease -- maybe because the dealership is trying to clear excess inventory of undesirable vehicles -- then take it ! otherwise , it 's worth considering an entirely new way to put a car in your driveway . but , you 'll be sacrificing a bit of flexibility for cheaper monthly payments . exiting a lease is n't easy , and you could be left paying the remaining payments on your lease plus early termination penalties if you ca n't find a person to take it over on a site for lease swapping . ",
        "if you change your mind about needing a car during your lease period , get ready for a big headache . it does n't have to be this way . imagine a world in which you never need to haggle with a salesperson or have to decipher a car purchase/lease agreement , entirely avoiding a trip to the car dealership -- and instead have your next car delivered to your home or office . and imagine a way to get a car that did n't require such a large upfront commitment . the fusion se is available from canvas for as low as $ 425 per month . ",
        "that subscription fee includes comprehensive insurance , all routine maintenance , a bumper-to-bumper warranty , tire wear and replacement , and roadside assistance . let 's compare that $ 425 per month to how much you would spend by plunking down a deposit for a new fusion se , taking a car loan , and making monthly payments for the next 60 months , or paying a large down payment and signing up for a 36 month `` ca n't break this contract '' lease . if that sounds good , then consider these other perks to a car subscription : avoiding a big down payment and instead utilize that money to invest in an asset that increases in value over time . ",
        "having the flexibility to choose a car that meets your needs on a month-by-month basis , rather than getting locked into the same vehicle for three to 10 years . never getting hit with a big repair bill , suffering the hassle of shopping for and installing new tires , or ever seeing a bill for insurance or registration . never having to worry about selling a car when you 're ready for a new one . going entirely car-free in months when you 're traveling or easily able to use ride-hailing or public transportation . this scenario is now possible with a car subscription . ",
        "the most frugal car buyer can still fire up a spreadsheet to calculate how to beat the odds regarding the total monthly cost of owning a car . but that task is not likely to overturn the laws of the car-buying universe . if you 're not looking for something flexible like canvas , then that 's cool too . we get it . if you 're the type of person that drives their car into the ground or if you want to commit to brand new car every three years through leasing , we understand . if you are looking for a subscription like canvas , you get something new , something unique , and something that can fit your lifestyle a lot better than any traditional form of car ownership can . ",
        "for the majority of drivers a monthly subscription model -- like how you pay for mobile phone service or cable television -- will save money compared to the traditional car purchase or lease . and when considering intangible factors , such as convenience , flexibility , and peace of mind , subscribing to a car -- rather than buying or leasing -- can very easily be the way of the future for many people . besides , all the hassle and heartache of cross-shopping , managing payments , insurance , repairs , and licensing are not what driving should be about . ",
        "it should be fun and freedom , which is what a car subscription offers . best of all , you can try it for a month to see how it affects your pocketbook and your sense of adventure . then you can decide if you want to go back to the old way of paying for your car , auto insurance , and repairs -- or if you 're ready for new and better alternative to car ownership .
