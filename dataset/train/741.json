        "electric vehicle numbers in the nelson-tasman region have trebled over the past year and that highly charged growth shows no sign of running out of juice . ministry of transport statistics reveal 150 electric vehicles are now registered in the nelson-tasman region , up from about 50 at the start of 2017 . the region also has one of the highest uptake rates of evs in the country per head of population at about 0.14 per cent , similar to the rate in wellington . auckland leads the table with more than 0.18 per cent . nationally , there are more than 6000 evs on the roads . ",
        "network tasman regulatory and commercial manager emma lanigan said factors in the nelson-tasman region likely to contribute to that uptake included high car ownership rates , a prevalence of off-street parking , commuting distances well suited to evs , consumer preferences and demographics . ev buyer damien taylor , of the car company nelson , said the popularity of electric vehicles was `` pretty much as we expected '' . `` demand is outstripping supply . '' second-hand imported evs had been on the company 's yards since december 2016 and accounted for about 2 per cent of sales , which tended to come in waves . ",
        "`` we could sell every one that we buy at the moment , '' taylor said . `` the last two i bought were sold before they got here . our biggest problem is getting them . '' the price of second-hand evs was `` competitive '' compared with petrol vehicles . the car company sold most evs for between $ 20,000 and $ 25,000 , taylor said . taylor said he was surprised by the level of interest in evs from retirees , who were looking to save money . `` the cost of running them is so low because they 're not doing big trips , it suits their lifestyle . '' ",
        "read more : aside from tyres and brake pads , servicing requirements were low . there was no oil or oil filter to change nor an exhaust system to maintain . `` the handling , it 's all the same ; you 're not compromising on anything . '' for people plugging in at home , taylor estimated it would cost $ 4 to $ 5 to `` fill up '' , depending on the person 's electricity tariff and model of vehicle . it was free for ev owners to use network tasman fast-charging stations at nelson , richmond and takaka . ",
        "some people used other methods . `` we 're selling a lot to takaka , to people off the grid using solar panels to charge them . '' taylor said he believed a recent ministry of transport prediction that evs could make up more than 40 per cent of the fleet -- 1.9 million vehicles -- by 2039-40 `` might be a bit light '' , tipping the growth would accelerate once the range of the vehicles improved . some would-be ev owners were concerned about the distance they could travel before the vehicle needed to be recharged , a phenomenon known as `` range anxiety '' . ",
        "a pure electric vehicle had a range of about 120 km with top-end models capable of 350 km , according to a website run by the energy efficiency and conservation authority , a government agency . in its november 2017 transport outlook : future state report , the ministry of transport says on average 95 per cent of daily travel is less than 120 km . taylor predicted a huge uptake globally for the next generation of the popular nissan leaf , which was likely to have an extended range . `` then we 'll see see the fourth generation , of course , '' he said . ",
        "`` we 're probably talking 2020-25 . they 'll just be on a par for range with petrol vehicles . '' network tasman installed a fast-charging station behind richmond library in mid-2016 . stations at nelson and takaka followed in january 2017 . all three are free to use . they are increasingly in high demand at times , resulting in queues . during 2017 , the number of users charging at the station behind richmond library climbed from about 60 a month in january to 250 in december . in that same period , the number of users at the takaka and nelson stations rose from about 30 a month to 125 and 180 respectively . ",
        "network tasman chief executive oliver kearney said the electricity distributor installed the charging stations as a `` community benefit '' . there were no plans as yet to charge users . nor were there plans for more stations . however , the warehouse aims to install a charging station outside its motueka store in february as part of a roll out across the country that started in invercargill . in addition , chargenet nz intends to have chargers operating at murchison , springs junction , havelock and blenheim in the first quarter of 2018 . kearney said network tasman was planning for a further climb in ev ownership across the region and the consequential demands on its network as more customers plugged into the grid to charge their cars . ",
        "`` if people come home and plug in on peak , it 's going to add to those peaks , '' he said . `` we are certainly planning for it . '' as part of its planning , network tasman aimed to this year bring out educational material for its customers on evs including information about peak times and electricity tariffs .   "
