        "verizon and the nfl signed a new $ 2 billion , five-year deal today . in it , verizon traded its previous status as the exclusive us wireless carrier for nfl games for the exclusive rights to livestream games to any device , whether a cell phone , a computer or a streaming device attached to a tv . the new deal kicks off in january 2018 , and brings the nfl playoffs to yahoo and yahoo sports . the key here is that the in-market games are available to anyone , regardless of carrier or service provider . verizon has the rights to stream these games through its oath properties , which apparently it sees as more valuable than restricting these games to its current , paying customers .
