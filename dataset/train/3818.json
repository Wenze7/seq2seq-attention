        "indianapolis -- denver broncos quarterback brock osweiler played like a relaxed reliever on thursday . he could n't have picked a better time . with paxton lynch inactive and trevor siemian out after two series , osweiler trotted onto the field , ran for one touchdown and threw for two more to lead the broncos past indianapolis 25-13 for their first road win of the season . `` i was just a little kid having fun tonight , '' osweiler said . `` that 's really what it was . i 've been on a little bit of a rollercoaster ride for about two years . ",
        "just to go out there , thursday night football , with my teammates , i was just having fun . `` the difference was obvious . osweiler played more like the guy denver took in the second round of the 2012 draft and the guy broncos fans remember filling in for the injured peyton manning during the 2015 super bowl season . he wound up 12 of 17 with 194 yards and no turnovers and ran for an 18-yard td , too . c. j. anderson ran 30 times for a season-high 158 yards . denver may need osweiler to keep playing this way a couple more times after siemian was diagnosed with a sprained left shoulder . ",
        "coach vance joseph could n't say whether he 'd have his starting quarterback against washington . if siemian ca n't go , osweiler may get another shot . `` he played with great poise , '' joseph said . `` he played great , clean football and it led to a win . `` that 's two wins in five days -- and the broncos ' first outside the mile high city since dec. . 4 , 2016 . the victory assures denver of avoiding its first winless season on the road since 1964 . but it sure was n't easy , and at times , it was downright rugged . ",
        "siemian was taken to the locker room after being driven into the ground by colts linebacker barkevious mingo late in the first quarter . a much scarier scene played out with 14:01 left in the second when denver linebacker deiontrez mount appeared to make helmet-to-helmet contact with colts tight end brandon williams on punt protection . williams was knocked over backward and stayed on the ground as trainers and doctors strap him to a backboard and removed his facemask . when williams was lifted onto a cart , his teammates came over to offer support . coach chuck pagano said williams had a concussion and had returned to the team 's training room after initially being taken to a local hospital . ",
        "`` we erred on the side of caution and , rightfully so , taking care of him , '' pagano said . `` but he 's back here , he 's doing well . `` indianapolis ' struggles continue , though . the colts have lost five straight , the longest skid in pagano 's six-year tenure , and will post their first losing season at home since 2011 . the game pretty much went as expected . jacoby brissett scored on a 7-yard run and adam vinatieri gave indy a 10-0 lead with a 45-yard field goal midway through the second quarter . ",
        "all indy could muster the rest of the night was a 39-yard field goal early in the third . osweiler , meanwhile , rallied the broncos . his touchdown run just before halftime made it 10-7 . he gave denver the lead with a 22-yard td pass to cody latimer with 4:16 left in the third and then added a 54-yard td strike to jeff heuerman to make it 22-13 following a 2-point conversion toss to latimer . `` we had a really good rhythm offensively and we were able to mix the run and the pass , '' osweiler said . ",
        "`` i was going to lay it all out there . `` key numbersbroncos : osweiler 's td pass to heuerman ended the team 's 18-game regular-season streak without a play of 50 more yards . ... emanuel sanders had seven catches for 68 yards and demaryius thomas had five catches for 69 yards . colts : brissett was 17 of 30 with 158 yards and was sacked once . ... indy had 228 yards in offense . ... t. y. hilton caught five passes for 41 yards . goredcolts running back frank gore added another milestone on a night it looked like he might not finish the game . ",
        "the 34-year-old running back left during the second quarter with a knee injury . but when he returned in the second half , he quickly became the second player in league history to post 1,000 yards from scrimmage in 12 consecutive seasons . only emmitt smith has more . injury reportbroncos : with the exception of siemian , denver stayed relatively healthy . the only other significant concern was an ankle injury that did n't allow sanders to finish the game . colts : in addition to williams , the colts lost right tackle denzelle good and linebackers jeremiah george and jon bostic in the second half .
