",
        "the whole renovation will cost $ 54 million , with $ 21 million coming from the city . the museum 's $ 33 million will be helped along by federal historic building tax credits and fundraising . the project has been in the works for years , with a group called protect volunteer park taking issue with the plan to expand the museum 's footprint , claiming it will disrupt the views and original vision of the olmsted park . by the end of the process , though , the group seemed resigned , with one spokesperson telling the seattle times it was a `` done deal .
