        "kia introduced a redesigned version of its forte compact sedan monday at the detroit auto show , as the brand seeks a turnaround after falling on hard times in the u. s. market . the korean automaker revealed the larger and more fuel-efficient 2019 kia forte with design inspiration from the company 's slickly designed stinger car , which popped onto the scene last year . while the forte was kia 's best-seller in the u. s. in 2017 , the model arrives amid gloomy conditions for compact cars . americans are flocking away from small cars and embracing crossovers and suvs -- a trend that has undermined kia , which staked its success on youthful passenger cars . ",
        "kia u. s. sales fell 8.6 % to 589,668 vehicles in 2017 . kia is hoping that the forte can break into the upper-echelon of passenger cars that are still faring well -- a small crowd dominated by the likes of the honda civic and toyota corolla . a 10 % jump in fuel economy could help . the redesigned forte gets an average of 35 miles per gallon in combined city-highway driving , up about 3 m. p.g. from the previous model . that fuel efficiency comes from a 2-liter engine with 147 horsepower . like several other models introduced at the show , the new forte is bigger than its predecessor . ",
        "it 's 3.2 inches longer , which is quite noticeable in automotive design , as well as a half-inch taller and 0.7 inches wider . in a notable safety advancement , the new forte has projection or full-led headlights that kia predicted would receive highest ratings from federal regulators and the insurance institute for highway safety . iihs has recently flagged poor headlights as a safety risk for many modern vehicles , pressuring automakers to make improvements . follow usa today reporter nathan bomey on twitter @nathanbomey .
