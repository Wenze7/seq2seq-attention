        "i wrote this piece early this year , before the elon musk twitter storm that led to the tesla battery installation a couple of days ago . it appeared in the latest edition of the stick , and given the chat around the battery installation , i thought it was worth re-sharing the piece , and thinking about the impact of these recent developments beyond the novelty . source : the australianon september 28 , 2016 , south australia was hit by a once-in-50-year storm . despite being a world-leader in integrating intermittent renewable energy generation into a constrained electricity grid , the state 's energy system was tested by the extreme weather event . ",
        "over 40 per cent of south australia 's energy is generated by wind and solar power , and there are no longer any coal-fired power stations operating in the state . the only back up power comes from the neighbouring state of victoria , heavily dependent on brown coal . unfortunately for south australia , and the advocates of renewable energy , the storm caused the state to lose all power . the statewide black out , which dragged on for days , was an unprecedented and catastrophic engineering failure . however , south australia 's failure should not be seen as the failure of the renewables transition . ",
        "instead , it is a prime opportunity to understand the delicate engineering challenge of integrating new , intermittent and asynchronous sources of power into ageing infrastructure reliant on conventional power generation . understanding what happened in south australia enables us to understand what is possible with today 's current technologies , and what truly stands in the way of a complete transition to a carbon neutral future . so what happened on that fateful wednesday afternoon ? according to the australian energy market operator 's final report into the events , south australia 's series of woes began with two tornadoes with gale force winds of 260km/hr knocking out three major transmission lines . ",
        "when a transmission line is damaged , it often short circuits . as a result of such a `` fault '' , the line almost immediately disconnects , protecting the rest of the system . almost . for a fraction of a second , the voltage dips in the grid , and it was these voltage dips that lead to the cascading failure of the system . typically , power generators -- whether wind , gas or otherwise -- are designed to `` ride-through '' a voltage dip , allowing them to continue to operate through a fault . however , unbeknownst to the aemo , responsible for operating energy markets and power systems , several wind farms in south australia had been set up with a protection feature limiting their tolerance for disturbances . ",
        "if the number of faults in a specified period of time exceeded a pre-set limit -- for instance , two faults in two minutes -- the safety mechanism activates and a wind turbine will either reduce its output , stop operating or disconnect from the network . strangely , this critical protection feature had been left out of all simulation models submitted to aemo , so the market operator had no idea that their wind turbines were vulnerable to disconnection due to voltage dips . the damage wrought by the weather caused six voltage dips to occur over a two minute period . ",
        "without warning , nine wind farms activated their protection features and 456mw , or almost a quarter of south australia 's energy demand , was lost from the system . the remainder of south australia 's generation was wind and `` slow responding thermal '' , and therefore unable to pick up the slack in time . instead , victoria , the neighbouring state , which was already providing 24 per cent of south australia 's electricity requirements at the time , began to compensate . during the seven seconds of power loss from the wind farms , the system began to draw significantly more electricity than the single interconnector between the two states could handle . ",
        "it was like trying to light a football field from a single powerpoint , blowing the proverbial fuse . the interconnector tripped , and australia 's fourth largest state became an `` electrical island '' . the entire population of 1.7 million was plunged into darkness . it was known as a black system event , and it took 13 days for the last of the remaining customers to have their power restored . south australia 's black system ushered in weeks of finger pointing and blame shifting among politicians , energy operators , pundits and consumers . conservative politicians blamed renewable energy , renewable energy purists blamed the market operators and the majority of the state and nation simply wanted the problem to be solved . ",
        "part of why the south australian example is so important is because it is tackling what is known within the industry as the `` energy trilemma '' . this is the tension between energy security , equity and environmental sustainability . as we move importantly and inevitably towards sustainability , there can be no question that energy security and equity will be tested . how they balance out is being watched very closely . from an engineer 's perspective , the focus is often squarely on reliability . the challenge of integrating intermittent renewable power generation sources into a system that has n't been designed for it means the energy supply is not always as resilient , and therefore , potentially less reliable . ",
        "this poses a significant political risk for leaders and often the argument for baseload coal and gas generation is offered as a solution . however , in this case , aemo found the operations of the gas generators had little to no material effect on the event , to the dismay of renewable energy opponents . yet a quarter of the state 's energy was coming from victoria , largely powered by brown coal . so although south australia may not have coal-fired power stations within its borders , it is still in some way dependent on their operation for baseload power . ",
        "the answer for the perfect mix of power generation is certainly not clear cut . what is clearer however , are the broader consequences of such an event and the potential loss if it is interpreted incorrectly . the lessons learnt from these massive engineering failures provide invaluable insight into how to design out a system 's weaknesses . technical industries rely heavily on learning from major incidents ; the oil and gas industry , for example , designed many safety systems from lessons learnt after piper alpha in 1988 and macondo in 2010 . the opportunity here to improve the system and avoid a similar incident in the future not only benefits south australia , but can also have a global impact . ",
        "by demonstrating how renewable sources of energy can be integrated into an ageing electricity grid , south australia is providing a blueprint for the energy transition globally . that is , if the interpretation of the event and the subsequent discussion remains true to the technical findings . unfortunately for engineers , the reality of the energy trilemma means that the technical solutions alone are not always enough , and run the risk of getting lost in posturing and agendas . the political and economic challenges are steep . tackling these requires moving away from blatant and dogmatic ideological approaches to a view that is committed to achieving the optimum balance of sustainability , affordability and reliability . ",
        "this may mean not turning of all fossil fuel powered generators tomorrow , but it also means not shying away from pushing for the carbon neutral future that we need to survive . for whether we like it or not , if we do n't get sustainability right , there may not be a world for us to live in where affordability and reliability matter at all . thanks for reading ! this is my first technical piece , so please share any thoughts / feedback / comments below ! ‚ù§ .
