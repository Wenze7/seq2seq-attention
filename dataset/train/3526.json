        "`` the best-known advocate of the was undoubtedly the rev. william gilpin ... who even mounted a mirror in his carriage , the better to enjoy ` a succession of high-coloured pictures ... continually gliding before the eye , ' which he likened to ` the visions of the imagination ; or the brilliant landscapes of a dream . ' '' in the late 18th and 19th centuries , connoisseurs of landscapes and travel made use of the claude glass , a foil-backed convex blackened mirror set in a small case or box . named after claude lorrain , `` the french painter who most perfectly harmonized classical architecture , leafy groves , and distant water , '' the claude glass reflected scenery for its user , who would examine , appreciate , or even sketch the landscape if deemed picturesque enough when seen in the mirror . ",
        "standing with their backs to the landscape that they wished to view , the bearer of the claude glass , the tourist , was then `` standing exactly away from that which they traveled to see . '' it is very easy , here , to make the connection between today 's instagram , facebook , or twitter user , those selfie-stick-carrying saps who inevitably stand directly in front of the landscape , structure , or artwork that the rest of us have come to admire , blocking the view . but upon the recollection that the claude glass is indeed a mirror , here we can discover another , perhaps less vexing connection : the very natural human desire to position one 's self within the landscape -- to confirm one 's existence in the world . ",
        "differences begin to emerge between these two behaviours when the photographic device is incorporated . a user of the claude glass might not admire the actual landscape , but would at least spend time with it , viewing it through a filtered version of reality , perhaps even taking time to trace its form on paper . the camera , however , allows viewers to walk away with a precise rendition , one that takes only seconds to create . when the operator of the camera positions themselves `` turned away from the lived experience '' and towards the lens of the camera -- that is , when they take a selfie -- the focus is no longer upon an admiration of the landscape . ",
        "instead , admiration is deflected onto the operator of the camera and the physical space they take up within the landscape ; the creator of the selfie begins to assert ownership over the geographic space . despite its complications , the photographic medium can provide a fascinating means by which to explore the landscapes in which we find ourselves . images created using traditional photographic film processes are only seen weeks , months , even years after they are developed ; the subject matter of the analogue photograph sometimes even changes dramatically or disappears in the space between the click of the shutter and a viewer gazing upon the photograph . ",
        "thus , the photograph shot using film is inextricably linked with geographic and emotional circumstances , a tangible representation of memory . photographing using analogue processes then allows us to project ourselves into the landscape and subsequently to see ourselves reflected back within it . the process of using film , then , is perhaps that which differentiates some artists ' photographic behaviours to those of the tourist . conscious of the fact that the photograph often stands for memory , we can create images with this fact in mind , placing the self within the landscape gently but deliberately , engaging with it rather than asserting ownership over it . ",
        "here , we send postcards to ourselves ; we think we know what will be waiting for us when we get home , but that which we find when we return is sheathed in the warm glow of memory . ren√© magritte , the master surrealist painter , said , `` we see as being outside ourselves , even though it is only a mental representation of what we experience on the inside . '' we may indeed , then , find encouragement in the form of the claude glass ; its mirrored surface reminds us that the behaviours of today might have more in common with the past than we think . ",
        "it has always been the human mind `` that made landscape out of mere geology and vegetation . '' the landscape , no matter how it is represented , will always contain the human subject and viewer , whether or not we are visible within the confines of the frame . photographs by the author . www . oliviajohnston . comphotographs by the author . www . oliviajohnston . comphotographs by the author . www . oliviajohnston . comwritten for unterwegs , an anthology that brings together artists and academics from around the world , illustrating how travel functions as a muse .
