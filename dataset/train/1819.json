        "detroit red wings captain henrik zetterberg has gone 21 games without a goal and probably has n't gone 24 hours without someone saying something complimentary about him . `` i would not doubt henrik zetterberg , '' red wings coach jeff blashill said recently about zetterberg 's goal slump . zetterberg , 37 , has n't scored since oct. . 18 , and his slump followed an impressive start in which he generated four goals and eight points in the opening seven games . he 's on a 47-point pace after finishing last season with 68 points . `` this is not the first time in his career he has gone through this stuff , '' blashill said . ",
        "`` six or seven years ago , the whole first half of the year , people doubted how much great hockey he had left . seven years later he 's had lots of great hockey . '' more : for islanders , defenseman nick leddy has entered ` elite ' conversation . more : seattle has go-ahead to file application for nhl expansion . zetterberg is considered one of the nhl 's premium leaders . the red wings ' 5-1 win against winnipeg on tuesday is an indication of that fact . zetterberg said the red wings embarrassed themselves in back-to-back losses against montreal , and everyone in the organization understood that zetterberg was demanding a better effort from everyone . ",
        "he was plus-4 , with one assist , in the winnipeg game . `` he has still been a good player , '' blashill said . `` obviously , we need him to produce . he wants to produce . but he 's still very good defensively . he still gets lots of minutes because of that . '' zetterberg is n't alone in his goal-scoring struggles this season . while scoring is up 8.7 % across the nhl , some notable players have inexplicably had trouble finding the net . nicklas backstrom , washington capitals : the center went 21 games without a goal before scoring wednesday against the chicago blackhawks . ",
        "backstrom scored 23 goals last season and has four this season . dustin byfuglien , winnipeg jets : the bullish defenseman with the powerful slap shot has scored 70 goals over the past four seasons , but he has no goals in 27 games this season . byfuglien does have 69 shots on net , though . his 15 assists put him on a pace for 45 , which would be a career-high . erik karlsson , ottawa senators : regarded as the league 's most dynamic offensive defenseman , karlsson owns one goal this season and has gone 13 games without scoring . ",
        "ottawa is 3-8-2 in those games . karlsson averaged 19 goals per season over the past four seasons . is he trying too hard to make something happen ? he is minus-7 over the past four games . brent burns , san jose sharks : burns scored thursday night to give him two goals in 27 games . that 's a six-goal pace for a defenseman who netted 29 goals last season and 27 goals the season before . his scoring falloff can be attributed primarily to poor puck luck . he still ranks eighth in the nhl with 106 shots on goal . ",
        "his 3.9 shots per game average is the same as last season . radim vrbata , florida panthers : a 20-goal scorer last season , vrbata has three goals and they all came in the same game . he has now gone 14 games without a goal .   "
