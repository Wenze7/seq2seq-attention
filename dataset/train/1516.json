        "each week brings a collection of new trailers for upcoming movies and tv shows . it 's never easy to find the right balance between properly introducing a new film and giving away too much . some trailers find that sweet spot and excite you in a way that even seeing the movie itself ca n't . you may never forget the feeling you had the first time you saw the trailer for star wars : the last jedi and realized how major a role luke skywalker would play in the film . then again , other times they miss the mark by a mile . ",
        "after all , you ca n't always make a terrible movie look good . is n't that right , the mummy ? gamespot revisited the year in trailers and found the best and worst from the worlds of film and tv . did your favorite make the cut or merit a place in the honorable mentions ? read on to find out and let us know what your most loved and hated trailers of the year were in the comments below ! best trailers10 . annihilationannihilation 's trailer is one that everyone should see . it sets up the plot of the movie , while giving away almost nothing . ",
        "after watching , you know natalie portman leads a team of armed women into an environmental disaster and runs into all kinds of bizarre creatures and dangers . without spoiling anything , the annihilation trailer has tempted audiences into its bizarre world . 9 . star wars : the last jedihow can you not include the first trailer for the last jedi ? this early look at episode viii set the stage for a massive battle between the light and dark sides of the force and reintroduced fans to jedi master luke skywalker . plus , it gave the world porgs ! ",
        "what 's not to love ? unless you hate porgs , in which case you may not have a soul . 8 . the shape of waterguillermo del toro 's other-worldly fairy tale captivated us right from the first shot . opening the door to this underwater tale reminiscent of the wizard of oz . this trailer showed the director going back to his dark fantasy roots with a narrator guiding us along with expertly cut visuals through a monotonous day in the life of our protagonist elisa -- this is up until the moment we 're hit with the reveal of a strange aquatic creature . ",
        "this trailer lured us in with its mysterious story and wonderful cast , and never let us go . 7 . avengers : infinity warfans have been waiting for the infinity war trailer since marvel first announced the movie in 2014 , and it certainly did n't disappoint . infinity war will bring together the avengers , the guardians of the galaxy , and almost every other major marvel hero in the mcu in order to take down thanos . this film is an epic undertaking , and the trailer manages to hit all the right parts without giving too much away . ",
        "and we hope marvel keeps it that way in the future trailers for this monumental film . 6 . crisis on earth-xnazis , evil doppelgangers , superheroes , and a wedding . the trailer for crisis on earth-x -- the 2017 crossover event featuring arrow , the flash , legends of tomorrow , and supergirl -- was the superhero team-up everyone needed in 2017 . when justice league let fans down , the cw superheroes picked up the slack with a trailer and event that was more than good enough for the big screen . 5 . the disaster artistthe first trailer for the disaster artist was the perfect tease . ",
        "it introduced the world to director tommy wiseau -- and james franco 's portrayal of him -- with the creation of one of the most iconic scenes in all of the room . oh hi , disaster artist ! 4 . dunkirkthe dunkirk teaser did n't show much , but it certainly left its mark . at this point of his career , nolan does n't need to show much to get us to buy a ticket . keeping the teaser at about one minute , dunkirk produces a bit of intensity , while giving slight callbacks to saving private ryan . ",
        "this teaser hit all the right buttons ; it offered little plot details , epic visuals , and a stunning conclusion . 3 . thor : ragnarokafter thor : the dark world , there was n't much excitement for a third installment . but marvel was determined to fix its asgardian hero . adding taika waititi to helm was the perfect move to change the tone and give a fresh face to the franchise . this trailer delivers on all the right notes -- including the perfect use of led zeppelin 's `` immigrant song . '' we 've seen this film a dozen times now , but this trailer still gives us chills . ",
        "2 . stranger things 2stranger things 2 was already one of the most anticipated shows of the year , which is why it has two trailers worthy of a spotlight . when its first trailer was built around michael jackson 's `` thriller , '' though , it became truly iconic . nothing sets the tone for halloween in the '80s more than michael jackson and ghostbusters costumes . the final trailer , though , removed the fun and silly feel of the `` thriller '' teaser , instead replacing it with the dread and terror all too common to the upside down . ",
        "1 . the crown season 2watching a period drama about the political rivalries , romance , and the rise of queen elizabeth may not sound too appealing to you . but trust us , this trailer for season 2 of the crown is exceptional . this trailer is epic because of its crisp visuals , but i = it 's unforgettable due to its seamless bond to the music and score . this succeeds as both an advertisement and a piece of art ; after watching the trailer , you want to watch this season , without having watched the first ! ",
        "honorable mentions : loganthe first look at logan set the appropriate tone for the r-rated extension of the x-men universe . with johnny cash 's cover of `` hurt '' providing the soundtrack , fans were introduced to a much older logan as he and xavier prepared for one final mission . marvel 's the punisherthe trailer for marvel 's the punisher did more for developing the character of frank castle than the entire second season of daredevil . in just two minutes , the first look at punisher 's standalone series dug deep into castle 's tortured past as it set the table for the carnage that was to come . ",
        "red sparrowthe trailer for red sparrow works so well because it gives fans who have been dying for a black widow spin-off in the marvel cinematic universe exactly what they want -- except with jennifer lawrence instead of scarlett johansson . the movie has yet to release , but first impressions are everything and red sparrow 's was great . black pantherthe visuals , music , and action take the best pieces of the mcu and make it feel new again . this is a trailer that prepares audiences to enter a very different piece of a well-known world and makes it feel like a truly unique adventure . ",
        "bonus points for including the revolution will not be televised . worst trailers : the avengers : infinity war fan reaction teaserthrow a rock at youtube , and you 'll hit a trailer reaction video . still , marvel piecing them together as a teaser for avengers : infinity war was not only an incredibly unoriginal thing to do but a grating choice as well . the mummywhile the first trailer for the mummy made it clear this was a tom cruise movie , it did n't explain how it was a mummy movie other than a brief look at the antagonist . ",
        "given that this was meant to kick off a new franchise of universal monster films , perhaps it should have made that a bit more clear . chipsthe trailer for chips , like the movie itself , leaves much to be desired . it shows that the film has little to do with the tv series it 's based on and , instead , is a collection of dirty jokes and explosions wrapped up in a cops on motorcycles story . while in the hands of some , that could be fun to watch , this first look promises nothing worth waiting for . ",
        "monster trucksthe trailer for monster trucks was about what you 'd expect from a movie where a friendly alien becomes one with a pickup truck . however , it did the film no favors in getting anyone excited . whether it was introducing 27-year-old actor lucas till as a high school student , how cartoony the creature looked , or the main character taking selfies with the alien , nothing about this trailer works .
