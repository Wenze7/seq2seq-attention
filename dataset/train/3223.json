        "as many as 2 million identities were stolen to leave fake comments in support of the fcc 's decision to kill net neutrality , according to the new york attorney general 's office . based on the 5,000 or so complaints filed with the office , some of the victims are senior citizens , some are minors , while some are already dead . `` this is a 13 year old child -- she did not post this comment , nor did anyone else in her household , '' a report filed by a new yorker said . a chicago resident who also filed a complaint called the fake comment made under their mother 's name `` sickening . '' ",
        "their mother passed away several years ago from cancer . while it 's still not clear how the identities were stolen , the attorney general 's office has at least figured out where the fake comments came from : new york , florida , texas and california produced 100,000 fake comments each . it has released the details of its investigation along with a letter from attorney general eric t. schneiderman criticizing the fcc 's decision move forward with its net neutrality vote . he 's urging the commission to postpone the vote , which is scheduled to take place today at 10:30 am eastern , and to help further his team 's investigation . ",
        "he wrote : `` millions of fake comments have corrupted the fcc public process -- including two million that stole the identities of real people , a crime under new york law . yet the fcc is moving full steam ahead with a vote based on this corrupted process , while refusing to cooperate with an investigation . as we 've told the fcc : moving forward with this vote would make a mockery of our public comment process and reward those who perpetrated this fraud to advance their own hidden agenda . the fcc must postpone this vote and work with us to get to the bottom of what happened . ",
        "`` schneiderman once called out the fcc for refusing to look into the issue . his office apparently requested for fcc 's records nine times between june and november , but it never received any concrete response . earlier this month , the commission finally agreed to cooperate with the new york attorney general , giving schneiderman 's team a way to finally start analyzing all the anti-net neutrality spam that flooded the commission 's website . this article originally appeared on engadget .
