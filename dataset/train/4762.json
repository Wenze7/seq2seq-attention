        "boston -- the pittsburgh steelers had their eyes on an afc championship game rematch with the new england patriots . there was just one problem -- the jacksonville jaguars . leading up to sunday 's game against jacksonville , steelers safety mike mitchell said `` we can play in hell , we can play them in haiti , we can play them in new england ... we 're gon na win . '' running back le'veon bell tweeted saturday night that he was looking forward to `` round 2s '' in two straight weeks , meaning the steelers would have a chance to avenge a regular season loss to the patriots after exacting revenge against jacksonville . ",
        "even head coach mike tomlin was guilty of looking ahead , saying in a november interview that he was looking forward to the playoff meeting between the steelers and patriots . then the jaguars left pittsburgh with a 45-42 win to set up a title game meeting with the patriots . steelers offensive lineman david decastro was not pleased following sunday 's loss . `` yeah , it 's embarrassing . it really is , man . it just blows my mind . beat us 30-9 . we played like crap , and we want to talk about new england ? ",
        ", '' decastro said , according to the pittsburgh post-gazette . `` i do n't know what to say about that . it 's just stupid . it 's just not what you do . you do n't need to give a team like that more bulletin board material . '' it 's safe to say the jaguars did n't forget , either . with the steelers falling short of their much-anticipated showdown in new england , the jaguars and patriots will play sunday at gillette stadium with a super bowl berth on the line .
