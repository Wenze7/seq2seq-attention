        "xbox one exclusive games will land on xbox game pass on the day they are released . this was announced by microsoft 's larry `` major nelson '' hryb earlier this morning . `` moving forward , we plan to release all new xbox one exclusive games from microsoft studios into xbox game pass on the same date as their global release , '' said hryb . `` this means that when sea of thieves launches on march 20 , it will be included in xbox game pass to all members . `` this plan to bring new games timed with their global release into xbox game pass not only includes announced titles like sea of thieves , state of decay 2 , and crackdown 3 but future unannounced games from microsoft studios including new iterations of our biggest xbox one exclusive franchises such as halo , forza and gears of war , on the same day they launch . '' ",
        "right now , xbox game pass is available for a monthly subscription fee of $ 9.99 . today 's announcement also revealed that six-month subscriptions will be sold for $ 59.99 at gamestop and other select retailers starting on march 20 . `` with the addition of more great games , new blockbuster releases and a new subscription offer , we are giving fans more choice and value in how they discover and enjoy games -- purchase games for their permanent library or play through xbox game pass for one low price , '' added hryb . this is certainly an interesting decision by microsoft . ",
        "one has to wonder if this will impact game sales in any significant way . after all , it would be cheaper for users to pay $ 120 a year than purchasing individual titles . on the other hand , knowing new xbox exclusives will be available on day one could incentivize more consumers to opt into the service . this venture certainly has both risks and rewards . i suppose we 'll find out how this venture pay off for microsoft by the end of the year . let us know what you like about geek by taking our survey .
