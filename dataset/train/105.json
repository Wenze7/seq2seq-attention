        "the weather is certainly cold , just as cold as the hot stove season for the baltimore oriolesafter a little excitement with the baltimore orioles listening to offers for manny machado , the hot stove season has gone cold . fortunately , that little holiday fun did n't pan out for the orioles or for any other teams . but , the off-season is still going and machado 's name is most likely on the lips of a few general managers . spring training is rapidly approaching with fewer than 45 days until pitchers and catchers report . hopefully , the stove can get hot again and the orioles are a team that could get it started . ",
        "so many holes to fillsince the orioles had nine players leave the team at the end of the 2017 season , there are several holes that could be filled . yes , some minor league players have been signed , but most do not have the caliber of play that the o 's need to compete in the al east . or the rest of the mlb for that matter . the orioles could field a team with the players they have . the numbers are there . but , even with jonathan schoop , manny machado , and chris davis on offense and defense , the team will not get many wins . ",
        "especially against the new york yankees or boston red sox . the orioles have money available to start signing now . they dropped significant salary when they let their free agents walk away . start with an easy signingalong with their serious need for quality pitchers and a right fielder , the orioles could use a veteran catcher . this should be an easy and inexpensive position to fill . as the 40-man roster sits , the catchers are caleb joseph , chance sisco , and austin wynns . sisco had his quick call-up in september , but wynns has not made any appearances at the major league level and played at the double-a level in 2017 . ",
        "all positions are important , but the catcher is the only player who can see the whole playing field at all times . a veteran can make a huge difference behind the dish . of course , the off-season is just as much of a game as the regular season , but the off-season game is run by money and front office staffs . the timing has to be right and the other options need to be discarded before a signing is made . someone has to rip off the band-aid and the orioles are the team to get it started .
