        "there is too much plastic in our ocean . if you asked your family and friends what they thought of the pollution in our ocean , i 'm sure they would all agree that it 's unacceptable , and rather devastating . but it 's hard to know how to help or what to do to make a difference , when the world is running quickly around you . lonely whale is trying to change that by making ocean activism more accessible . the organization is focused on creating conversations that help communities come together to make measurable impact . ",
        "most recently , lonely whale launched the #stopsucking campaign to challenge individuals , organizations , and even brands to refuse single-use plastic straws . as part of their strawless ocean initiative , the challenge has helped make the conversation louder than ever . we felt their mission was necessary , and wanted to help bring their courageous ideas to life . we want to help our communities raise awareness and also inspire others to take action through photography by putting together a special curated collection . now , it 's your chance to contribute your photos to create a curated collection of ocean-positive lifestyle choices .
