        "there are a lot of social , political , economic , and ecological unknowns going into 2018 . the future of art in the coming year , in contrast , is pretty much set in stone . visitors the world over have museum , biennial , and nonprofits ' advance programming to thank : the metropolitan museum of art , for instance , can schedule an exhibition as much as four years in advance . a lot of these exhibitions require years of planning . there are loans from other museums and private collectors to negotiate , wall text and catalogs to write , shipping to arrange , and , often must crucial of all , special funding to secure to make the exhibition possible . ",
        "in short , in an increasingly tumultuous world , culture remains the one constant . for anyone in need of reassurance , check out 10 of the most exciting exhibitions on the horizon and take heart . 1 . `` uprisings '' at the contemporary art university museum in mexico cityfeb . 24 -- july 29although this was planned well in advance , `` uprisings , '' a sweeping show curated by the star french art historian georges didi huberman feels awfully topical . ostensibly a highly theoretical show , the exhibition features documentation of literal revolt -- paintings , films , photographs , even engravings -- set within the largest public institution in mexico . ",
        "2 . `` the world of the fatimids '' at the aga khan museum in torontomarch 10 -- july 2the fatimid dynasty 's staggeringly sophisticated caliphate reached its peak in the 10th and 11th centuries . stretched along north africa and the middle east , its capital in what 's now cairo , egypt , fostered a boom in arts and sciences , eventually surpassing virtually any other contemporaneous civilization . the aga khan museum 's show will include an array of delicate , intricate objects that include ceramic lusterware , rock crystal , and ivory . 3 . `` painted in mexico , 1700-1790 '' at the met fifth avenue in new yorkapril 24 -- july 22in a show that first appeared at the los angeles county museum of art in 2017 as part of los angeles ' a `` pacific standard time : la/la , '' which explored latin american art throughout the city , this show , a collection of more than 100 artworks , will travel to new york 's metropolitan museum of art next year . ",
        "put in the context of the met 's prodigious collection of european masterworks of the same period , the show will take on a new importance as questions of colonialism , international exchange , and art history are put in stark and fascinating relief . 4 . gabriele münter at the louisiana museum in denmarkmay 3 -- aug. . 19it 's always nice to be genuinely surprised by an artist you know nothing about . given that very few people have ever heard of gabriele münter , let 's hope everyone else feels that way too . münter co-founded the influential expressionist group der blaue reiter with wassily kandinsky , franz marc , lyonel feininger , and others , but her oeuvre actually spanned numerous styles and periods . ",
        "with more than 130 works in total , this is one of the first exhibitions to reexamine one of the most influential , if not talented , artists of the 20th century . 5 . `` michel sittow : estonian painter at the courts of renaissance europe '' at the national gallery in washington , d. c.jan . 28 -- may 13people have the tendency to assume that celebrity is a contemporary phenomenon , but the success of michel sittow , an estonian artistic savant who was sought-after by european heads of state , proves that celebrity goes back a long way . ",
        "thirteen of the artist 's known paintings will be assembled alongside those of one of his contemporaries , juan de flandes , in the museum 's west building . 6 . sixteenth international architecture biennale in venicemay 26 -- nov. . 25for the past three decades , venice , italy , has hosted an international architecture exhibition in the giardini , and in its arsenale , a massive , ancient warehouse where biennial organizers install exhibitions by architects and artists . while the biennale can have its slightly wonky , academic side , there 's always a dazzling , spectacular component to the show , too : uncanny structures , unheard of materials materials , and new technologies are sure to make it a must-see . ",
        "plus , you 'll be in venice , so how bad can it be . 7 . `` the great spectacle : 250 years of the summer exhibition '' at the royal academy in londonjune 12 -- aug. . 19every summer for the past two and a half centuries , london 's royal academy of art has put on a rambling , blockbuster show that highlights work by british artists . historically there was so much art crowded onto the academy 's walls that it transcended a `` salon-style '' exhibition and came to resemble something closer to wallpaper . ",
        "to mark the 250-year anniversary of the summer exhibition , the ra has created a retrospective that marks the exhibition 's highlights , both historical and contemporary -- the show promises to run the gamut from joshua reynolds to wolfgang tillmans . 8 . `` daguerreotypes : five decades of collecting '' at the national portrait gallery in washington , d. c.june 15 , 2018 -- june 2 , 2019daguerreotypes were the precursor modern-day photography . the process , which was ubiquitous in the mid-19th century , involved exposing a treated silver plate to light through an early camera . ",
        "in 2018 , the national portrait gallery will have been collecting daguerreotypes for 50 years and has planned a large installation to commemorate the milestone . these are n't just fascinating artworks ; they 're also stunning chronicles of the birth of modernism . 9 . `` moriz nähr : photography and modernism '' at the leopold museum in viennaaug . 24 -- oct. . 29it 's hard to overstate the convulsive urban and social change that vienna was subjected to at the turn of the century . long the jewel in the crown of the hapsburg empire , its wedding-cake buildings and ornate cafes were subsidized in large part by the outlying `` crown lands , '' which , by 1900 , were beginning to make concerted efforts towards autonomy . ",
        "insulated as it was , vienna began to feel the effects of change : its city fortifications came down , the middle class grew , and it ever-so-slowly began to embrace technology and modernism . moriz nähr , a pioneer of the photographic medium , was appointed court photographer to the archduke franz ferdinand , and thus was on-hand to capture the changes from the highest levels . this will be a spectacular , not-to-miss exhibition of his oeuvre 's highlights . 10 . thirty-third são paulo biennial in são paulosept . 7 - dec. . 9generally considered one of the most important contemporary arts events in south america , the são paulo biennial has a history of combining unknown artists with the type of discourse that the international contemporary art world knows and loves . ",
        "set in locations throughout the city and in a massive modernist pavilion designed by oscar niemeyer , the biennial comes at a delicate time for art in brazil : earlier this year , protestors shut down an exhibit of queer art in the city of porto allegre because , protesters claimed , works by blue-chip artists such as lygia clark `` promoted pedophilia . '' how organizers of são paulo 's biennial tread an increasingly reactionary social line remains to be seen , but regardless , the show itself is not to be missed .   "
