        "after spending the holidays drinking heavily , eating with abandon , and focusing on celebration rather than health and wellness , many turn their attention to making healthier choices in january . as part of this process , many decide to stop drinking completely for a month , taking part in dry january , a 31-day commitment to staying sober . though it is not usually an easy choice for people who drink socially , it is impossible for those who are living with an alcohol use disorder . for families who are struggling due to a loved one 's use of or dependence on alcohol , dry january can be the challenge needed to identify a problem that requires treatment .

        "are you concerned that your family member is living with an alcohol use disorder like alcoholism ? here are some signs to look for : 1 . something is off . often , a simple gut feeling that things are not as they should be is the first indication that a loved one is struggling with alcoholism . you know that things are not as they should be , and there are a lot of issues when it comes to your loved one 's choices and behaviors that are not easily explained away or acceptable . 2 . they complain of illness or tend to sleep a lot . ",
        "alcohol is a toxin , and drinking heavily leads to physical illness . when someone is addicted to alcohol and levels of the substance in their system drop , they often experience withdrawal symptoms that are far worse than a mere hangover . this can look like illness or excessive time spent sleeping . 3 . they often disappear without a plausible reason . heading out to the store takes hours , or they often say they are `` working late '' and end up staying away from home far longer than is reasonable . they may also disappear for days at a time with no communication . ",
        "4 . they often appear to be out of it , silly , or surly without any discernible cause . acting inappropriately at family events , responding with angry outbursts without reason , or otherwise seeming unfocused while claiming to be fine can indicate a problem . 5 . you find things that do n't add up . charges you do n't recognize or cash gone out of the family bank account , stories that do n't appear to have any evidence to support them , or a lack of an ability to explain erratic behavior when occurring in combination with alcohol use can all mean a substance use disorder like alcoholism .
