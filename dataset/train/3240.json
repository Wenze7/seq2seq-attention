        "kamlesh nagarkoti of india u19 bowls . the india u19 team played exceptionally well and humbled australia in their opening encounter of the world cup at the bay oval in mount maunganui . the indian team stamped their authority on the game and hardly put a foot wrong . they dictated terms to jason sangha 's men with both bat and ball and emerged victorious by 100 runs . skipper prithvi shaw , manjot kalra and shubman gill batted exceedingly well to post a handsome total of 328 on the board . abhishek sharma played a quick-fire knock to propel india 's total . ",
        "during australia 's run-chase , the indian bowlers asserted themselves on the kangaroos . the likes of shivam mavi and kamlesh nagarkoti clocked over 140kmph on several occasions . they hurried the aussie batsmen into playing false strokes and nipped out three wickets each . moreover , they bowled enough dot deliveries which ensured that australia 's run-rate was kept in check . however , irfan pathan has asked the fans to not get overawed by the readings on the speedometer just yet . data-ad-client = `` ca-pub-7785168419440214 `` data-ad-slot = `` 6042301080 '' > he appreciated mavi and nagarkoti 's efforts but also mentioned the speed varies from country to country based on the technology used as well as the kind of pitch .

        "the baroda pacer also mentioned that beating the batsman 's outside edge is an important aspect of bowling . irfan 's tweet : he took to twitter and expressed his views . `` dont take away anything from these fantastic young india 19 blowers but do n't get hyped up with the speedometer . it doent stay the same . it all abt performing n beating the bat #under19worldcup #india '' after the thumping victory , shaw 's men will play their second game against papua new guinea on the 16th of january . having beaten australia , india are more or less assured of a berth in the quarter-finals barring any miracles in their upcoming games against png and zimbabwe . ",
        "meanwhile , the indians will look to replicate their form in the upcoming games and continue their rich vein of form . for the time being , the team looks strong in all departments and it wo n't be a surprise if they go deep into the tournament . the post indian pacer does n't want hype around the u19 bowlers appeared first on crictracker .
