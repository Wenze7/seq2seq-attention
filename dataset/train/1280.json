        "- joe arpaio , a former arizona sheriff and a close ally of president donald trump , said on tuesday he would run for the u. s. senate to replace retiring republican senator jeff flake . `` i am running for the u. s. senate from the great state of arizona , for one unwavering reason : to support the agenda and policies of president donald trump in his mission to make america great again , '' arpaio said on twitter . arpaio was convicted last july of criminal contempt in a racial profiling case that highlighted tensions over u. s. immigration policy , but was pardoned by trump the following month . ",
        "a federal judge had ruled that arpaio wilfully violated a 2011 injunction barring his officers from detaining latino drivers solely on the suspicion that they were in the county illegally . arpaio , who dubbed himself `` the toughest sheriff in america , '' lost a bid for re-election in arizona 's maricopa county in 2016 after 24 years in office . his tenure , including his tough stance on illegal immigration , drew notice from outside the county . he also reinstated chain gangs , made inmates wear uniforms that were pink or old-fashioned black and white stripes and forbade them coffee , salt and pepper .
