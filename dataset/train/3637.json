        "`` the proliferation of technology over the past several years has been a huge boon to companies fighting corruption , '' said business advisory firm bdo to digital journal . mining companies are using cloud data analytics to turn the tide against corruption . like every other industry , the mining sector is undergoing rapid digital transformation as companies race to streamline their operations . mining businesses are also approaching digital tech as a way to curb corruption and reduce their external dependencies . this allows them to address one of the industry 's biggest challenges using the opportunities presented by cloud services and analytical tools . ",
        "to learn more about how anti-corruption initiatives are benefitting from digital transformation , digital journal caught up with three leaders of bdo 's mining business . nina gross , leader of bdo 's global forensics practice at bdo usa , sean bredin , national mining leader for bdo canada , and jeff harfenist , the co-leader of bdo 's anti-corruption practice , contributed to the interview responses below . digital journal : what are the top corruption-related challenges facing mining today , and how are companies approaching the risks ? bdo : unfortunately , corruption continues to persist in mining today for many reasons . ",
        "the first has to do with location : mining companies often operate in very difficult regions and countries that are often more prone to corruption than others . then , there is the fact that the mining industry is not as heavily regulated as other natural resources sectors ; in fact , mining regulations are quite decentralized . another main driver of corruption is the industry 's dependency on the government for mining licenses and approvals . mining companies face exposure to many government touchpoints , which increases the risk of bribery and corruption . many mining companies are approaching these risks by finding ways to improve transparency with their key stakeholders , and ensure compliance with global human rights and environmental standards . ",
        "many are also strengthening their anti-corruption compliance programs by hiring and training more people , improving processes and procedures , and enlisting the help of technology . dj : how has digital transformation helped to mitigate these challenges ? bdo : while new technologies have transformed every aspect of mining , major advancements in data analytics has grandly revolutionized companies ' ability to detect and mitigate fraud and corruption risk . by incorporating advanced analytics , artificial intelligence , and the internet of things into existing systems , mining companies have been able to build powerful business intelligence and enterprise resource planning platforms to help them improve their overall corporate governance and make smarter predictions . ",
        "the cloud has also made these technologies much more accessible . whereas many organizations were unable or unwilling to use predicative analytics before because it required too much computing power , cloud solutions now let miners run tests for one or two months and pay just for the time used . dj : what are some examples of successful digital transformation efforts you have witnessed in mining ? bdo : one of our clients , barrick gold , recently underwent a companywide digital transformation initiative that touched on every aspect of its business -- from its mining sites to its toronto headquarters . ",
        "to aid its efforts , the company partnered with technology and consulting companies , including cisco and our team at bdo . play video -- > one of our main tasks was to help barrick gold improve the transparency of its investment data to maximize the value of its investment portfolio . to do this , we worked with the company 's investment management team to implement several reporting dashboards using tools like sql and microsoft powerbi . these dashboards are intended to be part of an investment-wide analytics hub designed to help employees benchmark the company 's internal and external investment projects , and to achieve greater efficiency , speed , and transparency in their overall tracking , reporting , analysis , and investment decision-making . ",
        "dj : what should mining companies consider when implementing new technologies ? are there additional challenges to be aware of ? bdo : mining companies looking to implement new technologies must be prepared to face many challenges and risks . most notably , companies must be cautious not to over-rely on technology to solve every problem . a major reason why many it projects fail is not due to a lack of technological tools , but a lack of subject matter experts who can work alongside it vendors to design platforms that will get the desired results . technology can only take an organization so far -- companies must continually invest in hiring and training smart professionals so that they can optimize the systems in place . ",
        "there is also the challenge of systems integration . any new technology introduced must integrate well with the company 's existing systems , or it is a moot point . finally , companies must ensure they have the proper cybersecurity and information governance frameworks in place to guard against potential cyberattacks and data breaches . dj : how can companies prepare themselves for emerging technologies , such as industry 4.0 , cloud and iot ? bdo : mining companies that want to take advantage of industry 4.0 and the associated emerging technologies and applications need to have a tailored action plan that clearly outlines the organization 's goals , stakeholders , and potential areas for failure . ",
        "as mentioned earlier , companies must also be extremely cognizant of cybersecurity , and the new security challenges that new technological systems , such as the iot , bring . as mining companies shift to connected operations , security must be embedded into products from design to distribution . an ideal cybersecurity program is one that focuses on proactive threat intelligence , detection , and rapid response . dj : what top corruption risks can mining companies expect to face in the next year , and how will technology help them respond ? bdo : mining companies can expect to continue to face many of the same corruption risks they are facing today in the year ahead . ",
        "political and administrative risks will continue to persist , as mining companies rely on government officials for mining license applications and approvals . nevertheless , the advancement and proliferation of technology over the past several years has been a huge boon to companies fighting corruption . advanced forensic data analytics can help organizations spot suspicious transactions , arising from anomalous data , as soon as they occur . it is expected that as the technology evolves , companies can use analytics not only to spot current anomalies , but envision potential problematic scenarios and act on predictive trends .
