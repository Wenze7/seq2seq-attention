        "the divisional round featured a matchup between the minnesota vikings and the new orleans saints . the vikings had the better record , home field advantage and the betting spread in their favor , but 60 percent of the public jumped on the drew brees bandwagon . the game was in the vikings favor for a good portion of the game , but new orleans would make a furious comeback late in the fourth . the game was hanging in the balance and the saints would take a lead with under a minute to go , but that 's when the next playoff miracle occurred : . ",
        "thanks to stefon diggs and his 61-yard touchdown as time expired , the vikings are now moving onto the nfc championship . a miracle ? yup . and for a certain gambler , the final play gave him the victory of a lifetime . talk about luck . he turned $ 5 into $ 11,000 . and he has diggs to thank for that . will he put that $ 11,000 on a vikings win ? with all the luck on his side , probably would n't be a bad idea .
