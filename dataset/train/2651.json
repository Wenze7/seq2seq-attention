        "by valerie volcovici and richard valdmanis - the trump administration 's decision last week to exempt florida from its national offshore drilling plan was based in part on the state 's argument that a spill would cripple its crucial tourism industry . but several other states opposed to oil and gas drilling off their coasts are similarly dependent on tourism , according to a reuters review of economic data - a fact that could make it hard for the administration to reject similar requests , and complicate its efforts to expand drilling . the interior department this month proposed opening up virtually all u. s. coastline to drillers as part of republican president donald trump 's plan to boost domestic energy production , leading the governors of every state along the atlantic and pacific seaboards - except maine and alaska - to object . ",
        "interior secretary ryan zinke said last tuesday , however , that he was removing florida from consideration after meeting with its republican governor , rick scott . that surprised officials in other states and prompted democratic lawmakers to accuse zinke of favoritism - a charge he has denied . it also disappointed the oil industry , which had been eager to drill in the region . `` for florida , we have to remember we are a tourism state . one out of every six jobs in our state is tied to tourism . so , i oppose offshore drilling , '' scott told fox news in an interview after the announcement . ",
        "` clearly unique'in announcing his decision , zinke said that `` florida is clearly unique '' and mentioned its recreation-centered coast . indeed , tourism is massive in florida . visitors to the state spent $ 111.7 billion there in 2016 , according to the state 's tourism marketing corporation , visit florida , accounting for about 12 percent of the state 's gross domestic product . but tourism makes up about 11 percent of the economy of neighboring georgia , 10 percent of the economies of south carolina and maine and nearly 7 percent of the economy of new jersey . ",
        "carolina 's republican governor , henry mcmaster , has said he is seeking an exemption from the drilling plan , while georgia 's republican governor , nathan deal , said he was concerned about drilling in coastal georgia . a spokeswoman for maine 's republican governor , paul lepage , said lepage generally supported trump 's efforts to expand domestic drilling but was still reviewing the offshore drilling proposal . in new jersey , governor-elect phil murphy , a democrat who takes office this week , has said he will fight drilling off the coast and called interior 's plan a `` ticking time bomb . '' ",
        "outgoing republican governor chris christie , a trump ally , is also `` steadfastly opposed , '' his spokesman , brian murray , said . most other states along the atlantic coast , like delaware , virginia , north carolina and new york , have tourist industries that contribute between 4 and 6 percent of their gdp . on the west coast , california 's tourism industry also contributes about 5 percent to the economy - but the full dollar figure exceeds florida 's at $ 126 billion , according to state tourism figures . zinke has said he will meet with every governor who has concerns about his offshore drilling proposal in a process that could take a year .
