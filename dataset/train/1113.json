        "how to reload , aim , look and equip attachmentsplayerunknown 's battlegrounds arrives on xbox one today , and with it comes a novel new control scheme . it takes some getting used to , so here 's the basics to get you started . inventorybattlegrounds is a fairly sophisticated tactical shooter and includes controls for leaning around corners and changing the range of your weapon . the controller maps were posted to the official xbox blog not long ago , but they do n't do a good job of actually telling you what 's going on . let 's start with picking up items and equipping attachments . ",
        "to grab something off the ground , simply walk up to it and point your reticle at it . press x and it enters your inventory . weapons will automatically equip to one of three slots , either primary weapon , secondary weapon or pistol . in the gallery below , i 've stumbled across a cache including an akm , a compensator and some ammunition . to pick them all up , just spam x while moving the cursor around . to load a weapon , hold down x. to switch between multiple weapons , hit y. attachmentsto equip an attachment , you 'll first need to go into your inventory by hitting the menu button . ",
        "once there , you 'll notice that the screen is divided into a series of vertical columns . the first column to the left is highlighted by default and represents the items on the ground . to move them from the ground to your personal inventory , hit the right shoulder button , then use the d-pad to scroll through and highlight individual items . just select the attachment you want and hit a , then a again to attach it . once you have more weapons in your inventory , this will be slightly more complicated . a red dot sight can fit onto a primary weapon , a secondary weapon or a pistol . ",
        "you 'll need to use the d-pad to select the correct weapon before hitting a to attach it . cycling through weapons , medical and throwablesto switch between your primary , secondary , pistol and melee weapons , use the y button . primary and secondary weapons are interchangeable . to replace a primary weapon with a weapon on the ground , equip your primary and then pick up the new gun . the old gun will fall to the ground . same goes for your secondary . the d-pad has a bunch of different functions . pushing up will equip your melee weapon . ",
        "pushing right will switch between different types of grenades . tapping down allows you to switch between medical supplies , while holding down uses them . left changes the firing mode of your current weapon . aiming and free-lookonce you have a ranged weapon , tap the left trigger to toggle into the aiming down sights mode . this will allow you to use your scope , if you have one equipped . up and down on the d-pad will adjust your range . once aiming down sights , hold down the left bumper to hold your breath . switch between first-person and third-person with the right bumper . ",
        "first-person is especially useful for close-in fighting inside buildings . that 's because in battlegrounds , bullets travel directly from a weapon 's muzzle . if the end of your rifle is tucked behind a windowsill , you 're not going to hit your target . switching to first-person perspective gives you a better idea if there 's anything blocking your shot . but playing in third-person has its advantages as well . if you hold the left trigger while in third-person mode , the camera will zoom in , and you will steady your aim slightly . clicking the left or right stick , whether you 're in first or third-person , allows you to lean left or right . ",
        "but in third-person , that also selects what shoulder you 're looking over when you zoom in . in third-person , when moving through tight hallways , it will be important to move the camera to the appropriate shoulder . done quickly , you 'll have a wider field of view as you round a corner and be able to see enemies before they see you . free-look , which allows you to point your gun in one direction and look in another , is accessed by holding down the right bumper and moving the right analog stick .
