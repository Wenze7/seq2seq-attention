        "a decision on spark therapeutics ' vision-restoring gene therapy , luxturna , was expected next month , but the food and drug administration decided an early ok was warranted following a unanimous recommendation by its advisory committee in october . the approval is a big breakthrough for patients and the company , but luxturna 's price could raise some eyebrows . a bit of backstoryluxturna is a gene therapy that can restore functional vision in 90 % of patients with biallelic rpe65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy . patients with this rare condition lose their vision because they fail to produce an adequate amount of rpe65 , a protein that 's critical to sight . ",
        "typically , patients with this genetic mutation lose their vision over time and many of these patients eventually become completely blind . there are approximately 1,000 to 2,000 patients in the u. s. with biallelic rpe65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy . a woman standing behind a girl who is getting her eyesight checked in an office . image source : getty images . luxturna restores functional vision in these patients by using an inactivated and naturally occurring adeno-associated virus to deliver a normal copy of the rpe65 gene directly to retinal cells . it 's both the first gene therapy to be approved for use in these patients and the only fda-approved treatment for this indication , so doctors and patients are likely to embrace it . ",
        "a pricey propositiongene therapies are incredibly complex and luxturna is no exception . the high cost of developing it for a small number of patients could result in its becoming one of the most expensive drugs on the planet . as of the time of this writing , spark therapeutics has n't disclosed pricing yet , but management told investors during its third-quarter earnings conference call that luxturna could hit the market with a one-time price that 's `` in excess of $ 1 million per patient . `` management based that price on `` reasonable assumptions '' of the direct costs that are incurred by these patients over their lifetime . ",
        "they may have a point . because luxturna is a one-and-done treatment , its high up-front cost may actually be a bargain over time , especially when you attach a value to the caregivers that patients often require . it should n't be ignored how this drug may improve patients ' quality of life , either . we 'll know soonluxturna 's approval validates spark therapeutics ' approach to gene therapy , and it could provide meaningful revenue that the company can use to fund its other research and development programs , including research on gene therapies for hemophilia patients . ",
        "the exact amount of revenue that luxturna generates will depend on pricing , the willingness of insurers to cover it , and how quickly treatment centers ramp up . management expects luxturna to be available in q1 2018 , so investors will want to keep an eye on second-quarter sales next year to see how they 're shaping up . industry analysts ' sales forecasts should be taken with a grain of salt because they often miss the mark , but consensus estimates pegs luxturna revenue at $ 75 million next year , before climbing into the hundreds of millions of dollars in 2019 . ",
        "if those estimates are anywhere near correct , then this approval is undeniably an important win for spark therapeutics . todd campbell has no position in any of the stocks mentioned . his clients may have positions in the companies mentioned . the motley fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned . the motley fool has a disclosure policy .
