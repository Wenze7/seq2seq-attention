        "every new year , lots of us resolve to lose weight . and every year , lots of us fail . the problem ? we go from eating too much food , much of it unhealthy , to eating very little of anything . but after starving ourselves for a while , many of us return to our old habits and regain the weight . this recipe for a korean grain bowl is built on healthy , filling ingredients -- whole grains and vegetable protein -- and some good fat . it 's a middle ground between empty calories and self-starvation . ",
        "in korea , this traditional rice dish is called bibimbap . usually it consists of white rice topped with meat , vegetables , a raw or cooked egg , a soy-based sauce and some chili paste -- all of it tossed together right before eating . my version swaps in a few healthier ingredients and increases the amount of veggies . instead of white rice , use your favorite whole grain , such as brown rice , wheat berries or quinoa . instead of meat , use tofu , a protein-rich bean curd that can be prepared to feature a satisfyingly `` meaty '' texture . ",
        "start with firm tofu , cut it into planks 1/3-inch thick , and weigh it down between paper towels for 20 minutes to remove excess moisture . miso sesame sauce , an all-purpose sauce for many items like sauteed fish and raw vegetables , makes this dish even more substantial . i encourage you to prepare your own , but if you do n't have time , just drizzle your bowl with low-sodium soy sauce . the vegetables specified here -- carrots , shiitakes and spinach -- could be replaced with vegetables of your choice . just be sure to pick from different-colored vegetable groups , which will deliver both nutritional and visual benefits . ",
        "but whatever else you might swap out or lose , do n't abandon the lightly fried egg . breaking the yolk and tossing it with the other ingredients adds a creamy coating to the grains . it 's the perfect finishing touch .   ",
