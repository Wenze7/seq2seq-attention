        "lake buena vista , fla. . -- j. d. martinez has a chance to see in person what his monster year is worth . the free-agent star who hit . 303 with 45 home runs was ready for a meet-and-greet session with teams at the winter meetings . the boston red sox wanted to see him , having hit the fewest homers in the majors last season . `` the only reason i think you have players talk to owners , presidents and general managers is there 's a request to really get to know the player , '' agent scott boras said wednesday . ",
        "`` they get to ask questions that they can never ask because they 're never in front of the player . `` st. louis added a power bat , swinging a deal for marlins outfielder marcell ozuna , a person familiar with the negotiations told the associated press . the move came just a few days after miami slugger giancarlo stanton turned down a trade to the cardinals . the bullpen carousel continued to turn , too . side-arming joe smith moved to the world series champion houston astros , who wanted a right-hander tough on righty hitters after luke gregerson went to st. louis . ",
        "seattle appeared to close in on juan nicasio , who led the national league with 76 appearances . the new york mets reached a deal with righty anthony swarzak , a person familiar with the talks told the ap . minnesota boosted its rotation -- for late 2018 , at the earliest . the twins agreed to a $ 10 million , two-year contract with former yankees righty michael pineda , who had tommy john surgery last july . martinez totaled 104 rbis and a 1.066 ops with detroit and arizona , and his season included a four-homer game for the diamondbacks . ",
        "the 30-year-old lives in florida and was going to hit the meetings before they end thursday . the red sox need power , a feeling heightened by the yankees completing a trade for stanton this week , less than a month after he won the nl mvp by leading with majors with 59 home runs and 132 rbis . ozuna joined stanton and second baseman dee gordon as all-stars traded by miami as new ceo derek jeter and the marlins cut payroll . `` ozuna is one of those names that you have to have great respect , especially as much we see him , '' cardinals manager mike matheny said . ",
        "an all-star the last two seasons , the 27-year-old ozuna set career bests this season with a . 312 average , 37 homers and 124 rbis . he is eligible for salary arbitration and likely will earn more than $ 10 million . the cardinals quickly found a bopper after stanton invoked his no-trade clause and blocked a deal . `` i was just very impressed the fact that we were involved in those conversations , '' matheny said . `` unfortunately , that did n't work , but i think that just kind of parlayed into , ok , now what are we going to do ? ",
        "`` ozuna 's acquisition could prompt the cardinals to make another trade , with outfielder stephen piscotty perhaps heading to oakland . while yu darvish and jake arrieta remain the top free-agent starters on the market , cc sabathia also is available . the 37-year-old lefty , who went 14-5 with a 3.69 era last season for the yankees , met this week with toronto . `` he 's a workhorse , man , '' blue jays manager john gibbons said . `` he 's always pitched well against us . one of the great competitors in the game for a number of years . ",
        "i thought he looked strong last year . `` sabathia has played since 2009 for the new york yankees , who would like him to remain . `` he 's been a great performer for us , and there may very well be a chance for us to continue working together . may not . it 's a business on both ends , '' yankees general manager brian cashman said . `` he 's certainly of interest , but because of who he is and what he continues to do , he 's of interest elsewhere , too .
