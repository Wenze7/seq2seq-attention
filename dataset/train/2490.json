        "at the end of this month in san jose , the united states figure skating championships will begin , to select the 2018 winter olympics in south korea . that 's exciting , but it will be nothing like it was 24 years ago when the team was being selected for the 1994 lillehammer olympics . for a trip back in time , back to an era when literally nothing was bigger than the drama in women 's figure skating , buy a ticket to `` i , tonya , '' a `` mockumentary '' that opens in theaters this week . ",
        "it 's fascinating . funny . bittersweet . and for those of us who lived it , covered it and will never forget it , the film is like stepping into a time machine . tonya harding versus nancy kerrigan on the ice was n't just the most compelling sports drama of its time . it was also a microcosm of life in america , as seen through the prism of the media . it was the precise moment when the 24-hour news cycle took a grip on american consciousness , the lines between reality and fiction began to be blurred and the world we currently live in was created . ",
        "the film is -- as stated at the beginning -- based on `` irony-free , wildly contradictory , totally true interviews , '' with tonya harding and her ex-husband jeff gillooly . harding is presented as a sympathetic character , physically and emotionally abused by first her mother and then her husband . her skating career was a constant battle of raw power over ingrained privilege , a fight to overcome prejudice and stereotypes through sheer force . harding was already on the downside of her career when she was caught up in astonishing drama with kerrigan . harding 's role -- though portrayed in the film as not much more than an unwitting bystander -- ended up derailing whatever was left of her ability to compete . ",
        "harding was never the most beautiful or graceful skater , but she was the most powerful . she did n't fit easily into the skating world , where theathletes are dainty and usually from supportive , financially stable families . harding sewed her own costumes , swore and smoked , married gillooly at a young age and fumed at her low scores from the judges . but when she was 20 , at the skating nationals in minneapolis , harding became the first american woman to land a triple axel , a difficult 3 1/2 rotation jump . the judges could no longer discount her and she became the national champion . ",
        "i was covering those national championships , executing my own intricate competition by managing to stay upright on the icy streets while seven months pregnant with my son . i was there because of the reigning national champion , a young woman from fremont named kristi yamaguchi . she finished with the silver medal and nancy kerrigan won bronze . but that moment belonged to harding . i 'll never forget the electricity in the arena when she landed the jump . boundaries were erased ; women 's figure skating was pushed forward . harding was simply a thrilled young athlete . ",
        "that was the pinnacle of her career . though she made the 1992 winter olympics team , in albertville , france , harding finished fourth , while yamaguchi won gold . harding did n't qualify for the world championships the next year and her career appeared to be over . but the olympics switched to a different rotation , putting the winter games on a different four-year schedule from the summer olympics . because the next olympics would be two years removed from albertville , harding had a second chance , when she would be 23 . with yamaguchi 's retirement , the battle for the top spot was clearly between harding and kerrigan . ",
        "and that 's when gillooly and his band of morons hatched a plan to attack kerrigan at the olympic trials in detroit . when kerrigan was injured -- whacked by a collapsible baton -- reporters actually wondered aloud , jokingly , if harding was somehow behind it . with kerrigan sidelined , harding won the competition and the top spot in the olympics . the next six weeks , leading up to lillehammer , were surreal , as media camped out in portland , ore. . -- where harding trained -- and skating was at the top of every newscast . ",
        "as one `` tabloid '' television reporter says in the film , he worked for a crappy show that `` legitimate news outlets looked down on and then became . '' gillooly became a verb . harding became loathed . the film omits some of the drama at the olympics . the midnight news conference the u. s. olympic committee called to announce it would let harding skate . the frenzy when she arrived . her first news conference , filled with 1,600 media members , when jere longman from the new york times opened with the question , `` you 've lied to us and to the fbi . ",
        "why should we believe anything you tell us about the nancy kerrigan case ? '' the first practice when kerrigan and harding skated together was standing room only for the media . i was there in the arena in hamar , norway , when we waited for harding to take the ice for her long program . the audience did n't know she was backstage struggling with her skate laces . when she finally took the ice , she popped a jump and burst into tears . she had her lace fixed , near a doorway directly below my seat . ",
        "she retook the ice and skated her full program , but without much sparkle . when she came off , her coach told her , `` what a brave kid . '' she finished an anticlimactic eighth , kerrigan won silver and ukrainian oksana baiul stole the show . a few months later , another kind of judge handed down a sentence to harding : three years ' probation , many fines and a ban from skating . the usoc later banned her for life . `` i was loved . i was hated , then i was just a punchline , '' harding says in the film . ",
        "in its closing moments , in a scene a few months after the olympics , a television screen showed o. j. simpson . the media beast had moved on . harding was just a strange piece of american history . ann killion is a san francisco chronicle columnist . email : akillion@sfchronicle . com twitter : @annkillion .
