        "image : justin sullivan / getty staffgood morning ! welcome to the morning shift , your roundup of the auto news you crave , all in one place every weekday morning . here are the important stories you need to know . 1st gear : more fixes , fewer buy backsthe dieselgate scandal will cost volkswagen billions of dollars , so of course it will work hard on finding fixes for its engines rather than resorting to strict buy backs , which is far costlier . back in february , we reported on everything we knew at the time about the 3.0-liter engine buy backs and repairs . ",
        "yesterday , volkswagen gained new approval to fix additional audis . the environmental protection agency and the california air resources board approved an emissions fix for 24,000 audis with the 3.0-liter v6 , reports reuters . from the story : the new approval covers 2014-2016 audi a6 quattro , a7 quattro , a8 , a8l and q5 diesel vehicles . the approved fix entails removing defeat device software that reduced emission control effectiveness and replacing certain hardware components . previously , regulators approved a fix for 38,000 other 3.0-liter diesels . in may , a u. s. district judge ruled that if volkswagen failed to obtain governmental approval for a fix , then it would be forced to offer owners buy backs . ",
        "it would have cost the german automaker about $ 4 billion . while that 's all happening , volkswagen is busy moving away from the scandal as quickly as it can by going electric for the future . hell , the next beetle could go electric . 2nd gear : and now onto fiat chrysler 's dieselsif you 'll kindly remember , the u. s. department of justice filed a civil lawsuit against fiat chrysler in may , alleging that it violated the clean air act by failing to disclose that it installed `` defeat devices '' on 3.0-liter diesel vehicles . ",
        "now , it looks like the two are in talks over a settlement . proposed settlement documents have been passed between vehicle owners , who also filed suits , and proposals were discussed with the justice department , carb and bosch gmbh , the german auto supplier , reports reuters . ken feinberg , the court settlement master , said in a hearing yesterday that all involved parties had `` a very healthy discussion on how we might get to yes . '' furthermore : `` we 're looking for different substantive ways to secure an early comprehensive settlement , '' feinberg said , adding a settlement could occur before testing on vehicles is completed in march . ",
        "`` everybody in good faith is certainly trying to figure out how we might achieve a comprehensive settlement . '' for what it 's worth , fca has denied any wrongdoing . it 's said that it never tried to cheat emissions regulations . 3rd gear : uber is now considered a taxi service in europeuber is no stranger to fighting legal battles with local taxi services and companies , which include claims regarding anti-competitiveness and labor disputes . because uber uses the gig economy , there are far fewer regulations and protections for its drivers . in europe , that may soon change . ",
        "today , the eu 's highest court declared that uber has to obey the region 's transportation rules , reports the new york times . the decision was reached after the court said uber operates more like a transportation service rather than a digital company . as a result , uber might not be allowed to let `` nonprofessional '' drivers drive people around . from the story : the case before the european court of justice centered on a complaint brought by a taxi group based in barcelona , spain . the group argued that it was unfair that uber did not have to adhere to the same rules it did while operating in the city , when uber ran a peer-to-peer service called uberpop , which linked nonprofessional drivers with riders . ",
        "in the decision , the court determined that uber , which connects drivers with riders through a smartphone app for payments , `` must be regarded as being inherently linked to a transport service . '' the 28 member countries in the european bloc will have to regulate `` the conditions under which such services are to be provided , '' the court added . this type of legal confusion also is n't really new to fast-changing business models that have boomed in recent years . it 's hard to regulate every single person or company that comes up with a new idea or practice . ",
        "it takes time for the legal system to first observe and then catch up . yet , with this new ruling , it shows that some of the chief complaints against uber will be addressed . 4th gear : subaru 's stock dropsjust yesterday , we found that subaru was caught letting uncertified staff carry out final inspections for new cars . they were doing it for decades . subaru said that it would be get better about that . today , there 's possibly a new mileage issue , which is definitely not helping subaru 's stock . subaru says that it 's now also looking into whether or not mileage readings were falsified during those final inspections , according to reuters . ",
        "this has driven its shares down about eight percent . from the story : some inspectors told investigators that mileage data had been altered on some sample vehicle models tested during final checks . subaru said it had not confirmed that any such fabrications had taken place . subaru shares fell as much as 8.5 percent to their lowest since july 2016 , before ending down 7 percent . the stock has given up almost 10 percent over the past two months amid the inspection scandal . hey , so , here 's a novel idea : why do n't companies just build the damn car without cutting corners ? ",
        "it would avoid all of this headache . 5th gear : laguna seca going back to what everyone already called itbesides in video games , the track to me was always just `` laguna seca , '' not `` mazda raceway laguna seca . '' maybe i was just lazy , but it does n't really matter anymore because the circuit is going back to being simply `` laguna seca . '' at the end of 2000 , mazda and monterey county , where the course is located , struck a naming deal . and as of april 1 , 2018 , it will no longer carry the mazda name , reports autoweek , which muses that perhaps recently falling sales had something to do with it . ",
        "a statement from mazda reads : `` after 17 seasons as the title sponsor for mazda raceway laguna seca , mazda has chosen to end its naming rights agreement with the storied race facility . we will continue to participate in key event weekends , as racing is a part of our dna . the relationship between mazda , the sports car racing association of the monterey peninsula and the county of monterey has been a wonderful one , and this decision was not reached easily . we wish the facility , the management team and the millions of fans who love the track as much as we do many more successful racing laps into the future . '' ",
        "anyway ! this affects nobody really and just makes saying the name of the circuit officially easier . reverse : yeah , elvis was pretty coolneutral : do you think uber will have the same fate here ? do you think uber will ever be forced to obey traditional taxi and transportation regulations here in the u. s. ? why or why not ?
