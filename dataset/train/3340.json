        "harvey weinstein , the ultimate impresario of the oscars campaign , has again reshaped the academy awards -- though in a way that he could hardly have anticipated while at the zenith of his power and influence . the allegations of sexual assault and harassment against weinstein sparked a #metoo movement that has removed others touched by the taint of misconduct from oscar contention this year . james franco , whose acclaimed portrayal of tommy wiseau in the disaster artist , was bypassed for a best actor nod -- he won at the golden globes and the critics ' choice awards -- amid allegations of sexual misconduct and exploitation . ",
        "similarly wiseau , who believed the 2004 cult classic that inspired the film was such a masterpiece that he screened the room in the window for oscar consideration , will see his academy awards dreams dashed . kevin spacey 's performance as john paul getty was erased from all the money in the world after actor anthony rapp accused the academy award-winning actor of making sexual advances when he was 14 years old . at the time , spacey said he was `` beyond horrified '' by rapp 's account , though some 14 others subsequently have come forward with allegations . ",
        "spacey 's eventual replacement in the role , christopher plummer , this morning received a nomination for best supporting actor , making director ridley scott , the film 's producers and sony 's risky and expensive decision to reshoot the film a good one . kate winslet may well have been overlooked for her award-winning performance in wonder wheel -- perhaps because of its association with director woody allen . the oscar-winning director is facing renewed allegations by daughter dylan farrow that he molested her in an attic when she was 7 , a charge he has repeatedly denied . ",
        "a growing list of actors , most recently colin firth , have expressed regret for working with allen . critical darling wind river was similarly snubbed , despite writer-director taylor sheridan 's steps to wrest his film from weinstein 's control . the weinstein company had acquired the film last august , but sheridan and the producers took it back , refusing to allow the profits from a movie -- which deals with sexual violence against women on a tribal reservation -- to flow to weinstein . weinstein has repeatedly denied sexual misconduct . he was expelled from the academy 's membership in october after an emergency meeting .
