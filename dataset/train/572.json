",
        "p/s ratioanother key metric to note is the price/sales ratio . this approach compares a given stock 's price to its total sales , where a lower reading is generally considered better . some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales , something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings . right now , apollo global management has a p/s ratio of about 2.6 . this is a bit lower than the s&p 500 average , which comes in at 3.4 x right now . also , as we can see in the chart below , this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years , suggesting some level of undervalued trading -- at least compared to historical norms .
