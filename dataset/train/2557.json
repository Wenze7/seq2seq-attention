",
        "`` it 's not where i want to be , '' she said of her recent form after hitting 12 double faults in her loss to the 19-year-old sabalenka . `` but i 'll just take away another match as part of the learning process and just keep going . `` unfortunately , now i 'll have time to practise over there . `` it was a mixed day for the tournament 's top seeds , with world no . 37 sorana cirstea the biggest casualty . the third seed was beaten 7-5 6-3 by 2015 hobart winner heather watson , who battled her way through qualifying and into the main draw .
