        "stock market breadth is displaying textbook bull market behavior . the stock market 's worst performers are picking up steam and joining the rally . long-time readers know that one of the few market `` indicators '' i have any use for involve internals or what the technicians call breadth . i do n't necessarily trade on it , but it informs my thinking about how strong or weak a price trend is . during an advance , you want to see more stocks going up than are going down , which is intuitive and not especially insightful . things get really interesting when the internals disobey the primary trend and leadership narrows down . ",
        "and by interesting i mean concerning . what we 've been seeing this winter has been textbook bull market behavior beneath the surface . the 52-week high list has been broadening , not narrowing , and highs are outpacing lows . some market observers have pointed out that the popularity of indexing and etfs may have blunted this particular indicator , but i do n't think we have any way of quantifying that , so i do n't focus too much on it . here 's oppenheimer 's ari wald : several important internal breadth indicators , like the nyse advance-decline line , are `` confirming '' the s&p 's rally and indicate broad-based participation , by our analysis . ",
        "we think this argues against a major top . and some charts , which you may click to embiggen ... josh here - tax reform has probably helped the internals , because sectors like energy , the refiners , the drillers and other ne'er do wells from 2017 finally got a lift . retailers were probably the most buoyed by tax reform as they currently pay the highest average tax rate of all industry groups . when the dogs of the year pick up a head of steam and join the broader advance into year-end , it 's not bearish .
