        "mothercare has warned it expects adjusted profits of just £ 1m - £ 5m this year after sales plummeted over christmas . the retailer , which sells pushchairs , car seats and baby clothes , said uk sales plummeted 11pc in the 12 weeks to december 30 . that was partly due to store closures but , even at those that remained open , sales dropped 7.2 pc . online sales , normally positive even at the most troubled of retailers , fell 6.9 pc . chief executive mark newton-jones said : `` as we signalled in november , there has been a softening in the uk market with lower footfall and website traffic resulting in lower spend in both stores and online . '' ",
        "mr newton-jones said mothercare avoided heavy discounts in the run up to christmas but that clearance sales towards the end of the period would knock its full year margins . he added : `` going forward , we are not anticipating any improvement in the short-term market conditions for the uk and on this basis the adjusted group profit for the year is likely to be in the range of £ 1-5m . '' mothercare reported `` challenging '' international trading , with sales down 3pc when adjusted for currency fluctuations , but said revenues in russia , its largest overseas market , and the middle east had returned to growth .
