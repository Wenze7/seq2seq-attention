        "zagreb , croatia mikaela shiffrin is officially the snow queen . the american slalom ski racer secured her seventh win in just 14 starts this season in croatia wednesday , dominating alpine skiing 's first major world cup event of 2018 . the 22-year-old scored her 38th world cup win and now has 1081 points in the overall world cup standings -- more than double the total of her nearest rival , germany 's viktoria rebensburg . shiffrin was handed the zagreb event 's traditional glass snow queen crown by croatian four-time olympic champion janica kostelic -- a true great she is already well on the way to emulating . ",
        "but unfortunately for shiffrin 's slalom rivals , complacency simply is n't on the cards . `` i 'm going to go back out there in the next days , train and race again , '' shiffrin told cnn alpine edge . `` i do n't feel like a snow queen , i just feel like another girl trying to ski fast . '' ` a race for second ` after straddling a gate last year in zagreb -- for once failing to make the podium -- this was a moment of redemption for shiffrin . she opened a huge lead of 1.41 seconds in her first run and extended her advantage to 1.59 seconds over wendy holdener of switzerland on croatia 's medvednica mountain . ",
        "frida hansdotter of sweden was a further 0.52 seconds back in third . such was shiffrin 's margin of dominance , austrian competitor bernadette schild told cnn sport it effectively felt like `` a race for second place . `` shiffrin , champion in this event in 2013 and 2015 , now has three snow queen crowns . `` i love racing here so i wanted to come back and have a little bit of redemption and ski aggressive , '' she said . `` i am feeling really good with my skiing . `` should the american maintain her red-hot form over the coming months , she could finish the season with a record points tally -- obliterating the current best mark of 2,414 set by retired slovenian tina maze . ",
        "`` i do n't know if i will ever be able to do that . it 's not really one of my goals , '' said shiffrin , who has made the podium in 23 of her past 24 slaloms . `` i also have so much respect for the season that tina maze had with so many points , it was incredible . `` there is a part of me that hopes that nobody ever beats that because she should really be remembered as one of the best ski racers of all time . `` the greatest ever ? ",
        "despite lindsey vonn 's stellar career with 78 world cup wins so far , shiffrin could become the most successful skier in us history , according to fellow american bode miller -- an olympic gold medallist and two-time world champion . `` i think she 's maybe the best ski racer i 've ever seen , male or female , '' said miller , who called an end to a glittering career in november 2017 . `` she 's so balanced , dynamic , intense and focused , so for me , i think she 's got a chance in any event she skis in . ",
        "`` the 40-year-old miller won six olympic medals across five games from 1998-2014 and says shiffrin could match his total in south korea if she competes in all five skiing disciplines . she already has one oiympic medal -- slalom gold from sochi in 2014 . `` i would say she has an outside shot at five medals , '' added miller . the upcoming winter olympics take place in pyeongchang , south korea , from february 9-25 2018 . but first for shiffrin and company is the next fis alpine ski world cup event in kranjska gora , slovenia from january 6-7 .
