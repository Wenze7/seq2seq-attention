",
        "`` event ridership is still a fraction of our overall ridership , '' said mark lonergan . `` it is focused on a unique purpose , and i think that 's what we 're seeing . '' now district leaders are looking for ways to boost ridership , including lowering fares for students -- a demographic that dropped in the last year . officials also say some of the loss may be due to the growing popularity of app-based ride shares , such as uber and lyft . now , rt is experimenting with micro-transit offering people in citrus heights point-to-point rides in an effort to compete .
