        "motherwell 's butcher clashes with glasgow 's mccormack in a scheduled eight-rounder on mtk global 's ` christmas cracker ' fight night on saturday . the scottish featherweight-title clash of stephen tiffney and lewis paulin tops the bill at the lagoon centre in paisley , while former british and commonwealth title challenger butcher kick-starts his bid for titles at 118 lbs as he fights at bantamweight for the first time on the undercard . `` moving up has just been stress free and it 's made training so enjoyable , '' said butcher . `` i have n't had to do any nasty stuff at the weight , so it 's a lot better for me up at bantamweight . ",
        "`` i 'm stepping up from super-flyweight and that makes it a bit easier on me to make weight . the size does n't bother me anyway because usually my sparring partners are much bigger boys . '' ` baby butch ' suffered points defeats to kevin satchell and charlie edwards when previously challenging for british and commonwealth titles at lower weight classes . but the former wbo european champion is confident that he will finally bag more belts at bantamweight in the new year once he gets over 23-year-old mccormack this weekend . `` i 'm looking forward to getting in there , finishing this year off on a high and building for the next one and hopefully i 'll get a title shot sorted , '' said butcher . ",
        "`` i still do n't believe i lost to kevin satchell - i thought i won it reasonably well on points - and the weight was a big part of my loss to charlie edwards because i was weight-drained , '' continued the 25-year-old . `` but charlie was in great condition and it was probably the best he 's boxed as a professional , so credit where it 's due . `` i believe i 'll be more comfortable up at bantamweight . i 'm still eating and drinking away during fight week . `` i 've already spoken with sam about next year and we 're looking at maybe getting a commonwealth title or maybe even a british title fight , so we 'll just wait and see , '' added butcher ahead of his bout , which will be one of nine fights on the mtk global card with a limited amount of tickets available at the door .
