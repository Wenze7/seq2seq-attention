        "top trends in commercial photography that every designer should know aboutwhether you 're an editorial designer who often works with photographic images , or an enthusiastic hobbyist photographer , it 's handy to have one eye on the biggest photography trends of 2018 . but what does it mean to be a photographer in 2018 ? once , it was at least in part a technical role , limited to those who could afford expensive equipment and had been trained to use it . nowadays , smartphone cameras are so advanced that anyone can take a half-decent picture without really trying . ",
        "with instagram and snapchat packed with enticing images from enthusiastic amateurs , today 's professional photographer has to find new ways to make their work distinctive and commercially desirable . here , we look at five broad photography trends -- and how they 've been harnessed in recent work by top design studios . 01 . simplified colour palettes w+k worked with photographer pierpaolo ferrari to create a series of striking and provocative ads for okcupid , a site that aims to redefine online datingit 's increasingly difficult to grab people 's attention , with more and more images appearing everywhere you look -- especially in digital environments . ",
        "one approach for achieving cut-through is by limiting your colour palette to only a few , clearly identifiable colours . this is a long established technique in composing product shots , but lately it 's been extended to a broader range of imagery . it can be seen , for example , in wieden & kennedy 's attention grabbing ads for dating site okcupid , huge inc 's bright and bold branding for payment platform zelle , and pentagram 's work for duvet brand buffy . 02 . greater authenticityauthentic images of real people are increasingly in demandgiven the ever-increasing blizzard of social media images , and set to the backdrop of fake news , audiences are quickly becoming sensitive to the difference between real and false . ",
        "the kind of posed , too-perfect , model shots that might have found approval in times past are increasingly looking dated , cheesy and irrelevant . photography today instead needs to capture realistic , identifiable people and scenes , if it 's to have any chance of making a connection with the public . and you can see countless commercial photographers doing so , from fashion magazines to website hero images to outdoor billboards and beyond . a great example of the trend can be seen in wonderers , a startup kidswear brand which use realistic shots of children 's lives to present a bold and positive aesthetic . ",
        "also see dn & co 's branding for ilford , which uses intimate black and white photography to captures the many faces of the town in a very human-centric campaign . it 's a similar approach , indeed , to that taken by pentagram in its work to promote hong kong 's landmark shopping district . 03 . diversity the corner 's campaign for jigsaw celebrated diversity in a positive , non-patronising wayin 2018 , a lack of diversity wo n't cut the mustard . photography needs to reflect the diversity of society in a natural , authentic manner that reflects how people really are , or it will stand out in all the wrong ways . ",
        "one of the best examples of the photography trend in action is the a17 campaign for jigsaw , masterminded by london agency the corner . this provocative series of posters combines an avowedly pro-immigration message with some beautifully arresting photography of some of the 45 nationalities employed by the company . this kind of imagery is nicely in line with the general direction that fashion advertising , in particular , in heading , with a study this year suggesting that fashion print ads are for the first time outperforming the runways themselves in terms of racial diversity . 04 . ",
        "original storytellingthis campaign for humanitarian group plan international tells the story of `` a collection that the world should n't need '' every picture tells a story , as the old saying goes . and in the 2010s the value of professional photography has become less about technical perfection and more about the ability to tell engaging , human tales . that may be through provocative means , such as the ` maternity wear for a 12-year-old ' campaign by hasan & partners for humanitarian group plan international , shot by meeri koutaniemi . or it might be more understated ; take for example , the campaign for art fair frieze new york by joe cole porter and photographer nicholas calcott . ",
        "this paid homage to the city 's most celebrated artists through their personal items ; a quiet but powerful approach . even mcdonald 's is getting in on the act : check out these artful posters created by tbwa \\ paris . featuring photography by helmut stelzenberger of stunning light sculptures , they convey the notion of late night opening in an subtly abstract but evocative manner . 05 . humourw + k london 's campaign for tk maxx highlights the world of bizarre yet brilliant opportunities opened up by the low-cost retailerhumour is another powerful way that photography can grab the attention and engage the senses on an instinctive level , especially when paired with a pithy tagline . ",
        "we 've seen this recently in the the award-winning burning stores campaign for burger king , which depicted a series of stores that have historically burned to the ground , with the tagline ` flame-grilled since 1954 ' . other examples of the trend include the ` pass the heinz ' billboard campaign by david miami , based on an idea by fictional ad exec don draper in tv show madmen ; and w+k london 's ridiculous possibilities campaign for tk maxx , which draws on a ` theatre of the absurd ' approach . related articles : how to make more money as a creative in 2018 10 huge graphic design trends to know for 20186 secrets to creating outstanding infographics .
