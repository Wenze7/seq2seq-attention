        "jupiter , the largest planet in our solar system , hides many secrets . some of its secrets have finally been revealed thanks to the data sent back from the juno spacecraft . scientists conducted new research , which reveals more about the red spot located on the planet , which turns out to be jupiter 's monster storm which has been raging at least since the first time it was observed in 1830 . furthermore , nasa says that the storm could have been active for 350 years . image source : youtube video screenshotthe juno spacecraft gathered data regarding the red spot on jupiter for the first time in july as it passed directly over it . ",
        "nasa revealed the data of the probe on monday at the american geophysical union fall meeting in new orleans , la. . according to the data from the juno spacecraft , jupiter 's monster storm moves far deeper below the clouds than researchers previously thought . nasa 's animated video of the red spot shows the upper atmosphere of the massive red spot and goes down into the depths . it was made from images from the junocam imager on the juno spacecraft , followed by some computer-generated animations . when the juno probe launched in 2011 , the main question that researchers were looking to answer was how deep are the giant red spot 's roots , and now this question has been partially answered . ",
        "the microwave radiometer on the spacecraft was used by the researchers to look into the spot . it revealed roots that go down 200 miles into its atmosphere . from the computer models , scientists tried to understand the storm , and found that it is about 1.3 times as wide as earth . thanks to the data regarding the depth of the storm , scientists know that no storm on earth has winds as fast as the great red spot , and that , as the mwr has revealed as much as it can , there is a possibility that the storm could be even deeper than the data reveals . ",
        "the juno probe orbited the planet , which is made mainly of ammonia , methane , and water . the spacecraft arrived in 2016 and orbits the planet every 53 days . the scientists are not sure what makes the giant red spot such a strong red color , because finding out which chemical reactions make the spot red is difficult , researchers said at monday 's meeting . the spacecraft gathered new information about the radiation around the gas giant . the jupiter energetic particle detector instrument found a new radiation zone which is quite close to the planet . ",
        "the zone is located above the atmosphere on the equator area of the planet and has a lot of energetic hydrogen , oxygen , and sulfur ions that move extremely fast , according to nasa . the juno spacecraft should complete 12 orbits of jupiter in total , and its ninth orbit is scheduled for dec. . 16 . similar to the cassini probe , which plunged into saturn 's atmosphere earlier this year , the same is to happen with the juno spacecraft . the animated video describing jupiter 's monster storm can be seen below . the post jupiter 's monster storm is 150-years old and 200-miles deep appeared first on valuewalk .
