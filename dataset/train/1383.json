        "atlanta -- riley ridley will not pick up the phone . calvin ridley refuses to make the first call . normally , the brothers speak every day , but the wide receivers -- alabama 's calvin , and georgia 's riley -- have n't communicated since their respective semifinal wins last week , and wo n't talk again until one is miserable , and one is ecstatic . `` we 're gon na wait until after the game to talk , '' riley said saturday . `` it 's coming between what we got going on now ... i do n't want to talk to him right now , and i do n't have to . ",
        "`` it 's a work week . '' separated by less than two years in age , calvin and riley grew up in fort lauderdale , fla. , first playing football as kids on the patio of their apartment building . at monarch high school , together they led their team to the state playoffs for its first time ever . calvin was the deep threat . riley was the possession receiver . calvin was a five-star recruit . riley was a four-star prospect . calvin was older , and faster . riley was younger , and bigger . calvin was the better route-runner . ",
        "riley was the better trash-talker . they worked in balance , and worked together for what they always wanted . `` this was always our dream , '' riley said . `` we 've always talked about these kinds of things , and to see them happen is crazy . '' in his third season at alabama , calvin has led the crimson tide in receiving each year , and already played in two national title games . the 6-foot-1 junior is expected to be the first receiver selected in this year 's nfl draft . riley , a sophomore , ranks sixth in receiving on georgia , and still seeks out his brother for advice . ",
        "`` he 's always been a role model to me , '' riley said . `` i always looked up to him . for him to be one of the top receivers in the country , and to have him as a resource , is a blessing . i just try and learn from him . `` to see him do these things now is remarkable . '' the receivers could have played together in tuscaloosa , but when alabama defensive coordinator kirby smart became the head coach at georgia , calvin recommended considering the bulldogs , partly so he would n't be in his older brother 's shadow . ",
        "atlanta -- it was a little over a year ago ... `` that 's what he wanted to do from the get go , '' calvin said . `` with kirby going over there , i said you should check it out . he said , ` i do n't know what to do . what do you think ? ' ... i said , ` make the best decision for you . ' '' riley 's decision created this beautiful , and difficult , scenario for their mother , kay daniels , who raised them , and their two other younger brothers , on her own . ",
        "she will likely be the only person in mercedes-benz stadium wearing a split jersey , featuring both schools . `` it 's really emotional right now for my mom to see her boys make it to this type of stage , '' riley said . `` she 's just overwhelmed . it 's been intense . '' each brother is rooting for the other , and hoping for their team to win . when the game is over , they will hug . finally , they will speak again . what will they say ? `` i 'm gon na ask him why he did n't call me , '' calvin said .
