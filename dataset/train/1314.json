        "seek substitutes if new zealand , as a country , can not recycle the over abundance of plastic that inundates us incessantly then we should not allow its importation . when materials for recycling become outlawed in asian cultures , with their seeming tolerance for pollution , we need to sit up and take note , because we will be stuck with that toxic waste . the new zealand government must make a stand that demands importers to sort their goods out . if it can not be recycled , find a substitute . an excellent example is the resilient papier mach√© containers now used for many small and large objects , where previously polystyrene or firm moulded plastics were used .

        "the potential for a full-on nationwide hemp industry with its associated jobs , would help overcome the problem , with strong fibrous by-products able to solve so many containment problems , and so much more . time to sort the mess out , and lets stop the plastics at the border while we still have half a chance . david russell invercargill enough , star wars if popular movies reflect our current times then i guess the latest star wars instalment is saying it 's all hopeless and the only way to have a fair society is to use magic .

        "i think hollywood should have made this most recent film the final one . every story must have an end and as jrr tolkien discovered when there is no future plot other than endless conflict and death then it 's time to stop . i mean if we want that story all we have to do is watch cnn . even star trek has given up on its message of hope by enlightenment and caring in favour of war and conflict and sadly our young people are engulfed in the same endless message in online games . i suppose star wars is just reflecting our overbearing punitive free-market military industrial complex instead of just being a space western as its original story was viewed .

        "today its role is looking like exporting americas message of might make right in a grim magical context . the fact is , for all its faults , the empire keeps order and it is just more sexy and better funded . i prefer the hitch-hikers guide to the galaxy where the galaxy is a humorous bureaucratic muddle and nobody is really in control of detail , people have flaws . . . oh and the ultimate question is the answer to life the universe and everything . or as some would say , the human condition . just sayin ' .

        "aaron nicholson manapouri bottled water a news item from the united states . the other day prompted me to comment . pure bore water is being sold for $ us8 a 2 litre bottle . just bore water , not liquid gold . must be so much better than the clear cool billions of it ; that are for free in this country . over the past couple of years our former government was hell bent on encouraging local bodies to give overseas companies unlimited supply of water just to bottle and export for very little cost . who will gain from such a woeful policy ?

        "jim fish invercargill abridged - editor religion the only thing john gullick said that makes any sense is that education is the enemy of organised religion . organised religion relies on ignorance to survive in a modern society . its no coincidence that it remains at its strongest in rural areas where levels of tertiary education are lowest . the other night i watched a story on the news showing gay couples in aussie marrying for the first time legally in thier own country . i distinctly remember thinking who could possibly have a problem with these people finally being about to openly show their love for each other - well i got my answer pretty quick - minister john gullick .
