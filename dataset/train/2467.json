        "imagine you 're living in the 1800 's . now imagine that you have terrible vision , and keep breaking your glasses . for your birthday in 1888 , you get a small box with a pair of glass lenses in it the size of your eyes . congratulations , you 've received the first pair of contact lenses ! that 's right , contacts have been around since the 1880 's . the idea was first illustrated by the great leonardo da vinci in 1508 , but it was n't until 1887 that german adolf fick developed the first working pair of lenses . ",
        "50 years later another german by the name of heinrich wohlk produced the first set of fully plastic lenses , and in 1949 the first lenses to only sit on the eyes cornea were released . from there , scientists and researchers tweaked and modified their own versions of contacts , thinner lenses , different materials , a concave design . now imagine having a pair of dimes in each eye and you get an idea for how thick contacts back then were . this and the flow of oxygen to the cornea proved to be the biggest problems of contacts .

        "when czech chemist otto wichterle developed the new type of plastic hydrogel in 1958 , ophthalmologists around the world used his new patent to develop better iterations of lenses . one of the first to do so was robert morrison , who began producing the first set of hydrogel soft lenses that could be molded to a specific eye . from there scientists and companies around the world began creating hydrogel soft lenses , improving upon the design and eventually allowing for overnight wear of contacts . in 1987 the introduction of disposable soft lenses rocked in the industry , causing a dramatic decrease in contact lens prices . ",
        "for the first time , people could buy contact lenses without having to worry about losing one and being forced to pay for a replacement . nine years later one day disposable lenses were introduced , making them even more available and affordable , with improvements to the design and material of lenses happening every year . in 2002 silicone hydrogel lenses were introduced to the market , which are what 90 % of contacts today are made out of . from a piece of glass that would sit over your eye , to personally molded silicone lenses , it 's amazing how fast contact lens technology has advanced since their debut in 1888 . ",
        "today it 's estimated that over 40 million north americans use contact lenses , with a global market revenue of over $ 12 billion . needless to say , contact lenses are extremely successful , and one of the most underrated inventions in recent history . sources : a brief history of contact lensesa history of contact lenses and moving timeline , from the contact lens manufacturers association . www . contactlenses . orga history of contact lenses | 1-800 contactswhen you think about contact lenses , you probably do n't picture wearing a bowl of water on your head , but strangely ... www .
