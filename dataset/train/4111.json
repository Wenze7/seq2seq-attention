        "wallets are becoming a thing of the past in china , it seems . from next year , the chinese will no longer have to worry about leaving their identity cards at home -- so long as they 're registered users on wechat . on monday , the guangzhou government in china released the country 's first batch of `` wechat identity cards . '' they 'll allow citizens to verify their identities through facial recognition technology , xinhua news agency reported tuesday . the programme is expected to launch across the country next month . the electronic identity card will function the same as a traditional identity card issued by the state . ",
        "verified users will be able to do anything that requires an identity card , including checking in at hotels and applying for government services , just by scanning their faces with their phones . their identities are authenticated through an artificial intelligence system . wechat is a social messaging platform similar to whatsapp and boasts 980 million registered users -- that 's the majority of china 's population of nearly 1.4 billion people . it 's owned by the country 's tech titan tencent , which became the first asian tech company to cross $ 500 billion in valuation last month . ",
        "the move is part of its efforts to get into the chinese government 's good books after it was investigated in august for alleged illegal content . wechat also has a mobile wallet service called wechat pay , which caters to the chinese people 's preference for cashless payments . applicants can opt to have their identities verified with facial recognition technology on the wechat app so their virtual identity cards can be authorised . the project is expected to improve accuracy in identifying people . ai can correctly authenticate identities with an error rate of just one percent while humans may be wrong 15 percent of the time , according to officer yan from the guangzhou public security bureau in nansha . ",
        "it also protects privacy and guards against identity theft . this is because data is encrypted and users no longer have to keep copies of their identity cards or have their personal information accessed by someone else , yan added . cnet has reached out to tencent for comment . now playing : watch this : apple explains face id on iphone x 2:35 tech enabled : cnet chronicles tech 's role in providing new kinds of accessibility . batteries not included : the cnet team reminds us why tech is cool .
