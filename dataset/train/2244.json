        "new york -- usa gymnastics announced monday that the leadership of its board of directors has resigned amid the continuing fallout over the scandal surrounding disgraced former team doctor larry nassar . dozens of athletes have accused nassar of sexual abuse , confronting the former doctor in court over several days of testimony during a sentencing hearing . the resignations announced monday include chairman paul parilla , vice chairman jay binder and treasurer bitsy kelley . `` we believe this step will allow us to more effectively move forward in implementing change within our organization , '' ceo kerry perry said in a statement . ",
        "`` as the board identifies its next chair and fills the vacant board positions , we remain focused on working every day to ensure that our culture , policies and actions reflect our commitment to those we serve . '' the organization says it is taking steps to promote athlete safety and prevent future abuse . the group came under fire after more than 100 athletes accused nassar of abusing them while he was team doctor . he has pleaded guilty to multiple charges of sexual assault and faces decades in prison . during nassar 's sentencing hearing , dozens of victims have delivered passionate statements in court about the abuse , including olympic gold medalist aly raisman , who denounced nassar in powerful remarks on friday . ",
        "`` you took advantage of our passions and our dreams , '' raisman said . `` i am here to face you , larry , so you can see i have regained my strength . that i am no longer a victim , i am a survivor . '' raisman , who detailed her abuse in an interview with `` 60 minutes '' last year , also criticized usa gymnastics in her statement friday . `` neither usa gymnastics nor the usoc have reached out to express sympathy or even offer support , '' she said . `` if over these many years , just one adult listened and had the courage and character to act , this tragedy could have been avoided . '' ",
        "gymnast mckayla maroney submitted a written statement about her abuse , which was read to the court on thursday . two-time olympic team member gabby douglas has also claimed abuse by nassar , as well as gymnast simone biles . nassar is already serving a 60-year sentence for child pornography .
