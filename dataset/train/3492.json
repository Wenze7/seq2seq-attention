        "as i compose this , digital currency bitcoin has hit yet another all-time high above $ 16 , 000 and is right now around $ 15,371 . bitcoin has experienced stunning gains so far this decade , and many experts are pondering -- could bitcoin possibly rise to $ 1 million ? fairly incredibly , with the present low being $ 15,371 , the record price marks a gain of $ 2,128 in under 24 hours -- a major move that opposed forecasts of a probable rectification because of steady overbought conditions over a great part of the last two weeks . ",
        "as indicated by price index , bitcoin has risen 9.63 percent in 24 hours , and 18.74 % in the course of the most recent 7 days . exchanging volumes have climbed somewhat over the most recent day , most strikingly on south korean trades . it 's important that , just one year ago , a bitcoin was worth $ 764 . the move to the present high means the cryptocurrency has gained 1,574 percent over that time span . bitcoin could easily extend the rally to $ 16,194 levels in the following couple of hours . in any case , while the speculator group is for the most part cheerful to see the digital currency heading for the moon , as shown by comments on social media , there is growing inconvenience with the pace of the ascent . ",
        "all things considered , today , the formula for a prominent technical correction is absent . history demonstrates that bitcoin , as a rule , suffers big sell-offs following confirmation of a bearish rsi disparity . in the past , bitcoin has suffered pullbacks when the rsi and stochastic turned lower from the overbought territory . over $ 1billion of investment into bitcoin-and-blockchain-organizations has occurred-bringing about a large number of organizations and a huge number of people-involved from around the world . could bitcoin rise to $ 1 million ? hypothetically , yes , in spite of the fact that considers what that would mean . ",
        "as of this writing , there are around 16.35 million bitcoins available for use . a cost of $ 1 million each would mean an aggregate estimation of $ 16.35 trillion for the majority of the bitcoins in existence . right now , the aggregate estimation of bitcoin is about $ 39 billion . then , the u. s. money supply , which incorporates all physical money , request deposits , investment accounts , and currency market accounts , is about $ 13.5 trillion . furthermore , this is only one nation 's money supply -- bitcoin , on the other hand , is a truly global currency . ",
        "truth be told , u. s. based transaction is one of the smaller sources of bitcoin volume . on account of that , consider that the global m2 money supply is evaluated to be about $ 68.7 trillion , expressed in u. s. dollars . a word of cautionbe that as it may , remember that any prediction of the future price of bitcoin is extremely theoretical right at this point . there are a lot of things that would need to go appropriate for bitcoin before a million-dollar valuation is possible , so remember that before deciding to put a considerable measure of your hard-earned money into the digital currency .
