'' china 's head coach massimiliano maddaloni said after the match . after a slow start to the game , qatar gragually came back to form . china suffered a blow in the 42nd minute as captain he chao was sent off after receiving a second yellow card . just two minutes later , qatar 's almoez ali beat the offside trap and leveled the score 1-1 with a header .
