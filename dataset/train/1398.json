        "pep guardiola does not expect philippe coutinho 's big-money move to barcelona to weaken liverpool when they host his manchester city on sunday . liverpool are undefeated in their last 17 games across all competitions , while premier league leaders city have won 20 and drawn the other two of their top-flight matches this season . they do have a significant anfield hoodoo to overcome , having last won at the famous merseyside ground in may 2003 , but the departure of influential playmaker coutinho for Â£ 142million earlier this week might offer grounds for encouragement . not , however , in the eyes of guardiola . ",
        "`` there is no doubt about the quality of coutinho , '' the former camp nou boss told reporters . `` i think barcelona have signed a top , top player who suits perfectly the way they want to play for the last 20 years . `` saying that , liverpool have resources . they can go to the market and jurgen knows exactly what he has to do with his team . liverpool remain a top , top team `` this season they played a lot of games without coutinho for many circumstances - injuries and other reasons . ",
        "always they were a good and stable team . `` that is not going to change my opinion about liverpool on sunday . `` guardiola is looking forward to his latest showdown against klopp , who he first faced during their respective spells in charge of bayern munich and borussia dortmund . even with coutinho out of the picture , the catalan knows the likes of mohamed salah , sadio mane and roberto firmino represent major threats to his side , who hold a 15-point advantage over manchester united at the premier league summit . `` i think that when our central defenders have the ball , salah , mane and firmino are going to go to take this kind of ball , '' he said , before acknowledging the potential impact of liverpool 's freshly minted club record signing , with whom city were also linked . ",
        "`` with van dijk now their build-up will be better , '' guardiola explained . `` of course , jurgen klopp is a master for the counter-attack . they are a team who , with three or four touches they arrive in the finishing area . `` when we lose the ball in dangerous positions we have to control salah and mane because they are so fast , so quick and so clever in the box . `` maybe now they do n't have the talent of coutinho in the middle but wijnaldum , emre can and lallana - these are guys who have energy and are strong . ",
        "they are good on set pieces `` i think liverpool play like liverpool was in the past , in all their history . their fans demand attacking football . `` defeat at anfield would still leave city as heavy favourites to collect a third premier league title in seven seasons , but guardiola had not started crunching numbers . `` i am not thinking about how many points left to be champion or how many games left to make a big crash , '' he added . `` i never spoke with the players , saying we need to win seven , eight or nine games to be champion or you have to drop so many games to not be champion . ",
        "`` liverpool , what they do , what we are and what we have to do to beat them - that is the point . always we will be judged on the results . `` in sports everything can happen . of course , we can lose the title because you never know what is going to happen in the next 13 or 14 games we have to play . `` it is simple like that . just focus on the next one - that is the best advice i can give to my players .
