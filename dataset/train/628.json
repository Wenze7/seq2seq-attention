        "a loss for the colts is nothing new and drops the team to 3-12 , essentially locking up a top three selection for the team in april . if the new york giants manage to win sunday against the arizona cardinals -- or pick up a win in week 17 coupled with a colts loss -- indianapolis would move into control of the no . 2 overall pick . but even though it was an important victory for the ravens , it was n't the smoothest one on a sloppy , rainy night in baltimore . here are six things we learned from the saturday special : . ",
        "1 . the ravens need to finish drives . that 's a lot of controlling the ball , getting first downs , but not finishing with touchdowns that would 've given the ravens a comfortable lead that could 've put the colts well out of reach . 2 . joe flacco is getting back to playoff joe flacco form . through the first 11 games of the season , flacco had nine touchdown passes and 11 interceptions . in his last four games , he has seven touchdowns and just one interception . he completed 29 of 38 passes for 237 yards with two touchdowns and no picks saturday to efficiently lead the ravens down the field on several long , ball-control drives . ",
        "flacco avoided mistakes and made plays in the red zone when they were there . it was n't a prolific day and it was n't a tough defense to go against , but it continued an upward trend for the quarterback and that 's good news for the ravens if the team hopes to do damage in the playoffs . 3 . frank gore is still a tank . he also scored a 14-yard touchdown on a screen pass -- the 100th touchdown of his career , including both regular season and postseason scores . if gore can get 74 yards in week 17 , he 'll be the fifth player in nfl history to cross 14,000 rushing yards in a career . ",
        "if he does n't get it next week , there 's always a chance he 'll come back for another go in 2018 . most running backs slow down around 30 . frank gore is not most running backs . 4 . michael campanaro plays the circle game . or at least that 's what i got out of his touchdown celebration in the second quarter . for the uninitiated , the circle game was made popular by the tv show malcolm in the middle . if you 're unfortunate enough to look at someone making a circle below their waist like campanaro made , it means you get a punch on the arm . ",
        "he got us , i guess . 5 . special teams were a roller coaster . baltimore typically wins on special teams . that 's not surprising considering it 's a team with a former special teams coordinator as a head coach and the only team that has a kicking coach . it manifested early when the ravens blocked a first quarter field goal attempt for adam vinatieri : . but things went the opposite direction for the ravens when a punt attempt for sam koch in the fourth quarter was blocked , setting up the colts with a chance to tie or win in the final minutes . ",
        "6 . the ravens are going to the playoffs . it 's not official yet and baltimore ca n't clinch sunday , but it would take a wild scenario to keep the ravens out . a win next week over the cincinnati bengals would lock up a spot , but the titans or bills slipping up in the last two weeks could do that work for the ravens . tennessee finishes the season with back-to-back games , but neither are easy with matchups against the playoff-bound rams and jaguars up next . buffalo 's path is n't much easier with road games against the patriots and dolphins .
