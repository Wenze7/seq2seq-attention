        "prince edward island by now , demolition of two 19th-century homes on water street is underway and most islanders agree that the houses outstayed their welcome . last week , the heritage committee approved an application for the demolition of 177 and 179 water st. neither building is designated a heritage property and the dates of construction are unknown , but they are both believed to pre-date 1900 . readers on the cbc facebook page weighed in on whether or not the homes should be saved . history not worth saving several readers noted the state of the houses , saying their age does not necessarily mean they 're worth saving . ",
        "`` disgusting old houses that cost a fortune to maintain . restore and maintain homes like fairmont , beaconsfield or fanningbank . not a couple dilapidated townhouses , '' daniel morgan said . cee elgin wood agreed , adding the homes themselves were not well built to begin with . `` you could build a replica for half the price of restoration , '' wood said . hoping for quick redevelopment `` not every old building has retained its historic value over the years , '' said pam doyle , adding she hopes the property will be quickly redeveloped . ",
        "`` too often demolition takes place then the lot sits in limbo , usually because the owner is more concerned with profit margins than the quick redevelopment of the area . '' dwayne robbie added that he would like to see the city of charlottetown impose a minimum redevelopment time limit in high demand areas like the property on water street . `` there needs to be some type of reasonable regulations in place so that people do n't buy up properties , run them into the ground , and then leave these valuable city lots sitting unused . '' ",
        "` difficult yet appropriate decision ' but not everyone was happy to see the houses go . `` sad . we have no sense , '' janice nicolle said . meaghan younker called it , `` a difficult yet appropriate decision , '' but said that some new townhouses would make a nice addition to the street . more p. e.i. news | changes coming to er response to sexual assault on pei more p. e.i. news | pc mla questions whether health pei meetings are open to public .
