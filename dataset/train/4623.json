        "paint with water books were the lazy kid 's art form of choice . especially me , a kid who could barely branch out beyond stick figures . i considered it art when i stuck a sticker to the back of my hand . give me a dixie cup filled with tap water and a flimsy paint brush with plastic bristles . break out the newspapers and spread them out across the dining room table . i was about to paint another masterpiece . the inky and pulpy-smelling books were a staple of rainy day activities in the 1980s . ",
        "they were sort of like the wacky cousin of invisible ink and magic markers . it was like coloring without the hand cramps and stubby crayons . the books were an entire industry featuring popular cartoon characters like he-man and bugs bunny , sitting in stacks on display at the pharmacy . they were always kept near the back near the magazines , in a strategic and desperate attempt to distract kids away from the blood pressure cuff machine . god , that thing was fun . the allure of paint with water books is simple enough to understand . ",
        "it allowed me to play with water while requiring as little creativity as possible . that was exactly the sort of winning combination i was looking for in my playtime . i craved sheer idiocy in all of its delightful forms . i wanted to melt my brain in a mass of goo playing video games . i wanted to gobble snack cakes from a feeding bag without having to chew . i wanted to play with matches and run with scissors and touch the dog while she was eating . i wanted to wet the paper and make it pretty colors . ",
        "there were a lot of theories about how the painting with water books worked , including accusations of wizardry . the pages were coated with dried pixilated ink dots , which bled together when dabbed with water . special note to parents : the ink was non-toxic and non-staining -- - totally safe for when your kids figured out licking the pages worked just as well . in fact , this was one of the avant-garde methods . other boundary-pushing methods included spitting on the paper . i bet pee would have worked , too , but that would be the kind of thing your parents sent you to a psychiatrist about . ",
        "one rainy saturday afternoon , i upped my game . i revolutionized the sport . i did n't even need to waste time laboring away with a paintbrush . i could just stick that bad boy directly underneath the kitchen sink faucet . painting completed in one second . as the kids today might say , `` donezo . '' or as i might have said back then , `` mom i 'm done , can i have another snack cake now ? '' kids today have no idea what they 're missing . we had painting with water , pac-man , and those rusty merry-go-round things on playgrounds . ",
        "one time i heard a rumor about a kid who got sucked underneath the rusty merry-go-round thing and got shredded to chunks . kids today do n't have to worry about getting minced up by sketchy playground equipment . kids today probably do n't even need tetanus shots . but hell , they were lifesavers for us . getting gashed by a nail was a badge of honor on certain jungle gyms . all kids today do is stare at little glowing screens , playing little games that they downloaded from an app library of millions . gazillions . you know how many nintendo games i had as a kid ? ",
        "fourteen . and it took about eight agonizing christmases to get that many . you know what you ca n't do with an ipad ? spread water all over it in a manic state of little debbie-induced hyper-psychosis while humming the theme song to < em > muppet babies < / em > backwards . adhd was way more fun than an ipad . you know what muppet babies sounds like backwards ? satanism . remarkably , paint with water books still exist today -- - in the same way that radio shack and fun dip candy still exist -- - hollow shells of their former glory . ",
        "everyone knows fun dip in the '80s was way more potent and possibly cut with glitter . it was the good shit . likewise , modern paint with water books are now only the generic kind in the flickery area of the dollar store , where that weird-looking man is standing intently studying the dusty boxes of mrs. freshley 's cupcakes . back in the 1980s , there were entire psas about that section of the dollar store . also , mrs. freshley is no little debbie . after about an hour of suffering and slaving over my masterpiece , i would be finished . ",
        "or maybe it would be more like eight minutes , which feels like an hour to a six-year-old hopped up on cosmic brownies . careful with the cosmic ones . those rainbow sprinkles are crazy , man . i stood back to get a good look at my hard work . the paper would be soggy and lumpy , and the colors would be a smeary , unicorn-vomit mess . whatever . it 's the journey not the destination . i wanted to be fawned over . i wanted to be adored . i wanted to be a dinosaur because that would be awesome . ",
        "so mom , display my picture proudly on the fridge . do it . do it . in a prominent spot . move over report card . move over school picture . move over free calendar from the auto parts store . i had just completed another van gogh . and now i 'm going to go drink a coke , pound down some pop rocks , and cut off my ear .
