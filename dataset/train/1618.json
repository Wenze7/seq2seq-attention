        "at ces this year , we 've seen quite a few companies unveil new headphones , but if you 're after something that 's a little bit more premium , you might be interested to learn that bang & olufsen have not disappointed and at ces 2018 , they have announced two new pairs of wireless headphones . these headphones are n't new per se , but rather they are improvements over existing models . this includes the beoplay h8i and the beoplay h9i , both of which are an upgrade over the beoplay h8 and h9 respectively . some of the improvements made to the headphones include slimmer ear cushion design , reshaped mono arm , larger aluminum discs , improved sound , improved active noise cancellation , improved battery life , and so on . ",
        "for example the battery life on the h9i has been bumped to 18 hours , which is a 4 hour increase over its predecessor . as for the h8i , bang & olufsen are boasting playtime of up to 30 hours , which is an increase of more than 100 % . while both headphones are clearly different from each other , one of the main differences is how they sit on your ears . the beoplay h8i is a pair of on-ear headphones , meaning that the cups rest on top of your ears . the beoplay h9i are a pair of over-ear headphones , which means that the cups will cover your ears , providing you with a tighter seal , which in turn helps with sound isolation . ",
        "in terms of pricing , both headphones will be released on the 25th of january and will be priced at $ 399 for the beoplay h8i , and $ 499 for the beoplay h9i .   "
