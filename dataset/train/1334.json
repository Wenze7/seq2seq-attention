        "doug jones ' victory in alabama : the key moments 02:00 doug jones ' victory over roy moore on tuesday came in a state that voted overwhelmingly for republican donald trump last year . the charts below show results from exit polls of more than 2,300 voters in tuesday 's election -- and they help show the makeup and thoughts of the people who decided to send jones to washington . party identification nearly all self-identifying democrats -- 98 % -- voted for their party 's guy , jones , and just more than half of independents picked him . ",
        "but jones also received a slice of support from republicans -- 8 % of them crossed party lines to vote for him . in a race where more republicans appeared to vote than democrats , jones benefited from his edge with independents and the support he chipped from moore 's party . age younger voters generally went for jones -- 61 % to 38 % . older ones favored moore . although the older crowd voted in greater numbers , jones ' margin of support with younger voters was larger than what moore pulled from older ones . race a majority of polled voters -- two in three -- were white . ",
        "and about 68 % of those white voters went for moore . but jones made up for that deficit by dominating the black vote . of the 29 % respondents who were black , nearly all said they went with jones . gender and race women made up a slight majority of voters , and most of them voted for jones . most men went for moore . so we 've established that jones enjoyed an advantage among black voters generally , and women voters generally . where jones really separated himself was among black women . while a majority of women overall voted for jones , nearly two-thirds of white women voted for moore . ",
        "by contrast , nearly every black woman voter who was queried in exit polls said she voted for jones . a vast majority of black men also went for jones . education most voters had at least some college education , if not a degree . among those who have at least graduated from college , jones fared better . the scandal moore has been accused of pursuing sexual relationships with teenage girls while in his 30s , including allegations that he molested a 14-year-old and assaulted a 16-year-old . he has denied wrongdoing . six in 10 voters said the allegations were a factor in their selection . ",
        "of those , 68 % said they went with jones . parents most voters did n't have children under 18 in their homes , and among this group , moore had a slight advantage . among the 35 % voters who did have children in their homes , most chose jones . jones did especially well with mothers who had children living with them . two in three of these went for the democrat . by contrast , most fathers who had children living with them went for moore . the trump/mcconnell factors voters ' opinions of trump generally seemed to coincide with their vote in tuesday 's senate race . ",
        "voters appeared split on their opinion of the president -- 48 % approved and 48 % disapproved . those who approved generally went with republican candidate moore and vice versa . but jones pulled more support from voters approving of trump than moore drew support from those who disapprove of the president . support , or distaste , for senate majority leader mitch mcconnell did n't seem to be as great a predictor . two in three voters said they had an unfavorable opinion of the kentucky republican . among those , jones had only a slight edge . among the slim percentage of voters who said they viewed mcconnell favorably , jones still pulled 46 % of the vote . ",
        "ideology the vast majority of those who described themselves as somewhat or very liberal went for the democrat , while most conservatives chose moore . but jones also scored among those describing themselves as moderates . more than three in 10 said they were moderate , and 74 % of those voters said they chose jones . values the percentage of voters who said only jones shared their values was close to the percentage of those who said the same of moore . but jones managed to get votes from a tiny amount of those who said only moore shared their values . ",
        "moore pulled no support from those who said jones was the only candidate sharing theirs .   "
