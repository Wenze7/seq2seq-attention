        "london -- when the boston celtics and philadelphia 76ers play thursday in london , they 'll both be looking to leave a mark on the league 's global stage . for the teams , that 's the obvious payoff . it 'll also provide a reminder of the league 's future . a number of the players -- including kyrie irving and joel embiid -- set to take the court at the o2 arena are also likely to appear in february 's all-star game , some surely going to be bolstered by votes they get from those fans in london and watching worldwide . ",
        "and the amount of young talent that will be on display makes this the most hotly anticipated matchup of the eight regular-season games that have taken place in england . `` i 'm appreciative of all fan votes . i 'm just a fan of basketball , a fan of sport and now i get to mark off my bucket of playing at the o2 arena , '' said irving , who is averaging 24.1 points per game to lead the celtics to a 33-10 start and the top spot in the eastern conference standings . `` i ca n't wait for that experience and to have the opportunity to come here to europe and especially london and to grow the game of basketball for the nba . ",
        "`` after the first round of fan voting for this season 's all-star starters , which nba followers from all over the world can participate in online , irving led his nearest challenger among eastern conference guards by more than 500,000 votes , leaving him all but assured of a starting spot in los angeles on feb. . 18 . while the celtics have exceeded expectations after losing free-agency acquisition gordon hayward to a horrific ankle injury on the opening night of the season , the 76ers have struggled to maintain consistency . still , philadelphia is very much in contention for a playoff berth , a marked improvement on recent years . ",
        "the team 's development plan , or `` the process '' as it was known , is finally bearing fruit . a healthy embiid is the main reason why . drafted in 2014 , embiid missed his first two nba seasons with foot injuries and managed just 31 games last season . thursday will be his 30th appearance this season and he is averaging 23.8 points per game . the gregarious 23-year-old is third among eastern conference forwards in fan voting , but he is aware a big performance in london could elevate his chances of holding onto his spot . ",
        "`` i 'm a winner , i 'm competitive but at the same time it 's also for the fans , '' embiid said . `` i want to have fun , i always do have fun on the court and then i play better when i have fun . i 'm going to play team basketball and try to put on a show too . `` another factor in the 76ers ' improvement has been the play of ben simmons . the 21-year-old australian point-forward , a leading rookie of the year candidate , could also become an all-star . ",
        "`` that would be amazing , '' said simmons , who 's currently just under 50,000 votes off a starting place . `` i honestly do n't know what i would say about that but it would just be amazing . i 'd be blessed . `` the next voting update comes out following thursday 's game , with polls closing monday . however , 76ers coach brett brown said whether simmons or embiid is voted into the all-star game really wo n't prove anything . `` there 's a difference between popular and championships and that 's my version of a star , '' brown said . ",
        "`` are you able to get your teams to win and win championships ? this is the challenge , for ben and joel , that 's my mission for them . `` the good thing for embiid and simmons , they could do both .   "
