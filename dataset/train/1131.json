        "2017 was an incredible year for gaming . we saw more world-class games launch this year than any one person could possibly play . echo , nioh , nier , persona , the legend of zelda , mario , pubg ... the list goes on , but of course , there are two games that outsold everything else by a large margin : call of duty : wwii , and destiny 2 . we knew these were going to be 2017 's juggernauts , but we were n't so sure which game would end up selling the best . this morning , activision has confirmed that the crown belongs once again to call of duty . ",
        "activision is reporting that call of duty : wwii has surpassed $ 1 billion in sell-through since it launched . this makes it 2017 's best-selling console game in north america . activision 's ceo , eric hirshberg , would like to remind everyone that call of duty has been doing this for years . `` call of duty : wwii is the # 1 top grossing console game of the year in north america , and destiny 2 is # 2 , '' he said in this morning 's press release . `` that means call of duty has been the # 1 top grossing console gaming franchise in north america for a staggering nine years in a row , and worldwide eight out of the last nine years . ",
        "thank you to our players for your incredible passion and engagement . and thank you to our talented , committed teams all across the globe that make incredible results like this happen . `` there were other accolades being handed out as well . destiny 2 obviously sold incredibly well in order to secure the number two spot in the `` best selling games of 2017 '' lineup , and it was also activision 's biggest pc launch to-date . additionally , it was noted that crash bandicoot n. sane trilogy is the best selling remaster collection in ps4 history . ",
        "we 're betting the competition for that particular accolade was less fierce , but we 're still happy to see crash on top .   "
