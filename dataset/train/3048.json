        "kylie jenner has barely been seen in public in months . the reality star/makeup mogul has taken herself out of the public eye , seemingly in order to keep her reported pregnancy a secret . the only pictures we 've seen from her have been from the chest up ever since september , and with the exception of some photos that fans think reveal jenner 's reported baby bump , we have no actual clue of what jenner looks like nowadays . that 's why kim kardashian 's tweet about north west is so funny . in the tweet , kardashian says her daughter is the `` hide & seek champ , '' but fans have been quick to troll kylie jenner in their replies , basically saying , `` kim , imma let you finish , but kylie jenner is the greatest hide and seek player of all time ! ",
        "`` the tweet was a hilarious photo of north west playing hide and seek . she 's hiding in an ottoman , but the cutie did n't realize her hair was poking out . so while this was an excellent hiding place , her plan was foiled by the curls . it 's honestly the cutest photo ever , and kardashian knew it , so she posted it saying , `` north is the hide & seek champ ! ðŸ˜‚ `` oh , north west . you do the darnedest things . fans were quick to correct kardashian on who the real hide and seek champ is . ",
        "i mean , where is the lie ? jenner has done an immaculate job of keeping herself out of paparazzi photos for the last four months . her life went from being the most public in the world to the most private in what felt like a matter of days . where has she been hiding all this time ? ! calabasas , apparently . jenner has reportedly been spending a lot of time at home while preparing for her reported baby . and that tracks , seeing as one of the most frequent things jenner posts photos/videos of on snapchat and instagram are her house in california . ",
        "according to reports , she spends a lot of time at home and has her friends come over to spend time with her . jenner reportedly had a baby shower the day after kim karadashian had hers back in november . a source told people that jenner 's shower had been planned for a while and had a pajama theme , whereas kardashian 's was planned a little more on the spot . a source told people that jenner has preferred to spend time at home during her reported pregnancy . the source said she `` prefers to stay home '' and is trying to `` keep a low profile '' before the baby is born . ",
        "it 's a rumor that got its start on twitter , obviously , because that 's where all of the kardashian conspiracy theories are cooked up . basically , fans believe the women looking off to the side in the christmas eve photo from the kardashian christmas card are actually looking off at kylie and her baby . there were some theories that they were looking at pregnant kylie , but now fans are convinced she already gave birth and bamboozled all of us with a phony march due date . because they believe she already gave birth , there are also those who 've theorized that tyga is actually the father of the baby , not travis scott . ",
        "basically , some fans think the math does n't add up . if jenner already gave birth , that means she might 've been pregnant long before we were led to believe . she and scott had n't been dating for that long before jenner 's reported pregnancy news came out . this makes some fans think tyga is actually the father . this theory is fueled even more by travis scott 's weird response to being asked about jenner 's pregnancy . when asked if he had spoken to his own father about `` becoming a father '' this year , scott reportedly replied , '' `` uh ... for what ? '' ",
        "this is very sus , guys . very sus . we 'll just have to wait for kylie jenner to tell us the truth herself . that is , if she ever does ...   "
