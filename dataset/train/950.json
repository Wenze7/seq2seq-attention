        "a rains county , texas , gas station owner shocked locals with a sign he posted to his door inviting those who do n't have any money to get a free sandwich and bottle of water . frank hemani , owner of the star mart gas station in lake fort , decided to help those less fortunate by offering a sandwich and water to people who did n't have money or a job . `` it 's just a couple of bucks , but somebody will not go to sleep hungry . if you do n't have money or a job , you can have a sandwich and a bottle of water for free , '' hemani told kltv . ",
        "the owner 's sign read , `` if you do n't have money or a job you can have a sandwich and a bottle of water for free . '' `` if they are hungry enough , i will feed them . if they have children , or child , i 'll definitely give them something to eat , '' hemani said . `` then we have ham and cheese sandwiches and sometimes he throws some of our breakfast tacos in here , as a little different they can have a choice , '' employee andrea wissman added . hemani said he was inspired to offer the free food after seeing a video about someone doing something similar . ",
        "`` it 's really nice to help the community out because , there 's sometimes that maybe i went hungry . i do n't think the kids in this country or anywhere in the world has to wait for christmas to get a good stuff and i think they should get it whenever they deserve , '' he said . the store usually gives away five to six sandwiches per week . `` i can do more positive stories out there , because of me , if more and more people start doing it , i think it 'll be one good thing for the whole world , '' hemani said . ",
        "many readers praised hemani for being so generous with his money and business in order to help others . `` i 'm extremely proud of this man an his generosity just wish that more of these businesses would follow his lead because they 're no reason why these places ca n't give these individuals who are going through a real hard time or that are homeless a sandwich or what they have made already . i 've seen these businesses throw leftovers away when they could be helping some unfortunate person out . god bless this man an his family for thinking of others as well , '' one american patriot nation reader commented on the site 's facebook page . ",
        "`` he 's an earth angel ! and will be blessed , who knows maybe jesus would come in his store disguised as a homeless hungry person , and say when i was hungry you gave me food ! far fetched but realistic , '' another wrote . `` its very nice and decent when there are still good hearted people out there , '' another added .
