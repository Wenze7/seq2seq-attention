        "since last week , more than 3,000 have put their name to the fight . sign the petition - herewe asked you to back the cause . and from around the globe , you have responded in your thousands . our petition to save south ayrshire 's lollipop men and women is on the march . since last week , more than 3,000 have put their name to the fight . and their is no sign of the campaign slowing . schools may be stopping for christmas -- but the ayrshire post bid to save their crossing patrols will not . ",
        "from mauchline to massachusetts , our petition has reached around the world . now we ask you to join those who have already signed on the dotted line . nicola coulter said : `` i think it 's a disgrace . has a child to be knocked down before the council opens their eyes and sees that every school needs lollipop men and women -- at least two at each and every school ? '' enis kerr added : `` we need to keep our children safe . they are our main priority in life . i think it 's shocking even thinking about doing away with our lollipop men and women . '' ",
        "budget cuts are inevitable ... but are south ayrshire council doing it right ? and ralph green said : `` to be pragmatic , when a child is either injured or killed the lollipop person will be brought back . it is a hard time for councils but this decision suggests an emotional ploy to secure more funds or is simply crass . '' former britain 's got talent winner jai mcdowall was among those to back our campaign in its first days . the tarbolton favourite said : `` i ca n't believe there 's even talk about this . ",
        "the lollipop lady ` bobby ' was such a big part of the day and left a lasting impression , a friendly hello from a lollipop person could change a child 's day . `` axing them would be a terrible move from south ayrshire council . '' post editor , gary fanning , said : `` we have been blown away by the early response to this campaign . `` not only have people responded in large numbers , they have done so from around the world . `` this can only send the strongest possible message to south ayrshire council that we are not prepared to stand for this proposal . ",
        "`` lollipop men and women are the very essence of our primary schools and everything must be done to protect their future . ''   "
