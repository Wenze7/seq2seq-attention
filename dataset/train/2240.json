        "facebook has ordered a 10-episode drama series from blumhouse television and two of the team members behind hbo 's true blood . facebook 's director of development , ricky van veen , made the announcement today at the national association of television program executives conference , deadline reports . the working title of the half-hour series is sacred lies . the story is based on the brothers grimm fairy tale the handless maiden and the stephanie oaks novel the sacred lies of minnow bly . the series 's plot sounds significantly darker and stranger than much of the content in facebook 's watch tab , which tends to favor gimmicky reality shows and clips from popular internet creators . ",
        "it 's about `` a handless teen who escapes from a cult and finds herself in juvenile detention , suspected of knowing who killed her cult leader , '' according to deadline . sacred lies reunites two of the people behind true blood : writer scott winant and writer / executive producer raelle tucker . it 's being produced by the television arm of blumhouse productions , the horror-inflected company behind movies like get out , m. night shyamalan 's split , and the purge and paranormal activity movies . although facebook plans to let anyone publish to the watch tab eventually , it 's currently competing for viewers with more established streaming services like netflix and amazon prime video . ",
        "a series like this could be a step toward commissioning its own wave of prestige programming . facebook has said it plans to spend more than $ 1 billion on original programming in the upcoming year , so details about its 2018 lineup will probably keep coming . the verge has reached out to facebook and will update with any new information .
