        "experiencing life while it laststhere 's not much to add or to ask . while talking to my blackest cat we figured out the simple truth of the timeless bonds . between me , between you and all the living things . enjoy while they , and you , are still alive -- that is the dream . the dream that is more than real : struggling for pleasure , at the same time avoiding and looking for sunbeam . all we know is the search for the ultimate , as if we knew what it means . we call it art , faith or philosophy -- no matter how we understand these words , we feel there is always something in between . ",
        "this something , that is the dream . tonight i want to abandon sense , avoidance and depression . all the nouns flowing out of me are meaningless , but they sound . there must be no agression when i experiment with sounds of closing door and cry for help . there must be no lie when i go out to the imagined sun to meet my conceptual man . how long the time span has to be for me to alter my dreams and embrace the intimacy which so real ? i hear . the sounds of my throat begging for more , my soul wants no more screams than before . ",
        "i surrender to sore cause i swore i would learn how to love . there is always a promise for opening a new door . and every time i open , i hear another sound , coming from the front and from behind . every time a mirror appears i look into it and god , who is me , knows why -- because every experience is at some point going to be clear . with this soothing message in my heart this time i shut the door and once more : in the land of dreams , no matter how much i fear , i can sense you are near . ",
        "so i close my eyes and decide to be here .   "
