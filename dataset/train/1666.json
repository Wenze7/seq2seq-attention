        "every year we get a peak at the latest and most exciting developments in tech at the consumer electronics show . in many ways , it is the grand showcase for what the best software companies and hardware manufacturers have been up to . and , for almost as long , robots have been the highlights . after all , what 's cooler than seeing the best autonomous tin cans around ? with that in mind , here are some of our favorite picks for the best bots of ces 2018 . also , if you 've got any fear of the robot apocalypse , you might want to skip this one . ",
        "sony 's new aibo botaibo , a rudimentary toy tog originally introduced in 1999 and updated into the mid-00s , has finally seen a major return . it 's much , much smarter , and absolutely adorable -- enough that some writers already miss the robo-pup . this edition plays , is expressive , responds to voice commands , and even learns from its owners -- developing a unique personality . but , of course , this is a likely prelude to a robo-dog invasion . omron 's ping pong bota new robot from manufacturer omron has all but mastered the fine art of table tennis . ",
        "it 's able to adapt its playing style and approach based on the skills and technique of its opponents . for some , it might be a little less than impressive , if only because it wraps all the way around its half of the court -- and is n't too great at the whole `` looking human '' thing . that 's okay , though , because that means it wo n't secretly infiltrate our government and challenge us all to ping pong matches to the death . robotic strippers from giles walkercredit : associated pressthis one is a little weird . ",
        "as someone who never really understood why you 'd want to go to a `` gentleman 's club '' in the first place , it 's bizarre to think of why a pole-dancing bot would be any more interesting . but , this one is n't quite what you 'd think . english metal sculptor giles walker created these bots as a commentary on how we 're all always `` being watched . '' the bots ' heads , presumably to make the point a little more clear , are just re-worked cctv cameras . still , something tells me this guy probably does n't get the commentary at play here . ",
        "aaaaand that puts it well within poe 's law , which , loosely interpreted , notes that it can be nearly impossible to sort out satire from the genuine article at the extremes . blue frog 's buddyon the other end of things is buddy , a smart in-home assistant that can control internet-of-things devices , act as a walking talking calendar , and even be a smart alarm clock or security guard . there 's not much else to say here , other than that 's in an impressive , capable , and potentially practical addition to your home -- an extension of an already partially smart-ified , internet connected life . ",
        "that 's pretty cool . until it lets the robo-dogs in and they kill you in your sleep . i 'm serious . he 's not to be trusted . sophiafinally , we have what may be the most all-around technically impressive bot , sophia . she 's definitely human-like , able to carry on basic conversation , and even been made a citizen of saudi arabia . she 's also gotten herself into a twitter fight with model and actress chrissy teigen . and now plenty are saying that spat will be the first mark against humanity in the coming robo-human war . ",
        "teigen herself has been desperately trying to appease the bot and now lives in fear that one day sophia will come for her . as bots will one day come for us all . sleep tight . let us know what you like about geek by taking our survey .   "
