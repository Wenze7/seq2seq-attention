        "the detroit lions are expected to tab new england patriots ' defensive coordinator matt patricia as their new head coach , whose attention to detail will vastly improve the team . barring a last-second disaster -- and the detroit lions have seen their fair share of those -- matt patricia will be the team 's next head coach . everything patricia brings to the table seems like a perfect fit for the lions : a winning pedigree , a defensive mind , closeness to bill belichick , an ability to get the most out of his players . in addition to all of those attractive traits , patricia 's penchant for detail and focus on fundamentals should be coveted most of all . ",
        "for years , and spanning multiple head coaches , the lions have been known to be their own worst enemy -- snatching defeat from the jaws of victory and reinventing ways to lose that were previously unthinkable . the difference between consistently great teams and mediocre ones is the ability to execute the fundamentals . as i came across this tweet from james light this past weekend , a quote attributed to patricia , i could not help but think how beneficial this mindset would be to the lions : . it is a simple statement , but a powerful one .

        "it explains so much about the patriots ' success and equally as much about the lions ' lack thereof . every team makes mistakes . dropped passes , errant throws , missed field goals , and missed tackles are all part of the game . concern becomes real when the mistakes are consistent , and it becomes horrific when the mistakes consistently come from the coaching staff . in consecutive weeks this season , the lions had less than eleven players on the field for game-changing plays , and it doomed them each time . against the vikings on thanksgiving day , the lions had just ten players on field , resulting in a touchdown . ",
        "the following week against the ravens , the lions had nine defenders on the field for a crucial third-and-seven play , resulting in a 27-yard reception . for all caldwell 's positive attributes , it was errors such as these that perhaps made bob quinn 's decision quite easy . a team can not be expected to be fundamentally sound if the coaching staff is not . patricia , if hired , is walking into a terrific situation for a first-time head coach . he has a franchise quarterback in his prime , the team has close to $ 48 million in cap space , and a defense loaded with talented players .
