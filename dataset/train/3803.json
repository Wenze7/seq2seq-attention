        "portland , ore. . -- an oregon law passed nearly seven decades ago banned drivers from pumping their own gas but now that 's changing -- in some cases . the new year ushered in some modifications to an aging law that makes oregon only one of two states in the u. s. that places restrictions on self-service gas . self-serving motorists in other parts of the u. s. have poked fun at the idea of oregonians struggling with gas pumps for the first time , but the reality is for many people in the state , not much has changed . ",
        "here 's a look at what the original law did , what 's changing and how oregonians are reacting to this brave new world . ____ what did the original law say and why was it passed ? the original ban on self-service gasoline was passed in 1951 in oregon . the state law made it illegal for gas station customers to pump their own gas and mandated $ 500 fines for stations that violated the law by letting customers pump gas . the law includes justification language explaining that pumping gas can expose customers , including pregnant women and children , to unsafe fumes . ",
        "it also said customer pumping can be dangerous for novices , can cause spills and can cause discomfort to the elderly . what other states restrict self-service gas ? new jersey is the only other state that places restrictions on self-service gasoline . the state 's law passed in 1949 and bans all customers from pumping gas at any time . has oregon 's law been modified before ? in 2015 , the law was amended to allow stations in rural areas to offer self-service gas between the hours of 6 p. m. and 6 a. m . this allowed gas stations in sparsely populated areas to remain open 24-hours without providing overnight attendants . ",
        "what changed in 2018 ? those modifications were taken a step further starting jan. . 1 . now , gas stations in counties that have populations of less than 40,000 can offer self-service gas to customers any time . if the station also has a non-automotive retail operation -- a snack store , for example -- it must keep a gas station attendant on duty from 6 a. m. to 6 p. m.how many people does this affect ? all-hours self-serve gas is now allowed in the 15 least populated of oregon 's 36 counties . so attendants are still required at gas stations in oregon 's larger population centers of portland , eugene , salem , bend and medford , for example . ",
        "about 266,000 people live in those counties . three other counties along the oregon coast now can offer self-service fueling between 6 p. m. and 6 a. m.how will the changes affect oregon drivers ? drivers in the western part of the state will notice no changes . in the eastern , rural counties where the changes apply , many businesses plan to keep things status quo to remain competitive or because their small stations are n't equipped to handle self-service customers . a few stations say they will offer self-service , but did n't expect many drivers to choose the option . ",
        "has anyone been fined ? collecting fines for violating the pumping law are `` extremely rare , '' said richard hoover , spokesman for the oregon state fire marshal responsible for enforcement of the law . authorities periodically receive reports of violations , visit gas stations and remind owners about the law , he said . how do oregonians feel about it ? oregonians can get quite worked up about the question of whether to pump or not to pump . some love sitting inside warm cars while oregon 's infamous rain pours down . others say the law drives up the price of gas and holds back the economy . ",
        "the issue always brings up a question from flummoxed newcomers : should i tip ? the answer from most oregonians usually is no -- unless the attendant has really gone above and beyond -- because it 's a mandated service . _____ follow gillian flaccus on twitter at .   "
