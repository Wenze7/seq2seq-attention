        "the last time i rode horses i was shopping in the children 's section of the shoe store . but that did n't stop me from stealing my mom 's vintage cowboy boots when i was home for the holidays . because yes , there are certainly functional elements to cowboy boots for those that rodeo , live on farms , or , you know , ride horses on the regular . but , for those of us in new york city -- and other non-rural locales -- they 're still a must-have during thick-sock season . or , at least , they 're starting to be . ",
        "inspired by the spring 2018 runways of calvin klein , margiela , and r13 , we 've rounded up 15 pairs of cowboy boots to shop for now . and there are a bunch of iterations to choose from -- from tall cherry red , to ankle-high all-white , to glossy croc prints in cropped silhouettes . feel free to do your best jessica simpson impression when they arrive in the mail -- just remember to make it fashun . like what you see ? how about some more r29 goodness , right here ? 16 on-sale designer buys for a luxe 2018this collection has us wanting warmer weather -- bad13 bold coats because we 're not done with red just yet .
