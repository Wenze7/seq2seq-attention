        "matt o'connor , the leicester head coach , wants rugby union 's authorities to be held to account after manu tuilagi 's citing for a dangerous tackle was dismissed , leaving the centre free to continue his comeback from injury . tuilagi pleaded not guilty at his hearing on wednesday with the disciplinary panel ruling that while the tackle on munster 's chris cloete was reckless it did not warrant a red card . it was the 26-year-old centre 's first match since the opening day of the season , having undergone knee surgery , and means he is available for leicester 's christmas eve match against saracens . ",
        "it also boosts his chances of stringing together a run of games before eddie jones names his england squad for the six nations . while o'connor was satisfied tuilagi had been cleared , he pointed to the disruption the disciplinary process had caused . in october the england captain dylan hartley 's involvement during the autumn internationals was placed in jeopardy after he was cited for striking the head of clermont 's rabah slimani . that was also dismissed and northampton swiftly issued a statement with the now former director of rugby , jim mallinder , saying : `` citings like this do beg the question of whether dylan is being singled out for what has happened in the past rather than being judged solely on game . '' ",
        "o'connor said he does not believe tuilagi had been singled out because of his pacific islands heritage but he was similarly critical of the disciplinary process . `` everyone involved in the game has to be a little bit more accountable for the actions they take , '' he said . `` the players and the coaches are certainly accountable and we 'd just like the rest of rugby to be just as accountable , the citing commissioners . `` it 's caused unnecessary disruption . it 's what it does to manu in the state that he 's in . ",
        "he comes back and plays the game physically and legally . unfortunately , it just makes everyone a bit unnecessarily cautious about the physicality and collisions . the citing commissioners need to be a little bit more accurate with what they 're sanctioning and what they 're not . '' tuilagi 's former british & irish lions team-mate brian o'driscoll insisted the `` game has gone soft '' in response to the citing on tuesday and o'connor insisted that the tackle was legal . `` he wo n't miss any rugby so that 's incredibly pleasing , '' o'connor said . ",
        "`` the sanction has to be a red-card offence and from our perspective there was no red-card offence . there was no malice , there was no intent to hurt the bloke . it was a very legitimate tackle . it 's a reaction to the broader community around health and safety and player welfare . '' tuilagi has managed only 17 minutes of game time for england under jones and last started a test in june 2014 because of his long list of injury problems . he made only seven leicester appearances last term but , after coming through 80 minutes against munster , o'connor was optimistic of swift improvements . ",
        "`` he 'll get better and better every time he plays , '' o'connor said on sunday . `` we 'll be very diligent about what we have to do but the growth that he 'll get out of that mentally and physically will be enormous for us . '' this article originally appeared on the guardian .   "
