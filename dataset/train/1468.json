        "washington -- president donald trump is n't waiting for the facts to emerge from the deadly amtrak train derailment south of seattle before using the accident to plug his infrastructure plan . trump 's first tweet on the accident monday : `` the train accident that just occurred in dupont , wa shows more than ever why our soon to be submitted infrastructure plan must be approved quickly . seven trillion dollars spent in the middle east while our roads , bridges , tunnels , railways crumble ! not for long ! `` the facts : from what 's known , it 's not at all clear his coming infrastructure plan is relevant . ",
        "the accident did not happen on a crumbling railway but rather on a section of track that had just been upgraded as part of a $ 181 million project for a new , faster route . the high-speed train was making its first run on newly constructed tracks when it derailed . the new route was designed to speed up service by drawing passengers away from the sort of aging system that trump speaks about : a route with curves , single-track tunnels and freight traffic . authorities initially doubted any maintenance problem was responsible because the stretch is new .
