        "qantas used the two most fuel-intensive aircraft and carried the most empty seats of any transpacific airlinemichael slezakqantas emits more carbon dioxide per passenger-kilometre than any other airline operating across the pacific , according to an analysis by the international council on clean transportation , the group that exposed the volkswagen emissions scandal in 2014 . for each kilometre qantas transports a passenger across the pacific , it uses 64 % more fuel than the two most fuel-efficient airlines operating across the pacific : hainan airlines and all nippon airways . one litre of aviation fuel was able to transport one passenger just 22 km , on average , on qantas flights , while hainan and ana were able to take a passenger 36 km on 1l of fuel . ",
        "the wide variation between airlines provides a stark contrast to the industry 's aspirational goal of improving fuel efficiency of international flights by just 2 % annually . all airlines chartaviation currently accounts for about 2.5 % of global carbon dioxide emissions . but pollution from the industry is expected to increase and , by 2050 , use up a quarter of the allowable greenhouse gas emissions if the world is to keep global warming at less than 1.5 c -- the world 's `` carbon budget '' . while hainan and ana tied as the most fuel-efficient airlines , they used different strategies to achieve the relatively low fuel burn . ",
        "hainan airways , a chinese carrier , employed more fuel-efficient aircraft , using the boing 787 dreamliner for more than 80 % of its flights , and the airbus a330 for the remainder . it also avoided having excessive empty seats , further increasing its efficiency . meanwhile , the japanese airline ana achieved the low fuel-burn by carrying a lot of cargo , which the analysis treated as equivalent to carrying people . in contrast , qantas used the two most fuel-intensive aircraft -- airbus a380 and boeing 747-400er -- and carried the most empty seats of any transpacific airline , filling just 74 % of its seats . ",
        "comparing all the airlines , icct found that how much freight an airline carried was the strongest determinant of its fuel efficiency , explaining 48 % of the variation between airlines . seating density , aircraft efficiency and passenger load were the other major factors . looking at specific routes , the analysis found delta was the most fuel-efficient airline on the sydney-los angeles route , flying a passenger 33 km on a litre of fuel . virgin australia and united were not far behind on 32 km , while qantas lagged on just 24 km . sydney-la chartthe most competitive transpacific route was los angeles-tokyo , with six airlines flying between the two hubs . ",
        "on that route united was the most fuel-efficient , taking a passenger 42 km on a litre of fuel . singapore airlines was the least fuel-efficient , taking a passenger just 26 km on a litre of fuel . la-tokyo chartthe report notes that qantas is planning on using eight new dreamliners for flights to the us , which , if operating now , would lift the airline one place from the bottom , above korean air and tying with asiana in the second-bottom place . the results follow an earlier analysis icct conducted on the efficiency of airlines on transatlantic routes in 2015 , which found a significant but smaller variation between airlines than was found on pacific routes . ",
        "in that report , british airways and lufthansa were found to have emitted 51 % more carbon dioxide than the cleanest flyers , norwegian air . `` this research shows that there are a variety of ways that international airlines can reduce fuel use and carbon emissions , '' said brandon graver from icct , the lead author of the study . `` buying new aircraft , carrying large numbers of passengers and optimising freight strategies all make a difference . '' dan rutherford , icct 's aviation program director and co-author of the paper , said : `` there 's a reason airlines around the world are starting to avoid very large aircraft like the 747 and a380 . ",
        "`` newer twin-engine widebodies provide the payload and range capabilities needed for transpacific flights with much lower fuel burn . '' alan milne , head of fuel and environment at qantas told the guardian that the airline ranks low in the analysis because it uses large aircraft , flies long distances and has premium cabins that leave more space between passengers . `` we 're committed to reducing carbon emissions and continually look at ways to lower them across our operations , '' he said . `` we are switching our 747s for more fuel-efficient dreamliners and we have several data-driven programs in place to reduce fuel burn .
