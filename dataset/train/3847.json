        "according to the developer , the game is the tale of a plucky bunch of moderately terrible people trying to escape from a lifetime of cheerful denial in the city of wellington wells . in this alternate england , conformity is key . you have to fight or blend in with the drug-using inhabitants to survive . the video gives players a glimpse at the second playable character known as sally . compulsion games also announced that the title is `` content complete '' , meaning that they now have to polish the game until it 's ready . however , certain aspects of the game did n't live up to expectations to the game maker has decided to push it back a little further to iron out the story problems . ",
        "in a statement issued to the press , sam abbott , producer for we happy few , said the following . there are these moments that are memorable , very funny , and super weird and we 're really excited to show you all . but we felt that the first two hours of arthur 's story just did n't live up to those moments , meaning that the game did n't start as well as it should . so we went back to the drawing board and made a couple of big decisions : we brought forward a number of story moments , to get into the action faster , and also rebuilt the whole first island for arthur . ",
        "due to this we happy few will now release in summer 2018 for xbox one , pc , and playstation 4 . the game started off as a crowdfunded project but the developer eventually decided to team up with gearbox publishing to increase the scope of the project . this means that we happy few will include a full-length story campaign , three playable characters , and hundreds of unique encounters . hopefully it 'll live up to expectations . see at microsoft store see at amazonkeep an eye on windowscentral . com/gaming for all the latest in xbox and windows 10 gaming , accessories , news , and reviews !
