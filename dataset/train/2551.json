        "london - britain may need to raise more money from taxes to bring down its budget deficit after relying heavily on keeping a tight grip on public spending , the international monetary fund said on wednesday . `` deficit reduction since the financial crisis has relied mostly on spending measures , '' the imf said in an annual report on britain 's economy . `` while the government should continue to seek the best value for money in public spending , a more balanced approach to deficit reduction may be called for in future , '' it said . the impact of brexit on the economy and britain 's low productivity growth could hit tax revenues , while demands on public spending would increase as the country 's population grows older . ",
        "`` under these circumstances , greater reliance on revenue measures for consolidation than in recent years may be warranted , '' the report said . the report also welcomed recent progress in the brexit talks with brussels but said the timeframe for negotiating a new trade deal was ambitious .
