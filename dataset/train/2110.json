        "atlanta falcons radio network analyst dave archer joined the morning show with john and hugh friday to breakdown the falcons ' 20-17 win over the new orleans saints . archer said the `` defense was amazing '' to hold on with drew brees having the ball in the final minutes of the game . the defense was patient and came up with key plays against an offense that was putting up 30 points a game prior to thursday night . the defense has been able to get stops , and the falcons expect that out of themselves at this point ; to go out there and get stops . ",
        "offensively , matt ryan has the ability to stay in the moment and not live in the past . even though he 's made some mistakes , and he 's able to focus on the then and now , which is really hard to do . just when you think he 's down , he makes the plays that the team needs him to . the script has been flipped . this is a defense that you expect them to play well ; it 's very opposite of last year . as long as the offense can put something together , the defense can win you games .
