        "two senior democratic senators asked the country 's intelligence chief thursday to assess the national security risks of president donald trump 's tweets on north korea . two senior democratic senators asked the country 's intelligence chief thursday to assess the national security risks of president donald trump 's tweets on north korea . senators martin heinrich and ron wyden asked the director of national intelligence , daniel coats , to `` assess the risk to the united states and to us interests and personnel '' arising from a tweet trump posted on january 2 . in that tweet trump made a veiled threat to north korean leader kim jong-un , who a day earlier opened the new year with his own defiant statement calling to speed up the deployment of nuclear weapons . ",
        "`` north korean leader kim jong un just stated that the ` nuclear button is on his desk at all times . ' will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that i too have a nuclear button , but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his , and my button works ! '' trump wrote . heinrich and wyden , both members of the senate intelligence committee , said they would like the intelligence community to assess the impact of trump 's tweets on washington 's credibility . `` we request that the assessment address the likely north korean response to the president 's january 2 tweet and the president 's other threatening tweets and statements , and whether this rhetoric serves as a deterrent or a provocation . ",
        "`` kim 's new year statement extended an olive branch to seoul , which in the subsequent days led to a renewal of direct contacts , reopening a cross border hotline and a proposal to hold bilateral talks on january 9 . on thursday trump turned to twitter again to claim credit . `` with all of the failed ` experts ' weighing in , does anybody really believe that talks and dialogue would be going on between north and south korea right now if i was n't firm , strong and willing to commit our total ` might ' against the north .
