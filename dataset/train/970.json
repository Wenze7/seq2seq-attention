        "my youngest daughter finally celebrated her eleventh birthday with her friends this past week . despite her birthday falling in april , her softball commitments in the spring prevented her from hosting a party until school was over . one of the coolest things about her party was that she asked her friends not to get her a present . instead , she requested they bring food or toys for animals , and the last part of her party was taking the goods to the local humane society to donate them to a cause she believes in . all her friends visited the animal shelter and got to interact with several of the cats and dogs . ",
        "at the tender age of eleven , my youngest daughter has already volunteered at the shelter several times . as a father , i burst with pride at the sight of my daughter having such a huge heart for a worthy cause . as a mental health professional , i marvel at how much helping others and making a difference benefits people 's lives . so why do n't more folks see volunteering as a legitimate and worthy method of improving mental wellbeing ? the psychological benefits of volunteeringin the united states , millions of americans dedicate anywhere from a few hours a month to several hours per week volunteering . ",
        "approximately twenty-six percent of adults volunteer , with most falling into the 35 -- 54 age bracket . women volunteer more frequently than men , and those with higher educational attainment tend to be more likely to volunteer . there are a variety of motives for volunteering , and plenty of rewards to be gained when helping others . research published by the federal government 's corporation for national and community service found that people who routinely volunteer , especially older adults , live longer and experience better physical and mental health than those who do not . `` viewing volunteering as a legitimate tool to progress in life is one of the first things we do in therapy . '' ",
        "these results were especially important for older adults who already started to experience a physical decline . the benefits of volunteering also provide physical and mental benefits for adolescents and teens . researchers from university of british columbia 's faculty of education and department of psychology studied the effects of volunteering on teen 's physical and mental health . the volunteer group of students spent one hour per week working with elementary school children in after-school programs in their neighborhood . after 10 weeks , students in the volunteer group showed improvement in their cardiovascular and mental health and reported increases in empathy and altruistic behavior .

        "adolescents who volunteer to help others also benefit themselves , suggesting a novel way to improve mental and physical wellbeing . the ambivalence or resistance to volunteeringwhy do n't more people volunteer ? well , here are the most common excuses i come across in my personal and professional experience : 1 . time limitations2 . inconvenience3 . it 's more work than fun4 . i wo n't know anyone5 . too young6 . associate volunteering with organized religion7 . i do n't believe i can make a differencelike many things in life , the more creative a person thinks , and the more research and planning that takes place , the better you 'll find that volunteering is n't as hard or bad as you might think it is . ",
        "but buyer beware ; if serving others is n't fun , if it 's not your ideal summer responsibility ... that 's okay because volunteering is n't meant to just be about you . you can and will reap the benefits from developing a servant 's attitude , but first and foremost , volunteering is giving your time and energy to others . in a culture with skyrocketing rates of narcissism , individualism , and self-absorption in young folks , volunteering can be one way to help young adults and adolescents develop empathy , compassion , gratitude , and connection to others .

        "the key to a meaningful and purposeful life : living out your valuesmany of the folks i see in therapy benefit from volunteering . it gives them a sense of accomplishment . it provides them with positive feelings about themselves . it gives their lives a sense of purpose and meaning . but the biggest benefit for the volunteer is that it provides them a sense of living out their values . the young folks i see in therapy tend to struggle with having an `` internal locus of control '' -- a belief that their lives and their actions can truly make a difference . ",
        "it is common for me to have clients complete a values inventory , identifying the morals and principles that they hold in high regard . then i 'll have them assess how much or little they are living out their values in daily living . many of my guys are discouraged by the inventory . the values and principles they hold highest in their beliefs are often not represented in their time , priorities , and daily tasks . but i encourage them with a simple fact ; it 's not that they ca n't make a difference but rather , that they are n't channeling time and effort to things that will make a difference . ",
        "volunteering as an antidote to boredomone of my areas of specialty is working with failure to launch young guys . many of them have experienced academic struggles . most have taken time off from college . they are working part-time jobs , living at home , and often isolated from their childhood peers who are still off at college or now immersed in adult responsibilities . `` adolescents who volunteer to help others also benefit themselves , suggesting a novel way to improve mental and physical wellbeing . '' they have more free-time than is benefiting them , but these guys often wind up time gaming or wasting their time away on netflix or youtube . ",
        "viewing volunteering as a legitimate tool to progress in life is one of the first things we do in therapy . we identify issues and community/societal needs that they care about to reduce the ifying effect of volunteering for the wrong reasons . for many , serving others as an intentional act of mental wellbeing is a novel concept . volunteer star : never stop , never stoppingi 've had the good fortune to travel to different countries on service trips . but i 've also sorted clothes at a local shelter , made bologna and cheese sandwiches for underprivileged children , and interacted with the elderly at an assisted living facility . ",
        "there are so many ways , big and small , that someone can serve and help others . i encourage you to use the summer as a starting point . and hopefully , once summer ends and you 're back to the daily grind of the school year schedule , the benefits of volunteering will compel you to continue to find the time and ways to help out others in need . where to find volunteer opportunities : community theaters , museums , and monumentshistorical restorations , national parks , and conservation organizationslibraries or senior centerslocal animal shelters , rescue organizations , or wildlife centersplaces of worship such as churches or synagoguesservice organizations such as lions clubs or rotary clubsyouth organizations , sports teams , and after-school programsinformation on volunteering and service opportunities : all for good is the largest database of volunteer opportunities .
