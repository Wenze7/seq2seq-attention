        "faced with reports that a `` major '' security flaw has been discovered in millions of intel processors sold over the past decade , intel today responded to the claims , framing the issue as an exploit impacting `` many different vendors ' processors , '' and requiring an `` industry-wide approach to resolve this issue promptly and constructively . '' due to the nature of the exploit , os kernel-level patches are apparently needed , and in some cases are expected to noticeably diminish performance of many computers across the world . while intel did not offer specifics on the exploitation of its chips , reports have claimed that the exploits allow insecure apps to access `` secure '' portions of a computer 's memory , including areas where passwords and other private content are stored . ",
        "an exploit could allow rogue javascript code running in a web browser to see supposedly protected information , compromising the computer and its user . intel 's response concedes that the exploits `` have the potential to improperly gather sensitive data from computing devices that are operating as designed , '' but notes that the company `` believes these exploits do not have the potential to corrupt , modify or delete data , '' if that provides anyone with any degree of comfort . the response notes that `` intel and other vendors had planned to disclose this issue next week when more software and firmware updates will be available , '' but rushed the statement to address `` current inaccurate media reports . '' ",
        "despite intel 's statement on shared exposure , the exploit has been said by researchers to impact `` virtually all '' intel-based machines , including consumer pcs , enterprise computers , and cloud servers . according to lwn . net , equivalent patches are also being readied for arm processors , though the extent to which arm-based devices will be compromised is unclear . intel notes that amd and `` several operating system vendors '' are all working on solutions . to that end , separate reports have suggested that apple , microsoft , and developers of linux distributions are all actively readying critical kernel-level patches to address the flaw . ",
        "initial fixes for the bug have been referred to as `` kernel page-table isolation '' , and work by relocating the secured memory area away from the insecure memory used by programs . as noted by the register , kpti fixes presently slow down certain processes by 5-30 % , though a given computer 's performance hit will depend on its specific processor , tasks , and operating system . synthetic benchmarks published by phoronix show an over 40 % performance cut on i/o functionality with an intel i7-8700k processor , but less than 10 % impact during the same test with an i7-6800k chip . ",
        "video encoding and gaming performance do not appear to be affected by early fixes . the question on everyone 's minds : does macos fix the intel #kpti issue ? why yes , yes it does . say hello to the `` double map '' since 10.13.2 -- and with some surprises in 10.13.3 . cc @i0n1c @s1guza @patrickwardle pic . twitter . com/s1yj9tms63 -- alex ionescu january 3 , 2018patches to address the bug have already been released for some linux distributions and beta versions of windows ; the windows 10 patch is expected to debut next tuesday as part of microsoft 's monthly patch schedule . ",
        "linux developers are being warned that performance regressions are likely . apple is reportedly patching macos to address the flaw , as well . following a new tweet this afternoon from alex ionescu , who previously tweeted about kpti and windows , appleinsider cited unnamed sources within apple as confirming that the current version of macos mitigates the kpti issue , with additional unspecified changes planned for the upcoming 10.13.3 release . according to appleinsider , `` arly indications are that there are no notable slowdowns between a system running macos high sierra 10.13.1 and 10.13.2 . '' we have reached out to apple for additional details and will update this article with anything the company offers . "
