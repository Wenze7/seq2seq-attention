        "boss jose mourinho is adamant they deserved their victory at arsenal . antonio valencia 's early strike and a double from jesse lingard , coupled with some heroic defending and terrific goalkeeping from david de gea , ensured united came away from the emirates stadium with three vital points which cuts the gap at the top of the table to five points . mourinho said , `` the plan was when they had the ball , we all had to defend , starting with the attacking players , and when we have the ball , we had to try to counter-attack fast and try to score goals , which we did . ",
        "we had the ball against the post , we had this last situation with lukaku facing petr cech and , of course , they can say they had chances but we fought and we had a great goalkeeper too and i think we deserve . '' `` they had the intelligence to play tactically according to the moments of the game because the game , we started in a way and then , when mustafi comes off , they changed and we changed and then later , playing with 10 men , we had to change again so i think it was hard for the players from the mental and tactical point of the view .
