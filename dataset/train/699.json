        "it 's been two decades since jack and rose 's ill-fated romance broke our hearts and turned `` never let go '' into the most romantic vow one could make . at the time of filming , titanic was the most expensive movie ever made , and no one could have predicted the monstrous success headed its way . the blockbuster went on to become the highest grossing film of all time , and has entered the pop cultural zeitgeist as one of the essential films to see before you die . but even after dissecting the film , its stars , and the real-life events that inspired it , there are still some things about the movie that remain endlessly fascinating . ",
        "here are 12 interesting facts about titanic ! 1 . there was almost a different jack and roseit 's impossible to imagine the film without kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio , but rumor has it they were not the first choices for their characters . gwyneth paltrow and matthew mcconaughey were reportedly in talks to star before things fell through . with that said , do n't expect james cameron to reveal the truth . `` i will neither confirm nor deny , '' he said . `` i just do n't think that 's cool to talk about actors that either chose not to do it , or were unavailable , or stupidly decided that there was n't enough meat on the bone of the character , or whatever it was . ",
        "`` 2 . winslet really wanted the partin order to secure the lead role , winslet reportedly got ahold of director james cameron 's number and called to tell him , `` i just have to do this , and you are really mad if you do n't cast me . '' she 'd go on to deny doing this years later , but admitted to sending him roses with a note signed , `` from your rose '' after her audition . `` jim took a risk in casting me , '' she said . `` a lot of my contemporaries -- uma thurman , gwyneth paltrow , winona ryder -- were much more likely candidates . ",
        "i got lucky . `` 3 . dicaprio got crabby on the setfourteen-hour days are rough for anyone , so it 's understandable that leo would have moments of weakness amidst his 70-90-hour work weeks . while filming that famous dinner party scene in which his character coins the phrase `` make it count , '' he reportedly leaned over to kathy bates and asked , `` which one of these do i use to lobotomize myself ? '' a 1998 vanity fair article also quotes him as being less than thrilled on a different day . '' was sick of the brown land , the mariachi merriment , and cameron 's big tub , '' the story read . ",
        "so one day `` he ambled over to the set , took a good look at the four soundstages , the 17-million-gallon water tank , the smokestacks rising majestically against the sky , the hordes of extras running around in period clothes -- and thought , ` this is bullshit . ' `` 4 . cameron was extremely thoroughthe director went through great lengths to ensure the film 's authenticity , and his thoroughness extended to the movie 's characters . . . even the extras . `` one night toward the climax -- it was 4:30 a. m. -- and the ship is dipping into the very chilly pacific waters , and 2,000 people are scrambling toward the stern , yells , ` cut ! ' '' ",
        "billy zane , who played cal , recalled . `` climbs onto the deck from the crane basket swinging him around with the sky cam , goes up to an extra , who 's this old lady , and says , ` you 're not just running . you need to go down to the sea deck because your daughter told you she forgot something very dear , her wedding ring , and she 's going down there and you gave her five minutes , and she 's taken 10 , and you regret making that choice . ' he 's giving backstory to a background artist , which elevated the moment for her and spread like wildfire to the other extras . '' ",
        "neat . 5 . the director has settled the door debatethe last half of the film finds rose on a floating door , while jack remains submerged . the moment has sparked heated a debate over the years : `` why did n't they just take turns ? there was room for him on that thing , '' and so on . now , consider those arguments settled because cameron has provided the definitive answer . `` look , it 's very , very simple : you read page 147 of the script and it says , ` jack gets off the board and gives his place to her so that she can survive . ' ",
        "it 's that simple . '' if the director says it is so , then so it shall be . 6 . jack had an unexpected hand doubleperhaps one of the most romantic scenes of the film is when rose asks jack to draw her like one of his french girls . however , the hands you see on screen do n't belong to dicaprio . since he 's more of an actor than an illustrator , cameron stepped in to do the actual sketching . 7 . j. dawson was realjack dawson might have been a fictional character but , as it turns out , there was a j. dawson aboard the real ship . ",
        "it 's a mere coincidence that the two share such similar names because cameron did n't find out about the latter until after the film wrapped . since its release , the real dawson 's gravesite has been extremely popular among tourists . 8 . jeremy sisto was nearly castcould you imagine ? nope , me neither . but before leonardo dicaprio signed onto the film , clueless hunk jeremy sisto did a screen test with kate winslet . however , they did n't have much chemistry and he was soon let go . `` it was exciting to be a part of the process , '' he said . ",
        "`` to be involved in something that had that kind of scope -- anything james cameron does has this huge scope to it . he 's trying to push the limits on things . so i was just insanely inspired by it and a little heartbroken when the role did n't come my way . `` 9 . lindsay lohan almost had a partyep , you read that correctly . the parent trap star , who was 8 at the time , was supposed to play jack 's `` best girl '' cora , but cameron thought her red hair made her look too similar to rose and her mother ruth . ",
        "10 . celine dion 's hit song was n't originally plannedfor the soundtrack , cameron only wanted songs without words . things changed when composer james horner hooked up with lyricist will jennings and singer celine dion to secretly create a demo for `` my heart will go on , '' which cameron loved . the song made it into the closing credits , and the rest is history . 11 . titanic holds a unique recordthese days , movies tend to disappear from the theater after a month and a half . back then , they were around for months . ",
        "titanic , which was released on dec. . 19 , 1997 , was still in theaters when it also came out on vhs on sept. . 1 , 1998 . it 's the first and probably only film to accomplish such a feat . 12 . the crew was reportedly druggedafter a long and difficult shoot , the cast and crew were nearly ready to wrap when many of them came down with a mysterious illness . fifteen minutes after eating lobster chowder , `` the crew was all milling about . some people were laughing , some people were crying , some people were throwing up , '' actor bill paxton recalled . ",
        "`` one minute i felt okay , '' he added , `` the next minute i felt so goddamn anxious i wanted to breathe in a paper bag . cameron was feeling the same way . '' it turns out that someone had spiked their food with pcp . to this day , no one knows the culprit behind it .   "
