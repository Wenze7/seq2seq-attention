        "arsenal boss arsene wenger admits they 're struggling to compete in wages against their premier league rivals . are reported to be offering alexis sanchez Â£ 500,000-a-week but wenger refused to discuss the finances but insisted that the chile star had remained professional throughout . wenger admitted arsenal can not compete with manchester city and united wages . `` financially , yes . that does n't mean that you can not compete on the pitch . that will not be an excuse big enough to not compete on the pitch . of course , there 's no mystery that united and city have bigger financial resources . ",
        "`` i would n't like to comment on the numbers because that 's 's problem . if they want to come out with the numbers they 've offered to sanchez ... i respect because they generate the money they pay to the players from their own resources . you have to respect that . `` after that , it 's down to them to know how much they want to give to the player . overall , is a club that is very well managed financially and on the pitch as well . that 's why i do n't have any problems with the money they pay . ",
        "`` modern football has created a kind of game where the best players in the game are grouped to a various small number of clubs . that makes football less unpredictable and much more predictable . i would say the gap in financial resources between the biggest clubs and the smaller clubs has increased tremendously in the last five years . `` they are professional players . i have no problem with alexis sanchez . his attitude has been outstanding with us . he was in training yesterday , fully committed and prepared 100 per cent . `` one thing you can not question about alexis sanchez is his professionalism and his commitment . ",
        "after that , he 's 29 years old and the next contract will of course be very important for him . ''   "
