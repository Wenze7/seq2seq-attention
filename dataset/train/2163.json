        "liverpool reportedly promised wantaway star philippe coutinho in september that he could finalise a move to barcelona in the january transfer window should a suitable fee be offered - an agreement which the reds could turn their back on . the reds are bracing themselves for barcelona 's return to the bidding table , a sequel to the summer saga which saw the merseysiders reject the spanish giants advances for their star playmaker . coutinho has reportedly had his heart set on a move to camp nou since the summer , but despite having been forced to stay put at anfield , despite submitting a formal transfer request , the 25-year-old has continued to impress during liverpool 's campaign to date - scoring 12 goals and providing eight assists in 19 appearances . ",
        "according to catalan newspaper sport , the reds assured coutinho that he would see his move materialise once an offer they deemed was acceptable was submitted . however , the spanish outfit are preparing to offer £ 100m , a fee which is below the valuation liverpool have of their midfield maestro . the reds are understood to be using barcelona 's fee for the transfer of ousmane dembele from borussia dortmund in the summer as a guide , with the 20-year-old costing £ 120m . however , the brazilian is seemingly prepared for a move so much so that earlier reports have suggested that he has already chosen his squad number at barcelona .
