        "jack elton-walters 9 jan 2018chris froome has been in south africa , logging his rides on stravagetting well clear of the cloud that currently hangs over him after it was revealed that he 'd returned an adverse analytical finding for salbutamol , chris froome has been logging plenty of kilometres in south africa . the kenyan-born british rider spent much of his teens and early twenties in south africa , and he has returned there to kickstart his 2018 training . so far this year he has logged over 1,000 km on strava , a platform he has returned to recently . ",
        "previously , froome was thought to be posting his data to the site under the moniker ` luke skywalker ' , a pseudonym that was accidentally revealed when he went on training rides with now ex-teammate ian boswell . once that became public knowledge , the profile soon disappeared so let 's hope the same does n't happen again this time . see related chris froome returns to strava , logs 1000 km in first week of 2018 ridelondon teams up with zwift as official training partner brexit and the bicycle : what does the uk 's departure from the eu mean for cycling ? ",
        "with rides showing on his open profile from feburary and march 2017 , this could be the same account , renamed and brought out of hibernation . the move to post froome 's rides on a public domain could be seen as an attempt to appear more transparent as he looks to clear his name and enter the 2018 racing season with a clear record . any questions about whether this is a genuine account should be dispelled by a number of factors : it is a verified ` strava athlete ' profile , it 's hard to fake rides of that length , froome is known to revisit south africa on a regular basis . ",
        "with the case surrounding the aaf at the vuelta a espana still very much open , which races we will see froome at this year is far from certain . the big news had been his plans to attempt the giro d'italia-tour de france double , but that race schedule is much less likely now unless the uci and wada come to a fast resolution , and one that is a positive outcome for the rider . cyclists .
