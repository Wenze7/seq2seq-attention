        "india is still open to tesla inc. . setting up operations in the country , even though the electric-car maker has chosen china for its first plant overseas . `` if they are coming , if they are ready to come , we will welcome , we are ready to offer them land and all type of help , '' transport minister nitin gadkari said in an interview . `` presently tesla does n't have any proposal to come to india , '' he said . palo alto , california-based tesla declined to comment . tesla , which last year picked china for its first assembly plant outside of california , had held months of public and private discussions with india before opting for the chinese site . ",
        "chief executive officer elon musk had discussions with indian officials -- some of them made public in twitter posts -- about the nation 's policies on manufacturing and import of electric vehicles . prime minister narendra modi on tuesday told the world economic forum in davos that india is removing red tape and laying out the red carpet for global investors . responding to a question of whether india lost out on an opportunity with tesla , gadkari said it was a decision for the company to make . `` i requested them , i met them in america , but their first point was china at that time , '' he said on tuesday in new delhi . ",
        "musk said in june his company is in discussions with the government of india requesting temporary relief on import penalties or restrictions until a local factory is built . in may , musk flagged concerns about the country 's local sourcing norms , before the government clarified some of them in a tweet . modi 's make in india campaign envisages creating the world 's next manufacturing hub by encouraging domestic and foreign companies to set up factories locally . tesla 's decision also comes as india pursues modi 's ambition for all new car sales to be electric models by 2030 as part of a plan to combat climate change . ",
        "that target is being seen by carmakers as a tough one to achieve because of lack of charging infrastructure and limited manufacturing capabilities of local companies . gadkari sees this scenario changing rapidly . a change in the tax structure for electric and alternative fuel vehicles will lead to a shift to environment-friendly cars , he said . `` i feel we do n't need any deadline , '' gadkari said . `` in two years , you will see the miracle .
