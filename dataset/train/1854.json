        "monrovia , liberia -- liberia 's national elections commission was expected to begin releasing provisional results wednesday from the west african nation 's presidential runoff as a football star and the vice president compete to replace africa 's first female head of state . state radio correspondents reported unofficial results overnight indicating that former international soccer player george weah led in several counties , but election authorities warned the two parties to `` stop making premature pronouncements . `` this is the first time in more than 70 years the nation founded by freed american slaves will see one democratically elected government hand power to another . ",
        "results will be announced progressively , though the elections commission has two weeks to give final results . nearly 2.2 million voters were choosing between the 51-year-old weah and 73-year-old vice president joseph boakai . the winner will replace ellen johnson sirleaf , who is stepping down after two terms . weah led the first round of voting on oct. . 10 but did n't get enough votes to win outright . the runoff was contested twice in court amid claims of irregularities , with its original nov. . 7 date delayed . nobel peace prize winner sirleaf , 79 , is stepping down after two terms in office that brought the impoverished country out of back-to-back civil wars and saw it grapple with a deadly ebola outbreak . ",
        "as polls closed on tuesday , election workers said turnout was n't as high as in october because legislative candidates who helped transport people to polling stations were not participating this time . some liberians said they were n't able to find their names at voting stations and could n't cast a ballot .
