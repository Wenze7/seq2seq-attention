        "the grinch is no match for 5-year-old tylon pittman . tylon was watching youtube videos when he heard the story of the grinch and his plan to ruin christmas . so tylon decided to get some protection , calling 911 in byram , mississippi , on saturday to let the police know the grinch was trying to take his holiday away . the call led a dispatcher to post about the 911 call on facebook , according to the clarion ledger , which caught the attention of a fellow grinch fan , officer lauren develle , who decided to make a personal stop to tylon 's house and keep his home safe from any christmas theft . ",
        "pittman 's brother posted two video clips of the visit on facebook saturday . in the clips with develle , tylon is seen showing her videos of the grinch , telling her what he 'd do if the holiday villain did try to show up to ruin his christmas cheer . `` i 'm going to say put your hands behind your back and get down on the ground , then when he gets on the ground , i 'm gon na say , ` why are you stealing christmas ? ' '' tylon explained to the clarion ledger . ",
        "tylon finally got his chance to ask the grinch that question on monday , when the byram police department brought in a character dressed as the grinch , telling tylon they were putting him in a holding cell for the attempted theft of christmas . when tylon asked the grinch why he was stealing christmas , the grinch just shrugged , the clarion ledger reported , giving tylon a memorable holiday message instead . `` you have saved christmas for the people of byram , '' the grinch told tylon , according to the paper . `` your bravery is unmatched ; you have saved the day . '' ",
        "the christmas hero was given a grinch doll to remember the occasion , and told to come back to apply for a job at the department when he turns 21 , according to the clarion ledger .   "
