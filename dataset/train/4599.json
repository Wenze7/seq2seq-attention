        "look out -- nbc shows like the good place , saturday night live and law and order could soon disappear from hulu . the walt disney company 's announcement today that it will purchase most of 21st century fox 's entertainment assets signals disney 's plans to compete head-to-head with streaming services . but the deal could also mark a new era for hulu , of which disney is now the majority owner . disney 's proposal to buy 21st century fox -- which in stock and debt is valued at around $ 66 billion -- includes the majority of most of 21st century fox 's entertainment assets , including its film and television studios , like fx productions , fox searchlight and twentieth century fox television . ",
        "the deal does not , however , include fox news , fox business or some other live sports networks , which 21st century fox separately announced thursday would be spun off into a separate company named fox that will focus more on news and live sports . the sale -- if approved by regulators -- will make disney , an already massive , many-armed entertainment conglomerate , an even more formidable foe as it seeks to compete aggressively with companies like netflix and amazon . those companies are already pouring vast amounts of money and resources into internet streaming . ",
        "disney has already announced that it plans to establish two new streaming services -- one for entertainment , like disney and pixar movies , and another for sports content . both are expected to launch sometime in 2019 . but more immediately , the deal also marks a major change for hulu , the over-the-top streaming service that launched in 2008 by fox , disney and comcast in an early effort to step into the streaming space . each of those investors had owned 30 percent in the service , and their joint investment in the service has meant that hulu came packed with television programs , as well as streaming rights to fox , abc and nbc . ",
        "as part of the deal , disney will get 21st century fox 's stake in hulu , making disney , for the first time , the majority owner of the streaming service . the deal is expected to affect the types of shows available on hulu , depending on the dynamic between disney and comcast , hulu 's new minority owner . according to recode 's edmund lee , the arrangement might make it less likely that comcast , which owns nbc , would sell its programs to the streaming service . comcast could also , in theory , contest disney 's acquisition of fox 's stake in hulu , and prompt disney to bail on hulu entirely , and sell its stake to comcast . ",
        "with the new resources from its 21st century fox acquisition , disney is also expected to continue its foray into original content -- specifically for streaming . hulu recently saw a major payoff on original content after the original series the handmaids ' tale , which it paid to produce specifically for the streaming service , received widespread acclaim and five emmy awards . disney , with its newly acquired 60 % ownership of the service , could likely continue down that original programming road , as all of the streaming services compete to have the best and most comprehensive original roster of original shows . ",
        "what these new programs will be , and whether they will appear on hulu or on disney 's other streaming services in the works , remains to be seen .   "
