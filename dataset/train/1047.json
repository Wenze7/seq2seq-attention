        "when i was ten , i went to dooars with my parents . these are the things i remember very well - tea in our room , in thermal pyjamas , throwing up omelette every morning on our drive up the hills , and a fat little diary i called my travelogue . i would , every day , pencil in the date and the day 's record - where we went , what we saw , how i felt , what we did . i got social media soon after , and i never again felt the need to keep a travel diary . ",
        "i had a facebook , and then , an instagram , to upload all my photos , and if i really felt strongly about where we went , blogging was always an option . blogging made self censorship a little more necessary , but it made archiving easy and it let me tell the whole world how happy i was . yesterday , we reached shillong , and as we pulled up to our bed-and-breakfast , the khasi man at the wheel proudly informed us that their society is matriarchal . out the car window pane , the city looked like a fairytale - quaint little shops , and a girl in a long flowery dress , and everything looks impossibly storybook . ",
        "it always rains , and in the evening i sit with a book in the balcony , listening to the insistent pitter-patter of the rain mingle with the city sounds . smelling the rains . the yellow light in the balcony mingling with the city lights streaming in . it rains like this , incessantly , adamantly all over meghalaya - megh er alay , home to the clouds . cherrapunji this morning is bitingly cold - so much more than we had anticipated , and already the precise biting grip of that cold , the precise majesty of the mountain roads , the precise mystery of the mist begins to elude me . ",
        "i fear that i will return to the city too soon , to miss these smells and sights and sounds , and then i will not remember any of this too much , too vividly , but only in passing . and majestic as memory , as remembrance can be sometimes , it is , mostly too pathetic , too watered down a version of what once was . memory will insist our senses were not quite so overwhelmed , that we were not , once , quite so happy , quite so devastated . someone once said - i can not remember if it is seth or kerouac , that life is merely an exercise in collecting material for future nostalgia , and the prospect of remembering is important to us , because we , as a people , place too much emphasis on the future . ",
        "as i write , the shillong rains stream down outside , and i know there will be never another moment quite like this . i will sit , someday , in another balcony in another city , and it will rain , and i might think of the fall of 2017 , but i may not remember this sudden dimming of lights outside , or the little departmental store right beside our room . we live a moment a thousand times over if we so wish , but do we ? we chronicle , to stay authentic to our future selves , and yet there will be something we miss out , or that one word that is never quite legible . ",
        "the lived is the lived , the here and the now , just once , and that is the monumentality of human existence . there is never anything as startling , as devastating , as liberating , as this .   "
