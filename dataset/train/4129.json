        "when kona shen returned to the united states in 2014 after several years in haiti , a country was waiting for her , fighting the brutality of the police . shen knew that her next project should be something that would help solve this problem . after graduating from stanford university , she joined fellow student mustafa abdul-hamid to find out which is the most effective way to communicate with police departments . the result is the my90 platform , which allows people to communicate anonymously with local police departments . anyone stopped on the road , accused of something or searched , as well as those who just want to share their experiences , has the right to speak . ",
        "my90 assists in the work of black lives matter and other activist groups , opening a new line of communication between communities and law enforcement agencies . the name of the project was invented on the basis of statistics : `` 90 % of the history is lost when the public and the police interact . '' the startup does not have its own application -- communication takes place via two-way text messages . therefore , users do not need to have a smartphone to share their experiences . `` we are trying to use the most accessible technologies , such as text messages . ",
        "this allows us not only to reach more audiences , but also to attract people who do not interact with platforms such as nextdoor , `` said shen , referring to the neighborhood app that was criticized for being a haven for racism . the whole point of the project is to give people the opportunity to anonymously express their opinion about the professionalism and fairness of law enforcement agencies . they , in turn , receive feedback and can somehow react to the received messages . my90 began its pilot program in the summer of 2016 and now works with law enforcement in santa clara and san jose , california ; pascoe , washington ; indianapolis ; and irving , texas . ",
        "my90 continues to evolve , and for the expansion of the program , the developers plan to collect venture investments that will help cover even more cities and us states . it was recently reported that a technical startup for plastic recycling is struggling with waste in africa .   "
