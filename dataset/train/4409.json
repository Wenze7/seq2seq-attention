        "new york -- former white house strategist steve bannon is catching blame from fellow republicans for coughing up a safe senate seat in deep-red alabama and foisting damaging political advice on president donald trump . but in the aftermath of this week 's stinging alabama defeat , bannon is showing no signs of abandoning his guerrilla war against the gop establishment . bannon wholeheartedly backed roy moore , the insurgent conservative who faltered in tuesday 's special election amid allegations that he had preyed on underage girls decades ago . the accusations prompted the national party to withdraw support for its nominee for a while , but bannon stuck with moore , headlining rallies for the candidate and convincing trump to extend a full-throated endorsement . ",
        "but when moore lost on tuesday , handing the democrats control of their first senate seat in alabama in a generation , republicans turned on bannon . the breitbart news head already had made scores of enemies for declaring a siege on his own party . `` this is a brutal reminder that candidate quality matters regardless of where you are running , '' said steven law , head of the senate leadership fund , a super pac for republicans aligned with gop leadership . `` not only did steve bannon cost us a critical senate seat in one of the most republican states in the country , but he also dragged the president of the united states into his fiasco . ",
        "`` bannon 's team vowed that its revolution would continue , insisting that senate majority leader mitch mcconnell should be the one to take the blame . bannon 's allies dismissed the alabama loss as little more than a temporary setback that would soon be forgotten . they expect that the republicans cheering moore 's loss will simply enrage trump 's most loyal supporters nationwide , who already suspected some republican leaders were trying to undermine the president 's agenda . `` they 're stomping on the very base they need to turn out for their candidates in the general election in 2018 , '' said andy surabian , a senior adviser to the bannon-backed great america pac . ",
        "he contended that `` the average republican voter across the country is pointing their finger at mitch mcconnell and the republican establishment . `` bannon 's team blamed mcconnell for abandoning moore , though it was a somewhat incongruous argument after bannon warned mcconnell to stay out of alabama when moore won the gop primary . on his sirius xm radio show wednesday , bannon credited democrats with `` out-hustling '' the gop on the ground in alabama -- praise that doubled as a swipe at the lack of senate republican campaign committee field staff on the ground in the state . ",
        "the fate of bannon 's insurgency may depend on whether he can keep trump 's ear . in the hours after moore 's loss , trump was restrained , according to a white house official and an outside adviser not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations . some in the west wing had hoped the loss would prompt trump to sever ties with bannon but the president did not seem inclined to take that step , according to the two people . since bannon 's exit from the white house in august , he has remained close to the president , speaking to him frequently by phone , offering political advice and reminding trump of his populist campaign promises . ",
        "though he had grown weary of the infighting bannon initiated in the west wing , trump still valued his former strategist , telling allies that he felt that bannon had a better feel for the president 's base than most of his advisers . he also praised bannon 's pugnacious spirit , seeing in his former aide a brawler similar to himself . bannon tried to steer trump toward moore in the primary but the president , confronted with conflicting advice from his staff , supported incumbent sen. luther strange , who had been appointed to the seat vacated by jeff sessions when he became attorney general . ",
        "but the president was never truly sold on strange , and publicly worried he had backed the wrong candidate . after moore 's primary win , an exultant bannon believed it was the first victory of a gop civil war and , later , urged the president to endorse moore even after the sexual harassment allegations surfaced . trump initially hesitated but then fully embraced moore over objections from aides and republican leadership . publicly , trump on wednesday addressed moore 's loss by acknowledging he `` would have liked to have had the seat '' in the senate as he and gop lawmakers scratch for legislative victories . ",
        "but trump also said , in what could be interpreted as a dig at those in the gop who did not back moore , that `` a lot of republicans feel differently . they feel very happy about the way it turned out . `` bannon 's group indicated they would forge forward with plans to challenge the gop establishment in senate races in as many as 10 states , including arizona , nevada and tennessee , though one adviser suggested that a greater effort may be made on recruiting and screening candidates . but in the hours after the stunning defeat , many republicans reveled in bannon 's failure . ",
        "sen. lindsey graham of south carolina argued that bannon should have called off his guns and simply backed trump 's first choice . `` when it comes to alabama politics steve bannon should have followed president @realdonaldtrump lead in supporting luther strange , '' graham tweeted . `` trump 's instincts on the alabama race proved to be correct . `` and rep. peter king , r-ny , declared that bannon looked `` like some disheveled drunk who wandered onto the political stage . '' `` this is not the type of person we need in politics , '' said king said . '' ",
        "sort of parades himself out there with his weird alt-right views that he has , and to me it 's demeaning the whole government and political process . and last night 's election was a manifestation of the revulsion by the american people .
