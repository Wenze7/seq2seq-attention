        "kabul - january 1 is samad alawi 's birthday . it 's also the birthday of his wife , his two sons , 32 of his friends and thousands of other afghans -- a date chosen for convenience by a generation who do not know when they were born . in the absence of birth certificates or official records , many afghans have long used the seasons or historical events to help determine their age . but the explosion of social media networks such as facebook , which require users to register their birthday , and the growing demand for passports and visas have forced afghans to pick a day -- any day . ",
        "january 1 has become a common choice , although the date is more about practicality than parties . `` it seemed all afghans had birthdays on january 1 , '' samad alawi , who is 43 , said . even those who know their real birth date often choose january 1 because they do not want the hassle of converting their birthday from the solar hijri , an islamic calendar used only in afghanistan and iran . the first day of the year in hijri usually corresponds to march 21 . `` when i first created my facebook account in 2014 it was just easier to choose january 1 as my birthday from the drop down list , '' alawi told afp . ",
        "`` the internet was also slow and it was difficult to convert the date to a western calendar . '' even the official identity card , or tazkira , held by most afghans offers little official clarity , with a person 's age `` determined based on physical appearance '' . `` my tazkira says i was three years old in 1365 in the hijri calendar . that is the year my tazkira was issued , '' abdul hadi , who is now 34 , told afp . `` there is no blank space for a date of birth in an afghan tazkira . ",
        "how can you remember your date of birth if you do n't have one on the record ? `` authorities are trying to change that . in recent years afghan hospitals in major cities have started issuing newborn babies with birth certificates -- something previous generations lack . the government also plans to issue e-tazkiras , or computerised national id cards , to afghans which would include their date of birth , if it is known . but the process has been stalled for years by political and technical problems . in the absence of official records , some educated parents resort to recording their children 's birthdays on slips of paper which are often kept in a copy of the koran . ",
        "`` i hope one day all afghans have their proper date of births so that social media does n't have to tell them how old they are , '' alawi said .   "
