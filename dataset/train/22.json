        "about the author tony seskussenior producer western digital business unit tony seskus is senior producer with cbc 's western business unit in calgary . he has written for newspapers and wire services for more than 25 years , covering news in britain , the united states and africa . in calgary , tony has reported on the energy sector as well as municipal , provincial and federal politics . an important year in the energy sector lies ahead , with pipeline disputes , opec trying to keep a grip on oil prices and a lot of u. s. natural gas about to flood the market . ",
        "while many stories will be unfolding in the coming months , here are five that are sure to be making headlines . fuel prices consumers can expect to pay more to fill up in 2018 , according to dan mcteague , senior petroleum analyst at gasbuddy . com . mcteague anticipates gasoline prices will rise in the second half of the year as the u. s. economy strengthens and demand spikes . it 's likely , he says , canadians will see , on average , about a five-cent-per-litre increase in 2018 versus averages in 2017 . `` the whole issue of demand in the united states continues to drive prices up for canadians , whether we like it or not , '' he says . ",
        "`` we are price takers , not price makers . '' a strengthening u. s. dollar and provincial carbon taxes may also add to the pump price . pipelines do n't expect an end to the pipeline drama as three major energy infrastructure projects remain in the spotlight in 2018 : trans mountain , keystone xl and line 3 . pipeline supporters , including alberta 's ndp government , believe the multibillion-dollar projects are needed to ease a transportation squeeze resulting from growing production and limited shipping options . it 's one factor in why canadian heavy oil sells at a discount to u. s. crude . ",
        "new pipe would help . but opponents -- whether they are jurisdictions , environmentalists or indigenous groups -- remain determined to stop the pipelines . their concerns are often both intensely local , like the direct impact on the landscape , and also part of the broader climate change issue . despite controversy , observers expect progress on line 3 and trans mountain in the coming year . transcanada expects to secure final federal u. s. permits for keystone xl in early 2018 . meanwhile , canadian natural gas producers will be watching what happens next year when new pipelines start to move a lot more appalachian gas out of pennsylvania , west virginia and ohio and into the continental market . ",
        "`` so it 's just a question as to how quickly some of that gas will come on , and what it will do to gas prices , '' said samir kayande , director at industry research firm rs energy group in calgary . `` it is just a tremendous success story from a productivity standpoint -- and it 's frankly a disaster from a gas market standpoint , because it 's a lot of cheap gas that 's hitting the market , '' he said . opec opec and its non-opec allies , including russia , surprised observers last year when they agreed to oil production cuts -- and then stuck to them . ",
        "with time running out on the pact , they agreed in the fall to maintain the cuts for all of 2018 . the agreement is aimed at drawing down the surplus oil inventories that have dampened crude prices . `` we have seen very good compliance numbers from the opec members as well as russia , '' said dinara millington , vice-president of research at the canadian energy research institute . `` whether that will hold or not remains to be seen . '' the cartel will reassess target production levels according to market conditions at their june 2018 meeting . ",
        "in the meantime , opec and others will be watching to see if their efforts will be undermined by oil production increases from u. s. shale . u. s. shale what will u. s. shale producers do in 2018 ? the answer is critical , and even the most informed prognosticators at opec and the international energy agency ca n't agree on what will happen . prolific shale production has reshaped the energy landscape in recent years . it 's also a vital component of u. s. president donald trump 's `` america first '' energy plan , with the potential to turn the world 's largest oil-consuming nation into a net exporter of oil by the middle of the next decade . ",
        "but the more pressing issue is whether there 's a big wave of shale production coming next year . opec does n't think it will be big enough to harm the cartel 's efforts to erase the oil glut . the iea , meanwhile , thinks u. s. crude production will be strong and keep the overhang in place . `` the big macro question in this industry right now , on the liquids side , is which one of those is the right one , '' said ian nieboer , also of rs energy group . `` both ca n't be . '' ",
        "renewable energy no discussion about energy in 2018 can ignore the role of renewables . `` this is a sector that 's growing faster than any of the other energy sectors out there , '' says warren mabee , canada research chair in renewable energy development and implementation at queen ` s university in kingston , ont . `` it 's going to continue moving forward . '' decisions made this year will ring into 2018 , including fallout from b. c. 's decision to proceed with the site c hydroelectric dam , and alberta 's aggressive plan to build 600 megawatts of new wind generation by 2019 . ",
        "but mabee is also looking for 2018 to provide key advances in solar panel development as the industry inches closer to grid parity -- the point at which it might be cheaper for people to generate electrons on their roof than to buy electrons from a utility . `` it might not happen next year , but we 're moving closer and closer , '' he said . `` that 's going to be a hugely disruptive moment in the canadian power industry .
