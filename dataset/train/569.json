        "europe and iran are to put on a united front in support of the landmark 2015 nuclear deal at talks in brussels thursday as washington mulls reimposing sanctions on tehran . the european union and the foreign ministers of britain , germany and france will unite to defend the accord , which curbed iran 's nuclear ambitions in return for the relaxing of punishing sanctions but which us president donald trump has repeatedly criticised and threatened to leave . while eu diplomatic chief federica mogherini wants to keep the nuclear issue separate from other contentious issues with tehran , iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif will also face tough questions about recent anti-government protests which left 21 people dead . ",
        "trump , who in october refused to certify iran was complying with the deal but stopped short of withdrawing from it , is expected to decide on friday whether to extend waivers on nuclear-related sanctions against tehran . the eu and other world powers have repeatedly warned it would be a mistake to abandon the deal , thrashed out with iran over 12 years by the us , britain , france , china , germany and russia . british foreign minister boris johnson called the deal `` a crucial agreement that makes the world safer '' . `` it is vital that we continue to work with our european partners to preserve the iran deal , and with it the security and prosperity it is bringing to the people of iran and the world , '' he said . ",
        "- iran warning - according to two us sources , trump had not made a decision by wednesday , while johnson told the british parliament on tuesday that london was urging `` our friends in the white house not to throw it away '' . iran , which on monday warned the world to get ready for washington abandoning the deal , has said if the us walks away from the agreement it is ready to give an `` appropriate and heavy response '' . zarif , who travelled to moscow on wednesday to seek russian support , criticised what he called washington 's `` destructive policy '' . ",
        "`` the united states must understand the unity of the international community over the nuclear deal and change their position as a result , '' zarif said , urging world powers to `` resist the hostile actions '' of the trump administration . the international atomic energy agency has repeatedly said iran is keeping up its side of the agreement , most recently in november . after talks in moscow on wednesday zarif tweeted a warning . `` everyone agrees it is imperative that all live up to their obligations under jcpoa . iaea has verified iran 's full compliance , but continuation will depend on full us compliance , '' he wrote . ",
        "jcpoa is the official name for the deal . - punishing tehran - mogherini , who played an important role in crafting the nuclear accord , has vowed to preserve the deal and has lobbied us lawmakers in washington . us congress is working on a way to punish iran for its continuing ballistic missile programme and meddling in middle east conflicts such as yemen and syria . johnson said these issues would be `` an important part of our conversation '' in brussels on thursday -- along with the recent unrest in iran . `` i will be making it clear to foreign minister zarif , on the subject of the recent protests in iran , that the right to peaceful demonstration within the law is central to any truly thriving society , '' johnson said . ",
        "the 28-member eu has condemned the `` unacceptable loss of human lives '' in the protests and stressed that peaceful protest and freedom of expression are `` fundamental rights '' . burs-pdw/arp/hmw / klm .   "
