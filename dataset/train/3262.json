        "while lavar ball continues to bash luke walton , the lakers head coach showed yesterday that he 's the right man to handle the criticism . for some coaches like rick carlisle , blasting back at lavar with fire and fury is their knee-jerk response . however , that is n't how luke walton likes to roll . after benching lonzo ball early in the first quarter , walton received a ton of questions for that move . well , walton 's response might have you in tears : luke walton on why he subbed out lonzo early , `` his dad was talking sh -- t so i took him out early . '' ",
        "he waited a good two seconds before he smiled and made sure everyone knew he was kidding . -- ramona shelburne january 8 , 2018 . talk about hitting back at lavar with humor . walton clearly does n't mind being a wise guy if he has to . luke walton is asked why lonzo ball came out midway through the first and third quarters . walton cracked , `` um yeah , his dad was talking s -- so i took him out early . '' pic . twitter . com/kaqrrjszln -- ohm youngmisuk january 8 , 2018 . ",
        "as awesome as this response was , perhaps walton should get even edgier with his jokes . it 's not like he and lonzo have a bad working relationship . lonzo ball on whether he is happy with luke walton as lakers head coach : `` i 'll play for anybody . '' pic . twitter . com/9msqfmreqo -- bill oram january 7 , 2018 . the greatest part about all of this is that walton clearly is n't phased by this distraction . for the past year , lavar ball has dominated the media with his outlandish takes and humorous approach . ",
        "maybe it 's time for people to get back at him with his own tactics . the record might not indicate it yet , but it 's scenarios like these that prove walton is the man for the job in los angeles . hopefully the serious lavar ball against comical luke walton rivalry continues , as it 's already provided great fodder .
