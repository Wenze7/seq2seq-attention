        "all sport/getty imagesarsenal has become the first major football club to sign a deal to promote a crypto-currency . the club has reached an agreement with the gaming company cashbet , which is planning to launch its own currency cashbet coin . it will see cashbet coin advertised at arsenal 's premier league home games . but one crypto-currency expert has questioned whether the club is wise to promote what can be a very risky investment . cashbet is a californian online gaming business formed in 2012 , which is now launching an initial coin offering . it aims to raise $ 40m by getting investors to buy cashbet coins which can then be used to bet on its various online games . ",
        "arsenal 's chief commercial officer vinai venkatesham said : `` we are looking forward to working with cashbet coin as they launch their new crypto-currency . `` i 've asked arsenal whether it was wise to endorse a highly volatile business and whether it was encouraging fans to encourage fans to bet with cashbet coins . a spokesman said the club was too busy preparing for its carabao cup clash with chelsea to comment today . ` high risk ` icos have become an extremely popular way for businesses to raise money following the surge in value of bitcoin , the original crypto-currency . ",
        "but they are unregulated and investors who buy the coins have no stake in the business and receive no dividends . they hope to profit from the rising value of the crypto-currency . the financial conduct authority has warned that icos are `` high-risk , speculative investments '' . david braben , whose book `` attack of the 50 foot blockchain '' warns about the risks of investing in crypto-currencies , says arsenal fans who might be encouraged to see cashbet coins as a new way of betting need to be cautious . `` crypto-currencies are less regulated than regular betting shops and it 's a lot harder to get actual pounds back out again , '' mr braben said . ",
        "while cashbet says it is regulated by the uk gambling commission and the alderney gambling control commission , a spokesman admitted that did not apply to its new crypto-currency venture . he said that punters who bet with cashbet 's currency would eventually be able to convert their winnings into cash on third party exchanges .
