        "doha - world number five dominic thiem eased through to the quarter-finals of the qatar open wednesday , but the tournament is now guaranteed a non-seeded finalist because so many of the highest-ranked players crashed out . thiem , the number one seed , won his second round match against slovenia 's aljaz bedene in straight sets 7-5 , 6-4 , but said the contest was tougher than the scoreline suggested . `` i 'm pleased today , i 'm through in straight sets , '' he told reporters . `` it was a tough match , but i expected it and had two tough matches which i both won in straight sets . ",
        "`` so i think that 's a perfect start into the new year . `` the austrian is one of only two seeds left in the competition and could face the other , veteran frenchman richard gasquet in the last eight . fifth seed gasquet meets greek qualifier stefanos tsitsipas later on wednesday . the six other seeds have all been knocked out , even though the tournament has only reached the second round . that means an unseeded player will reach the final in doha for the first time since gael monfils in 2014 . spain 's fernando verdasco and feliciano lopez were the latest seeds to fall on wednesday . ",
        "russia 's andrey rublev , 20 , beat veteran seventh seed verdasco in three sets , 6-4 , 3-6 , 6-4 in a centre court match watched by qatar 's emir sheikh tamim bin hamad al-thani and paris saint-germain president nasser al-khelaifi . the high-profile pair are former tennis partners and khelaifi is also president of the qatar tennis federation . rublev , the world number 39 , broke verdasco in the ninth game of the final set , then saved two break points as he served out for victory . `` of course i 'm really happy , '' said rublev . ",
        "`` i 'm happy to take my revenge because i lost against fernando a few months ago . `` earlier , world number 138 and wildcard mirza basic shocked eighth seed lopez with a straight sets victory 6-4 , 7-6 . lopez is ranked 102 places higher than the bosnian in the world standings . the defeated spaniards join second seed pablo carreno busta , as well as tomas berdych , albert ramos-vinolas and filip krajinovic -- numbers three , four and six respectively -- all falling at the first hurdle . the carnage among the seeds comes after the tournament was shorn of three major stars before it began , with novak djokovic , stan wawrinka and jo-wilfried tsonga pulling out as they try to recover from injuries . ",
        "with so many seeds gone , it may provide an opportunity for one of the game 's emerging stars to shine , such as rublev or the man he will play in the quarter-finals , borna coric , the world number 48 . croatian coric , 21 , followed up his impressive first round victory over carreno busta by easily dealing with blustery conditions on an outside court as he romped to a 6-1 , 6-3 win over nikoloz basilashvili on wednesday , his first tour win over the georgian .
