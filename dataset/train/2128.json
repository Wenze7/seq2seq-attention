        "florida sen. marco rubio on thursday threw a last-minute curve at the gop 's tax-reform bill -- telling senate leaders he 'd vote against the plan unless it included a larger expansion of a child tax credit to help low-income families . `` i think my requests have been pretty reasonable and consistent and direct . right now , the refundability level is $ 1,100 ; it needs to be higher , '' said the florida republican , whom president trump mocked as `` little marco '' on the campaign trail . `` it 's a pretty straightforward ask . ",
        "if the refundable portion of the child credit is substantially increased beyond the $ 1,100 it currently is , i 'll vote for the bill . if it 's not , i wo n't . '' rubio and utah gop sen. mike lee proposed to expand the tax credit as part of the bill that passed the senate , but the gop leadership shot down the effort . if rubio votes against the bill , republicans can afford to lose just one more vote from their caucus and still be able to pass it , with vice president mike pence breaking a 50-50 tie . ",
        "the gop holds a 52-48 majority that will become narrower still when democratic sen. - elect doug jones of alabama is sworn in . pence will delay his trip to the middle east to be available for a vote , the white house said . tennessee gop sen. bob corker said he opposes the plan because it swells the federal debt by an expected $ 1.5 trillion over a decade , but has not definitively said that he would vote against it . `` my deficit concerns have not been alleviated , '' he said . arizona sen. john mccain is in the hospital being treated for brain cancer , and maine sen. susan collins is on the fence , leaving the bill 's fate up in the air . ",
        "south carolina sen. lindsey graham , mccain 's best friend on capitol hill , said he spoke with mccain 's wife , cindy , and was optimistic the arizona lawmaker would be back soon . collins , whose no vote helped torpedo the gop 's effort to repeal obamacare , said she would not decide how she 'll vote until she sees the final bill . she voted for the original senate bill . the white house said that it would continue working with rubio and other possible holdouts . `` i think he 'll get there , '' trump said about rubio . ",
        "the deal would cut the top tax bracket from 39.6 percent to 37 percent -- a huge gift to the wealthiest americans -- and trim the corporate rate from 36 percent to 21 percent . negotiators were leaning toward maintaining the seven tax brackets from the senate bill rather than the four in the house bill . it would also cap deductions for state and local income , sales and property taxes at $ 10,000 a year . and it would let homeowners deduct interest on the first $ 750,000 of a new mortgage . current mortgages would not be affected . ",
        "the agreement between house and senate negotiators would allow taxpayers to continue deducting hefty out-of-pocket medical expenses , and keep allowing graduate students who receive tuition waivers to avoid taxes on the benefit . the bill would also repeal the obamacare mandate that individuals buy health insurance or pay a penalty . congressional gop leaders planned to unveil details of the bill on friday , including expected changes in the tax brackets that should provide at least modest relief to middle-class americans . additional reporting by marisa schultz with ap .
