        "for as long as there have been pc games , there have been modders turning them into star wars games . some mods add stormtrooper skins or lightsabers , and some are massively ambitious total conversions that warrant recognition as full star wars games in their own right . whether you 're looking for a few cosmetic additions or you want your game to be completely transported to a galaxy far , far away , here are the best star wars mods for pc games . stellaris makes a great fit for some sprawling star wars strategy . this total conversion adds a galaxy with almost 1,000 systems , republic and empire ship sets , accurately named and located planets and hyperlane routes , plus custom loading screens and ambient star wars music .

        "pilot all sorts of ships from the star wars universe , from the plucky x-wing to a massive star destroyer . -- chris livingstonmoddb linkwhile most star wars mods take the form of total conversions that replace near every aspect , requiem takes a different approach . it posits the theory that sins of a solar empire and star wars take place in the same universe -- and shows what would happen if the two worlds were to ever collide . predictably , after stumbling upon sins ' little patch of spacetime , the empire decides to conquer it in the name of ol' electric hands himself , emperor palpatine . ",
        "in response , the warring factions of sins come together as the alliance . as an extension of sins rather than an entire overhaul , requiem should suit players who do n't want to throw its finely tuned balance out with the bathwater . -- tom sykesofficial mod pagean astonishingly ambitious mod for the medieval sword - 'em - up that fully integrates the star wars universe from the galaxy-spanning world map to lightsaber combat , custom races and working speeders . it 's not available for mount & blade : warband , however , so if that 's your preferred platform you should look up the bear force ii mod instead .

",
        "-- tom sykes moddb linkthe 2142 community has struggled to maintain new multiplayer mods since ea axed the servers , so the next release for this star wars total conversion will focus on singleplayer . multiplayer mods may be possible again fairly soon , however . that 's a good thing : first strike amounts to an interim sequel to battlefront ii , with dogfighting , a selection of vehicles , and a range of detailed maps . -- chris thursten official mod pagethis battlefield 1942 mod lets you choose between the galactic civil war and the clone wars , then do battle on land or in space .

        "-- chris livingstonsteam workshop linkdespite the aging engine , this is one of the better-looking modern star wars games -- let alone mods . it 's a total conversion for modern warfare 's multiplayer that incorporates star wars weapons to a rare degree of fidelity . a huge effort went into building maps that feel like replicas of the movie sets , and the foundation of an already-strong shooter enhances the feel of combat from the outset . -- chris thursten moddb linkwith the kickstarter for nexus 2 failing to get off the ground back in 2012 , mods will be our only way to enjoy more of the cromulent the jupiter incident for the foreseeable future .
