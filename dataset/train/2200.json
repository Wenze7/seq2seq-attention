        "dell 's xps 13 has been one of our favorite laptops for years , and with good reason . its compact design , brilliant display , comfortable keyboard and long battery life make it a well-rounded device . dell was n't content to simply offer an incremental upgrade this year , though . it has given the xps 13 a makeover , with narrower bezels , a new cooling system and a white option with a stain-resistant coating . that sounds like a lot , but on the outside the xps 13 does n't appear to have changed much . ",
        "at least , not when you 're looking at the silver/grey version anyway . the rose gold/white edition , though , will catch your eye . while i 'm not a fan of the new color , i appreciate that dell found a way to keep it from yellowing or getting stained . the white xps 13 uses a glass fiber weave with coating to prevent discoloration , especially the areas where your palms rest . during a recent briefing , a dell rep showed me how marks from a sharpie were easily cleaned off a sample swatch . according to the company , this effectively repels most substances , but its kryptonite is mustard and sunscreen . ",
        "so do n't bring your laptop to the beach or a hotdog eating contest . in addition to the new color , the xps 13 also sports a thinner , lighter design , now weighing in at 2.67 pounds . that 's practically featherweight , but then again the xps 13 has always been easy to carry around . still , we always appreciate carrying a lighter load . while the new xps 13 still has the same awkward webcam placement as its predecessor , it 's been upgraded to an infrared sensor for windows hello support . with that , you can log into your computer with your face , or by using the fingerprint sensor embedded into the power button . ",
        "i did n't get to test either of these authentication methods during my demo , though . inside , the xps 13 packs a quad-core eighth-generation intel processor that dell says helps the new laptop render and encode videos in adobe premiere pro twice as fast as the 2015 model . that 's just one specific test to show how well the system should perform , of course -- your experience may vary . there 's also a new dual heat pipe and fan cooling system , as well as gore thermal insulation covering certain parts of the system like the processor and gpu to keep temperatures low . ",
        "i did n't get to push the xps 13 enough to really test these performance and cooling claims during my briefing , so we 'll have to wait till we get a review unit . i did like the xps 13 's screen , though . it 's surrounded by the latest version of dell 's `` infinityedge '' bezel , which is now 23 percent narrower than the previous generation . the border , which was barely there before , now looks like it 's almost gone -- and the effect is a display that blends into what 's behind it while still managing to look inviting and vibrant . ",
        "the screen is now available up to 4k and supports a new suite of technologies called dell cinema . this enables hdr playback , waves maxx audio enhancements for `` studio-quality '' sound , as well as streaming prioritization to minimize buffer lag . at my hands-on , videos that dell showed did appear to have deeper blacks and higher contrast ratios with the cinema enhancements applied . it was difficult to deduce the effect on the laptop 's speaker sound quality and streaming speed in the demo environment , though . all told , the new xps 13 feels like a timely refresh , given the industry 's pivot to 4k hdr in recent years . ",
        "it 's challenging to keep refining and improving an already successful product , but so far it appears dell 's latest has what it takes to live up to the excellent reputation it has established with the xps series . it 'll be available today starting at $ 1,000 , like its convertible brother . click here to catch up on the latest news from ces 2018 . this article originally appeared on engadget at = txtlnkusaolp00000595 .
