        "the toronto maple leafs need a right-handed top-four defenseman . the toronto maple leafs should be targeting colin miller of the las vegas golden knights . he is a player who could help the leafs in every way . sure , the knights are having a good season and may not want to trade one of their best players . they should , however , be self-aware enough to realize that they need to build for the future and not pursue a championship this season . which means that they may be open to trading one of their most valuable players . ",
        "in the summer , after acquiring miller in the expansion draft , there was a huge rumour that he was coming to the leafs , so it 's reasonable to think that they like this player and would be interested in him . back in the summer i wrote about how i 'd like the leafs to get him , and now i 'd like to go a little deeper into why . great seasoni said at the time it was a huge mistake for boston not to protect miller , but their gm did n't take my advice for some reason . ",
        "since then , miller has exploded . miller has 19 points in 33 games , which puts him top-30 among defenseman . he is right-handed , which the leafs need . he is top ten in expected goals against , and his 56 % corsi is ninth best in the nhl . furthermore , at even-strength , miller allows the third least shots per 60 minutes among all defenseman . shots allowed are easily the leafs biggest weakness as a team . more from editor in leaf toronto maple leafs : heading into christmas on a winning note14m ago toronto marlies notebook : a weekend worth forgetting8h ago three best moments for the toronto maple leafs in 201711h ago auston matthews had concussion ; back tonight12h ago toronto maple leafs look to rebound vs rangers12h ago to sum up : he scores , he defends , and his team is among the best in hockey while he 's on the ice . ",
        "he is also only 25 and right-handed . colin miller is the best defenseman in the nhl that no one knows about . the toronto maple leafs need to pursue him . the costit 's really too bad the toronto maple leafs did n't pursue miller harder in the summer when he 'd be cheaper . still , it 's worth it to pay for him -- partner him with morgan rielly and you have one of the best top-pairings in the nhl . or play him with gardiner , i do n't care , he is awesome . what would the cost be ? ",
        "a first round draft pick and connor brown probably gets it done , or at least provides a good basis for a deal . sure , you hate to lose brown , but if you think about it , he 's the logical trade chip . the leafs ca n't lose komarov because he 's their best defensive player . even if you move nylander to centre , you still have marner and komarov ahead of brown and nowhere to play kasperi kapanen who is probably better than brown defensively and one of the fastest players in the nhl . ",
        "connor brown is the odd man out and i 'd bet good money on it . i do n't want him to leave , because i 'm a huge fan , but it 's obvious the leafs current situation is unsustainable , and if you want to get something good , you have to give something good . brown is two years younger than miller and has 30 goal potential . the knights should be pursuing youth and goals . add in a first round pick and i think it 's a fair deal . not a bad price to pay for a top-pairing potential defenseman who addresses all your specific needs .
