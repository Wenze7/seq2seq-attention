        "by shaun boyddenver -- as the government reopens , immigration activists in colorado and across the country are blasting democrats for what they see as a sellout . the shutdown was meant to force republicans hands on protection for dreamers , butdemocrats ultimately relented . the anti-trump group `` indivisibles '' crashed the denver office of sen. michael bennet to protest while dreamers , like marco dorado , lost faith in colorado 's delegation . cbs4 's shaun boyd interviews marco dorado . `` by virtue of doing nothing on this issue and not standing our ground and making sure we 're doing what the american people want us to do , we 're turning our backs on individuals like myself , '' said dorado . ",
        "bennet 's sent a statement following the end of the shutdown : `` the senate just passed the fourth temporary budget extension of this fiscal year . this is an unacceptable and disgraceful way to run our federal government . but continuing the government shutdown would have been worse . '' republican leader mitch mcconnell agreed to take up dreamer legislation in the next two and a half weeks in exchange for democrats reopening the government . senators michael bennet and cory gardner but , colorado 's republican sen. cory gardner says that was always the plan . `` the government gets shut down and three days later people realize they 've made a mistake , it was the wrong thing to do , and they agree to basically the same thing they could have agreed to on friday , '' said gardner . ",
        "`` unfortunately , they create a lot collateral damage in between . '' gardner and bennet are part of a small group of senators to draft a compromise bill that gives dreamers a path to citizenship and allocates nearly $ 3 billion to border security . they 're now working against the clock to build support . `` i do n't think this is going to be impossible , '' said gardner . `` i think this is going to be tough , there 's no doubt about that , but we have to solve this problem . real lives are at stake and that 's the security we need to give so many thousands and thousands of people across colorado and the country . '' ",
        "dorado , one of some 17,000 dreamers in colorado alone , said `` i 'm cautiously optimistic about the feb. . 8 deadline , but congress has had so many opportunities , so many deadlines to meet , and nothing has happened . '' one provision in the bill both sides agreed on is a six-year re-authorization of the childrens ' health insurance program . shaun boyd is cbs4 's political specialist . she 's a veteran reporter with more than 25 years of experience . follow her on twitter @cbs4shaun .
