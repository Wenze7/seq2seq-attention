        "man utd midfielder juan mata has long established himself as one of the nicest guys in football and his player of the month vote reflects that . juan mata has called on jesse lingard to be crowned manchester united 's player of the month - despite also being up for the award . united sent a call out on instagram for supporters to vote for the club 's best performer in december , with phil jones joining mata and lingard on the three-man shortlist . amid the thousands upon thousands of comments on the post , mata popped up with one simple response : `` jesse . ",
        "`` mata enjoyed a brilliant december , scoring twice and creating a further three goals , and provided one of the moments of united 's festive season with a stunning free-kick at leicester . but the spaniard , who helped launch the inspiring common goal initiative in august , has selflessly put forward lingard for the monthly honour - and few would disagree with him . the 25-year-old maintained his remarkable run of form with a now trademark solo goal to seal all three points in united 's 2-0 win against everton on new year 's day . it was the warrington lad 's 10th goal of the season and his sixth since the start of december ; only tottenham superstar harry kane has scored more premier league goals in that period . ",
        "lingard scored twice against both arsenal and burnley in december and also helped set up mata 's second goal in the 2-2 draw with leicester . and jose mourinho has been among those who has been impressed by his exploits of late . `` these boys -- they either jump or they do n't jump , '' he said after the win against everton . `` it 's one thing to be a young talent , and another thing is to be a very good player . one manchester united player needs the fa cup more than anyone else `` some players are not capable to do that jump . ",
        "they go from great potential young players to normal players . i think jesse is making that jump . `` he is being more consistent , he is adaptable , he understands better the game , he understands the different spaces and positions . i think he is going in a good direction .
