        "designer benjamin geskin has taken to twitter with some conceptual renderings for a samsung galaxy note-branded device he hopes could be seen in 2020 . the images are , it probably goes without saying , unofficial and not intended to show any current projects samsung is working on or to be based on anything other than the general progression of samsung 's design cues . there also have n't been any details listed with regard to the internal specifications the designer would expect from a galaxy note released in that year . the device pictured actually bears no brand-designation , either , so it is n't even really possible to say which iteration of the samsung galaxy note is being represented . ",
        "bearing that in mind , a few details may be surmisable form the images themselves , since the renders are exceptionally well-made . in any case , it 's always fun to speculate about what may be in store for the high-end handsets of the future . perhaps the most immediately noticeable feature shown in the concept renders is a nearly complete lack of bezels surrounding the screen of this imagined galaxy note handset of the future . at the same time , every edge of the handset pictured appears to be comfortably rounded off on both the front and back . ",
        "the only portion along the front of the device that is n't part of the display is a notch along the top where the front facing camera , sensors , and the speaker would be housed . the fingerprint scanner , meanwhile , has been built directly into the display -- as represented by a fingerprint icon on the lower part of the screen . that leaves the back of this concept looking remarkably clean , with the sleekness of the back glass interrupted only by the dual-cameras , heart rate sensor , and accompanying dual-tone led flash . the power and volume rocker buttons along the right and left edges of the device also appear to protrude less , which lends well to the overall aesthetic appeal . ",
        "the renowned galaxy note s pen is also shown tucked in along the bottom of the handset , next to a single bottom-firing speaker , 3.5 mm headphone jack , and usb type-c charging port . as already mentioned above , this design is completely fan-made . so it 's unlikely that samsung has anything quite like it in the works for the near future -- let alone planned as far out as the year 2020 . having said that , it is a good attempt to capture the essence of samsung 's design language as it might be shown in the future , building on current designs being put forward by the company . ",
        "it also holds true to some of the features samsung has been working to achieve , such as a behind-the-display fingerprint scanner . the post fan-made renders of future galaxy note device pop up online appeared first on androidheadlines . com | .   "
