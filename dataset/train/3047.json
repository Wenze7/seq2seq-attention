        "what 's this ? will smith , new king of instagram , had himself an australian adventure . image : hanna lassen/wireimageby johnny lieu2018-01-18 02:39:01 utcfor a guy who 's still pretty new to instagram , will smith is killing it . the actor only joined the social platform in december , but for his big trip to australia to promote his not-so-great netflix movie bright , he 's really let us into his world . while there are plethora of pr-approved , tightly curated celebrity accounts out there , smith 's stream of instagram posts indicate he is n't shy about being a bit of a dorky dad that 's just having a helluva good time down under . ",
        "prime example : his trip to sydney 's taronga zoo where he offered up some excellent narration when he came face-to-face with a crocodile , and met with a very cute and sleepy wombat . he 's been taking selfies in front of an australian icon , the sydney opera house . and raving about how damn good sydney 's food is , even if he hates people taking pictures of it . he 's managed to get a bit of local culture into him . smith may have only been in australia for a few days , but he 's already trying his hand at local slang . ",
        "look , if will smith tried to sue bondi beach coffee roaster will & co , we reckon they 'd be flattered . seriously , he 's just having the best time ever .   "
