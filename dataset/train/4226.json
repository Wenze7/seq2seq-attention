        "osaka university researchers developed a highly efficient way to produce chiral multi-centered fused tricyclic compounds of which core structure is often found in bioactive compounds including medicines . chemists have devoted tremendous efforts to develop a way to build molecules as they want . a single enantiomer is essential for molecules of specific biomedical properties because of chiral nature of biological receptor sites . a very challenging goal in organic chemistry is asymmetric synthesis , selective preparation of a single enantiomer of a molecule . recently , chemists at osaka university has synthesized highly enantioselective polycyclic chiral compounds with multiple chiral centers in an elegant and selective manner that could open new avenues in research and industry . ",
        "in their report in nature communications , the osaka team focused to develop a novel and practical way to synthesize tricyclic molecules , named hydronaphthofurans . these scaffolds are abundant in natural products of important biological activities . the representative members of this family are morphine , azadirachtin , teucvidin and momilacton that are well-known to show a range of biological activities such as analgesic , anti-tumor , insecticides , and allelochemicals . although some are found in nature , preparing them in the synthetic laboratory with the complete control of selectivity is a major challenge to the synthetic chemists . ",
        "a reported synthesis by a spanish group used an organic molecule based chiral catalyst to produce a tricyclic scaffold with three chiral centers . on the other hand , the osaka team adopted a conceptually different strategy to build the tricyclic scaffold with five chiral centers . starting with a cheap raw material with just one ring , they used an organometallic nickel-based chiral catalyst to construct further two rings through a reaction termed oxidative cyclization . in situ displacement of nickel from an intermediate 2 with another reactive molecule of desired substituents afforded a variety of hydronaphthofurans . the final product is formed as single isomer and that contained at least five chiral centers , distributed among all three rings . ",
        "ravindra kumar , a one of the team member explains , `` the catalyst is key to chiral selectivity , since it is chiral itself . '' in fact , although the application of nickel catalysts are widespread in organic synthesis , none had used in this reaction before . `` in an organometallic catalyst , it 's crucial to attach a suitable ligand to the metal atom to determine the reaction outcome . the ligand is typically a bulky organic molecule with multiple ring systems . in our case , it was a process of informed trial-and-error to find a suitable ligand that gave the desired product as a single compound both in high yield and with excellent chiral purity . ",
        "with the suitable catalyst in hand , the team successfully produced over twenty compounds in good yields and with 94 to 99 % enantioselectivity of all five chiral centers - a spectacle achievement ! tolerance of a wide range of substituents in the developed method and presence of functionalizable group expand the potential synthetic utility of tricyclic products to bioactive molecules after functional group transformation . apart from offering excellent chiral purity , the reaction is also rapid and economical in terms of starting raw materials , which are crucial requirements for scaling up the research from laboratory to industrial production . ",
        "`` these tricyclic products have traditionally been made by stepwise ring construction , but that tends to be slow and inefficient , '' sensuke ogoshi , the team director , says . `` our direct two-step cyclization provides access to a range of very useful scaffolds for natural products . in the long run , this could not only simplify the production of known medicines , but perhaps lead to the discovery of new compounds with medicinal or other biological properties .
