        "it 's been a crazy week since i started work . a new job that demands all of my time . i suddenly found myself from having days to plan and draw my comics to having nothing more than a few hours to come up with new ones . so i did what anyone else would do in my position i bemoaned my fate . after much whining and gnashing of the teeth . i ended up on a tuesday hours away from my weekly deadline with no comic , not even an idea for one . with nothing more to look forward to than a day already full of scheduled meetings and client calls . ",
        "i found myself in my daily morning cab , my usual commute time increased by half an hour due to increased traffic . it 's already an hour long . so i did what anybody else would do , dreamt of immigrating to a foreign country where people only bicycled to work . where offices were a coffee run away . i had already composed an apology note to the regulars who followed my comic , a handful of friends and relatives , citing insane work hours as an excuse for the lack of inspiration . i was just about to post the note and try to work away the disappointment for missing a deadline for the only consistent thing in my life . ",
        "the only thing that had seen me through unemployment and turmoil . thankfully that 's when the desperation kicked in like it always did . when i give up , my desperation refuses to give up on me . so i pulled out my ipad in an uber pool hitched up my backpack to use as support , downloaded my reference images on my iphone , airdropped them to my ipad and started drawing in the cab itself with two very bewildered co-passengers staring at me . it was horrible , the lines came out all squiggly , it was a bitch trying to draw as we hit potholes . ",
        "it 's hard to think of humour when surrounded by the cacophony of tooting horns and indian obscenities . somehow by the time i reached office an hour and a half later . the cab got delayed even more . i had a comic ready . of course it was n't my best work , of course the art was shit . but it was still better than nothing . i posted it as soon as i got in . since then drawing in cabs is a new skill i 'm developing . it 's taking me two cab rides to draw a strip as of now .

        "i 'm hoping to bring it down to one . there is no lesson to be learnt here i guess . sometimes the way is the way . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- if you enjoyed reading this , and can afford it , please consider donating . the author needs money for endless cups of tea . pay percy bharucha using paypal . mego to paypal . me/percybharucha and type in the amount .

        "since it 's paypal , it 's easy and secure . do n't have a paypal ... www . paypal . methe adult manual is a comic strip i 've just begun posting twice a week , here .   "
