        "austin , texas -- university of texas system chancellor william mcraven , the former head of u. s. special operations command who directed the raid that killed osama bin laden , announced friday that he 'll leave the school in may . mcraven , 62 , divulged in 2015 that he was diagnosed with leukemia five years earlier . he cited unspecified health concerns friday as a factor in his surprise departure while stressing `` they are not serious but they have caused me to rethink my future . '' `` there is going to be a lot of speculation as to why i am stepping down , but the fact is , this is a very personal decision for me , '' mcraven said during a regents meeting . ",
        "a university of texas graduate and retired navy admiral , mcraven had recent policy clashes with state lawmakers . his three-year contract expires at the end of the year . mcraven had no professional academic experience when , in 2015 , he was hired to lead the system of 14 campuses , 215,000 students and 90,000 employees . the chancellor 's duties include representing the system in legislative matters , advocating higher education causes and fundraising . mcraven plans to stay through the end of the current academic year in may , but mentioned entering the `` fourth quarter of my life , '' saying `` there are still a lot of things i want to do '' including teaching , writing , traveling and `` as , hackneyed as it sounds when someone is stepping down , i want to spend more time with my family . ",
        "`` in the past 40 years , i have always put the job ahead of the family and i think it 's time for that to change , '' mcraven said . in a statement , the ut system said `` mcraven has been public about chronic health issues over the past few years and a recent illness played a key role in his decision '' but provided no further details . mcraven was quoted in that statement as saying : `` while i 'm on the road to recovery and am grateful to my ut physicians and the good wishes and prayers of our many friends and colleagues , i believe it is time to segue to several other passions in my life . ",
        "`` board of regents chairwoman sara martinez tucker thanked mcraven at the meeting for `` ensuring we have the best talent leading our institutions , driving inclusion and healthy campus climates . `` mcraven 's future appeared in doubt earlier this year after his decision to scuttle a controversial expansion project in houston , as well as past clashes with state lawmakers over guns on campus and immigration policy . but , as recently as last week , the system said that mcraven would stay on as chancellor in 2018 . he earns about $ 1.9 million annually . the university of texas system does n't have an academic campus in houston and mcraven 's plan to build a data and research center surprised state and local officials , who said they were n't consulted . ",
        "mcraven sparred with state lawmakers over the project at a tense legislative hearing , before announcing that he was ending the project and that any purchased land would be sold . earlier in his tenure , mcraven opposed an eventually successful state law allowing concealed handguns on campus , while advocating for preserving a law that allows immigrants in the country illegally to pay cheaper , in-state tuition . that policy has endured despite years of opposition from republicans in the legislature .
