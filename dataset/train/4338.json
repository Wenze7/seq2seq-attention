        "the way many businesses and individual workers access work is undergoing change in the digital era . one such example is with platform business models , which cover both contracts and labor markets . there are different forms of workplace platforms . there are those which are open to crowds and those based on flexible forms of employment , such as on-call work or on-demand employment . these platforms signal a change to work in the digital era , with the rise of networks replacing traditional workplace hierarchies for a range of services . we look at three examples , each of which has been disruptive for traditional business models . ",
        "global marketplacewith many crowdworking platforms , these two-sided market arrangements often operate internationally , with the work or task offered subject to competitive bidding . this may be simple , in that the lower bidder wins , or other , additional criteria may be used to select the winner , such as a quality measure . an example of a crowdworking platform is amazon mechanical turk , which offers a globalized marketplace for different tasks . unlike the all-encompassing business contracts of the past , many of the items through crowdworking platforms are often fragmented , providing elements of an overall project . ",
        "with amazon mechanical turk , this sets out to enable individuals and businesses to coordinate the use of human intelligence to perform tasks that computers are currently unable to do . the platform is one of the sites of amazon web services , and is owned by amazon . freelancersother crowdworking platforms are more circumspect in terms of who can bid for a contract in that the freelance clientele need to be certified by the platform in advance . this is the case where those bidding are supposed to have some form of professional qualification . the site may standardize the rate or the freelancer may be able to set their own hourly rate . ",
        "an example of this is the work crowd , which connects companies with the freelance experts and consultants in the fields of marketing , communications and public relations . this second example allows for the use of a greater range of digital technologies like geolocation , smartphone applications and web platforms . servicesanother form of crowdworking is with material services , such as transport , accommodation , food deliveries , housekeeping and so on . within this there are two models : rates set by the platform , such as deliveroo 's food service ; or where the service is a product of supply and demand , as with taskrabbit , for home and garden improvement works . ",
        "many of the forms of work in this third category are not digital in themselves but they are managed by digital platforms . taken together , crowdworking platforms signal a change to the way work is structured in the digital age .   "
