        "office chat software used by companies around the world has been credited for encouraging women to speak up at work . slack 's informal nature is thought to be leading to more assertive conversations between women , who would normally be conscious of coming across as `` pushy '' . the trend is particularly noticeable at ad agencies , reports digiday , where women are expressing themselves more freely on internal messaging systems than they would in real life . kerry mcgowan , managing director at the hr specialists , told that this could be because , unlike emails sent from a work account , slack messages feels like a more informal and safe space . ",
        "she added that this could be especially prevalent in smaller businesses , where women may feel more conscious that their conversations are being overheard and their emails are being monitored . this rings true for jen usdan mcbride , head of digital and innovation at jwt , who told digiday that she often sends emails and goes back to check that her language was n't too brash . relationships with work colleagues more likely to blossom in winterit 's been scientifically-proven that men and women use language differently . one 2016 study examined the words people used on facebook and revealed that men favoured declarative sentences whereas women use more ambivalent terms such as `` maybe '' and `` seems '' . ",
        "however , the study concluded that women were no less assertive than men but that they were simply warmer in their delivery . on slack , mcbride explained that she feels less inhibited because using the tool feels like texting , where people care less about what they say due to the conversation typically being faster-paced . this , she added , leads her to use more declarative terminology on the platform . slack also offers users an array of light-hearted emojis and gifs , which may also encourage uplifting and autonomous communication between colleagues . plus , there are various group all-female slack channels , such as #womeninsales , women in product and huge 's women 's group slack , where nearly 200 women share their thoughts on all things from current affairs to feminist literature . ",
        "however , given that conversations on the channel are unregulated , slack may also encourage employees to engage in inappropriate conversations that they otherwise would not on email or in person . mcgowan explained that this can be concerning from a human resources perspective because a proficient word recognition software may not be in place to flag up sexist or racist remarks that would typically be enrolled in an email system . indeed , quartz recently published an article entitled `` your company 's slack is probably sexist '' after they studied the slack conversations between men and women at online newsrooms and found that many reflected clich√©d gender dynamics that could actually be perceived as sexist .
