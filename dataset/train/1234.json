        "food tech startup innit and lg electronics partnered on a project meant to deliver the next generation of smart kitchen solutions to the market , the two companies announced at the 2018 edition of the consumer electronics show in las vegas , nevada . the collaboration will see innit 's smart cooking app implemented into a wide variety of lg-made kitchen appliances targeting modern chefs regardless of their skill levels , the partners claim . in practice , the innit-developed service will be seeking to support users in their cooking endeavors in a step-by-step manner and will function as a standalone app , much like it usually does . ",
        "the integration with lg 's product portfolio comes into play once ingredients have been prepared , with the innit app delivering detailed instructions to compatible ovens from the south korean tech giant . the feature will be supported by all 2018 models of lg 's internet-enabled smart ovens , though it 's currently unclear whether the partnership is of the long-term variety and already meant to expand to more appliances in the future . innit 's service will leverage lg 's newly relaunched thinq platform to deliver a polished and highly intuitive cooking assistance solution , the companies claim . ",
        "the support for lg 's appliances will be introduced to the innit app for android and ios devices at some point this year , but no specific availability window has yet been provided and it remains to be seen whether the partnership will be global in nature . the innit app can already be downloaded from the google play store and used as a standalone mobile service . outside of its upcoming integration with lg 's kitchen appliances , the innit app is meant to assist you in deciding on your meals based on a broad range of factors such as available ingredients and the desired volume of proteins , sauces , starches , as well as particular flavors , allergies , and general diets . ",
        "the service also adapts to one 's preferences and eating history , being able to serve personalized meal recommendations from scratch , in addition to providing detailed recipes explaining how one 's desired meals are prepared . innit claims its solution is the world 's first `` connected food platform '' that 's meant to result in more enjoyable cooking experiences , more delicious meals , and healthier lifestyles . google playthe post lg , innit partner on smart kitchen solutions for modern chefs -- ces 2018 appeared first on androidheadlines . com | .
