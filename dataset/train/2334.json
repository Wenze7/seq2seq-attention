        "this time of year is often accompanied by a painful realization for anyone in a relationship ; we do n't truly know our significant others and their tastes . we rely on minuscule hints throughout the year to come to a conclusion during the holiday season that this would make a great gift . but if they were to get what they 've wanted during the year then the holidays can be a very stressful time . what do they want for christmas now ? what should they get for christmas ? what do they like ? these questions can drive someone up a wall . ",
        "that 's why its important to first realize that any gift is better than nothing at all . also , think outside of the box . away from video games , purses , shoes , or even cars . what can a significant other receive that will be deemed as thoughtful , unique , and very creative ? the answer to that is elusive and changes from person to person . but if you 're in a rush , we have some ideas that might save you . take a look at four gift ideas that we have that a significant other will love . ",
        "a drinkable arrangmentbecause , who does n't like free liquor ? fifteen bottles of wine shaped in the form of a christmas tree makes for the perfect gift because it will keep giving in more ways than one . besides offering a good time , it 'll benefit you both to relax and sip on something that will take the edge of your shoulders this good holiday season . and let 's be honest , it 's more of a gift for you is n't it ? high five for thinking smart . i confess , before typing this i actually did a google search to see if this type of thing exists and it does . ",
        "instead of paying for each bottle , it would be cool to go ahead and order one . christmas with you and me : a children 's bookas a child , reading was the pinnacle of existence . nothing compared to staring longingly at barnes & nobles ' enormous collection of storybooks with bright spines and hand-drawn characters on the cover . often accompanied with pictures , these tales entranced us , helping craft our imaginations and immerse ourselves in new and exciting experiences . as we grew older , we replaced hard-copy reading with viewing these materials through technology , shattering the immersion ; often times , losing our fascination with the past-time altogether . ",
        "would n't it be awesome to reinvigorate that same childhood interest ? i propose a short story , dr. seuss-style , called christmas with you and me . no more than ten pages with five of them consisting of large , hand drawn pictures . make use of inside jokes , sexual suggestions , and showing gratitude for their presence . this will win you major points , and unlike technology or clothes that grow ragged as they get older , this withstand the test of time and be viewable 30 years from now . fat day ticketsso many of us in america are concerned with our eating habits , usually shaping our lives around them . ",
        "gaining five pounds is akin to losing your hair , causing people to freak out when a new number on the scale pops up to their genuine suprise . we count calories , count macros , and starve ourselves to avoid growing any bigger . the pressure to refrain from gaining weight is even worse in relationships . what if new weight pushes our significant other away ? because of this , we do n't eat how we want . we stare longingly at mcdonald 's and five guys as we drive down the street towards chipotle instead . we then joke about weight gain like it 'll never happen to us . ",
        "christmas is the day to change all of that for 24 hours . i present to you fat day -- a christmas event where both significant others can eat whatever they want . the greasiest , nastiest options on the menu are all fair game . the power in the gift lies in the announcement . but first , you must work on the presentation . create flyers and advertisements for the event . tell family and friends . create fake tickets that you can gift to your so . then when the time comes , give . them . ",
        "over . instant success . follow the gift with news of at least three reservations for breakfast lunch and dinner for christmas or the next day since most places are closed . or , cook everything yourself ; just make sure that you make all of their favorites . everyone needs a fat day , make yours on a historical holiday . detailed vision board for 2018one of the greatest gifts that anyone can ever receive , regardless of holiday , is opportunity . chances at success are fleeting and need to be grasped the second that they come up . ",
        "people often get in the way of their own success , not properly planning out their free time to maximize it the best . without doing this , you may be dooming yourself to a life of failure . you know your significant other better than anyone . plan next year for them and their goals down to a tee . record everything in a planner and wrap it up and give it to them . this could possibly be the make-it or break-it factor that can determine the rest of their lives . all of the gifs used here can be saved via gifitize .
