        "just like saying goodbye to aim screen names , it is time for those who are using okcupid to say goodbye to theirs . okcupid announced that it will be moving away from the practice before the end of the year . users now have nine days to enjoy the glory of their old username . bye bye bigcatlover91okcupid announced the change through its company blog . it also cited the death of aim as a reason to wave goodbye to the current username format . one of the reasons the dating app cited for getting rid of the usernames was how forgetful they were . ",
        "once you meet that person you 've been talking to in real life and use their real name , that username is gone for good . okcupid is selling the idea of getting rid of usernames by liking it to a hard decision . `` we understand that , for some , usernames are a great way to show off who you are . but for most , they are a pain to come up with and a pain to remember , '' okcupid said in a blog post . `` and we hope that you can instead use your profile to give people an insight into your interests , rather than a made-up moniker . '' ",
        "`` n order to qualify as a real name it has to be two letters minimum , no numbers or symbols or emojis . we also have a list of banned words that would not qualify . also we are only asking people for first names only , not their last names , so this is an added level of protection , '' a spokesperson for okcupid clarified what names could be used , big changesthis year had many changes for okcupid . back in august , it removed the visitors function from its app that allowed users to see whenever someone visits their profile and vice versa . ",
        "visitors let users see when someone is checking a user out and basically shows who had `` liked '' the profile -- this may have been the reason why it was eliminated . users that paid for a-list service had the ability to see who had liked their profile , while free users were restricted . visitors may have let them bypass the system . at the beginning of december , it revealed that it was changing the way that users message each other . inboxes would no longer be cluttered by any person randomly messaging someone they were attracted to . ",
        "now , users would have to like each other in order to view the message that was sent . okcupid is making changes that are bringing it in line more with another company owned by the match group -- tinder . whether these changes attract more visitors or send long time users running away remains to be seen .
