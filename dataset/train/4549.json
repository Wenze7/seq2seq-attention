        "in a recent decision , the eleventh circuit court of appeals affirmed an important order of the united states district court for the northern district of florida in a so-called `` powell claim . '' welford v. liberty mutual ins . co. , -- fed . app ' x -- , 2017 wl 5899784 . the district court order can be found at welford v. liberty ins . corp. , 190 f. supp . 3d 1085 . i. introduction to `` powell claims '' florida law imposes a duty of good faith on liability insurers . the duty of good faith requires that insurers `` investigate the facts , give fair consideration to a settlement offer that is not unreasonable under the facts , and settle , if possible , where a reasonably prudent person , faced with the prospect of paying the total recovery , would do so . '' ",
        "boston old colony ins . co. . v. gutierrez , 386 so . 2d 783 , 785 . an insurer that breaches this duty may be liable for the total amount awarded against the insured , including an amount in excess of the applicable coverage limits . to be liable for bad faith in the context of a third-party claim , the insurer must have caused the excess judgment against the insured . perera v. u. s. fid . & guar . co. , 35 so . 3d 893 , 901 . as a related concept , a liability insurer can not be liable for bad faith if it had no realistic possibility to settle within the applicable coverage limits . ",
        "barry v. geico gen. ins . co. , 938 so . 2d 613 , 618 . accordingly , the general rule in florida is that `` the insurer is not liable for bad faith or conduct tantamount to bad faith in the absence of an offer to settle . '' seward v. state farm mut . auto . ins . co. , 392 f. 2d 723 , 728 ; see also davis v. nationwide mut . fire ins . co. , 370 so . 2d 1162 , 1163 . however , in powell v. prudential prop . & cas . ",
        "ins . co. , 584 so . 2d 12 , 14 , a florida appellate court held that `` an offer to settle is not a prerequisite to the imposition of liability for an insurer 's bad faith refusal to settle , but is merely one factor to be considered . '' the court stated that `` here liability is clear , and injuries so serious that a judgment in excess of the policy limits is likely , an insurer has an affirmative duty to initiate settlement negotiations . '' id . thus , the court in powell recognized that an insurer may have a duty to initiate settlement negotiations when two requirements are met : the liability of the insured is clear ; and the injuries are so serious that a judgment in excess of the policy limits is likely . ",
        "a lawsuit for third-party bad faith where the injured claimant never offered to settle at or below the applicable coverage limits has become known as a `` powell claim . '' ii . the welford decisionthe welford case involved a very unique set of facts . it is not necessary to go through those facts here . however , the decisions of both the eleventh circuit and the district court set out the facts in great detail . readers who are interested in learning about the facts of the welford case should read those decisions , particularly the decision of the district court . ",
        "the important fact here is that , as the district court correctly found , ` by any objective measure , liability was not ` clear ' on the facts of this case . '' welford , 190 f. supp . 3d at 1098 . the insurer in welford attempted to settle the claim within the applicable coverage limits . however , the claimant refused . ultimately , the underlying negligence case proceeded to a jury trial . the jury apportioned 55 % liability on the deceased claimant ; 38 % on the insured ; and 7 % on a third-party . ",
        "a judgment ultimately was entered against the insured for $ 501,600 . the liability coverage limit was $ 10,000 per person . at no time did the deceased claimant 's estate make an offer or demand to the insurer to settle within the liability coverage limit . the estate sued for bad faith to recover the judgment in excess of the $ 10,000 liability coverage limit . the insurer moved for summary judgment arguing it had no duty to initiate settlement negotiations under powell because liability was not clear . and because the estate had not offered to settle within the liability coverage limit , the insurer could not be liable for alleged bad faith under applicable law . ",
        "the estate opposed the motion . it argued first that the insurer had breached its duty to investigate which precluded summary judgment . the estate also argued that it was `` ` absurd ' and ` nonsensical ' to interpret the ` clear liability ' requirement in powell to mean that the insured must be principally -- if not entirely -- at fault for the accident . '' id . at 1095 . the district court granted summary judgment to the insurer . regarding the first argument , the district court held that `` n insurer 's ` duty to investigate ' does not exist in a vacuum ; rather ; it is part and parcel of the overall duty to settle a claim within policy limits wherever possible , thereby protecting the insured from a potential excess judgment . '' ",
        "id . thus , the court turned to the real question : `` did liberty have an affirmative duty to initiate settlement discussions under powell ? '' id . in analyzing powell , the district court noted : on its face , powell does not obligate insurers to initiate settlement negotiations whenever an insured is involved in a crash and has some potential liability . indeed , if that were the law , insurers would have that obligation in virtually every accident case as it is almost always possible that an insured may be found at least partially liable for an injury . ",
        "but that is not what the powell court said . rather , at the risk of repetition , powell speaks specifically about an insurer 's responsibility when its insured 's liability is clear , which generally means : `` free from doubt ; sure . unambiguous . '' id . at 1096 . accordingly , the court concluded thatpowell holds that an insurance company is obligated to initiate settlement discussions in a probable excess case even if there is no formal demand , but that obligation exists only if `` liability is clear . '' the estate appealed to the eleventh circuit . ",
        "the eleventh circuit affirmed . regarding powell , the eleventh circuit held that `` hile did not make a pre-suit settlement offer , there was no affirmative duty under applicable florida law to do so , and even if there was , such a duty would have been inapplicable because was not clearly liable for the accident . '' welford , 2017 wl 5899784 , at * 4 . iii . conclusion `` powell claims '' continue to provide fertile ground for bad faith lawsuits and bad faith set-ups . welford reinforces that a liability insurer 's duty to initiate settlement discussions in a probable excess case exists only if liability of the insured is clear . ",
        "this is an important decision that should help insurers defend `` powell claims '' in those cases where the liability of the insured is not clear . david b. krouk , anthony j. russo , and matthew j. lavisky of butler weihmuller katz craig llp represented liberty insurance corporation in welford both in the district court and in the eleventh circuit court of appeals .
