        "china on tuesday successfully launched a set of remote sensing satellites , as part of its last space mission this year , marking a series of landmark achievements in the country 's aerospace industry in 2017 , despite the failed launch of a heavy-lift carrier rocket mid-year . the satellites were launched on a long march-2c carrier rocket from xichang satellite launch center in southwest china 's sichuan province . the launch is part of the third batch of the yaogan-30 project , which will conduct electromagnetic environmental surveys among other experiments , further boosting the country 's competitiveness in space science , xinhua news agency reported on tuesday . ",
        "`` it is a fruitful year for china 's aerospace industry , '' jiao weixin , a space science professor at peking university , told the global times on tuesday . jiao stressed the importance of china 's tianzhou-1 cargo spacecraft completing three refueling missions with the tiangong-2 space lab in the first nine months of 2017.tianzhou-1 not only refuels the space lab , but using its fast-docking technology it can complete the mission within hours , a great enhancement in efficiency from what used to take days . such advanced technology lays a great foundation for china 's imminent space station building and manned space expropriation , jiao explained .

        "in november , china successfully launched two beidou-3 satellites into space via a single carrier rocket . since then , china 's self-developed beidou navigation satellite system has officially begun to expand into a global network . beidou will cover countries and regions along the belt and road by 2018 , and is set to form a complete global satellite navigation system by 2020 , xinhua reported . it is also a great year for china 's meteorological satellites , with china 's new-generation fengyun-4a geostationary weather satellite successfully sending the first set of images and data back to earth , the sending of fengyun-3d into space , and the successful use of tansat - china 's first carbon monitoring satellite , xian di , head of the national satellite meteorological center 's satellite data-sharing department , told the global times . ",
        "fengyun-3d is one of china 's second-generation polar-orbiting meteorological satellites , which provides global three dimensional weather and multi-spectral remote sensing images . the satellite will improve the accuracy of atmospheric sounding and enhance the monitoring of greenhouse gases . the network it creates will also help with china 's disaster relief work . china has become a leader in the field of meteorological satellites , and it is making good use of this technology to help the world tackle climate change , with china sharing data from fengyun satellites as well as tansat with the international community , xian added . ",
        "progress to be madechina conducted 22 rocket launches in 2016 , ranking top in the world together with the us . the number in 2017 is likely to see a slight drop from 2016 , as several space projects have been delayed due to the unsuccessful launch of the latest heavy-lift carrier rocket , the long march-5 y2 , in july , an aerospace expert requesting anonymity told the global times . an irregularity occurred with the rocket , which was launched from the wenchang space launch center in south china 's hainan province on july 2 , causing it to fail to reach its planned orbit . ",
        "the failed launch shows that china 's rocket engines for heavy-lift launch vehicles still lag behind those of the us and russia , and it will take time to identify the specific technical problems and run more tests before putting them to use , jiao said .   "
