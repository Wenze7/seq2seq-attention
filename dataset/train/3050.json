        "jessica wongsenior online arts writer jessica wong is the longtime online arts and entertainment writer for cbc news . she 's a fan of harry potter , musical theatre , game of thrones , dave chappelle 's comedy , '90s r&b and those little tasty videos . at first glance , the 2018 oscar contenders seem to reflect a changing tide in hollywood . but for many , the academy of motion picture arts and sciences still has a long way to go toward true diversity . `` this is a year where we 've seen a lot of the wealth spread across many deserving films , '' according to jen yamato , film reporter for the los angeles times . ",
        "oscars 2018 : the shape of water lands a leading 13 oscar nods `` post #oscarssowhite , the academy really aggressively tried to make its membership more inclusive and to bring in more young people , and i think we are seeing the result of that . we 're seeing a wider range of movies being recognized . '' after #oscarssowhite , film academy invites diverse new membership oscar nominations show greater diversity , but no triumph of inclusion and if the eventual winners ' circle includes notable contenders like jordan peele 's sharp racial satire/horror debut get out , greta gerwig 's nuanced mother-daughter tale lady bird or mudbound cinematographer rachel morrison , `` it would tell us that the industry is n't closed off to recognizing diverse voices , new voices and different voices , '' yamato noted . ",
        "that said , there 's still a long way to go , she pointed out . `` we should not lose sight of the fact that hollywood has so much work to do , particularly with women , particularly with minority representation . ... a lot of other people are still largely left out of the conversation , left out of storytelling and left out of awards season . '' despite moonlight , exclusion is hollywood 's norm , not the exception : study vancouver actress and writer carmen aguirre , for instance , decries the entertainment industry 's general lack of latinx representation . ",
        "`` i see zero or next to zero latinx representation on the screen -- and when it 's there , it 's either a woman holding a broom or a man holding a gun , engaging in criminal behaviour , '' she told cbc news from vancouver . though encouraged by the kudos for mexican filmmaker guillermo del toro , whose the shape of water leads the oscar race , and the foreign-language film nomination for chilean transgender drama a fantastic woman , she sees a need to be more vocal about representation -- in hollywood as well as at home in canada . ",
        "`` we the latino people have not been as outspoken as our african-american brothers and sisters . ... we should take the example from them and get as outspoken as they have . maybe that would help change things . '' who are the storytellers ? `` in some ways , looking at the list of nominations , you can see the progress : lady bird , amazing . call me by your name , amazing . get out , amazing . but those are set up against ... a sea of the same in hollywood , '' said rachel giese , a writer , cultural commentator and editor-at-large for chatelaine magazine . ",
        "`` why is this list still not as diverse as it could be ? '' awards shows tackle gender variance issues over ` male ' and ` female ' categories 300 hollywood a-listers launch campaign against sexual harassment point of view , whose stories get told and who is brought in to help tell these stories -- these all matter and are rightfully being questioned coming out of the #metoo movement , time 's up and #oscarssowhite , giese said . `` it 's about the storytelling as well as the power structures , and the two are always interconnected . '' ",
        "a changing industry ? tuesday 's nominations `` show progress not just for the academy but for the industry , '' said yamato , who hopes that this year 's wide field of oscar contenders will spark more open conversations . `` maybe the fact that these nominations are diverse will lead to voters thinking a little bit more deeply about recognizing diverse stories . '' still , while awards shows might take the spotlight , giese is not expecting the oscars to create real change to hollywood 's structures and systems . instead , she feels change will come from inclusive initiatives that create opportunities for new voices , from powerful women like ava duvernay , reese witherspoon and oprah `` using their prominence and power to actually generate more inclusive projects '' to the way tv networks and streaming services are supporting diverse creators telling engaging stories , like donald glover and issa rae . ",
        "`` obviously awards matter , but i think box office in many ways matters more , '' she added , pointing to crowd-pleasing box-office behemoths like the genuinely frightening get out , the irreverent girls trip and thor : ragnerok , which director taika waititi filled with maori references , as more likely to truly move the dial on diversity in hollywood . `` get out can be political and powerful . at the same time it can also be enormously entertaining , '' giese said . `` the two are n't in opposition . they can be the same thing .
