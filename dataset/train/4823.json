        "the four-year partnership that has won two afc south division titles is reportedly ending with an ultimatum . texans head coach bill o'brien is planning a year-end meeting monday with bob mcnair in which he 'll tell the team owner that he can not continue working with general manager rick smith . o'brien , according to sporting news , will tell mcnair to fire him or fire smith . the relationship has further deteriorated , with the houston chronicle last week saying it 's `` toxic . '' smith is under contract through 2020 , o'brien through 2018 , and both have strong resumes , perhaps beginning with deshaun watson . ",
        "smith traded for him , o'brien has coached him to be the franchise quarterback , who looked like a superstar until suffering a season-ending knee injury in early november , after which houston tanked . it is unclear the specifics of the discord between them , but a source told the chronicle that , `` it 's dysfunctional . '' this is n't exactly new ; last year there were grumblings that o'brien could leave because of his relationship with smith , but the two made it work this season . o'brien is a highly respected coach and qb whisperer who probably has leverage , as he likely would n't have much trouble finding another job during an offseason expected to be filled with coaching openings . ",
        "smith , who is close with mcnair , has been houston gm since 2006 , a span in which the texans have made the playoffs four times , though have not taken the next step .   "
