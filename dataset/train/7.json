        "manchester united could well start the 2018-19 season with arsenal 's current strike force , as the club still plan to try and sign mesut ozil on a free in a summer , even if they get alexis sanchez in this window . jose mourinho could thereby be the biggest beneficiary of arsene wenger 's struggle to get a raft of players to sign new deals , as the portuguese manager could well end up with the emirates ' two biggest stars . united 's initial plan had been to move for ozil in the summer when his current deal expires , and there had been a widespread expectation that sanchez would go to city . ",
        "that changed in the last few days , when it became apparent that a punt by the club could lead to something more . while they were initially just testing the waters in letting it be known they would trump their neighbours for sanchez , the old trafford hierarchy found it could be much more possible than they had anticipated , due to the chilean 's impatience at getting out of arsenal . they had felt his first choice was city and the chance to work with pep guardiola , but have now seen that stance is flexible . if they do pull off what would be a significant coup , united will still go for ozil .
