        "brian boyle 's 100th career tally and is the difference in the devils ' 5-2 win . newark , n. j. -- corey schneider and the new jersey devils rebounded quickly from an overtime loss the night before in montreal and push aside the dallas stars . schneider made 28 saves , and brian boyle broke a tie with his 100th career goal and added an empty-netter and an assist to help new jersey beat dallas 5-2 on friday night . `` we knew coming in to the game that 35 probably had to be our best player . coming in on a back-to-back against a rested team , we needed a goaltending performance . ",
        "particularly against a team like dallas , '' devils coach john hynes said . `` it 's something that we challenged him a little bit on where you look at the back-to-backs . ... we need him to be our guy and when there 's situations when we 're in adversity , we need him to come through , so i thought he was a huge factor for us tonight and a congrats to him on i think answering the challenge . `` steven santini , blake coleman and nick lappin also scored for the devils . martin hanzal and alexander radulov connected for dallas . ",
        "midway through stephen johns ' double-minor for high-sticking , devils fans booed the team 's power-play effort . boyle responded by knocking in a rebound from the crease off of will butcher 's shot to give the devils a 3-2 lead with 3:21 left in the period . john 's penalty came at the tail end of john klingberg spending two minutes in the box for cross-checking boyle . `` it changed twice . halfway through the game they had nine shots which is exactly what you want . klinberg 's penalty -- whether that was a penalty or not -- that allowed them to take a breather and then the 5-on-3 from there , i do n't think it should have been a penalty at all , '' stars coach ken hitchcock said . ",
        "`` but that kind of gave them a breather to get shots on goal , and then obviously three missed chances on the power play when the game is 3-2 , so it turned twice for us . `` as things got chippy , klinberg and boyle exchanged words . `` i told him he was 100 pounds heavier than me and i think he fell easy there . i do n't think it 's a cross-check , '' klinberg said . `` and after he scored a goal he celebrated in my face and i did n't think that was respectful . ",
        "he said he was sorry , so let 's move on . `` boyle insisted he was n't flopping . `` the hit was the hit , guys are playing physical . i 'm not trying to dive , '' boyle said . `` it was what it was but i 'm not trying to embellish it . i just did n't see him . i do n't think he 's being malicious . i do n't think he 's trying to injure me . it 's just something that happens . `` boyle assisted on lappin 's goal midway through the third period and completed the scoring with the empty-net goal . ",
        "it capped off an emotional night for what has been a rollercoaster season off the ice for boyle , who was diagnosed with cancer on sept. . 19 . `` emotional is a good word , '' boyle said . `` it 's really been a blessing for sure . sept. . 19 seems like a long , long time ago . lot that 's gone on with my family , which is most important to me and the support i 've gotten , that 's why i 'm able to play . from my family my wife and my parents and especially this club here . ",
        "everyone this club , top to bottom . i 'm having a blast and we 're playing pretty well . `` game notesdevils f taylor hall , f marcus johansson and f kyle palmieri all skated friday . it 's the first time on the ice for hall and johansson since their injuries . coach john hynes hopes they will skate saturday , practice with the team on sunday and see about playing monday night . ... the stars could n't complete the sweep of the metropolitan-area teams this week after beating the islanders and rangers . up nextstars : dallas wraps up its four-game road at philadelphia on saturday night .
