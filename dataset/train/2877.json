        "istanbul - turkey has ramped up its rhetoric to threaten an imminent cross-border incursion against kurdish militia in syria but the attitude of russia and to a lesser extent the united states will determine the nature of the operation , analysts say . the kurdish people 's protection units militia controls key northern syrian towns including manbij and afrin , and is an ally of the us but ankara accuses the group of being a terror organisation . tensions have risen to a new peak in the last days after the united states announced plans for a new 30,000-strong border security force in northern syria that would be composed partly of ypg fighters . ",
        "president recep tayyip erdogan threatened to destroy the force , describing it as an `` army of terror '' . `` the preparations have been completed , the operation could start at any moment , '' erdogan said this week , as the turkish army sent dozens of military vehicles and hundreds of additional personnel to the border area . - ` needs russian green light ' - yet executing the operation on the ground -- especially against a well-populated urban centre such as afrin -- could prove much harder than making threats in fiery language . crucial will be the attitude of russia , which has worked increasingly closely with turkey on syria in the last year but has a military presence in the area where it cooperates with the ypg . ",
        "`` can ankara dare to attack afrin without getting a green light from russia ? it 's a sure ` no ' for me , '' said metin gurcan , security analyst at istanbul policy center and al monitor columnist . he said that despite the increasingly inflammatory language from erdogan , a full operation would require that russia open afrin 's air space to turkey and withdraw its soldiers from the area . tensions between moscow and ankara have grown in the last days as russia seeks wide attendance at a peace conference on syria at the end of the month . ",
        "but turkey insists it will not attend if the ypg is there . in a potentially decisive meeting , turkey 's army chief general hulusi akar and spy supremo hakan fidan held talks in moscow on thursday with russian counterparts on syria . - ` hard to back down ' - `` the only external power that can stop an invasion at this point is russia , '' said aaron stein , resident senior fellow at the atlantic council 's rafik hariri center . he said erdogan had threatened incursions inside syria `` once a week , every week '' for the past year since the euphrates shield incursion turkey launched in august 2016 , which ended the following spring . ",
        "`` what makes this different is that the rhetoric is far more specific , pointed and hostile towards the us . i assume that he will carry out his threat , but the scale of the operation is still an unanswered question , '' he said . turkish foreign minister mevlut cavusoglu insisted thursday that russia would not oppose an afrin operation , saying that ankara needed to coordinate with moscow to ensure its military observers on the ground were not harmed . aaron lund , a fellow with the century foundation , said that `` it would be hard for erdogan to back down at this point '' following such `` loud and persistent '' threats . ",
        "he said if the operation turned into full-out combat , much of the actual fighting would be done by turkey-backed syrian rebel forces like in the euphrates shield operation . but he added that afrin has tough terrain and was well fortified while the `` ypg is a disciplined and effective force . '' - ` not a us problem ' - moreover , any turkish intervention may not find the warmest of receptions in washington , which has closely cooperated with the ypg as its main ally on the ground in the fight against the islamic state extremist group . ",
        "yet afrin -- which lies to the west of the main kurdish zone of influence in syria -- may not be a prime concern of washington which is more interested in the kurdish-controlled areas stretching east to the iraqi border . `` as far as i can tell , the americans do not view afrin as being their problem , '' said lund , saying the american military was in syria on a `` fairly narrow counter-terrorism mandate . '' `` that said , they must be worried that this could create trouble for them '' especially if turkey fired on ypg-controlled areas to the east with a us presence , he said . ",
        "stein said there was a `` recognition in washington that this is a turkish show '' and `` little to be done to dissuade erdogan '' if he chooses to go ahead with the incursion .   "
