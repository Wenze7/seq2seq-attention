        "hamburg - ailing sv hamburg on sunday parted company with coach markus gisdol in the wake of a 2-0 bundesliga home defeat against bottom club cologne , and their former player bernd hollerbach is said to be the favourite to take over . gisdol was in charge in hamburg since september 2016 . the team avoided the drop on the last matchday in the past season but is in deep trouble again in second last place , facing its first-ever relegation from the bundesliga . `` the club has told me that i have been released . i would have liked to have continued but have to accept it , '' gisdol said . ",
        "hamburg chairman heribert bruchhagen said in a club statement : `` a premature parting with coaches is never wanted but we believe that a new impulse is mandatory in order to achieve the goal of staying in the top flight . `` hamburg won the first two games of the season amid hopes for more peaceful times . but they have added only two more victories , and nine points overall , from the following 17 games . gisdol 's fate was sealed saturday with the loss against cologne , making him the sixth coach who has had to go this season . ",
        "cologne are now just three points behind the former european and bundesliga champions hamburg after three straight victories . one point above hamburg in the relegation play-off spot are werder bremen who were set to play at leaders and champions bayern munich later sunday . but hamburg 's deficit to safe 15th is five points . hamburg said a new helmsman is to be appointed as soon as possible but bruchhagen did not want to confirm a report from the bild paper that they have reached agreement with hollerbach on a contract until 2019 . the report said that hollerbach , who played for hamburg 1996-2004 , would conduct a first training session monday afternoon . ",
        "candidates apart from hollerbach reportedly also include ex-players felix magath and thomas doll , and possibly bruno labbadia who 16 months ago had to end his second term at the club . the new coach will start saturday with a difficult match at third-placed rb leipzig , where however hamburg surprised with a 3-0 victory last season . hamburg have had 15 official coaches and six caretakers over the past 21 years , with a last title dating back to a german cup in 1987 . four years earlier magath 's strike against juventus lifted them to the 1983 european cup title . ",
        "they still played in the upper tiers of the bundesliga and in europe a decade ago , reaching the uefa cup/europa league semi-finals twice . but there has been a sharp decline since then with hamburg fighting huge debts , and transfers made in part possible by investor klaus-michael kuehne were mainly flops . hamburg are now fighting the drop in the fourth of the past five seasons - escaping only in play-offs 2014 and 2015 . todt admitted after saturday 's defeat that `` the situation has become considerably worse '' but also insisted : `` the team is intact . ",
        "`` hamburg have scored only 15 goals in 19 games , lacking the firepower cologne now seem to have in simon terodde , a winter break signing from stuttgart who scored both goals saturday and an injury-time winner the previous week against borussia moenchengladbach . cologne also clearly have the momentum on their side as terodde vowed `` we are still last but cologne is alive again . `` cash-strapped hamburg meanwhile signed no new players during the hibernation period although briuchhagen insisted : `` staying in the top flight is the top priority .
