        "college is n't easy . we all know that . we 're pulled in every direction by athletics , academics , our job , internships , extracurricular activities and our social lives . there is little room for anything else . while most times , it 's important to just work through the tough times and push ourselves to the finish line , there are a few good reasons to take a semester off from school . read on to see if you should consider a break . 1 . there 's a family crisisthis is so important ! if you find yourself dealing with a serious family emergency like death , divorce or illness , that can take precedence over school . ",
        "some people actually cope with illness or death better when they have other things to focus on , like academics . `` i had a family crisis last year during the middle of the year , but my family urged me to stay in school , '' says kelsey , a sophomore at eastern university . `` it ended up being for the best because i was n't constantly thinking about the situation at home , since i had academics and everything else right in front of me . '' however , if you 're not that type of person , consider taking a semester off . ",
        "if you 're in class but constantly worrying about your family , it is not worth staying in class and getting bad grades . come back next semester with a clear head and smash those classes . but while you 're at home , do n't slack off . help your family with whatever they need , think about applying for a part-time job and maybe even consider taking an online class . it 's bound to be less vigorous than a full credit load , and it 'll keep your mind active and ready to go back to campus in a few months . ",
        "but most importantly , cherish the time you have with your family while you 're home . 2 . you run out of moneywith college tuition on the rise , debt is a serious issue . many college students have to pay their own tuition , so they rely fully on loans and their savings . it 's not uncommon for students to run out of money part way through earning their degree . and we are n't talking the `` omg i 'm so broke i ca n't even afford guac in my burrito bowl '' kind of broke , we 're talking about literally running out of money and having nothing to fall back on . ",
        "it 's a harsh reality for many students , especially in today 's economy , and taking a semester off is a way to alleviate debt and make some money . `` my dad lost his job while i was in my first year , and my parents were paying for my college , so i decided to take a semester off and help my family , '' says kate , a junior at temple university , `` i found a job close-by that paid well and i actually ended up becoming closer to my family members than ever before . ",
        "truthfully , i 'm so glad i made the decision to take the semester off . '' if you 're considering taking a semester off for this reason , we advise that you begin looking and applying for jobs before you leave school . doing this ahead of time may give you more time to work once you 're actually home . 3 . you become seriously depressed , anxious , over-exhausted and/or suicidal at schoolit 's so easy for mental health to be pushed to the back burner in college . there are so many other responsibilities that seem to overshadow our mental well-being . ",
        "if you find yourself becoming depressed , anxious or suicidal , you need to see a mental health professional to talk about your options . they will likely advise you to talk to a professional outside of school , as well as give you advice about how to continue through college . taking a semester off could be the best option if you 're in this position . see a doctor , find a therapist at home and take the semester to get yourself back on track . your mental health is always going to be more important than your gpa . ",
        "over-exhaustion is also very real among college students . the often crushing weight of assignments and extracurricular activities leads to burnout . in this situation , taking a semester off is also viable option . we recommend finding a counselor at home to help find new ways to reduce stress and let out frustration . spend time resting and rejuvenating yourself . find a new active hobby , like yoga or running , that helps you alleviate anxiety and stress . another option is travel . `` i think if someone does take a semester off they should either travel or have a balance of work and something they love to do , '' says cassandra balado , a junior at pace university , `` you have to be honest with yourself about why you 're considering it . '' ",
        "taking time to travel by yourself or with a friend can be the perfect solution to over-exhaustion . related : 17 signs you 're ready to get tf out of college4 . you lose interest in school all togetherif you find yourself completely disinterested , apathetic and unmotivated about your studies for a long period of time , we recommend talking to your parents as well as an advisor or guidance counselor at your school to discuss next steps . college is n't for everyone . that 's why there are hundreds of other options that will land you the career of your dreams without going to a traditional university . ",
        "`` i was in art school for two years before i realized that i hated it , '' says judy , a lehigh valley school of nursing alumna . `` i quit the next semester , and took a few months to look into other options . i applied for nursing school and got accepted , and realized that i had such a passion for it . 40 years later , here i am , still in the field . '' taking a semester off to explore other options may be just what you need to spark motivation for your future . ",
        "5 . you receive a special opportunitysometimes , an opportunity arises that you just ca n't pass up . especially with the election this year , college students were considering trading their class schedules for internships with political candidates . sometimes internships are seriously intensive and more like a full-time job than an internship . `` i was on an organizing team for hillary clinton 's campaign in philadelphia , '' says yasmine hamou , a sophomore at temple university . `` so i spent most of my days organizing voters into specific groups so that they could contact and be contacted by the right people to get them more involved . ",
        "while organizing was similar to what i had done in the past as a fellow for president obama , there was a lot more ennui this time around . '' other situations can arise , too . some schools and religious organizations offer programs that span months where students work on service projects in areas of need . sometimes these programs include cross-cultural classes , but often they are solely for mission work . `` i 'm planning on taking a year off of school after my sophomore year to do missions abroad , '' says morgan , a sophomore at hesston college . ",
        "`` i 've decided to take this step because i want to try and apply what i 've been studying to make sure that it is what i want to do for the rest of my life . it also will give my brain a little break after two years of cramming info in there . '' opportunities like these do n't come around often , so when they do , consider them . you might learn invaluable lessons from a campaign or a mission trip that a professor ca n't teach you . remember : no grade is worth your well-being or your family life . ",
        "`` i think sometimes we put a lot on our plates and a semester off can help clear our heads giving us a new perspective on priorities , '' says cassandra . `` you have to know yourself , though , and be aware if you will have motivation to go back finish up your degree . '' like cassandra says , it can be tough to return to school after a semester off , but remember why you started in the first place . remember the dream career you had as a little girl that transformed as you grew up , and go back to school to make that little girl proud .
