        "chancellor angela merkel 's party pressed the social democrats to hurry up and end germany 's political deadlock , saying the country needs a stable government to avert further far-right gains . merkel and other leaders of her christian democratic union discussed strategy for coalition talks on tuesday while waiting for the social democrats to say when they 're ready begin . with merkel due to address the world economic forum in davos on wednesday and spd leaders meeting on thursday , the timeline is already sliding toward the end of the week . reiner haseloff , cdu premier of the eastern state of saxony-anhalt , said the arrival in parliament of the nationalist alternative for germany , or afd , is reason enough for the two big established parties to end bickering and cut a deal . ",
        "`` you can see the responsibility we have to stop this trend before it gets out of hand , '' haseloff told reporters . `` i 'm from a state where the afd holds a quarter of the seats in the legislature . '' merkel and her backers have been pressing for talks to start since sunday , when 56 percent of spd delegates at a deeply divided convention voted in favor of staying in government . merkel 's bloc has said it wants to wrap up coalition talks by the third week of february , followed by an spd membership ballot and the swearing-in of a new cabinet by easter . ",
        "` plan b ' ? the chancellor is considering alternatives to a third `` grand coalition '' with the spd , bild newspaper reported , citing cdu officials it did n't identify . that `` plan b '' would involve governing without a majority in parliament , according to bild . at the spd convention , members who favor a period of renewal outside government were defeated after party leaders vowed to demand policy concessions from merkel to improve a framework deal agreed after marathon talks on jan. . 12 . leaders of the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , are pushing back against that notion , further raising the stakes for the talks . ",
        "`` it 's time to get moving , '' volker bouffier , the cdu premier of hesse state , told reporters in berlin . `` we 're not going to go start all over again in our discussions . '' merkel ca n't start her fourth term until germany 's longest party stalemate since east-west reunification in 1990 is resolved and a new governing coalition sworn in . though the cdu won the federal election in september , merkel 's bloc and the spd fell to historic lows , eroding the political center and limiting leeway for compromise on both sides . ",
        "support for the spd declined half a percentage point to 18 percent in an insa poll for bild , which compares with its post-world war ii low of 20.5 percent in the september election , where the cdu-csu took 32.9 percent . merkel 's bloc held at 31.5 percent in the latest poll . -- with assistance by patrick donahue .
