        "montreal -- the head of the montreal police union says he wo n't apologize or step down after provincial police dismissed serious fraud-related allegations he made about current and former quebec liberals . yves francoeur alleged in an interview last april the crown was ready to press charges against one ex-liberal and one sitting member of the legislature but was blocked by a higher-up . one of the liberals mentioned by francoeur was veteran cabinet minister jean-marc fournier , who has called on the police union boss to apologize and explain his remarks . francoeur told montreal 's 98.5 fm radio station thursday his comments were made in good faith and that he would say them again . ",
        "he said the information came from six different sources . the police probe of his claims found no evidence of any fraud or influence-peddling . a spokesman for fournier said francoeur 's refusal to accept there was `` no proof '' only serves to attack institutions like the crown and the police officers who investigated his claims . fournier has n't decided what actions he 'll take next . one of two other elected officials mentioned by francoeur , former finance minister raymond bachand , said a few weeks ago he may take take legal action . the other , ex-liberal minister claude bechard , died in 2010 .
