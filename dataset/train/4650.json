        "so me and this girl have been best friends for almost five years . she is the only person i would do anything for like i love her . she moved interstate two years ago but we 're still just as close and visit each other whenever we can , it 's like nothings changed . anyway with where she is now she has this guy friend she 's close to and usually i end up meeting all her friends when i come just because they 'll always have heard about me through her and want to and vice versa . ",
        "whenever me and her talk she tells me that i 'm like her guy friend so much in the way i am and i just laugh because i do n't know what else to say and i think at one point she liked him . i do n't even know the guy personally but the other day we spoke through her phone because he said he wanted to meet me but he was working that day and stuff so it was that and snapchat . basically he told my best friend that i 'm cute and he had found her this really nice guy and i was just joking before that about setting them up and so she told her we should double date , me and him and my best friend and that nice guy . ",
        "my best friends whole mood changed like she was trying not to show it but you could tell and she said she did n't want to tell me but i had to act like i did n't know . anyway , that was that and i just do n't know what to do if it happens again or she mentions it . i love my best friend and i would n't put a guy or anything in harms way of our friendship and i barely know him . also i 'm sure she might like him and i do n't want to interfere with that . ",
        "there was another guy she liked in the past that liked me too but i never condone anything like i do n't even talk to them if i know she likes them . what do i do the next time this all happens and why is she like this ? because i do n't want her hating me over something i have no control over . she also did ask if i liked him and that it was fine if i did and i just honestly answered her that i do n't know him .
