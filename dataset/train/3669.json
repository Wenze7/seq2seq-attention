        "ana maria cardona killed her three-year-old son , lazaro figueroa in 1990 and dumped his body among the bushes at miami beach . now , after 27 years , she has been found guilty of murder for the third time . a miami jury on 13 december convicted cardona of first-degree murder and aggravated child abuse of her son , who was known as baby lollipops for the t-shirt he was found wearing . she will now face life in prison -- a punishment much milder than her two previous death row sentences . the florida supreme court had overturned the two rulings of capital punishment and the case was brought back to trial recently . ",
        "`` i do n't think you will be meeting lazaro in the afterlife . your actions were monstrous . my mind recoils at the hellish existence you put lazaro through that last year of his life , '' miami-dade circuit judge miguel de la o told cardona at the sentencing . `` there are wild beasts that show more empathy for their offspring than you showed lazaro . `` the body of baby lazaro was discovered in an emaciated condition with severe bruising all over . during the trial , the medical examiner pointed out how he was beaten often , and starving . ",
        "his body was covered in bumps , bruises and cigarette burns . the child 's skull was fractured , and his left arm was permanently bent at a 90-degree angle . `` after suffering years , months , days of continuous abuse by her , under her watch , lazaro inevitably withered and died . and lay in the dirt until his little heart stopped beating , '' prosecutor reid rubin said in a closing argument . `` it was only a matter of time before he wound up dead because of her . `` the 56-year-old had other children as well , ones who she did not abuse . ",
        "however , according to the prosecutors , she took out her anger on lazaro because his drug dealer father had died and left her without money . `` she became angry and spiteful , and she took it out on an innocent young child who became her personal whipping boy . it escalated , more and more , '' the prosecutor said . `` lazaro died because his mother did n't love him . `` the defence attorney , stephen yermish , said that while cardona was a bad mother , she was not responsible for her son 's death . ",
        "the defendant herself made a statement reiterating that she was not guilty of murder . `` i did n't kill my son ! i did n't torture my son , '' she told the court in spanish . `` maybe you do n't believe me . you do n't feel my pain . nobody could love my child more than me ! `` she claimed her former girlfriend olivia gonzalez mendoza was to blame as the latter had given the child to an unknown `` friend '' who had him for the two or more months before his death . ",
        "gonzalez had previously pleaded guilty and was the lead witness of cardona 's first trial in 1992 . she is currently serving 16 years of a 40-year prison sentence . over the years , the cardona has changed her story on numerous occasions , from claiming that she did not have her child at the time of his death to telling that he died after falling out of bed and hitting his head . she told the police that she hid the body because she did not want to lose custody of her other children . florida jury finds mom guilty in `` baby lollipops '' murder trial #blog pic .
