        "as a craniofacial surgeon with more than 30 years of experience in treating facial abnormalities and performing reconstructive surgery on children with congenital deformities , i am heartened to see that the film wonder offers hope that tomorrow brings greater understanding and acceptance . wonder tells the story of auggie pullman , a fictional 10-year-old boy with a severe case of treacher collins syndrome -- a rare genetic craniofacial disorder . auggie must navigate new challenges in a new school , such as how to talk about his condition , make friends and handle bullying . more : holiday blues : 4 mistakes we make when comforting friends who are struggling . ",
        "more : trump travel ban : head back to the airports and bring your protest signs . due to the severity of his condition , auggie has undergone nearly 30 surgeries before he enters middle school . when a classmate asks auggie about plastic surgery , auggie jokes , `` this is after plastic surgery -- it takes a lot of work to look this good . '' there is truth to this light-hearted moment . auggie 's birth defect , which ranges in severity , is characterized by underdeveloped facial bones that affect his eyes , ears , cheeks , palate and jaw structure . ",
        "many patients with craniofacial disorders undergo a series of plastic and reconstructive surgeries every year , starting at a young age . statistics from the american society of plastic surgeons reveal nearly 220,000 maxillofacial and craniofacial procedures were performed in the united states during 2016 . plastic surgery can make both functional and aesthetic improvements , but some deformities may remain even after surgical procedures , especially in severe cases . i had the honor and pleasure to attend a special screening of wonder with families , young adults and children with a variety of craniofacial anomalies . their facial differences make them extremely visible to the world , yet their stories and struggles often remain untold . ",
        "many of the parents and young adults in my group were moved to tears as they watched auggie 's story develop , because his trials and triumphs mirrored their own and affirmed they were not alone . more : senate tax bill is life or death for obamacare and millions who need it . policing the usa : a look at race , justice , media . although wonder is a fictional film , it represents reality for many of the children and young adults with craniofacial abnormalities . i witnessed this firsthand in discussing the film with them after the screening . ",
        "like auggie , they understand how it feels to be judged by their outward appearance , and wonder gives them encouragement and hope -- a reminder that their facial differences do not define them . it 's my hope that wonder can serve as a catalyst for millions of people to better understand craniofacial disorders and the amazing children who persevere with these conditions . a major highlight of the movie is watching some of auggie 's classmates discover he is no different from their other friends . he 's a smart , nice kid with a great sense of humor . ",
        "it 's the same message we 've heard about judging others based on their color , race or creed . do n't do it . we are all much more than our physical differences . i hope wonder reminds patients with facial differences that they possess the strength , wisdom and courage to defy the odds and overcome their adversity every day . scott bartlett , md is a member of the american society of plastic surgeons and chief of the division of plastic and reconstructive surgery at children 's hospital of philadelphia .
