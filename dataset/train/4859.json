        "austria 's political `` wunderkind '' sebastian kurz , 31 , said thursday he hopes to form a coalition with the far-right before christmas , with media speculating a deal could be done this weekend . `` i am very optimistic that we can achieve our aim of wrapping up the coalition talks before christmas . we are in the final straight , '' kurz told reporters after briefing the austrian president on progress . `` we still have intense days ahead of us ... i hope very much we can clear this up together in the coming days , '' kurz said . ",
        "kurz 's conservative people 's party entered coalition talks with the populist freedom party of heinz-christian strache following elections in october when the parties came first and third respectively . the last time the anti-immigration fpoe entered government , in 2000 under controversial then-leader joerg haider , there were major protests and austria was ostracised for a while within the european union . this time though the reaction is likely to be much more muted with the fpoe seen as having moderated and nationalist parties on the rise across europe , for example in germany , the netherlands and france . ",
        "the fpoe is ambivalent about the european union but kurz , who has moved his party to the right , said on thursday that the `` pro-european '' stance of the incoming government `` from my point of view has been secured '' . the only agreement to have emerged so far from the coalition talks is a pledge to scrap a law that would have banned smoking from all bars and restaurants from may 2018 , despite a widespread outcry .
