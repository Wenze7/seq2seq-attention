        "introductionhave you ever opened a book and read the first page only to close it because you were so overwhelmed by how much you love books ? yes ? no ? well , it happens to me all the time . i tend to fill my corner of the internet with words on phenomena that frustrate me , bemuse me , and downright anger me . in the spirit of trying to be more optimistic for the new year , i hope to balance this with reflections -- definitely not criticism -- on the one device that never fails to shift my world back into the sensical , even at its most surreal : the novel . ",
        "now that i 'm free from syllabi-controlled reading , i do it more than ever , but i still want to set a goal to read one book each week for the entire year . when i call the shots , i follow through . reading extends lightyears beyond sheer entertainment . sure , stories often amuse us , but narratives stand alone in their ability to create attentiveness , foster empathy , and take us where we could n't otherwise go as they captivate . i want to make it my life 's purpose to kindle or rekindle people 's desire to read . ",
        "i do n't expect it to mean quite as much to everyone else as it does to me , but it does n't follow that there is n't at least one life-altering book out there for each person . maybe we will find it together . maybe you will be inspired to find it on your own . either way , i hope to make clear that reading is not a daunting activity . we can all take it one word at a time . so , yeah . * clears throat , lifts monocle to eye , nods head * godspeed .
