        "kobe bryant had not one but two of his los angeles lakers jersey numbers retired by the team during an emotional halftime ceremony at the staples center on monday night . he may be the recipient of a comparably special honor little more than a month from now , on jan. . 23 , when the academy of motion picture arts and sciences announces its nominees for the 90th oscars . bryant , as the writer of dear basketball -- an animated short derived from his retirement poem of the same name , drawn by disney legend glen keane and scored by the incomparable john williams -- would personally receive an oscar nomination if his film , which was screened on the jumbotron prior to monday night 's retirement ceremony , is nominated for best animated short . ",
        "dear basketball has already made the oscar shortlist of 10 animated shorts from which five nominees will be chosen . now , can it advance to the next round ? in my opinion , it has a 50/50 shot -- but will be a , well , slam-dunk to win if it gets one . here 's why ... oscar nominations in the animated short category are determined by the members of the academy 's short film and feature animation branch , a group of roughly 500 people who work in those fields . it 's a group that is not generally welcoming of outsiders ; bryant is a lifelong student of animation and is organizing a program to enable diverse communities to study animation , but he 's new to the professional animation community . ",
        "but it 's also a group that cherishes longtime practitioners of its profession , like 38-year disney vet keane . keane has never been oscar-nominated before , primarily because directors , not animators , are recognized for animated features . but , as the director of dear basketball , he would share in the nom with bryant . another wild-card , though , is the involvement with dear basketball of verizon . the short was entirely financed by bryant 's granity studios and believe entertainment group , long before verizon had anything to do with it , but , in an effort to get it out to as many people as possible , bryant last week agreed to a distribution deal with go90 , the telecommunications company 's free , ad-supported video streaming service that was launched in october 2015 , and now reaches roughly as many people as facebook or google . ",
        "one might think that animators would applaud a partnership like this that brings animated shorts to many members of the general public , but there is reason to believe that some have an aversion to shorts affiliated with corporations . it 's even suspected by some that this had something to do with why duet , an animated short that keane made in 2014 , was shortlisted but not ultimately nominated . the difference , though , is that google atap was a co-producer of duet , meaning it was involved with it from the start , whereas go90 only became involved with dear basketball after it was already made . ",
        "if dear basketball does , in fact , get nominated , then i think it will win the oscar in a walk . that 's not only because it 's a beautiful film , but because of the way in which winners are selected . under the academy 's arcane voting rules , best animated short oscar nominees are chosen only by people with expertise in shorts and/or animation -- again , the short films and feature animation branch -- but all academy members , most of whom know little to nothing about shorts and/or animation , then get to weigh-in on the winner . ",
        "a sizable number of members who turn in ballots do n't bother to watch the nominated shorts ; of those people , many abstain from voting in the category , while others vote for the one they 've seen or heard the most about . bryant is a hometown hero in the place that is home to at least a plurality , and perhaps a clear majority , of academy members . per academy policy , his name would n't be on the ballot -- just the name of his film -- but fortunately , for him , the name of his film would instantly remind many voters that it 's his .
