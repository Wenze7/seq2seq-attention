        "jerusalem mayor nir barkat recently launched a campaign to increase government investment in the capital . indeed , jerusalem is one of the poorest cities in israel . just over a year ago , it fell from the fourth socioeconomic cluster to the third , along with jaljulya , kafr kassem and netivot , communities where neglect is high and infrastructure is poor -- not the expected company for the capital and the largest city in israel . there are two large and poor populations here : the ultra-orthodox , and the arab residents of east jerusalem . these groups have joined the labor market in recent years in significant numbers , largely as a result of investments in professional training and services which assist entry into the workforce . ",
        "but that positive process also amplified a problem : jerusalem 's chronic shortage of workplaces that provide professional opportunities for people in those communities to move up the socioeconomic ladder and achieve some measure of employment security . many campaigns to bring government ministries to the capital have been promoted over the years , including a call to transfer all governmental institutions to jerusalem . that would benefit the city , but only provide a partial solution to the employment needs of its residents . to do that requires a few more steps . a decision to keep heavy industry out of the holy city -- made during the british mandate period -- has severely limited the number of quality jobs for those here who lack a high level of education . ",
        "the solution is a major expansion of industrial zones in jerusalem and a significant easing of restriction on heavy industry , including : expansion of the industrial zone in talpiot southward toward gilo and northward to givat hamatos ; implementation of the plan for construction of an industrial zone in the e1 area between jerusalem and ma'aleh adumim ; and expansion of the atarot industrial zone . these are areas in which the government has tried to build for years and failed due to international pressure . instead of adding more residential buildings , it would be best to turn these areas into industrial zones . ",
        "they could be defined as `` israeli-palestinian '' zones because many of the potential employees would come from among the residents of east jerusalem . such employment growth in jerusalem could lead to training more professional jobs for those without higher education . the industrial zones would significantly bolster municipal tax revenues , and each new factory would increase the range of available services in the city , both private and public . next , public transportation must be improved to connect the main employment areas of talpiot , har hotzvim and atarot with the city 's residential areas , so that all potential employees can reach them . ",
        "today , for example , har hotzvim -- the `` hi-tech industrial park '' of jerusalem -- is largely accessible only to those who own private cars . that needs to change . another important step is to invest more in tourism . jerusalem 's historical and religious importance exceeds that of most european capitals . despite the fear of terrorism , this is a very safe city -- safer than most large cities in europe and the united states . your chance of getting stabbed is greater in portland , oregon , than it is in jerusalem . and must we mention the need to clean the city ? ",
        "few things could possibly discourage tourism and tarnish jerusalem 's image more than heaps of stinking garbage at the entrances to the shuk at mahaneh yehuda and other world-famous attractions . all these steps would greatly help to promote the city as a livable city and tourist destination to rival the capitals of europe . these measures would improve the economic status of jerusalem and the lives of its residents . they require state investment , instead of a stingy campaigns . let 's change jerusalem from being a place where beggars must crowd the doorways in order to survive . ",
        "create wealth for the city and its residents , and jerusalem will no longer need to depend on government for its survival . the writer is an organizational consultant and employment expert who lives in jerusalem .   "
