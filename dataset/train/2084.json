        "according to the sun , manchester united are keen to secure a loan deal for paris saint-germain attacker lucas moura during the january transfer window . what 's the story ? lucas has not represented psg in ligue 1 since the beginning of november after struggling to displace the likes of neymar and kylian mbappe in the french club 's first xi . the brazil international has not even been on the bench for four of psg 's last six league fixtures , and it is understood that he will leave this month . chelsea have been credited with an interest , but according to the sun , man united are also interested , with the red devils preparing a loan approach . ",
        "the report claims that psg are reluctant to sign off on a loan , but would be prepared to do business if a purchase price of £ 40m was agreed at the end of the current season . lucas was strongly linked with a move to man united when it became clear that he would leave sao paulo in the summer of 2012 , but psg won the race . would lucas fit in at united ? it is no secret that man united boss jose mourinho wants to improve his squad this month . the portuguese is believed to want another attacker to compete with anthony martial , marcus rashford , jesse lingard and juan mata in the positions behind romelu lukaku . ",
        "lucas , who is valued at £ 34.2 m by transfermarkt . co. uk , actually scored 19 times during a very impressive 2016-17 campaign , and has the qualities needed to thrive in english football . pace and an explosive strike are just two qualities that lucas would bring to old trafford , and he would be a very good option for mourinho when it comes to the final third of the field . indeed , the brazil international is capable of operating left or right in a 4-3-3 formation , whilst he could also be used in the number 10 position due to his ability to carry the ball through the lines . ",
        "a loan move would suit all parties at this stage of the campaign , and it could turn out to be a very smart piece of business from the 20-time english champions .   "
