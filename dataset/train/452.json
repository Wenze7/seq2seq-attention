        "heikoal / pixabayamazon ceo jeff bezos founded his company in the garage of his house in seattle in july 1994 . today , it is the third most valuable company in the world with a $ 576.8 billion market cap and bezos is the richest man on the planet with a net worth of $ 99.6 billion as of this writing . one of amazon 's core values is a customer obsession . the amazon website says that `` leaders start with the customer and work backwards . they work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust . although leaders pay attention to competitors , they obsess over customers . '' ",
        "this is a great philosophy for business success , and one that any startup or entrepreneur can use to grow their business to new heights . solicit feedback from family and friendsthe first place to look for help optimizing your business for your customers is your biggest fan club : your friends and family . no matter what product or service you offer , talk to friends and family who fit your target demographic and ask them for candid feedback . i start here for feedback on almost every project . whether i ask my wife or parents for quick input , send it to a friend who is a good knowledge base for what i 'm working on , or toss it onto facebook for general feedback , i always start with friends and family . ",
        "the only problem with getting help from this source is that they are sometimes a little overly positive to be supportive and protect your feelings . that is why it is important to look to friends and family as just one source of input , not the only source . try your product or service as a customerhave you ever gone through the customer experience and actually tried what you 're selling ? if not , you may be in for a big wakeup call . try it out from the customer side , and take notes on every possible improvement and pain point along the way . ",
        "do n't expect your customers to just `` figure it out , '' particularly if you run a web based business . instead , take the time to review the customer experience , methodically find problems and iterate improvements , and always be looking to make your product or service better . nothing is perfect . there is always room to improve . watch a customer try your productone of the most eye opening experiences in building money mola happened when i sat down next to someone who had never tried the product and silently watched them go through the steps . ",
        "when someone got stuck on step 2 , i knew i had something to fix . while you know how your product or service should work , it may not be obvious to your customers . if that 's the case , you may find sales lagging and goals missed . make sure your product is painfully obvious . if it 's anything else , you might find your business operating in the red , or missing out on big opportunities . survey your customersnobody knows more about your customers than your customers . have you ever asked them what they think about your product or service ? ",
        "if not , it may be time to ask some questions . you can setup a free survey online with a tool like surveymonkey , then blast that survey out to your email list to find out what your customers really think of you . your customers are already familiar with you and your business . they have some level of loyalty if they have already purchased from you , and if not , it is important to find out why . make sure to ask the right questions to get helpful answers that you can turn into action to improve . ",
        "find what works and repeatthere is a little secret in business that i 've discovered over the years . sometimes the way you want your business to work is not how your customers want your business to work . rather than trying to force them into your business model , maybe you should update or pivot to make your customers happy ? when building my business , i thought i would have a giant , popular website filled with excited readers looking forward to buying the products i suggested . it turns out that did n't work so well , but my blog did lead to opportunities to write for sites like this , and grew my business to new heights and record income while working fewer hours .
