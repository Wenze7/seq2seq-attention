        "fred sirieix : service with a smilemeet fred sirieix , known to many as just fred . in real life , he 's the french restaurant boss at london 's park lane hilton hotel . but to tv viewers , he 's the charming maitre d' of channel 4 's first dates eatery . the match-making show sees singletons venture into the paternoster chop house in east london to share a meal with a blind date chosen by the show 's producers . and we , flies on the wall , watch how as the food flows and the romantic sparks fly . ",
        "yes , first dates is one of a number of love-seeking programmes and falls into the oft-derided category of `` reality tv '' . but this show has heart . staff from first dates join newcomers for the hotel experienceparticipants are treated with respect . the waiting staff talk to them as friends . there is no sarky voiceover . cameras are rigged discreetly to walls . the atmosphere is chilled with the other diners being `` real '' . and we get to know them as they open up away from the table , often with moving stories of what 's led them to the show . ",
        "`` it 's all about giving a great experience and making people happy , '' says fred of all he and the show aim to do . `` my motto is ` enjoy life , learn everyday and make a difference ' . `` one beautiful girl wanted to take part because she found things very hard due to her bad depressions . people could n't see her for who she really was . but i said if you ca n't take people across their whole spectrum there can be no relationship . `` fred 's commitment to first dates arguably elevates the show above its contenders . ",
        "it 's also helped make it a huge success - the show is now in its ninth series . first dates waitresses ci ci and laurawhat 's more , it 's spawned a spin-off show , first dates hotel , the second series of which begins next week . fred , with his smile , winning accent and suave apparel , is the daters ' first point of contact , at the restaurant and hotel . end of twitter post by @firstdatesand the man from limoges is adamant his approach makes a difference . `` the first thing they all say when they arrive is they are nervous . ",
        "the job is to make them feel secure , '' he says . `` many wo n't have been on a date before . others are still trying after 70 or more failed attempts . being on camera is daunting but suddenly they forget and get on with it . it 's fascinating . `` fred 's also convinced his shows serve a valuable purpose - and people do not just want to be on tv . finding love is a serious business even in the passionate surrounds of italythe rigorous application process - a probing form followed by more in-person quizzing from producers - would suggest the seriousness of those taking part . ",
        "`` you know , they believe we will find them ` the one ' . it 's what we 're all about , '' says fred . `` it 's our vision , our raison d'etre . and they know it can happen as we 've done it before - on both shows . '' `` people are addicted to . it 's made them far too impatient . they swipe and swipe through image after image but it 's always a case of finding someone else , someone better . it 's crazy . `` the recent first dates christmas special highlighted the show 's success . ",
        "it announced more than 80 couples had found love there in the past year . one success story , ibiba and aarron , even came back to introduce their baby girl aziza . end of twitter post 2 by @firstdates `` i held her in my arms and thought , ` wow , this is real ! ' can you believe it ? '' says fred , busting with pride . `` love is the greatest gift . `` different dynamicif altruism is truly at the heart of first dates , it carries through to the hotel show . series one was at le vieux castillon in the south-eastern langeudoc-roussillon region of france . ",
        "this time , we 're in southern italy , near naples . `` it 's the country of romeo and juliet , of argument and high emotion . couples fight and then start kissing passionately , '' fizzes fred , with no hint of hurt patriotism . fred in his hilton domain is master of all he surveysand as the love-seekers are flown to another country for several days , the experience takes on a different dynamic to the parent show . `` because you are really on holiday , you clear your mind , '' says fred . `` all you concentrate on is your date and what 's happening right there and then . ",
        "`` the group mingle for a few days , not knowing who their dates are . water sports , sun-basking and cocktail-supping in a beautiful setting are on the agenda as they each try to guess . garish suitsamong them we see single mum kaylee who only gets chatted up doing the weekly shop . then there 's julian , a company director with a penchant for garish suits . the same kind of people applies to both programmes , says fred , and finding `` the one '' is `` both art and science '' . the hilton restaurant is not called galvin at windows for nothing `` there 's always that element of chemistry that we will never be able to bottle . ",
        "but we had this 70-year-old lady who wanted a black rastafarian elvis . and we got her that . on paper it was such an odd match but it worked ! `` fred professes to know instantly if a couple click . he 's written a book called the art of love and is often asked for romantic advice . but fred 's never had a blind date and cites only once having had his heart broken - at 16 . `` i 'm no more expert than anyone else . but i am always candid , considerate and measured . ",
        "i put myself in people 's shoes ; try to see the situation from a 360-degree angle . `` a lot of people have fears , are held down by a chain with a bullet . but it 's about remembering you only have one life and doing what is right for you . `` seize the dayaway from tv , fred 's 20 + years in the restaurant trade have won him numerous awards , including personality of the year at the national restaurant awards . and the hilton vaunts him as a `` dynamic and highly driven individual '' with `` boundless energy '' . ",
        "fred 's also a fervent amateur boxer who `` spars '' daily - and he gives back to society with charity work . but all this raises the question of why he felt the need to go into tv . star waiters austin and sam `` how could i not ? it 's fun and what a great job to have ! you are there at the inception of something beautiful , '' he says . `` life 's all about taking opportunities as they come along and doing your best . i hate the words ` try ' , ` but ' , ` why ' , ` double-check ' . ",
        "they just denote failure . it 's easy to be average . i have no time for this . we can all be who we want to be . `` as for advice about romance he says : `` i believe just a phone call or a text are lovely . nice everyday things are enough , and not just for your partner . show love to all you care for . `` first dates hotel begins on channel 4 at 22:00 gmt on 8 january .
