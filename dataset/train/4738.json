        "by danny coxjust three weeks ago , the new england patriots easily defeated the buffalo bills , but a lot has happened since that time . now , the bills have won two in a row in impressive fashion and are looking like a much different team than the one that faced the pats a few weeks ago . things are not going to be as easy for the patriots this week , despite coming off of a big victory over the pittsburgh steelers . bills ' season record : 8-6buffalo has truly been up and down this entire season , but they 've played very well in the last couple of weeks . ",
        "they have huge victories over strong teams such as the atlanta falcons , kansas city chiefs , and oakland raiders , but they can collapse in a heartbeat as well . this game will likely be quite different than the one that saw the pats easily defeat the bills 23-3 less than a month ago . bills on offenselesean mccoy is the focal point of the bills ' offense and containing him on the ground and in the passing attack is what the patriots truly need to focus on . if the patriots can do that , it 's going to be much easier to pick apart a bills ' passing game that really does not have a lot of big-time weapons and players . ",
        "tyrod taylor struggled a bit earlier this season and even found himself on the bench a couple of times , but he appears to have shaken off those problems . taylor has been a much better quarterback as of late and new england will need to not only watch his arm , but also his feet since he is quite fast and agile . bills on defenseearlier this season , the bills were giving up a lot of points and even saw three teams in a row score 34 points or more against them . in the last four games , only one team has scored more than 16 points , and that happened to be the patriots . ",
        "the secondary is really improving for buffalo and they are not going to make it easy for tom brady to get the offense down the field . one thing the bills do n't have a lot of is a pass rush , but defensive end shaq lawson needs to be focused on and even double-teamed at times . the young man is a rising star in just his second year in the nfl and already has a career high in sacks with four . bills players to watch : te charles clay and cb tre'davious whitebuffalo does n't have a lot of huge offensive weapons , but tight end charles clay is one of their gems . ",
        "he leads the team with 457 yards and seven touchdowns , but it is mccoy who leads in receptions . clay is a big target who is more of a receiver-tight end hybrid in the make of marques colston , and he is a lot to try and take down in the open field . he 's only a rookie , but former lsu cornerback tre'davious white is already making a name for himself in the nfl with four interceptions this season and 57 tackles to go along with 18 passes defended . white is a big-time cover corner who is very fast and shows so much more size in him than his 5 ' 11 '' frame displays . ",
        "this will be the first time white has been back on the same field as rob gronkowski since gronk delivered a vicious late hit on him three weeks ago . gronk 's hit left white with a concussion and earned the tight end a one-game suspension , but bills coach sean mcdermott does not want his team thinking about retaliation . outlookafter seeing the way the new england patriots rebounded against the pittsburgh steelers , they appear to be the team to beat in the nfl right now . expect the bills to bring their best game to the field as they look to keep their playoff hopes alive , but also know that the pats are n't going to sleepwalk through this contest . ",
        "with home field advantage possible this weekend , expect new england to come with all they 've got .   "
