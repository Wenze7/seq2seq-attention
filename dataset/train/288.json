        "spider-man coming in 2018 . yesterday we told you about some brand new details about the highly anticipated spider-man title . now , through a resetera thread discussing possible days gone release dates , many fans noticed the upcoming title was noticeable absent from the showcased titles in playstation graphic of 2018 . do n't fret though , as it may have just been confirmed that spider-man will be released this year . one `` verified '' user titled a developer at insomniac games , jstevenson , simply stated that `` spider-man is 2018 '' . jstevenson , we have learned , is one james stevenson , community director at insomniac games . ",
        "stevenson was quick to respond to another user 's claim that spider-man would slip into 2019 in the same thread . stevenson also confirmed this 2018 date to a user on twitter . as the community director at insomniac games , stevenson is very likely privy to the state of the game and its estimated time of release . he makes it clear that the title is on-track for 2018 . although release dates can shift for plenty of reasons , there is no reason not to expect this title in our hands later this year . a couple weeks ago , design director at insomniac games , brian horton had finished his third play through of spider-man . ",
        "this came during insomniac games ' two-day long playtest of the title to start the new year . this leads us to believe that the game is at least in a state to complete from start to finish . of course , game release dates can change for a variety of reasons , but at least fans can rest assured that development on this impressive looking title is on track . we are very excited to get our hands on spider-man later this year , are you ? let us know in the comments below . source . the post appeared first on cogconnected .
