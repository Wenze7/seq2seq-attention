        "fredericton -- atlantic canadians are a largely honest people , if a lost-wallet experiment is any indication . the region 's credit unions took 12 wallets and left them in public places across the four provinces . jennifer murray , director of brand marketing for atlantic central , representing the region 's 47 independent credit unions , said they believed that the values of honesty , trust and fairness are alive and well in the region , and wanted to test their theory . `` we assembled them with things like receipts , bus tickets , around $ 100 cash , a credit union debit card , and a little insert that said if lost , please contact , and we included a contact number , '' she said tuesday . ",
        "murray said the experiment was conducted a few weeks before christmas , and they were pleased that , within hours , they began to receive calls . she said nine of the wallets were returned , with all their contents intact . `` we still do n't know what happened to the others . they may still be out there , '' she said . murray said she was impressed with the honesty of the people who found the wallets . most said simply that if they lost their wallet , they would want it returned to them . many said they know the hassle of replacing identification cards and would n't want it to happen to them . ",
        "the good samaritans were allowed to keep the money , while the credit unions also made a donation to a charity of their choice , she said . `` and actually some people who returned the wallets decided to top-up the donation with the money that was in the wallet . it 's fantastic and speaks to who we are as atlantic canadians , '' murray said . murray said she could n't break down the results by province or community . kevin bissett , the canadian press .
