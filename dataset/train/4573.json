        "nintendo 's plan to release 64 gb nintendo switch game cards in 2018 has reportedly been delayed into 2019 , according to a new wall street journal report . the report claims that nintendo was hoping to roll out higher-capacity cards during the latter half of 2018 , but `` technical issues '' are preventing the company from mass producing them . currently , nintendo switch cartridges can hold up to 32 gb of memory . 64 gb cards would allow a ton of more storage space for developers to work with , even going above the 50 gb limit on blu-ray discs on ps4 and xbox one . ",
        "nintendo chose to go with game cards over discs for the switch in order to make the system more portable . and while nintendo 's first-party titles like super mario odyssey and splatoon 2 are relatively small , third-party developers have struggled to keep them the same size . ports like doom and l. a. noire exceed the console 's built-in 32 gb storage and require large microsd cards before downloading . other games like the resident evil revelations collection only contain the first game on the cart , while the second game is download-only . coming back to the topic at hand , nintendo was hoping to solve this issue by launching 64 gb cards . ",
        "now that they are delayed , publishers may be in a tricky situation to release their game on switch . according to the journal , nintendo `` said the notice disappointed some software makers , especially u. s.-based publishers that often produce data-heavy games . those publishers may wait for the 64-gigabyte card to release those kinds of games for the switch . `` despite sales of physical media steadily declining in the industry , nintendo games tend to hold their value a lot longer than their competition . will this delay hurt third-party support for the switch in 2018 ? ",
        "it may be too early to tell but the switch is selling like hotcakes right now so this may not hurt them anytime soon . what are your thoughts on the matter ? leave us a comment down below .   "
