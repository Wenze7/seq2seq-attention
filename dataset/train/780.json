        "an anglican minister is feeling the heat after a blog post in which he urged congregants to `` pray in the privacy of their hearts '' for prince george to be gay went viral . very rev. kelvin holdsworth , who belongs to the scottish episcopal church , wrote the original post nearly two years ago . his words resurfaced on twitter and in a number of media outlets -- including the new york times , the guardian and time -- last week after the 4-year-old george 's uncle , prince harry , announced his engagement to american actress meghan markle . ",
        "the piece , `` how to change the church of england , '' outlined holdsworth 's take on how acceptance of same-sex marriage would be achieved . though marriage equality was legalized in england and wales in 2013 , same-sex marriages are not recognized by the church of england . holdsworth suggested that marriage equality advocates pray `` for the lord to bless prince george with a love , when he grows up , of a fine young gentleman . '' `` a royal wedding might sort things out remarkably easily , '' he said , `` though we might have to wait 25 years for that to happen . '' ",
        "prince george is third in line to the british throne , following his grandfather , charles , prince of wales , and his father , prince william . the minister 's remarks were condemned on social media . religious leaders were similarly critical . gavin ashenden , a former chaplain to queen elizabeth ii and a christian episcopal church missionary bishop , accused holdsworth of using prince george as `` a gender-political football '' among followers . `` what is especially odd and incongruous is the fact that it is suddenly ok to pray for someone to be gay , '' ashenden told the bbc , `` but totally unacceptable to pray for them to be free from being gay and to resume a sexuality that was in tune with their biology . '' ",
        "susie leafe , director of the conservative evangelical group reform , told the bbc , `` as a christian minister he should pray for all people to come to know the love of christ , rather than a fine young gentleman . '' in a dec. . 1 blog , holdsworth apologized for the outrage he had -- belatedly -- ignited , but stressed that his words had been widely misinterpreted . `` i could spend the next few weeks defending that post and keep reminding people what it was originally about . however , it seems to me that is n't likely to be fruitful , '' he wrote . ",
        "`` the issues about the church and its capacity to welcome same-sex couples who want to be married remain important , '' he continued . `` i 'm not interested in continuing it through a conversation about prince george . i would urge others , those who agree with me strongly and those who disagree with me strongly to turn our attentions to the actual matter at hand .
