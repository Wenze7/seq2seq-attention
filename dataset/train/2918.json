        "with the dallas cowboys wide receiver corps massively underperforming this season , here are five moves the team should make to remedy their issues . arlington , tx -- december 24 : wide receivers cole beasley # 11 , terrance williams # 83 , and dez bryant # 88 of the dallas cowboys walk to the sidelines in the first quarter of a football game against the seattle seahawks at at&t stadium on december 24 , 2017 in arlington , texas . as the dallas cowboys put a bow on what has become yet another disappointing season in big `` d '' , one of the glaring issues america 's team must address in 2018 is their ineffective wide receiver corps . ",
        "filled from top to bottom with role or gadget players , the cowboys desperately need new blood to reinvigorate this stagnate group with young , talented playmakers . therefore , here are five steps i believe dallas must take in order to fix their wide receiver corps . step # 1 : fire oc scott linehanthis one is a given . the cowboys offense has been historically bad this season . and a lack of quality halftime adjustments combined with what 's become a generic , predictable playbook has only highlighted how antiquated the playcalling of offensive coordinator scott linehan 's actually is . ",
        "throw in the cowboys inability to scheme their wide receivers open , a general lack of support for mediocre offensive line play and the fact quarterback dak prescott 's game fell apart at the end of the season ; and it all adds up to dallas needing an all a new direction offensively . if the cowboys are keeping jason garrett , linehan should be the first to go . answer me this . i understand that players must execute plays . i get that this group shares a massive amount of the blame for underperforming in dallas . but i also see offensive coordinators across the nfl who are able to scheme less talented receivers open on a consistent basis . ",
        "more from the landry hat are the dallas cowboys capable of asking the tough questions ? 8h ago dallas cowboys : 12 reasons america 's team failed in 201712h ago dez bryant : dallas cowboys should throw away the ` ex ' 13h ago should the dallas cowboys pursue safety earl thomas ? 1 d ago seven dallas cowboys who should be fired in 20181 d ago who is responsible for the development of these receivers ? who develops their hands , their footwork , who improves their route running ? who designs these plays ? who insures these receivers are mentally prepared to face their opponents week in and week out ? ",
        "who gives them that `` mental edge '' against these suspect secondaries ? think about the regression of this wide receiver group . bryant has been a shell of himself for three years now . terrance williams has yet to live up the promise of his rookie season . after a terrific outing last season , cole beasley has all but disappeared in 2017 . ryan switzer has barely seen the field as a receiver . and most fans did n't even know noah brown was on the roster until week 15 . this coaching staff has done this group of receivers a disservice in 2017 . ",
        "and i 'm not sure how you can allow them to stay another season and continue to `` develop '' players in this manner . santa clara , ca -- october 02 : dez bryant # 88 of the dallas cowboys is seen on the field during warmups prior to the game against the san francisco 49ers at levi 's stadium on october 2 , 2016 in santa clara , california . bryant was ruled out for the game due to injury . step # 2 : trade dez bryantforgive me . but dez bryant does n't appear to be the kind of player who is willing take a pay cut to stay in dallas . ",
        "clearly , his production for the past three seasons does n't match his price tag , which made him the sixth highest paid player at his position in 2017 . surely there is a team like the san francisco 49ers or the cleveland browns who are willing to pick up bryant 's contract in an effort to resurrect his career elsewhere . if not , the cowboys must demand bryant take a major pay cut to stay in dallas . unfortunately , i 'm not sure there is a place on the depth chart for a wide receiver who does n't catch the ball regularly , has a limited route tree and still believes he 's the top receiver in the game . ",
        "step # 3 : do not re-sign brice butler . brice butler is a progress killer . his size and speed are alluring . and when it does n't count , he 'll show you just enough to justify his presence on the depth chart . but ultimately , his game is a mirage . and suddenly you 'll find out that all the time and money you 've invested in him equals next to no production on the field . we are talking about a player who has had five years to figure it out and still struggles to catch the ball , gain any separation despite his alleged 4.4 speed and continues to make mental mistakes . ",
        "when it comes to free agency this offseason , dallas has many more important and impactful players to spend their money on other than butler . jacksonville , fl -- november 13 : allen robinson # 15 of the jacksonville jaguars catches a pass against the houston texans during the game at everbank field on november 13 , 2016 in jacksonville , florida . step # 4 : sign a veteran via free agencythe dallas cowboys must find themselves a new number one wide receiver , even if bryant stays in big `` d '' next season . and a veteran free agent should be able to fill that role as a bridge player , giving younger prospects a year or two to develop . ",
        "some of the bigger names that could be available this offseason are allen robinson , jarvis landry , davante adams , terrelle pryor and sammy watkins . all of them have their positive and negative traits , but each could also start on this current dallas squad . do n't rule out a trade for a veteran as well , as the cowboys will have tons of ammunition following their massive free agency losses this offseason that should result in them being awarded the maximum allowable compensatory selections in the upcoming draft . and now , those picks can be traded as well ! ",
        "step # 5 : draft a wide receiver highas far as i am concerned , the cowboys biggest draft needs heading into 2018 are at wide receiver , safety and at offensive tackle . that 's assuming the cowboys will be able to ink deals for pending free agents like defensive end demarcus lawrence , defensive tackle david irving guard jonathan cooper and linebacker anthony hitchens . if any of those four are n't re-signed , their position ascends to the top of the `` needs '' list or very close to it . personally , i prefer drafting for talent in the first three rounds and filling needs later , so keep that in mind . ",
        "but with no clear number one receiver available on the open market , i believe dallas will need to make a major investment in the draft to find one . dallas had juju smith-schuster on their radar last season , who was a late second round selection by the pittsburgh steelers and who has had a terrific rookie season . if the cowboys could find themselves a similar prospect in the 2018 nfl draft , which will be in arlington this year , investing a high draft pick on a receiver who could grow with quarterback dak prescott is a must .
