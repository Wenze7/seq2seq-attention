        "washington -- count commuters among the losers in the republican tax bill that the house and senate are expected to vote on next week . the final bill agreed to by republican negotiators and released late friday eliminates the tax incentive for private employers that subsidize their employees ' transit , parking and bicycle commuting expenses . currently , companies can provide parking or transit passes worth up to $ 255 a month to employees as a benefit to help pay for their commuting expenses , and then deduct the costs from their corporate taxes . that amount was set to increase to $ 260 a month on jan. . ",
        "1 . the reasoning behind the elimination of the deduction is that since the tax bill substantially lowers the corporate tax rate , smaller tax breaks that complicate the tax code are no longer necessary . companies could still provide the parking and transit passes to employees , but they would no longer get the tax deduction . and employees who pay for their own transportation costs can still use pre-tax income . the elimination of the subsidy has transit agencies worried that fewer commuters will opt for transit . `` it 's clearly a negative for commuters who are spending a lot of money on public transportation , '' said rob healy , vice president for governmental affairs at the american public transportation association . ",
        "the employer subsidies are generally more lucrative for commuters than the ability to use pre-tax income for transportation costs , he said . `` the concern is that if employers ca n't write it off , they wo n't offer it . and if they do n't offer it , it 's a loss to the employees , '' healy said . `` it could ultimately hurt the ridership . `` businesses that provide their employees with $ 20 per month to cover the expense of commuting by bicycle would also no longer be able to write off the benefit under the tax bill . ",
        "without that incentive , the relatively few employers offering the benefit may discontinue it , said ken mcleod , policy director for the league of american bicyclists . bicyclists can use the benefit to offset the cost of a new bicycle or pay for helmets , locks , lights or maintenance like new tires , mcleod said . the money does n't count toward employee earnings , he said . getting rid of the bicycle benefit , which was adopted in 2009 , would save the government a relatively low $ 5 million a year , mcleod said . by comparison , the parking benefit costs the government about $ 7.3 billion a year in foregone taxes , according to a report by transitcenter , a transit advocacy group . ",
        "the house version of the tax bill retained the benefit , but the senate version eliminated it even though more than 1,500 bicyclists contacted members of the senate finance committee to try to persuade them to keep the write-off , he said . `` growth in commuting by bicycle contributes to reducing congestion , promoting good health and supporting a low-cost mode of transportation for all americans , '' 20 bicycle , community , and sports and outdoor industry groups said in a letter to the committee 's chairman , sen. orrin hatch , r-utah , and senior democrat , sen. ron wyden , d-oregon . ",
        "what bothers bicyclists the most , mcleod said , is n't so much the money , but `` just that it feels like the federal government does n't support biking . `` i do n't know if that is something the legislators meant to express , '' he said , `` but that 's something we 're definitely hearing .
