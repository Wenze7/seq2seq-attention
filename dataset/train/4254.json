        "paris/sao paulo - airbus and boeing are pairing with smaller regional rivals to add sales at the lower end of their $ 100 billion-a-year commercial plane duopoly , but the two market leaders are also laying the foundation for a longer-term strategic contest against more powerful threats such as china . u.s. planemaker boeing co and brazil 's embraer sa said on thursday they were discussing a `` potential combination '' widely assumed to focus on jetliners , confirming a report in the wall street journal . news of the talks comes just two months after boeing 's european archrival airbus agreed to buy a majority stake in bombardier inc 's 110 to 130-seat cseries jet , the canadian rival of embraer 's biggest e-jets . ",
        "`` this seems initially to be about blunting the offering of the cseries , '' said consultant jerrold lundquist , managing director of the lundquist group , one of the first industry-watchers to predict the move . `` one of the things the cseries brings to airbus is the ability to offer a broader product line . `` both embraer 's e-jets , which generally range between 70 and 130 seats , and to a greater extent bombardier 's cseries , overlap at the margins of the big-airplane portfolios of airbus and boeing , but the products are mainly seen as complementary . ",
        "boeing and airbus smaller planes start at around 125 seats . such commercial tie-ups allow planemakers to offer package deals and expand opportunities for generating revenue and profit , a person familiar with the cseries deal said . boeing now appears to be a convert to this approach after initially - at least in public - dismissing the deal between airbus and bombardier , several analysts said on thursday . but the proposed alliances , neither of which is finalised , are not simply about tacking on revenue and cash flow , analysts and industry sources said . first , they could quickly lead to technical overlap . ",
        "`` if boeing begins to collaborate with embraer , you could imagine them creating commonality in the boeing cockpit , '' lundquist said . others see similar benefits at airbus . more importantly , they broaden the battlefront for the next round of developments in 2030 and beyond : one in which western jetmakers will be up against growing competition from china and russia and could rely on their new partners to spread the risk . preparing the next generationboeing and embraer had already prepared just such a tryst in confidential talks over a decade ago . in october , reuters reported that the template for a possible boeing-embraer response to the airbus-bombardier deal already existed in dormant plans for a new generation of single-aisle planes , for which there had been a previously unreported collaboration between boeing and brazil . ",
        "plans for an all-new plane were put on hold while boeing and airbus focused on engine makeovers for existing models , cashing in on fuel savings that were considered strong enough to hold off chinese and russian competitors for another 10 or 15 years . but the blueprint for deeper co-operation between embraer and boeing remained in place and by breaking the status quo , airbus 's bombardier deal may have brought it back to life . `` embraer gives boeing access to technology for smaller jets for application on a next-generation narrowbody aircraft , '' morningstar analyst chris higgins said in a research note . ",
        "a source with knowledge of the matter said boeing had already approached embraer twice about a potential deal in 2002 and 2006 . at the time , the brazilian government vetoed any deal , saying embraer was a `` strategic '' company for the country . brazilian president michel temer , who took office last year , has pushed a more market-friendly agenda than predecessors . deals with their smaller cousins may give airbus and boeing more options when they develop the successors to the best-selling boeing 737 and airbus a320 , perhaps allowing them to offer a trio of large jets coupled to a pair of smaller ones . ",
        "for boeing , however , there may be another gamble at play . the american firm is considering launching a twin-aisle 220 to 260-seat jet in the so-called middle of the market , challenging airbus in the segment where it began life over 40 years ago . the timing of the talks leaves open the possibility that any core technology embraer has to offer could be considered for the `` new mid-market airplane , '' people familiar with the matter said . to some , that only increases the chances that boeing will kick-start the project next year , taking pains at the same time to shore up the lower end of its market with an embraer tie-up . ",
        "`` boeing would apparently prefer to do the nma and taking on two major developments at once may be considered too ambitious , '' lundquist said .   "
