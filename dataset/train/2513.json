        "it was all hands to the pump for murty 's side in the closing stages but they stood firm for another vital three points . graeme murty further boosted his chances of landing the rangers job permanently by masterminding another gritty 2-1 win over hibernian at easter road . the ibrox caretaker has now added the scalp of neil lennon 's team having previously taken those of aberdeen boss derek mcinnes and hearts manager craig levein . yet his team had to come from behind after lewis stevenson put hibs ahead early with a deflected opener . celtic 3 hamilton 1 - hoops extend unbeaten run to 69 gamesjosh windass levelled with his fifth goal in eight games before alfredo morelos scored the goal which keeps gers in second , six points ahead of the fourth-placed leith outfit , who were unlucky to see substitute brandon barker twice denied by the post . ",
        "murty - whose second stint as interim boss will continue until at least the end of the month - now has six wins from eight games in charge this term and he is looking increasingly like the man to steady the ibrox ship . the hosts looked determined to make the most of martin boyle 's pace down the right early on but the ninth-minute opener came from the opposite flank . sns groupleft-back stevenson released simon murray into the box from deep before carrying on his run as bruno alves failed to get tight enough to the hibs striker . ",
        "when murray cut the ball back for stevenson on the edge of the box , gers ' portuguese centre-back was forced to lunge in but only managed to divert the ball past goalkeeper wes foderingham . rangers should have levelled midway through the half , only for morelos to somehow miss the target from three yards after being presented with a free header from declan john 's back-post corner . and they had to be bailed out by foderingham when john failed to cut out oli shaw 's pass to boyle . having been outplayed for most of the opening 42 minutes , though , gers suddenly found themselves ahead at the break . ",
        "old firm facts 2017 year in review part one , with hot rod and classic mcgheetheir equaliser came as daniel candeias got lucky with the break of the ball . jason holt did not hang about and quickly sent windass scampering through and he finished brilliantly into the far corner . if ofir marciano 's part in rangers ' first was questionable , he was undoubtedly to blame for their second . with the clock into stoppage-time , holt , candeias and jamie barjonas combined to slice through the hibs midfield . morelos did not appear to be in a shooting position as he collected out wide but tied paul hanlon in knots before beating marciano at the near-post as the keeper dived the wrong way . ",
        "sns grouprangers got lucky again just moments after the restart as murray failed to apply a finish to another quality boyle delivery , while at the other end morelos fluffed another header as he failed to bury a james tavernier cross . but hibs continued to apply pressure , with barker foiled by the woodwork on a couple of occasions after twice ghosting past tavernier . derek mcinnes and the rangers transfer that never was with old firm factsthey should have had a penalty with quarter of an hour left but referee kevin clancy failed to spot david bates ' blatant handball .
