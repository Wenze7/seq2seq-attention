        "in 2015 , uber added a `` panic button , '' and cab tracking features to its taxi-summoning app in india after the public outrage over an incident of sexual assault by a cab driver in the national capital . according to uber , these safety features , each requiring two finger taps , were the first of its kind to be introduced by the san francisco-based firm anywhere in the world . whether these facilities work or not is another question altogether . on november 28 , 2016 , the ministry of road transport and highways notified amendments to the central motor vehicle rules , which stated that all public transport vehicles including buses and taxis , must install a location tracking device and one or more emergency buttons to alert the authorities , in the event of danger . ",
        "this notification stated that it was mandatory for all public transport vehicles to install them by april 1 , 2018 . on wednesday , the road transport ministry re-issued the order with a few modifications , stating that all public transport vehicles , besides auto-rickshaws and e-rickshaws , will have to do the same from april 1 . for representational purposes only this order comes amidst news reports that many states are n't doing enough to meet the centre 's objectives . in a firm clarification , the government has said that no further extensions will be given for public transport vehicles to abide by these new measures . ",
        "according to this times of india report , it is incumbent on manufacturers , dealers , or operators to install these location tracking devices and panic buttons . however , the centre has dropped the idea of installing cctv cameras on public buses having more than 23 seats . the provision was shelved due to concerns surrounding privacy . `` three-wheelers have been kept out of this mandatory installation of gps and alert button since they are open . passengers are more vulnerable in vehicles with closed structures , '' the official said to the publication . as per the government 's belief , once a passenger presses this panic button , the respective transport department and police control rooms will receive alerts and take necessary action . ",
        "however , there are some who are n't entirely convinced that merely installing gps or panic buttons would do much to enhance overall safety . the focus , they believe , should be on tracking that data and ensuring a quick response to a dangerous situation . like this story ? or have something to share ? write to us : contact@thebetterindia . com , or connect with us on facebook and twitter . new : click here to get positive news on whatsapp !
