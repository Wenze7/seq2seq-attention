        "after twelve years working for banks and consulting firms on the digital transformation of financial services , creditas founder sergio furio finally found a problem he felt he could build a business around while at dinner with his brazilian wife . over dinner in their new york apartment one night in 2011 she casually mentioned that consumers in her country were paying over 200 % interest rates on consumer loans . the longtime fintech professional basically did a spit-take . after digging a bit deeper into the problems that consumers faced , furio had his business idea and creditas was born . ",
        "roughly six years after that fateful dinner , furio is wrapping up a $ 50 million venture capital financing round and preparing to radically reshape lending in a country that sorely needs it . the heart of furio 's innovation is the notion of a collateralized loan . while the lenders that require collateral to issue a loan in the u. s. are typically catering to low income customers , furio views collateral as one of the only ways to lower interest rates for would-be borrowers in brazil . so far , the company has originated about $ 100 million in collateralized loans . ",
        "furio 's company charges anywhere from 17 % to 25 % for home equity loans and between 23 % and 50 % for auto equity loans , according to furio . creditas actually makes money in three ways : through loan origination fees ; through servicing fees ; and return on investment for the junior tranches in the funds that supply the loans . there 's an acute need for services like creditas in brazil . banks in the country do n't typically offer loans with collateral , because they prefer the high-margin unsecured loans that they 're used to . ",
        "a typical personal loan has 120 % apr and revolving credit cards in the country typically have 480 % apr. . so far , less than 1 % of the loans that furio 's creditas has issued have resulted in default . according to internal projections that default rate may go up next year ... to 2 % . for brazilians , the benefits of collateralizing the loans are obvious , says furio . the company sees lower default rates because the consumer has aligned incentives . then even if customers do default losses are n't as great , because there 's still the underlying asset that covers part of the risk of the loan ; finally , these loans are typically a bigger size that have a lower rate of return and high maturity , so it reduces installment pressure , according to a company spokesman . ",
        "according to company estimates , about 75 % of the 55 million households in brazil include families that own their own homes . these families have mortgage penetration rats of about 30 % . that means there are approximately 30 million households with 100 % equity in their residence . it 's that roughly 100 million people will be affected . meanwhile only 25 % -- roughly 37 million cars -- have little or no car insurance . that 's the opportunity that attracted investors like lead investor vostok emerging finance , the publicly traded investment firm focused on early and growth stage fintech companies across emerging . ",
        "previous investors including kaszek ventures , quona capital , qed investors , international finance corporation and naspers fintech also participated in the investment . creditas currently has 285 employees , up from 110 at the beginning of the year , and furio said that the new money will continue to expand the company 's labor force and work on its relationship with regulators . `` we operate through a banking-partner model , we book the loan in a traditional bank and then sell that loan to an investment fund that is the vehicle that is funded by institutional investors and ourselves . ",
        "this model is 100 % compliant with regulation , although it generates a dependency , `` said furio . `` central bank in brazil has been an ally and is crating a new regulation that will allow us to get our own license to issue the loans directly . this has already finished the public consultation phase and we expect it to be effective in q1-2018 . , '' furio said . this article originally appeared on techcrunch at .
