        "qatar said wednesday that the two state-owned firms running the country 's natural gas business had merged in a move aimed at cutting costs and creating a global energy giant . qatargas and rasgas , operators of the wealthy emirate 's liquefied natural gas industry , were merged under the brand name qatargas . qatar is the world 's largest exporter of lng and the tie-up comes at a time of political crisis for the gulf state , which has been blockaded by neighbouring countries for the past seven months . `` on january 1 , we announced the birth of the new qatargas , '' the chief executive of national oil company qatar petroleum , saad al-kaabi , told a press conference . ",
        "kaabi said the merger will save two billion qatari riyals annually . when the plan was first announced in december 2016 , qatar said it wanted to create a truly unique global energy operator in terms of size , service and reliability . gas exports have helped make tiny qatar one of the world 's richest countries . before the tie-up between the two companies , rasgas held no assets but oversaw and managed all lng operations in the emirate . qatargas is the world 's largest lng producer with output of around 77 million tonnes per year . last year , qatar announced it would increase production in the north field , the world 's largest gas field which it shares with iran , to 100 million tonnes by 2024 . ",
        "both of the merged companies had joint ventures with oil companies including exxonmobil , total and shell . senior executives from those companies were at wednesday 's press conference . kaabi also confirmed that qatar petroleum is interested in investing in iraq 's energy market . he said he had held talks with iraqi ministers about possible commercial tie-ups . `` iraq is a very important country in the region , '' he said .
