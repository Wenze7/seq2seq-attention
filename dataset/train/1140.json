        "former ufc and current wwe champion brock lesnar could actually portray ivan drago 's son in creed ii . brock lesnar could be playing the son of fictional boxer ivan drago . that is a real sentence in the year 2017 . this odd occurrence first picked up steam when sylvester stallone , famous for his portrayal of fictional boxer rocky balboa , took to instagram to tease the former ufc champion portraying the offspring of rocky iv 's villainous russian rival in the upcoming creed ii . big challenges come in all shapes and forms ! by the way this is just for entertainment , drago 's son will be played by a new unknown #brocklesnar #rockybalboa1976a post shared by sly stallone on dec 11 , 2017 at 11:05 am pstwhile there 's currently no word on the validity these claims , stallone has long implied the sequel to 2016 's hit creed would indeed involve some callback to drago , who was originally portrayed by dolph lungren . ",
        "creed , released in 2015 , showed stallone once again donning the balboa name as he mentored adonis creed , played by michael b. jordan , in the early stages of his boxing career . it should also be noted this role would indeed mark lesnar 's first foray into hollywood after years of competing in the ufc and wwe 's heavyweight division . in terms of actual athletic competition , lesnar , a former ufc heavyweight and current wwe universal champion , has not made the walk to the octagon since his unanimous decision win over mark hunt at ufc 200 in july 2016 . ",
        "this victory marked lesnar 's first appearance fight since announcing his retirement in 2011 following his tko loss to alistair overeem . however , soon after , the ufc announced lesnar had been flagged for an own anti-doping for a potential violation , stemming from an out-of-competition drug test . almost immediately after , lesnar was also flagged for yet another doping violation , this time from an in-competition test prior to his fight against hunt . while there were rumors of a potential return to the ufc , specifically to challenge light heavyweight champion jon jones , these rumors were to bed after jones was flagged for his own anti-dipping violation .
