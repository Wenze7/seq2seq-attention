",
        "`` sadly though , the time has come for our festival to say goodbye , and rally our followers to support the ` new ' evolving and exciting sacramento scene , '' organizers wrote . dennis speciale , president of the sacramento traditional jazz society , cited rising costs and competition -- along with diminishing audiences -- as reasons for the festival 's end . `` while the music festival was a beloved event in sacramento , the rising costs of performer fees , the diminishing audiences who want to hear traditional jazz , and the competing mainstream for-profit music festivals around the country were the major factors that led us to our decision to end the music festival , '' speciale said in a statement . ",
        "the event raised money for the sacramento traditional jazz society , which would then go to help support jazz camps and other educational programs .   "
