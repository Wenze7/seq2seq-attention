        "detroit - general motors co chief executive mary barra has made a bold promise to investors that the detroit automaker will make money selling electric cars by 2021 . what barra has not explained in detail is how gm intends to do what , so far , no major automaker has done . the answer is a big bet on combining proprietary battery technology , a low-cost , flexible vehicle design and high-volume production mainly in china , according to six current and former gm and supplier executives and six industry experts interviewed by reuters . if gm can meet barra 's ambitious profitability target , then it will house two different businesses by the mid-2020s : a traditional focus in north america on trucks , sport utility vehicles and cars fueled with petroleum , and a global electric car company centered in china , branching into pay-per-use services such as robotaxis . ",
        "barra 's promise to turn a profit is a bold claim in a market segment that has been driven more by government policy than consumer demand , and where tesla inc - the world 's largest electric-vehicle manufacturer - is burning through more than $ 1 billion in cash each quarter selling premium-priced vehicles . barra and gm have invested heavily in the electrification strategy , and worked during the past year to persuade investors that gm can compete with tesla by building on the success of the automaker 's latest electric vehicle , the chevrolet bolt ev , and cutting costs along the way . ",
        "a key element of the plan , according to two people familiar with the company 's strategy , is slashing the amount of cobalt in gm 's new emc 1.0 battery system . the price of cobalt - the single most costly ingredient in current lithium-ion battery cells - has soared in the past two years in expectation of a surge in demand from automakers . cobalt prices hit a record high this month on the london metal exchange . gm 's new battery design increases the amount of nickel , which enables batteries to store and produce more energy , these people told reuters . ",
        "gm engineers are also working on other design and technological advances , according to executives and company patent filings , including more efficient packaging of batteries in vehicles and improved systems for managing energy flow and cooling the battery cells . without providing details , gm has said it expects these changes to cut the cost of battery cells by more than 30 percent , from $ 145 per kilowatt-hour to less than $ 100 by 2021 . battery experts said the full cost of a gm battery pack , such as the one used now in the bolt ev , is $ 10,000 - $ 12,000 , or nearly one-third of the car 's $ 36,000 sticker price . ",
        "with improvements in battery chemistry and packaging , bereisa said , the next-generation bolt `` could deliver a 45-percent increase in range for about the same pack cost , or the same range at 45 percent less pack cost . `` pam fletcher , vice president in charge of gm 's global electric vehicle programs , and other gm executives would not comment on specifics of the new battery system , which is slated to be introduced in 2020-2021 . to be sure , electric vehicles account for only a small fraction of global auto sales . like other manufacturers , gm is banking not only on reducing its own costs and improving vehicle performance , but also on increased demand driven by higher government-mandated electric vehicle quotas in china that are intended to help reduce pollution and the country 's dependence on petroleum . ",
        "in addition to improving battery and vehicle design and performance , gm is working with chinese partner saic to reduce the cost of assembling electric cars . sources said gm and saic are designing dedicated electric vehicle factories in china that are far smaller , less complex and more efficient than a conventional car plant . barra 's bold claimgm has more capital for electric vehicle development because of barra 's decisions to sell money-losing european operations , exit other unprofitable markets and invest in a new generation of highly profitable , petroleum-fueled large pickup trucks , launching later in 2018 . ",
        "the automaker now has more than 1,700 engineers , designers and researchers working on batteries and electric vehicles , many of them at the gm technical center in warren , michigan , where the company opened a dedicated battery research center in 2009 , a week after it filed for bankruptcy reorganization . automotive experts say gm 's battery and ev group is one of the largest in the world , rivaled only by toyota motor corp in japan and daimler ag in germany . toyota has patented more battery technology in recent years than gm , although its focus has been mainly the prius family of hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles , rather than on pure battery-powered cars like gm 's bolt ev . ",
        "gm was issued 661 u. s. patents on battery technology from 2010 through 2015 , the latest that such data is available from the united states patent and trademark office , trailing only toyota 's 762 battery patents among global automakers . for a graphic , click addition to the battery work , gm engineers are developing a new dedicated `` plug and play '' structure for its next-generation electric vehicles that is flexible and modular , meaning it will be able to accommodate battery systems of different sizes , as well as hydrogen fuel cells , one of the sources said . ",
        "in an interview , mark reuss , head of global product development , said gm 's strategy to reduce battery cost is not tied to a single improvement such as a change in battery chemistry , but rather a series of continuous enhancements in battery technology and packaging . `` there are no silver bullets here , '' reuss said . gm also has not solved all the problems required to achieve its goal , he said . `` it 's called ` product development ' for a reason , '' he said . the most recent developments and enhancements in battery technology have not been made public , according to gm 's fletcher . ",
        "`` there 's a lot of stuff that we choose not to patent because we do n't want to make it visible '' before the new technology goes into production , fletcher told reuters . lessons of boltgm 's patent history since 2010 shows a focus on improvements in battery technology , packaging and processing , some of them designed to help boost the battery 's energy and extend vehicle range between charges , according to company filings . gm jointly developed its current battery know-how with korea 's lg group , which makes batteries and electronic components for the bolt . ",
        "introduced in october 2016 , bolt was the first mass-produced electric vehicle to go more than 200 miles between charges , and sell at a sticker price of under $ 40,000 . gm sold 23,297 bolts in 2017 . tesla reported producing just 1,770 of its $ 35,000 model 3 sedans in 2017 , well short of the company 's original targets . the launch of the bolt and its warm reception by reviewers , customers and investors was a watershed event for barra and gm 's top management . `` it was a ` holy shit ' moment that made us rethink what might be possible , '' said one gm insider .
