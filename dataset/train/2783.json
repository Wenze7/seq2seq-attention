        "neither the minnesota vikings or anyone associated with the team were among the selections included in this year 's fansided fandom 250 list . each year , fansided puts together a list of the best fanbases from around the entire world and it is known was the fandom 250 . whether it is fans of a sports team , a television show , or even a sparkling water , this list covers it all . among the selections included on this year 's list are 16 teams from around the nfl , including two teams from the nfc north . ",
        "despite being included in last year 's list , neither of the two teams from the nfc north on the 2017 fandom 250 were the minnesota vikings . instead , the chicago bears and green bay packers were voted to have better fanbases than those who root for the vikings . which is a little interesting considering how many packers `` fans '' gave up on the 2017 season after quarterback aaron rodgers suffered a broken collarbone back in week 5 . three individual players from around the league also made the list including j. j. watt , tom brady , and colin kaepernick . ",
        "despite the vikings not making the cut , the list did at least feature one team from the twin cities . the minnesota timberwolves were one of 12 nba teams selected . so according to this list , the television show pretty little liars , shania twain , chick-fil-a , derek jeter , and james corden all have better fanbases in 2017 than those who support the minnesota vikings . what ? apparently , those who created this year 's list totally missed the fact that the vikings have sold out every game at u. s. bank stadium since moving in their new building during the 2016 preseason . ",
        "ask all of minnesota 's opponents this season that have had to play the vikings at their home stadium just how good of a fanbase the team has . the incredible support minnesota has from their fans should be weighted even more heavily considering everything people have suffered through over the years of rooting for the purple and gold . perhaps the vikings winning this season 's super bowl in their home stadium will land them on next year 's fandom 250 ? one would like hope something like that would be enough for the team to be selected .
