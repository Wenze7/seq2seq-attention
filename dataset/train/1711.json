        "an analysis of published studies indicates that following the mediterranean diet may reduce the risk of frailty in older individuals . the findings , which are published in the journal of the american geriatrics society , suggest that a diet emphasizing primarily plant-based foods -- such as fruits and vegetables , whole grains , legumes , and nuts -- may help keep people healthy and independent as they age . frailty is common among older people and its prevalence is increasing as the population ages . frail older adults may often feel low in energy and have weight loss and weak muscle strength . ",
        "they are more likely to suffer from numerous health concerns , including falls , fractures , hospitalization , nursing home placement , disability , dementia , and premature death . frailty is also associated with a lower quality of life . nutrition is thought to play a crucial role in developing frailty , a team led by kate walters , phd and gotaro kojima , md , of university college london , in the uk , looked to see if following a healthy diet might decrease one 's risk of frailty . the researchers analyzed evidence from all published studies examining associations between adherence to a mediterranean diet and development of frailty in older individuals . ",
        "their analysis included 5789 people in four studies in france , spain , italy , and china . `` we found the evidence was very consistent that older people who follow a mediterranean diet had a lower risk of becoming frail , '' said dr. walters . `` people who followed a mediterranean diet the most were overall less than half as likely to become frail over a nearly four-year period compared with those who followed it the least . '' the investigators noted that the mediterranean diet may help older individuals maintain muscle strength , activity , weight , and energy levels , according to their findings . ",
        "`` our study supports the growing body of evidence on the potential health benefits of a mediterranean diet , in our case for potentially helping older people to stay well as they age , '' said dr. kojima . although older people who followed a mediterranean diet had a lower risk of becoming frail , it 's unclear whether other characteristics of the people who followed this diet may have helped to protect them . `` while the studies we included adjusted for many of the major factors that could be associated -- for example , their age , gender , social class , smoking , alcohol , how much they exercised , and how many health conditions they had -- there may be other factors that were not measured and we could not account for , '' said dr. walters . ",
        "`` we now need large studies that look at whether increasing how much you follow a mediterranean diet will reduce your risk of becoming frail .
