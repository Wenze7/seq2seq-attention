        "he talks about how he 'd sometimes use his wife as a character inside his comics when creating them and much of his content is taken from real life experiences . when trump was elected he created many political cartoons relating to his inappropriate behavior and opinions of latin americans and immigrants . he received a lot of hate mail in response to his cartoons defending trump and his ideals . alcaraz is an entrepreneur in the very fact that his cartoons have the goal to raise awareness to the blatant hate and discrimination towards latin americans and immigrants .

        "umbc defines entrepreneurship as `` the ability to identify a goal , provide leadership and mobilize assets to reach that goal '' . in his cartoons , alcaraz is providing leadership to all of those who share his concern for the mistreatment of latin americans in the us justice systems and by the public . he is inspiring others and creating a forum for those who want to speak up about these problems . his work does not go unrecognized as well as pixar has invited him to be a consultant for the film `` coco '' in order to have his input on the latino characters and their culture . ",
        "alcaraz advises artists to have a life outside of their work and to apply their work to the world around them . i have personally created work that has applied to events that were happening at the time however after learning about alvaraz 's artwork and the impact it had on the people he worked to support , it helps me see that artwork can have a wider impact than i first thought . i think that i would like to create something whose purpose is not only to be aesthetically pleasing but something that also means something to me or to the world around me . ",
        "i think i will try to work on a project whose goal is to raise awareness to a particular issue that i am passionate about in the future .   "
