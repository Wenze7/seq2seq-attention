        "olivier giroud 's future at arsenal looks to be in doubt with a number of clubs set to offer for the french international in january . giroud has made 15 premier league appearances this season - 14 of which coming from off the bench - and the 31-year-old is reportedly growing increasingly frustrated by his lack of playing time at the emirates . with the 2018 world cup fast approaching , the striker will need regular first team football during the second half of the season if he is to be selected for france 's national side for the tournament , and he may be offered a lifeline in january . ",
        "according to spor x , turkish side fenerbahce are set to come in for giroud after an unsuccessful loan spell from their current tottenham loanee vincent janssen . the dutch international has failed to make an impact for fenerbahce this season - who currently sit in third place - after scoring just two goals in 11 appearances . now , reports are suggesting janssen may be sent back to his parent club , making room for giroud to join the squad for the second half of the season . fellow premier league side everton have been monitoring giroud since the summer transfer window , however now look to have turned their attention to besiktas ' striker cenk tosun , leaving the door open for fenerbahce to come in for the 31-year-old .
