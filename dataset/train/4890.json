        "an exploration of five works of art in the nms . lace spherei was walking through the nms , and something immediately jumped out at me . how could it not ? it was glaring in the corner of my eye , dazzling me with its construction . it was david huyck 's lace sphere . standing still , it 's not that much to look at -- it 's a series of dots connected to each other in a form loosely resembling the bonds of an element or compound . move your head , or yourself , even in the slightest however and this piece comes to life . ",
        "david huycke 's combination of the spherical shapes inside the larger bowl , connected in a chainmail-esque pattern become a dizzying and ever evolving rainbow of grey . i wish i had the opportunity to reach my hands out and pick up this creature : inspect its every detail , and feel all the intricacies of the construction . the construction is another thing that interested me about this piece , as the only way i can see this being made is to individually bond each little droplet into the hexagonal shapes , and then to bond them on to each other -- presumably in a mould -- to create a perfectly spherical bowl . ",
        "interestingly , i think my favourite piece of art in the museum was this little passage here . i found it extremely interesting that the architects would put so much effort and though into designing a piece of the museum that is little going to be seen , and certainly hardly noticed . i , of course , do not study architecture , however i do have an interest in it and these shapes and styles reminded me very much of the brutalist forms of le corbusier and paul rudolph . i have only recently discovered what the term was for brutalism , however i have always been a fan of the style . ",
        "as can be seen in the picture here where there is a section of the wall that does not touch the ground , and a hanging shelf protruding from the wall behind where i was standing when taking this photo . one of the traits of brutalism is to make the subject feel uneasy -- the opposite of what traditional architecture hopes to achieve . there are other similar areas to this , especially the main concourse of the newer building within the national museum where there are odd shapes at juxtaposed angles hanging all around above your head , and tall , thick , archways leading into the exhibits . ",
        "... some corner in the building -- benson & forsyth architectsmetalworking lathewhen i entered the museum , i thought `` i 'll go straight to the art section , while my mind is fresh to see all the cool and interesting things there . '' to be honest , i did n't feel especially inspired . i quite liked zaha hadid 's shoes , however given that they were featured in the slides i was shown in univeristy , i do n't think that would exactly show that i had put effort into the work i was doing , or that i was looking to see new things . ",
        "and i did see a lot -- i spent a good two hours wandering around in the art section exclusively . closely inspecting things that caught my eye , and purposely pulling myself to things that my eye completely ignored . there just was n't much there that truly sparked my imagination , or really inspired me . instead , i came across this . it 's a lathe , as you can probably tell . why did i decided to write about this lathe ? because this was the nicest looking lathe i 'd ever seen in my life . ",
        "they 're usually blocky , or covered in panels , designed only for practically . with this lathe however , you can tell that the designer was n't exclusively putting form over function -- where there was room , they considered shape and appearance as much as they could . the flared legs , the slim body , the unpainted finish all come together to what i can only describe as a piece of art . art that was made with a passion . art that can make art . art that can even make itself . geometric chairi 'm a huge fan of angular design -- one of my favourite graphic designers is saul bass ; particularly his poster and motion graphic work for film . ",
        "that 's probably why this little chair mounted on the wall as you 're going down the stairs to exit the museum caught my eye . the only ` conventional ' angles on this chair are in the square that is in the very centre of the seat -- something which is almost invisible with the cage of moulded plastic surrounding it . sharp angles are also exactly what not to expect from a chair -- a chair is supposed to be inviting and warm , curvy to embody comfort . this chair however , using structures that look like they 're supposed to hold up the fourth rail bridge instead embodies support . ",
        "it 's bowl of triangles that will ensure you wo n't slip off give to you a feeling of security above comfort . i 've noticed that there seems to be a rite of passage that designers must pass before they can truly consider themselves designers . perhaps i 'm exaggerating a little there , and the exception to this very general rule seems to be graphic designers , but most notable designers come with a notable chair design as well . charles rene mackintosh , arne jacobsen , marcel breuer -- all these people have designed chairs , yet none of them are ` chair designers ' . ",
        "this piece says to me that to design one thing is to design everything ; i had the chance to take an hour 's long flip-through of `` room 606 '' , a book about arne jacobsen 's sas hotel in k√∏benhavn . though it , it shows that jacobsen did not just design a hotel , or a room , or a chair -- but every single detail in that building . right down to the cutlery . that is design . unfortunately . this piece was n't labelled in any way so i have no idea what it is called or who designed it , and searching `` angular plastic chair '' does n't produce workable results . ",
        "one of the installations that interested me as i was browsing was an interactive exhibit simply called `` concrete textile '' . i have been fascinated with concrete for a long while -- i find it incredible that a material that can be traced back to 6500 bc and being particularly popular with the romans can still be considered a ` modern ' building material . it did not say on the display ; however , i would guess that the concrete has been laser etched to create the texture on the surface . this exhibition has shown that concrete does not need to be the boring , unfinished surfaces you see in an ` edgy ' office building , but instead that it can be a visually interesting and tactile resources that can really add to a building , or could act as a medium for art in itself . ",
        "the variety of textures on the slab was quite substantial , and i 'm sure more could certainly be created -- rough , smooth , ridged ... it really opens the eye to the possibilities of concrete in our everyday lives , in a missed opportunity to make our cities not only appealing to look at , but interesting to interact with too . raven asks pontiac was one of the very few examples of graphic design that i found in the nms . the set is designed to draw attention to the bias in the telling of american history . ",
        "pontiac was a great chief and warrior of the native american ottowa tribe , and played an integral part in early american history and influenced the country greatly . the only reason anyone will have ever heard his name however is the famed american car manufacturer , particularly famous for their pontiac firebird kitt in knight rider . this very much highlights the age-old phrase of `` history favours the victor '' as we see that george washington , who helped the british empire in taking ottawan land , is revered as a great hero . stealing land is not something often deemed heroic -- in fact there are many figures throughout history who are hated for doing exactly that . ",
        "i am drawn to art that has meaning , and that i can look more and more into to find out more and more about -- i 'm sure i could spend hours inspecting these pages and discovering things that are not obvious at a first glance , and hours more looking up the backstories of these things . the way that mcneil has written the characters of raven and pontiac is quite humorous -- something you might expect in a conversation between a figure of mischief and deceit , and a figure of power and leadership . this serves to bring the characters to life and make it feel as if raven and pontiac could in fact be having a conversation , and this is aided by the visual language between the posters , almost being presented as a strip from a graphic novel . ",
        "the image of the american flag being made of `` washington 's '' is profound . in this image , i see that mcneil is drawing a comparison between the value of an idol , a people , -- two things that are real and important -- and with money ; something that holds no real value . there is also a common theme of the black and white . i thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the national museum , and would highly reccomend it to anyone who is able to go and see it . it 's full of wonders of the imagination and a fantastic history of innovation , design and nature ; the way we live , work and play . ",
        "it is not however , my favourite museum -- if you ever get the chance to see the national museum of denmark in copenhagen you will not be disapointed , they had a huge collection of artwork and cultural artifacts there . raven asks pontiac -- larry mcneil . images taken from www . larrymcneil . com as the photographs i took were not clear .
