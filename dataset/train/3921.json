        "our comparison between the top two wireless noise cancelling headphonesover the years , many audio companies have experimented with noise-cancellation audio equipment , primarily headphones . one industry leader has always been bose , but sony has had quite decent noise-cancelling headphones here and there over the past few years . this time , sony stepped it up a notch . they gave us what we all wanted and just enough to edge out bose this time . these are the top 2 noise-cancelling wireless headphones . sony wh-1000xm2sony has taken over bose and replaced them at the number one spot for wireless headphones . ",
        "the wh-1000xm2 headphones have a great balance in sound quality between highs , mids , and bass . their noise-cancelling ability is second to none , not even the qc35s below . this is because they contain three different modes : active noise cancelling , ambient mode , and quick attention mode . active noise cancelling is where the headphones try to shut out as many frequencies as possible to isolate only the audio playing through the headphones . the ambient mode allows mid to high range vocals to pass through from the outside world , such as the announcements from a speaker . ",
        "the quick attention mode allows for all audio to pass through temporarily . for instance if a flight attendant is asking you something , you respond , and then immediately return to noise cancelled environment . the sony wh-1000xm2 are a premium build with a premium price tag that rivals the bose qc35s in every category , but surpasses them in our rank of the best wireless headphones . 2 . bose quietcomfort 35bose has always been one of the best audio device manufacturers on the market for the past couple of years . this year is no exception as they remain among our top 3 best wireless headphones due to their exceptional sound quality but even better noise cancellation technology . ",
        "like the sony headphones above , the qc35s boast the superior sound quality that bose has always provided with the best balance between treble , midrange , and bass . the edge they have over sony is 10 hours longer battery life in the wired mode , which provides about 40 hours of playback in wired mode . in wireless mode , you get about 20 hours of playback time , which is still more than enough on a normal length flight . the time to pair is almost instantaneous -- simply flip a switch on the headphones and find them on your device 's bluetooth menu . ",
        "one of the few drawbacks to the qc35s is their design which is quite bland and boring to some people . but , if it 's not a primary concern , then these lightweight , powerful headphones are a stellar choice . overall , both choices are great and neither of them can be deemed `` incorrect '' . both headphones boast amazing sound quality , premium build quality , and stellar noise-cancelling technology , but the sony wh-1000xm2 edge out the bose quietcomfort 35 by a small margin in terms of additional features . either choice , though , will most definitely be comfortable enough and pack high quality sound to last an average flight .
