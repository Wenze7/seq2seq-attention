        "in game of thrones ' seventh season , we saw characters travel to new lands and team up with unexpected characters : daenerys landed in dragonstone and also flew north of the wall at the end of the season , jon snow formed an alliance with khaleesi and went to king 's landing to negotiate with cersei , and arya and bran stark finally returned to winterfell after seasons away from home . in season 8 , expect even more relocating . in an interview with tv guide , got actor john bradley revealed that our onscreen faves will find themselves in new surroundings in the final season : `` each of the characters this year is placed in a completely alien environment at some point in the season that they 've never been placed in before , '' he said . ",
        "`` the thrill is seeing how they react to it and how they respond ... this season , i think , more than any other is stretching these characters . `` hbo . the end of season 7 set us up for these relocations in season 8 : jon and daenerys were en route to winterfell , a new location for dany ; jaime lannister was fleeing king 's landing after leaving things on a shaky note with cersei ; euron greyjoy was heading east to retrieve the golden company ; sam left the citadel with gilly and little sam and arrived to winterfell with mind-blowing info about jon 's heritage ; and most importantly , the white walkers and army of the dead finally made it south of the wall . ",
        "hbo . but we have a long way to wait before we find out what happens to these characters next . last week , actress sophie turner confirmed that season 8 wo n't returns until 2019 . currently , the cast is mid-production , with about six or seven months left to go , turner said . the cast is aware of how excited fans are and how high their expectations will be for the final season . `` we know that we 've got a real job to do . this has been a part of people 's lives for so many years , '' bradley told tv guide . ",
        "`` this is our eighth season , and we are kind of feeling the pressure to get it right because we want to satisfy people . we want to give people a payoff that they 're going to be happy with . ''   "
