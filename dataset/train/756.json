        "- momenta pharmaceuticals inc and mylan nv plan to begin a pivotal clinical trial of a biosimilar to regeneron pharmaceuticals inc 's blockbuster eye drug eylea in the first half of this year , the two companies said on wednesday . if successful , it would likely mark the first competition from a cheaper biosimilar of eylea , although regeneron says it has u. s. patent protection on the treatment until 2023 . germany 's formycon ag is far along in testing a biosimilar to eylea rival lucentis from roche . it lists an eylea biosimilar at the preclinical stage on its pipeline chart , putting it behind the momenta/mylan candidate . ",
        "eylea , which treats a leading cause of blindness in the elderly - wet age-related macular degeneration - and related eye conditions , accounts for most of regeneron 's revenue . regeneron shares fell 1.5 percent to $ 388 in extended trading . momenta shares rose 6 percent to $ 15 , while mylan shares were unchanged from their nasdaq close at $ 43.14 . u. s. eylea sales rose 12 percent in the third quarter to $ 953 million . sales outside the united states , which are booked by bayer ag , rose 20 percent in the most recently reported quarter . ",
        "global sales in 2016 exceeded $ 5 billion . eylea is also approved to treat macular edema following retinal vein occlusion , diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy in patients with diabetic macular edema . the proposed trial of the biosimilar , currently called m710 , will be in patients with diabetic macular edema and compare the safety , efficacy and immunogenicity with eylea . unlike generic versions of traditional pills , it is not possible to produce exact copies of complex biotech medicines made from living cells , thus the term biosimilar . proposed biosimilars must prove themselves to be close enough to the original drug to satisfy regulators .
