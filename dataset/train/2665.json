        "with global warming an ever-present worry , renewable energy - particularly solar power -- is a burgeoning field . now , two doctoral students in the school of architecture & design have demonstrated methods of optimizing the capture of sunlight in experiments at the center for design research . green-roof boostmohammed alshayeb started by asking himself what might be done to boost the performance of solar panels . `` the efficiency of a photovoltaic panel is measured under standard testing conditions - at 77 degrees fahrenheit , '' he said . `` every degree that the temperature increases decreases performance . ",
        "`` alshayeb wondered if there was a way to `` extract the heat out of the panels '' when the temperature rises above 77 . because most solar panels are installed on building roofs , alshayeb decided to compare the effects of three types of roof materials - highly reflective , conventional and vegetated - on the panels ' performance . the cdr roof is mostly covered with sedum , planted in trays . so alshayeb established his test bed there , installing a solar panel monitoring system over the green roof , as well as nearby white and black portions . ",
        "he also installed temperature , humidity and light sensors and a weather station to record conditions like wind speed . the sensors made recordings every five minutes for a year , and alshayeb then analyzed the data . what he found was that , contrary to industry practice , which favors white roofs over black , white roofs actually slightly decreased the efficiency of the solar panels due to the heat they reflected up toward the panels . however , compared to the vegetated roof , the high-reflective and conventional roof materials were not significantly different from one another . ",
        "panels installed over the green roof performed best , generating an average of 1.4 percent more energy as compared with those over the white and black roofs . `` there is a lot of research in this area , but nothing as comprehensive as he has done , '' said alshayeb 's faculty adviser , associate professor of architecture jae chang . `` the next step is to see the effect of increasing the height of the panel over the roof . `` bending lightanother of chang 's students , afnan barri , wanted to see whether she could improve the performance of light shelves . ",
        "a traditional light shelf is a fixed , horizontally mounted plane that can be placed either outside , inside or on both sides of a window in order to reflect and redirect sunlight inside a building . light shelves can thus reduce the use of artificial lighting and electricity . traditional , fixed light shelf systems have limited effectiveness , as they are only capable of functioning while the angle of the earth to the sun is just right . previous experiments have shown that movable light shelves and ones with curved surfaces can diffuse sunlight with greater efficiency than traditional fixed , flat systems . ",
        "this is where barri 's idea of a dynamic thermal-adaptive curved lightshelf came about . she thought : `` what if there were a system that could combine all these methods to enhance the delivery of natural light into buildings throughout the day without the use of mechanical and electrical controls , and unlike existing movable systems ? `` her project includes computer simulations and a field experiment to collect a year 's worth of data on the performance of the dtacl system through different weather conditions on the ku campus . she created and placed on the lawn of the cdr four experimental rooms the size of refrigerators fitted with sensors and light shelves . ",
        "three of the rooms have fixed light shelves in various configurations , while one , the dtacl , uses an adaptive , composite material called thermadapt , invented by ronald p. barrett and commercialized by a company he runs with his son , ku professor of engineering ron barrett-gonzalez . thermadapt changes shape in response to heat and sunlight , curving upward . when it cools , it flattens back out . barri theorized that the dtacl system would transfer light inside a building more efficiently than the fixed systems , and her initial results have proven that to be the case . ",
        "`` i am still in the process on collecting , comparing and analyzing these data , '' she said . `` however , based on a two-month pilot study and computer simulations , the indoor light intensity of the dtcal system is twice as great as the intensity of a fixed , traditional light shelf . `` i 'd like to take it overseas and perform an experiment like this in more extreme temperatures , '' said the native of saudi arabia .
