        "the nintendo switch is without a doubt a huge success , and that 's despite having a wonky online chat system . the problem here is that users need the nintendo switch online app on their android or ios device to talk to other switch owners in multiplayer mode , but thanks to a 3d-printed joy-con grip that can hold smartphones , things could get a bit more manageable . switch smartphone holder accessory . as anyone can imagine , shifting your attention from your switch to your smartphone over and over again just to chat is n't ideal . ",
        "called the nintendo switch phone joy-con grip , it seems to be a solution to the issue at hand . the creator of this nifty invention is nathan becker , who uploaded the files for it to thingiverse . it supports a wide range of phones , including the iphone 6 , iphone 6s , iphone 7 , iphone 7 plus , iphone x , pixel 2 xl , galaxy note 8 , and galaxy s8 plus . according to htxt , becker spent about 10 hours to print it using 0.1 mm layers and used a digital caliper tool to make sure the phones fit like a glove , with the final product measuring at 160 x 14.3 x 101 mm . ",
        "`` printers can vary in their tolerances , so you may need to edit your slicer settings to print it a few percent bigger or smaller to get the tolerances perfect , '' becker says . on an interesting note , the smartphone holder was inspired by a smartphone mount for the switch , which is n't too shabby as well when it comes to making online chatting more manageable . other potential uses . of course , using the phone joy-con grip is n't limited to just chatting . you can also use it for pretty much anything else , including but not limited to browsing online while you wait for the next splatoon 2 match , perhaps . ",
        "`` this can be used for watching a stream while on a loading screen , having a game map open , accessing the nintendo switch online app , and much more , '' becker says . technically , it can also turn your smartphone into a gaming system with physical keys of sorts , which is reminiscent of the moto gamepad moto mod . the joy-cons are basically bluetooth controllers , after all . the thing is , this is n't exactly the best way to play games on your smartphone since users who have tried it out have reported latency issues . ",
        "last but not least , the files are free of charge , so if you want to make online chatting on your switch a bit easier , it 's time to fire up that 3d printer again .   "
