        "for uk viewers , things could n't have been more normal - tottenham were playing against everton in the premier league in saturday 's late kick-off , and going in 1-0 up at half-time . for natives of hawaii though , what should have also been a completely normal experience turned into something of a nightmare . as the players were walking off the pitch at wembley for the break , a warning message flashed across the top of the screen along with a voiceover to read it out loud . the terrifying message said , as quoted by the sun : `` the us pacific threat has detected a missile threat to hawaii . ",
        "`` a missile may impact on land or sea within minutes . this is not a drill . if you are indoors , stay indoors . if you are outdoors , seek immediate shelter in a building . remain indoors well away from windows . if you are driving , pull safely to the side of the road and seek shelter in a building or lay on the floor . `` we will announce when the threat has ended . this is not a drill . take immediate action measures . `` the situation was eventually deemed a false alarm , but residents were not to know and the message prompted widespread panic across the state - especially after they also all received emergency text alerts .
