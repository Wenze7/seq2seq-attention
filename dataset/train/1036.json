        "ai has been on everyone 's lips in 2017 and nowhere more than in marketing technology , where it has not only augmented marketing tasks but also replaced some roles entirely . today , cobiro -- an ai marketing service for small businesses -- announced that it has received $ 2 million in grants from the european commission to expand and improve its advertising solution . so what does cobiro do ? cobiro is a fully automated solution that allows small businesses to create google adwords ads . it uses artificial intelligence to create adwords campaigns without the need for an expert . ",
        "by collecting website data , it can create ads , decide on the right keywords , and then place bids based on a budget . because it uses ai , cobiro optimizes ad campaigns , making adjustments and improving adwords in real time . behind the scenes , cobiro is doing some fairly sophisticated work . using natural language processing , it compares the advertiser 's website to millions of accumulated site mappings . it uses this analysis to identify the main line of the advertiser 's business down to industry , sub-industry , and specific business specialities . cobiro 's nlp currently supports 39 languages . ",
        "it then uses nlp and machine learning to identify the right keywords and optimize them based on return on investment . from there , the solution creates a full set of adwords ad units , including the ad creative content . cobiro is n't yet working with images and video , but it can build text-based ad units . `` we are using ai for various purposes , '' bo krogsgaard , ceo and cofounder of cobiro , told me . `` the primary use is language technology , which is where it creates the most value . one of the most time-consuming and costly parts of managing google adwords is to set up the campaigns and maintain them . ",
        "using nlp to figure out what the essence of a product or a service is about is key to being found on google . '' that 's where cobiro helps save time for marketers who understand adwords and for smaller businesses that do n't have a dedicated marketing function . `` let 's say that you are advertising a running shoe , cobiro will automatically detect the noun , the adjective , and the brand of the shoe to make a keyword phrase ` red nike running shoe ' and variates of this keyword phrase , '' krogsgaard said . ",
        "cobiro 's use of nlp to determine the business line is sophisticated too . `` for websites that do not sell products online but offer a service -- like if you are a lawyer , a carpenter , a dentist , or similar , we use neural networks to figure out the area of expertise , '' krogsgaard said . `` if you are a lawyer , you might be working with m&a or a completely different area , like social housing or environmental law . setting up relevant campaigns for these websites is obviously very different . many humans are confused by the difference and might not tell them apart , but the neural network is very accurate and likely much more accurate than humans in determining whether it is one or the other . '' ",
        "it is also crawling the advertiser 's website for additional information . `` natural language processing is also helping cobiro to understand the context before setting up the campaigns and enriching the ads with an address , a phone number , reviews from happy customers , relevant site links -- content that makes your ad stand out and increases the performance by using all the features of google adwords -- fully automated , '' krogsgaard said . and the cost ? the service itself is free to use . `` we do also offer a premium plan at $ 49 per month if you need a more detailed reporting and phone support , but the core of cobiro is free , '' anders ibsen , cco and cofounder at cobiro , said . ",
        "`` cobiro does have some large players that use the service , but the majority are smaller companies with 1-50 employees . the platform is autonomous , so the traditional model of charging a percentage or a commission is not making sense here , and approximately 20 percent of our customers upgrade to premium . '' so what 's next for cobiro now that it has been granted $ 2 million ? `` what you will see from us in the future are tools that help small businesses , '' ibsen said . `` it will , of course , be in an advertising context , and we have some very interesting and powerful services in our pipeline . ",
        "we have started with google adwords because it has one of the biggest impacts on the growth of small businesses from an advertising perspective , and people are struggling to get it right -- now they can -- and that is how we like to contribute . '' as with many marketing technologies , the service started out as an internal project . `` we built the technology for ourselves , '' ibsen said , adding , `` 99 percent of businesses around the globe are smbs , and this is where economic growth comes from . if we can contribute to a healthier economy for these businesses out there , we are more than happy to give away our service for free .
