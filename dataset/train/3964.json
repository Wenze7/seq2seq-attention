        "photo credit : jim rogash/gettythere 's a 100 percent chance of snow in foxboro tomorrow , with a foot or more expected . blizzard conditions are possible , and gov. charlie baker has asked everyone to stay off the roads as many schools and businesses have announced their closures in advance . and bill belichick , as always , expects all of his players to drive to practice on time and will not tolerate anyone who shows up late as a result . belichick himself is n't quoted in today 's espn story about his need for timeliness , weather be damned , but the players who were quoted paint a pretty clear picture of the intensity of his wishes here : `` you certainly better leave yourself enough time to get here on time tomorrow . ",
        "we all know there is weather . coach has mentioned that several times to the team , so i would n't want to be the guy who is late tomorrow , '' special teams captain matthew slater said . added safety duron harmon , another team captain : `` snow does n't matter . we have to find a way to get here . just be prepared . ... these days are too important for us to have guys missing and being late and being a distraction . '' `` i tell guys , ` wake up earlier . ' ",
        "especially if you do n't have a garage or something . wake up and go clean your car off . i think guys know . we 're in the nfl playoffs . i think everyone , if you 've been here for a week or two weeks , you kind of get that -- ` this guy bill that talks every day in the early morning , he does n't play , ' said safety devin mccourty . this is , of course , nothing new -- linebacker adalius thomas was forced to leave a 2009 team meeting when he arrived nine minutes late , after calling ahead to let them know he 'd be late due to trouble driving in the snow . ",
        "it 's the playoffs ; every practice matters ; punctuality is generally good . but it is possible to value each of these things and also the idea of basic safety . belichick can acknowledge that there 's a blizzard approaching and encourage his players to do the same -- `` we all know there is weather '' is n't quite there -- and even encourage them to be safe as they do their best to make it to practice on time tomorrow morning . he could acknowledge that they are real human beings whose lives have value outside their ability to make it to practice tomorrow . ",
        "belichick could even acknowledge that he is a real human being whose life has value outside his ability to hold practice tomorrow ! if such a thing were true , that is , which it does not seem to be .   "
