        "it 's a serious charge : nestlé has been accused of taking millions of gallons of water more than it has right to from san bernardino national forest in southern california . the swiss company , which sells arrowhead bottled water sourced from arrowhead springs in the san bernardino mountains , has been accused by the state water resources control board of lacking the right permit to withdraw so much water from the national forest . as reported first by the desert sun , the board , which is one of six branches of the california environmental protection agency , conducted a 20-month investigation after they received several water rights complaints and an online petition against nestlé starting in april 2015 . ",
        "the board has now issued a 37-page report which alleges that nestlé is taking a portion of water it does n't have the right to : the complaint allegations included diversion of water without a valid basis of right , unreasonable use of water , injury to public trust resources , and incorrect or missing reporting , all regarding nestlé 's diversion of water from springs at the headwaters of strawberry creek in the san bernardino national forest for bottling under the arrowhead label . nestlé reported drawing approximately 32 million gallons of water from arrowhead springs in 2016 . ",
        "according to the board 's report , this puts nestlé way over its licensed quota . the board states that `` current operations do not appear to be supported by rights to the diversion or use of water exceeding 26 acre-fee per annum . `` that 26 acre-fee per annum equates to an 8.5 million gallon annual cap , according to tds , so they 're 23.5 million gallons over , if the report is accurate . the board says nestlé needs to limit this diversion `` unless it has evidence of valid water rights to water within the permitting authority of the state water board . ",
        "`` nestlé said in a statement given to the la times that they would have liked to see the report first , and that they will review it thoroughly . `` we are disappointed by the fact that we have just received a copy of the report from the state water resources control board and that others appear to have received it much sooner . '' `` once we have had an opportunity to review the report thoroughly , we will be in a position to respond . ''   "
