        "as the mlb winter meetings progress , the new york mets reportedly seemed to find themselves shopping all-star pitcher matt harvey . however , new york mets new manager mickey callaway and staff , decided to ask to keep the once prized righty . before i get into my analysis , i want to acknowledge that i understand the nostalgia that surrounds the `` dark knight . `` this guy was once dubbed as the next tom seaver . however , i found shopping him as an appropriate and a good move for the mets . more from empire writes back new york mets : matt harvey inquiries come at an odd time5h ago buffalo bills : lesean mccoy buries the colts in ot blizzard8h ago new york yankees : stay away from the hype regarding giancarlo stanton11h ago new york yankees : what the giancarlo stanton trade truly means for the roster16h ago new york yankees : giancarlo stanton 's effect on the 2019 free agent class17h ago harvey is coming off what is arguably the worst season of his career .

        "the whole 2017 mets season is pretty forgettable . but harvey 's lackluster , injury ridden performance contributed to that . he spent much of his time injured and just did not have the same stuff he once did . harvey 's injury is nearly impossible to come back from . it 'll be what i consider a medical miracle if he is able to return to his old self . but i 'm not a doctor . so , it leaves us at this question : do the mets even need matt harvey ? i , for one , do not think so . ",
        "when he is on he is no doubt an asset . his performance in the 2015 world series was heroic and textbook playoff mets . but the mets still have noah syndergaard , jacob degrom , zack wheeler , steven matz , and seth lugo . the list goes on . even just syndergaard and degrom is a lethal 1-2 punch . with the mets also openly trying to build up their bullpen and get bullpen arms , it shows they wo n't need their pitchers to throw complete games . so , would n't that make harvey worth keeping ? ",
        "yeah , perhaps , but it could also not matter when he does n't have the juice to go more than a few innings . harvey shows flashes of promise still . i 'm not denying he is a smart and decent pitcher . but how much longer are fans willing to wait for harvey to magically get back to where he was ? listening to callaway is obviously what the front office should do , but i think it is a big risk . it is likely harvey will completely have to change the way he pitches both mentally and physically in order to keep him out there . ",
        "his stuff might not always be there and he will rely on what he is coached . yeah , he might not be done as an mlb pitcher , crazier things have happened . what i am saying though , is that his days of being the `` dark night , '' the same old harvey , might very well be over . it 'll take a lot of coaching and hard work otherwise . i like harvey , and i am rooting for this to workout , but if the mets can use him to build around positions they need like the bullpen or infield , then i was all for it . ",
        "if harvey can be an asset again , it 'll put the team right back into playoff discussion . matt harvey will seemingly remain a new york met , but now , instead of being an asset , he seems to be a project . as the mlb winter meetings progress , the new york mets reportedly seemed to find themselves shopping all-star pitcher matt harvey . however , new york mets new manager mickey callaway and staff , decided to ask to keep the once prized righty . before i get into my analysis , i w. . .
