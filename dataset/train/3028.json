        "the bengals are ending the season in a way that indicates all is lost , and there 's no reason to expect much of an effort here based on the way the team has played in recent weeks . andy dalton is a decent quarterback when he has excellent play from his line and a solid running game , but he tends to panic and throw the ball into coverage at the most crucial moments . the ravens will find themselves as a playoff team if they can win this game at home . it has been a remarkable turnaround after an awful start to the season , and head coach john harbaugh deserves credit . ",
        "joe flacco has had a tough season and his yards per pass are way down , but he seems to have picked up his level after the awful start . one of the most inexplicable stats during the 2017 season is seeing the bengals at the bottom of the offensive rankings . they are dead last in yards per game and rushing yards per game , and they are not likely to do anything in that area against the ravens . a. j. green is a talented receiver who struggles after taking a big hit . brandon lafell is a decent secondary receiver . ",
        "the ravens started to turn the season around when they started to give the ball to alex collins and he began to produce in the running game . collins is not a superstar , but he is steady and he is not going to fumble very often . the duo of mike wallace and jeremy maclin has improved quite a bit over the second half of the season and can make game-changing plays . the bengals have decent personnel on defense and played fairly well for the majority of the season . however , this unit has gotten overrun in recent weeks because the offense has been hopeless and the defensive players have gotten worn down and out . ",
        "discipline is often an issue here , as emotional players take ridiculous penalties that put the bengals in a terrible position . the ravens have been dependent on their defense for years , and that has not changed this season . the ravens will struggle when they are competing against the best offensive teams , but they can hold their own against average of below units . inside linebacker c. j. mosley is one of the most productive tacklers in the league , while terrell suggs has been resurgent with 11.0 sacks . the bengals are average in this area , and that 's not going to help them against a superb special teams unit . ",
        "cincinnati does a decent job of keeping opponents from making big returns , but alex erickson is just an ordinary return man . randy bullock is not the kind of kicker to depend on in clutch situations . the ravens are always among the best teams in the league when it comes to special teams , and they are at the top of the heap this year . the ravens do an exceptional job in coverage , while bobby rainey and michael campanaro are both dangerous return specialists . justin tucker will not miss clutch kicks .
