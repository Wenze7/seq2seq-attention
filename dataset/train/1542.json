        "let 's face it : when living in major cities such as san francisco or new york city , commuting can take a stressful toll on people who go to and from work on a daily basis . however , that could all change soon , as inventor franky zapata has created a new hoverboard that can fly in the sky . the ezfly hoverboard throws riders into the skycalled ezfly , the hoverboard resembles a segway but uses jet-powered thrusters to throw riders into the sky at 80 miles per hour . similar to riding on a segway , riders should hold on to handgrips that help steer body weight while flying into the sky . ",
        "video footage surfaced on youtube recently showing military personnel flying in the sky using zapata 's latest invention . in the video , there are about a dozen riders willing and ready to test out zapata 's ezfly hoverboard over a body of water in texas . all riders made it happen safely . unlike skydiving , it does n't seem like a lot of training is involved in getting started with the ezfly hoverboard . all riders make it seem relatively easy to be thrown into the sky by zapata 's new flying hoverboard . zapata always had big dreams to fly in the skywhat inspired zapata to create the ezfly hoverboard ?
