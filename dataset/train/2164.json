        "new yorkcomcast 's nbc is airing both the super bowl and the olympics in february , a double-whammy sports extravaganza that the company expects to yield $ 1.4 billion in ad sales , helping it justify the hefty price it 's paying for both events . nbc is banking heavily on these sports events since traditional tv ratings have slumped in recent years . live sports are marquee tv events that draw most of the largest tv audiences , but even those ratings have declined . more americans are dumping their cable packages -- comcast lost 33,000 video customers in the fourth quarter and 151,000 for all of 2017 -- and advertisers are following consumers to their phones . ",
        "spending on u. s. tv ads is expected to grow an anemic 0.4 percent this year , according to emarketer . in the october-december quarter , nbcuniversal 's broadcast tv ad revenue fell 6.5 percent , after a boost in 2016 from election ads . as it adapts to a slowing tv market , nbc is continuing some digital efforts from rio and expanding others to meet viewers wherever they are -- whether in front of a tv or not . the super bowlthe super bowl reaches more than 100 million people in the u. s. , outstripping every other tv event . ",
        "it 's the most expensive ad time on tv . this year 's super bowl is feb. . 4 and follows a two-year slump in regular-season nfl ratings , according to espn . but nbc has said it is not worried about a lack of interest . the game is an event that `` transcends sport and even the game itself , '' dan lovinger , an nbc sports ad-sales executive , said in january , about three weeks before the game . nbc said then that it had nearly sold out super bowl ad spots and that on average , companies are paying more than $ 5 million for 30-second ads during the game . ",
        "kantar media expects rates slightly higher than last year 's $ 5.05 million . fox aired the super bowl in 2017 , and said it had $ 500 million in ad revenues for the day . nbc has predicted about $ 500 million for the game and associated events this year . nbc also makes money from ads during events before and after the game and a special episode that day of its hit drama , `` this is us . `` for the first time , it 's selling ads for the game that will only appear on its app or website . ",
        "ads from pyeongchangnbc is paying $ 963 million for the broadcast rights to the winter olympics in pyeongchang , south korea , which follow a summer olympics in rio two years ago that disappointed in some ways . nbc ruled the airwaves during the rio games , besting other networks , and raked in $ 250 million in profit . but ratings for the prime-time broadcast declined compared to the london olympics in 2012 , so nbc had to give advertisers some extra ad slots to make up for it . this time around , nbc will sell ads for this olympics based on total viewership , counting cable and digital viewers as well as those who tune into nbc proper . ",
        "that gives them more leverage with advertisers , said brian wieser , an ad analyst for pivotal research group . nbc expects to sell more than $ 900 million worth of ads for the olympics , which it says would be the highest ever for a winter games . the company is offering more hours of programming this year , both on tv and online , than it did for the sochi games in 2014 . keeping fans happypast olympics have been criticized by fans for tape-delayed events . this year , nbc will air its nightly prime-time broadcast simultaneously across the country . ",
        "that means the west coast evening broadcast will start early , at 5 p. m.the company says it will be able to show many olympics events live for the u. s. audience , including skiing , snowboarding and figure skating . but some popular events will be live at odd hours in the u. s. speed skating will take place in the evening in korea , for example -- but morning in the u. s.nbc will stream the opening ceremony at 6 a. m. eastern on feb. . 9 , but only for cable customers . a delayed version will air on prime time . ",
        "and it 's not yet clear whether exciting medal-round events will be shown at the best time for nbc 's ratings , said kantar media chief research officer jon swallen . nbc just says that all figure skating , alpine skiing and freestyle snowboard finals will be aired live in either prime time or what it calls `` prime-time plus , '' which stretches from 11:30 p. m. until 2 a. m. eastern . going digitalas it did during the rio olympics , nbc has again partnered with buzzfeed to make videos on snapchat , a messaging app popular with millennials . ",
        "these will include behind-the-scenes videos posted by snapchat users , clips of athletes and olympics venues shot by buzzfeed , and snippets of nbc 's own olympics coverage . nbc 's revenue from its snapchat deal is in the tens of millions , said an nbc sports spokesman . the broadcaster is also teaming up with the online news site vox to make a daily olympics podcast for the 18 days of competition . nbc parent comcast is showcasing both nbc 's olympics broadcasts and streaming video for its home cable customers in a way that will be easily searchable on tv sets . ",
        "in its fourth-quarter earnings report on wednesday , comcast said its net income soared to $ 15 billion , or $ 3.17 per share , from $ 2.3 billion , or 48 cents per share , because of a one-time impact from tax changes recently signed into law . revenue climbed 4 percent to $ 21.92 billion .
