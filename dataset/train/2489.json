",
        "the step was really amazing as it allowed me to understand the blessing i have and really stimulated mind to feel more blessed and happy . at the end of day the journal allows you to focus on the good and positive thing that happened and it allows you to sleep well and happy with good things in mind . meditation allows you to relief your daily stress and be engaged in positive things . when you do random acts of kindness they bring satisfaction to your soul and i assure you that no other feeling than self-satisfaction is the biggest joy in the world .
