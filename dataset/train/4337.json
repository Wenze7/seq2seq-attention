        "for the royal family , the pressure of one 's wedding day is at an all time high , because just about all of great britain is watching . but as it turns out , diana , princess of wales , was n't the only person at buckingham palace to run into a bit of trouble before walking down the aisle . in fact , harper 's bazaar reports that queen elizabeth ii 's tiara actually had to be repaired the morning of her wedding . now that 's something we did n't see on netflix 's the crown . ",
        "originally , the fringe tiara was made for queen mary in 1919 . nearly 30 years later , elizabeth ii was set to wear the diamond-encrusted crown to marry prince philip . but as she was getting her hair done that morning wedding , it broke . `` the fringe tiara was given to queen elizabeth on her wedding day , and the hairdresser broke it , '' the royals ' jeweler , house of garrard , tells marie claire . `` on that day , they had it police escorted to the house of garrad workshops . we fixed the tiara that morning and had it sent back to queen elizabeth , and then she got married in it . ",
        "you do n't expect the royals to have these sorts of mix ups but they do ! '' three words : can . you . imagine ? the fringe tiara is n't the only royal accessory with historic origins , either . as it turns out , the stones in the three-carat diamond engagement ring prince philip proposed to elizabeth with originally belonged to his mother , princess alice of battenberg , who -- wait for it -- was gifted it on her own wedding day by tsar nicholas ii and tsarina alexandra of russia , the last rulers of the russian empire . ",
        "seriously . and given the fact that cleave and company , the jeweler responsible for meghan markle 's engagement ring , has stated it wo n't be producing any replicas , we have a feeling hers will , in 100 years , become just as iconic as these other family heirlooms . like what you see ? how about some more r29 goodness , right here ? zara will single-handedly get you ready for the holidays ` power , ' ` woke , ' & more of the most-used words in fashion22 purrfect gifts for all the cat ladies in the house .
