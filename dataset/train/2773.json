        "well , i can only imagine . can you imagine living your days stress free ? can you imagine being able to get out of bed the instant you open your eyes , without feeling like you did n't even want to be alive ? can you imagine actually sitting down to get work done instead of just staring at it because you are so mentally exhausted your body ca n't even move ? can you imagine being able to talk to people without feeling like they can hear alll your thoughts ? can you imagine being able to leave a conversation in the past without thinking about the words you said over and over in fear of having said something wrong ? ",
        "can you imagine living through your whole life , not once thinking about throwing yourself into oncoming traffic or throwing yourself off a building ? can you imagine being able to interact with everybody normally without ever needing time away from people to recharge ? god , i mean - can you imagine being neurotypical ? because i really , really ca n't ; not when my whole life has shown me that i am everything but . do leave a clap if you enjoyed this post !
