        "the smartest person in the room tends towards ambition . you can see what might be , you can see a few steps ahead of the current trend , and you can see how to get us from where we currently are to where we could be . you innately want to bring the light of possibility that you see into the world you live in today . your ambition fuels you . it moves you towards the promised land that you and a select few are able to see . this ambition , when embraced and manifested in ways that keep you open and available to the rest of the world draws people to your leadership . ",
        "over time , however , that same ambition can become a prison . you can become caught by the possibility that you see , and left jaded by the fact that the world is never as good as it could be . so , your ambition will initially fuel you towards leadership as a position . the role of leader will allow you to affect the vision you have for the world to a greater extent . initially , any promotion that grants you greater leverage will allow you to greater affect your mission and purpose . but as time goes on , that same ambition can lead to myopia -- an inability to see anything but the next promotion , the next set of responsibilities , the next bit of leverage . ",
        "in this way , your ambition has two detrimental aspects . first , it steers your attention away from the aspects of leadership that are less positional and more relational . it has you put your emphasis on job titles , responsibilities , and power , and lose sight of the softer aspects of being a leader everywhere in life : relationships , and the ability to create and be in intimate relationships with people . second , it masks this cost from you , as each time you rise further up the ladder and have your thirst for ambition quenched , you experience a momentary hit of satisfaction . ",
        "further , you do experience greater leverage , and do have more power , albeit at increasing diminished returns . as a consequence of these two factors , your ambition steers you away from an ability to develop deep and meaningful relationships , leaving you wondering why , despite your best efforts , you do n't seem to be able to achieve what you crave . you know you 've experienced what i 'm talking about when you find yourself asking questions like : why is it that the leadership my ambition drives me toward feels so lonelyis this just a consequence of being a leader ? ",
        "do i just need to resign myself to the fact that my vision requires letting go of things like relationships ? why is it that i can seem to master the business world , but seem to struggle at the basics of relationship ? your ambition is a lot like the first stage rocket-fuel that is burnt at the start of a shuttle 's launch , designed to create maximum thrust early , so that later on more efficiently-burning fuels can take over and continue to build the momentum more sustainably . while great to start your ascent with , if you continue to burn only that fuel , you will rapidly burn yourself out , reaching your apogee long before you are anywhere close to what you seek . ",
        "in a lot of ways , it 's an impossible task . i 'm positing that you 're way out is to set down the very tool that has brought you so far . if you the only fuel you have is first stage , and you stop burning it , surely you 'll plummet back down to the ground , crashing spectacularly . and while there is a degree of truth to that , it 's also the only way you 're going to learn how to fuel yourself in other ways when that is what is called for . ",
        "here are some of approaches you can take to begin to loosen the grip your ambition currently has on you : notice and make a list of the things that you set aside in pursuit of realizing your ambition . these are often things that you label with words like `` unproductive '' , `` inefficient '' , `` a waste of time '' , `` pointless '' , or `` boring '' . efficiency is entirely subjective -- your ambition tends to have you regard things like relationships as inefficient because they do n't move you towards the things outside of your myopia . ",
        "notice and make a list of the things that you put emphasis on in your life . you may currently think of these as your `` values '' , although your sense of your own values will likely be skewed as a result of your ambition . what do you notice is n't on that list ? what are the things you crave in your life , that ambition does n't seem to be bringing you closer to ? make a list of these , and then start noticing how you keep those things out of your life . you do n't need to do more to bring these things closer to you -- as a starting point , we want to get you clear on how you are keeping these things apart and distant from you .
