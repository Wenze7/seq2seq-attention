        "around this time 10 years ago , we were introduced to my favorite television holiday of all time : seth cohen 's `` greatest super-holiday known to mankind , '' chrismukkah . thanks to seth 's father , `` a poor struggling jew growing up in the bronx , '' and his mother , `` waspy mcwasp , '' the witty young boy came up with his own holiday by `` drawing on the best that christianity and judaism have to offer . '' chrimukkah featured the best of both worlds : eight days of presents followed by one day of many presents . ",
        "its best feature ? it was fully equipped for o. c. drama with twice the resistance of any normal holiday . and that was a good thing , because the o. c. ` s chrismakkuh episodes were some of its most dramatic . here 's how they rank in my mind : 1 . season 1 , `` the best chrismukkuh ever '' : not only was this episode the introduction of seth 's brilliant holiday , but it was filled with everything from a big party to a sandy vs. caleb showdown , a drunk marissa , and , of course , the anna vs. summer party extravaganza , which featured summer in a wonder woman costume . ",
        "plus , there was that adorable mall sequence for ryan and marissa , and no one can forget sandy 's sylvester stallone impersonation . 3 . season 2 , `` the chrismukkah that almost was n't '' : drama-wise , this episode got an a + . kirsten finding out about her father 's affair and throwing a vase at his head was great television . summer and marissa working to pull off a chrismukkah miracle for lindsay ? also great . and then there were the yamaclauses and seth 's amazing chrismukkah song set to death cab 's `` a lack of color , '' which featured a lyric about jesus and moses both having beards . ",
        "does it get any more cohen-y than that ? they were all great episodes . then again , how could they have been bad ? they had jesus and moses on their side . do you agree with my list ? or if you were n't an o. c. fan , what was your favorite television holiday ?   "
