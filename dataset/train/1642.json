        "columbus , ohio -- ohio 's largest city graduated its latest class of police recruits friday at a time of soaring street violence , a point underscored by reports of a double homicide as the ceremony got underway . columbus recorded 143 killings last year , four more than the number of people slain in 1991 during the crack cocaine epidemic . at least four people have died this year , including the two on friday . mayor andrew ginther , a democrat , noted the challenges facing officers as he addressed the new graduates . `` policing has always been a difficult profession , but these officers are entering it at a time in history both nationally and locally when the challenges may be greater than any other time , '' ginther said . ",
        "the record number of homicides has drawn attention to the police department 's staffing levels . the 33 officers who graduated friday brings the total number of columbus officers to about 1,880 , said spokesman sgt. dean worthington . the head of the union representing columbus officers said the department needs at least 200 more officers . police chief kim jacobs agrees more are needed but wo n't give a specific number , saying instead the department should grow with columbus , which continues to add population . `` i believe more officers on the street will help us better serve our community , '' jacobs said after the graduation . ",
        "the opioid epidemic , numerous illegal guns and gang violence are among the reasons for the city 's high killing rate . last month , a member of the deuce deuce bloods gang was charged with the deaths of four people in three separate 2017 killings . also in december , the franklin county coroner said the county that includes columbus saw 383 overdose deaths through september , higher than all of 2016 . most were attributed to opioids like heroin and painkillers . adding a minimum of 200 additional officers would allow full staffing of the patrol division and bolstering narcotics , gang , gun crimes , assaults and homicide squads , said jason pappas , president of the local police officers ' union . ",
        "the city needs 200 more `` just to get us where we can hit the ground running and doing some proactive work , '' pappas said . ginther 's budget this year pays for two more police recruit classes and $ 2 million to increase neighborhood-based patrols and programs working with the community , said spokeswoman robin davis . ginther is committed `` to hiring additional officers as resources allow , '' davis said . new police officer caleb ohl joined his father , lt. paul ohl , on the department friday . the younger ohl said he 's not deterred by the violence the city is facing or the scrutiny officers are under . ",
        "`` the challenges every day that being a law enforcement officer presents to officers -- that 's just something that really , really intrigues me and attracts me to the job , '' said caleb ohl , 21 . a pastor in a tough east side neighborhood says he 'll leave staffing needs to the police . for him , ending violence is a losing battle without community involvement . that means people in neighborhoods intervening with children early and taking responsibility for what happens on their streets , said the rev. frederick lamarr , senior pastor at family missionary baptist church . ",
        "`` to make any community safe , you 've got to have people in the community stepping up , telling these young kids they ca n't do this , that and the other , '' lamarr said . `` really , just taking a more active role . '' ___ andrew welsh-huggins can be reached on twitter at .   "
