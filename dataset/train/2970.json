        "there are a lot of ways to come at the patriarchy and white supremacy . i 've written about the power of protest and the importance of language . but one of the most obvious and practical ways to dismantle the systematic oppression of such a large portion of the population is to defund it . we know that money is power -- power to lobby on your issues , to buy politicians , to pay for lawyers , to give to the charities that are important to you . this power has been greedily hoarded by white people , mostly white men for all of american history . ",
        "every time you shop at a business owned by white men you are supporting the patriarchy and white supremacy . every time you invest in a company owned by white men you are supporting the patriarchy and white supremacy . every time you eat at a restaurant owned by white men you are supporting the patriarchy and white supremacy . why are you funding your oppressor ? now i say , `` when you ... '' but of course i mean me too because in our society white men own the vast majority of american owned businesses . it 's no easy task to avoid perpetuating the power of white men through the dollar . ",
        "it 's not easy but it can be done . while i 'm probably still going to shop at acme grocery cause it 's on the way home from work , i 'm going to be looking to women owned stores to buy my clothes and black owned bookstores to buy my books . this is the shopping season , so i encourage you to consider where your shopping is happening . shopping at stores owned by black women is the most concrete way to start dismantling the economic system that allows for -- and in fact profits from -- their oppression .

        "black women are the largest growing group of entrepreneurs . black women are more likely to be discriminated against in the work place , suffer sexual harassment , and bear the brunt of austerity policies , all the while being heads of a households . one of the best ways to counter this is to shop at the businesses black women are building for themselves . one of the easiest ways to do this is by going to the website buy from a black woman : `` when you support a black woman business owner you are taking the pledge to educate those around you on how to become a conscious consumer . ",
        "you are taking the pledge to spend your money places that will help empower your community . you are taking the pledge to inspire those around you to do the same . '' another way is through the app the official black wall street . it allows you to search for black businesses by location or type of business . it 's often easy to see if a woman owns the business . and if you are looking to shop right now let me direct you to this business owned by black women : the spice suite ... a spice bar in washington , dc that will ship you your culinary needs . ",
        "honey citrus cilantro is a must for my kitchen . the spice suite supports 17 other black women by offering them her space for free each month to sell their products . on sundays the space is open for non-recurring small black businesses for pop up shops . this is what happens when women are in business -- the support spreads . you 're going to spend that money somewhere , why not spend it at a company that is , by its very existence , fighting the patriarchy ? #buyfromablackwomanarticle by claire ryderverve operative usa & humanitarian activist .
