        "house prices as finally going into reverse in london , but the midlands show no sign of slowinghouse prices ended 2017 2.6 % higher than when the year started , with london identified as the uk 's weakest-performing region for the first time since 2004 , according to an index . across the uk , the average price was £ 211,156 in december , marking a 0.6 % month-on-month increase as well as the 2.6 % annual uplift , nationwide building society said . the annual rise was the slowest for any calendar year since 2012 . it compares with a 4.5 % annual increase in december 2016 . ",
        "for the first year since 2008 , prices in northern england and the midlands combined grew at a faster rate than in southern england , nationwide said , with a 3.6 % year-on-year increase compared with 1.6 % . in london , prices were down 0.5 % annually , taking the average to £ 470,922 . the strongest-performing region was the west midlands , with prices up by 5.2 % annually , followed by the south west at 4.8 % . an increase of 3.3 % was seen in wales , with 2.6 % in scotland and 2 % in northern ireland . ",
        "the 13 towns where house prices fell in 2017 revealed - and one 's in greater londonrobert gardner , nationwide 's chief economist , said 2017 `` saw the beginnings of a shift '' , as rates of price growth in the south moderated towards those in the rest of the country . he said : `` london saw a particularly marked slowdown , with prices falling in annual terms for the first time in eight years , albeit by a modest 0.5 % . `` london ended the year the weakest-performing region for the first time since 2004 . ",
        "`` gardner said a 20 % deposit in london now typically equates to more than £ 80,000 , based on the average first-time buyer price . this is around £ 30,000 higher than a decade ago . in other regions , such as the midlands and northern england , deposit requirements are similar to 2007 , he said . nationwide calculated that would-be buyers face spending around eight years saving for a deposit , rising to nine years in the south east and nearly 10 years in london . gardner said subdued economic activity and an ongoing squeeze on household budgets is likely to exert a modest drag on housing market activity and price growth in 2018 . ",
        "he said : `` overall , we expect house prices to record a marginal gain of around 1 % in 2018 . `` over the longer term , once the economy regains momentum , we expect house prices to rise broadly in line with earnings . `` gardner said much will depend on how brexit impacts on the uk economy . jonathan harris , director of mortgage broker anderson harris , said : `` getting the deposit together is still the biggest challenge for most first-time buyers and even a slowdown in property price growth is not enough to make the difference between being able to get on the property ladder or not , particularly in london .
