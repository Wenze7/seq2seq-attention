        "promotional material for monster hunt 2 photo : icit seems that the 3d craze in the chinese mainland is starting to cool off . monster hunt 2 , the sequel to the 2015 box office champion monster hunt , will only release in 2d when it premieres on february 16 in china , even though the first film came out in both 2d and 3d . monster hunt 2 is not the only blockbuster film to stick to 2d . when legend of the demon cat , veteran director chen kaige 's latest fantasy film , debuted in december of 2017 , a 3d version of the film was conspicuously absent , despite the fact that most chinese fantasy films tend to feature a 3d version . ",
        "`` both the cinematographer cao yu and i are very opposed to 3d , '' chen said during a film forum recently , according to a report by ent . sina . com . `` if 3d , we would not be able to present the real beauty of the tang dynasty , which we spent six years working on . `` chen made reference to 3d films ' inability to show off certain details because the glasses audiences must wear make the film seem darker than 2d films . `` i do not dislike 3d films . recent 3d films such as wolf warrior 2 and kong : skull island were great ... but if i take my child to the cinema for a film like kung fu panda 3 , i prefer seeing the 2d version , since children find wearing 3d glasses uncomfortable . ",
        "sadly , i could n't find any theaters that had a 2d version of that film , '' a mother in beijing told mtime on thursday . while it was estimated in 2017 that by the beginning of 2018 the number of 3d screens in china would reach more than 43,000 , `` some cinemas have invested in this to a limited extent ... 3d projectors vary and so the quality of experience is not fixed from theater to theater , '' a cinema manager who wished to remain anonymous , told mtime . the rising preference for 2d films among studios , even for big-budget commercial productions , can also be traced back to the overall good market performance these types of films saw last year . ",
        "for example , 2d films such as mainland director han han 's duckweed made a total of 1.04 billion yuan , hollywood action film logan brought in 732 million yuan and hong kong filmmaker wong jing 's crime action film chasing the dragon earned 576 million yuan . according to china box office , while only one 2d film , operation mekong , made it into the top 10 list of the highest earning films in china in 2016 , three 2d films managed to break into the top 10 in 2017 - never say die , youth and indian film dangal . ",
        "the ex-file : the return of the exes , which premiered on december 29 , 2017 , also a 2d film , was the highest earning film of the new year day holiday weekend . rise of 3dthe first 3d film to screen in the chinese mainland was actually a domestic film . in 1962 , moshushi de qiyu decided to give 3d try . in 2008 , hollywood sci-fi adventure film journey to the center of the earth came to the chinese mainland . it earned 67 million yuan at a time when there were only 139 3d screens , providing a hint of the coming 3d era . ",
        "however , it was the huge popularity of james cameron 's avatar , which was released in the chinese mainland in january 2010 , that finally kicked off the 3d craze in china . avatar became the highest earning film in china that year by raking in a total revenue of 1.33 billion yuan , more than double the amount earned by that year 's runner-up chinese disaster film after shock . avatar remained the box-office king in china for four years until transformers : age of extinction , another 3d blockbuster , set a new record with 1.97 billion yuan . ",
        "the number of 3d blockbusters imported from hollywood surged after avatar , and chinese filmmakers eagerly followed suit . the craze for 3d films could be seen from the rising number of 3d screens in china . when avatar debuted in china , there were about 800 3d screens in the chinese mainland , but by the end of that year , that number had increased to 1,000 . according to a 2013 report on edu . cnr . cn , by the middle of 2013 , the number of 3d screens rose to 11,854 . by december 20 , 2016 , the number of film screens in the chinese mainland reached 40,917 , with 3d screens taking 85 percent , or about 33,551 screens , according to cnr . ",
        "cncommercial reasons aside - tickets for a 3d film are sold at a much higher price than regular tickets - government policy is another factor behind the growth of 3d in china . in 2012 , china and the us signed a memorandum of understanding which increased the number of imported films in the chinese mainland from 20 to 34 , while requiring that the additional 14 films had to be 3d or imax versions . while chinese filmmakers seem to have lost their taste for 3d , that does n't mean these films have no future in china . ",
        "cameron , who is now working on avatar 2 and avatar 3 , is also working on 3d films that do not require audiences wear glasses . if he succeeds , this is sure to kick off another 3d craze for the film industry in china and the rest of the world .   "
