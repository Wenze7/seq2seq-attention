        "i do n't think i 've ever liked the first few miles of a run . that might be why i love races so much : for those first miles , you are surrounded by fellow eager runners -- and the energy is enough to carry you into the heart of the race , when the runners fan out and supporters on the sidelines dwindle and it 's back to you and your music and your thoughts . but on non-race days , i slog through it . i remind myself how good it feels when i finally find my rhythm . ",
        "sometimes i imagine being in a race , surrounded by onlookers instead of the trees and shrubs of the trail . i know , by mile 3 or 4 , i will have found my rhythm . i will have found what i 'm looking for . perhaps that 's why i love mid-distance running so much . if i have to force myself through upwards of a half hour of running before i get to that magical place , i want to spend as much time there as possible . ironically , it 's the short runs that make running feel like a chore , instead of an experience . ",
        "ii . my poison of choice is the various atv trails and fire roads that spiderweb the forests in this area of new hampshire . i can give the typical reasonings for it : the scenery , the beauty -- i can talk about how i need variety , how boring neighborhoods can be , how nice it is to be away from cars and in the thick of nature -- but i love the trails for the same reason i live for the hike . it feels like the woods around me take in whatever it is i 'm radiating out . ",
        "and i am radiating out . i 've mentioned before the grimaces i can make when i run -- as if everything that 's bothering me is brought to the surface for me to contend with as i speed along . perhaps that 's why i do so poorly on treadmills . i used to joke that treadmills are an existential panic in mechanical form -- spend that much time exerting energy only to go no where and eventually you 'll start questioning the meaning of life -- but it 's a lot more than that . on a treadmill , stuck inside , that energy has no where to go but off the walls , bouncing and echoing until there 's nothing but cacophony , drowning everything else out . ",
        "outside , there is nothing but the breeze . and in the open silence , i become a little less sodden . iii . `` so , what 's the difference between running and mid-distance running ? '' a friend asks during a sunday morning brunch . `` when it 's only 2 or 3 miles , i 'm running away from my problems , '' i quip . `` when i 'm running 6 miles or more , i 'm running with my problems . '' it 's supposed to be a joke , but i do n't know if there 's a better way to explain mid-distance running , or why i do it . ",
        "perhaps that is why the first few miles are so tough . in the beginning , i run while simultaneously carrying everything that weighs me down . i run while lugging the frustrations of the day , old hurts and haunts , what is on my mind , whatever is bothering me or got under my skin . my demons play piggyback as i attempt to find my stride . but somewhere along the line , it all gets shrugged off . it 's as if i find the fortitude to turn around and go , `` you do n't deserve me carrying you like this , '' and i demand them all to fall in line . ",
        "it would be wrong to say running gives me a platform to sort out what 's on my mind . if anything , i am the one on the platform , and every issue , insecurity , demon , and frustration is forced to sit in the audience , forced to recognize how insignificant they really are . i do n't bear witness to my problems so much as i make my problems bear witness to me , as the miles tick away , as i rediscover my strength amongst the waves of fatigue . it 's as if i get to say , `` do you not see what this body is capable of ? ",
        "do you not get how tiny you are compared to this ? '' i do n't run despite my aches and pains -- i run with them . i am present with my discomfort as a way to show i 'm more than just my discomfort . i become a conqueror of so much more than a few miles and a handful of calories . and in a piece that is filled with `` perhaps '' es , perhaps this right here shows why the mid-distance run deserves an ode . it is another nod to the understanding that you have to incorporate the body in order to heal the mind . ",
        "it is a reminder of the triumph and force of sheer , stubborn , resilient human will . it 's the ultimate equalizer , a way to win the staredown happening between yourself and your emotions . did something cross your path to rattle the cage , stirring up a dormant rage about something that you swore you had put to bed for good ? take it to the trails , the streets , and watch how it becomes no match for what your body can do . our earliest ancestors hunted by running their prey down -- by literally running until the deer or the bore had collapsed from exhaustion . ",
        "it 's why they believe humans sweat , why we have some of the physical traits that we have today . our ancestors ran to survive . and , in a way , so do i. iv . the woods take on new life in the winter . the trees are stripped bare and the space between them becomes more apparent . i can see deeper into the forest now -- i can see the forest through the trees . it 's a good feeling , to be able to see through everything . to see past what was once obscured , to know what exactly is in front of you . ",
        "it makes the world look a little more open , the path a little more free . i 'm on my last run before the december snow came . i 'm zig-zagging around a spiderweb of atv trails , keeping track of trail numbers , noting trails that fork away from me , hoping i can get to them soon enough -- motivating me to return and explore where the paths had diverged . i can hear the robert frost poem in the back of my mind , but i give it little room to breathe . even i refuse to be that clich√© . ",
        "besides , i know i 'll be back , even with way leading on to way . but maybe not for the rest of the season . snow means my runs will be relegated to the roads again , and only after they 've been sufficiently plowed . i typically lower my mileage in the winter . some years , i take a complete hiatus and let my knees recover . there will be plenty of outdoor activities to do : i 've finally learned how to downhill ski , and i have a pair of snowshoes i need to finally use . ",
        "my husband and i are also insanely close to finishing our basement , and there 's been talk about getting a treadmill once we do so . the treadmill : my existential panic in mechanical form . i 'm not opposed to it . there are times during the heart of winter when i 'll hear a song and it makes me wish i could lace up my shoes and hit the roads -- times when every muscle fiber in my legs becomes a pack of pavlovian dogs , and i 'm salivating at the sound of the bell . ",
        "i remind myself that my runs are very much not just about the external scenery , but the internal sensations . besides , it might be time to show i 'm stronger than the noise , too .   "
