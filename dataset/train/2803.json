        "how anxiety motivated me to teach -- and forced me to leavelast thanksgiving , my aunt and i were searching for something in her spare room when i came across `` my bird book : the study of ornithology '' , which i created when i was around eight years old . the book was comprised of a few illustrations and names of birds that an eight-year-old would likely know . i 've included the cover here as proof of its existence : i initially dismissed it as a cute and quirky creation . i was undoubtedly a creative child , often diving into music , art , and writing as my primary outlets . ",
        "i could n't help but feel sad as i went through the book , because i remembered how often i was alone and making things like this when i was growing up . i loved learning , but i hated being at school . i missed so many days of school when i was eight that i nearly had to repeat the third grade . my aunt stepped in to prevent this and gently forced me to go to school each day , no matter how tardy i was , or how many times i had refused the cheerios she so lovingly offered to my empty and churning stomach . ",
        "my aunt vividly remembers the time i sat in the car with her one day before school . i apparently looked at her and asked , `` why is this happening to me ? '' she told me she did n't know , but that maybe i could help other kids with their problems someday . i worked for a couple of years outside of the classroom after graduate school . i was certainly busy , but i could n't shake the teaching bug . i would even write lesson plans on my lunch hour `` just in case '' i found a position . ",
        "i finally faced the anxiety of having my own classroom when i joined a highly reputable teaching organization in 2013 and moved from new york to wilmington , delaware . the initial excitement of this transition led to extreme difficulty . my anxiety level was so heightened during my first year of teaching that i was almost asked to leave my position . i remember crying every day , sometimes during the day , sometimes when colleagues asked how the day went -- and even upon casually first meeting the speech therapist in the teacher 's lounge during a prep period . ",
        "`` oh , you 're crying , '' she said , pointing it out as a fact . i sure was . and i did n't stop for quite a while . i eventually got through the two-year teaching program and deemed year two the end of my teaching career -- but was offered a position working with small groups in special education and did that during year three . i moved to philadelphia and deemed year three the end of my teaching career -- but was offered a position at a different school in wilmington and did that during year four . ",
        "i deemed year four the end of my teaching career -- but was offered a position at a school in philadelphia and did that during the beginning of year five . the anxiety became exponentially worse around october of year five . i remember feeling like my brain was becoming more and more broken as time went on . i wanted so badly to continue to teach and manage and counsel and it started to feel impossible . i made jokes about not being able to finish a sentence at the end of the day because my mind was so full and yet so empty at the same time . ",
        "it stopped being a joke , though , when i re-read the e-mail i was sending to my supervisor to ask for her help . it sounded so desperate . surely i had picked up enough tips and tricks and tools after all this time that i could practice a fraction of the resilience i expected out of my students ... right ? wrong . so , so , so wrong . during that same november trip to my aunt 's house when i found the `` bird book '' , i regressed even more into my anxious mind . ",
        "i felt like that third-grader sitting in the car asking questions that had no immediate answers . my aunt and i talked about what was happening and , as usual , she snapped me back to reality : i probably was n't going to make it through the year this time . let 's face it : a human-shaped ball of anxiety and irritability and exasperation is in no position to work in a classroom . i had unknowingly made a secondary career out of overcoming my own anxiety and followed a cycle that would never end unless i made a serious change . ",
        "teachers are notoriously terrible at self-care , and i needed an outsider to tell me that what i was doing was just my version of this practice . i had to return to a realistic baseline of sanity and hope before i could do anything else . this article does n't really have an ending , because as with most things , the ending has led to a beginning . as the decompression phase ends , i look forward to figuring out my next step . if you 're in a similar position -- whether you 're a month , five years , or a decade into your career -- please talk to someone . ",
        "losing hope is the scariest feeling , but starting to regain it comes with a level of peace and freedom that i never could have imagined . whether it 's right now , tomorrow , or a month from now , i hope you can imagine it as well . ‚ù§ so that 's what i did . my go-to quote for year one .
