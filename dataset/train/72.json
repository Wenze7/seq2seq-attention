        "concerns are being voiced in pakistan about how a few radical groups with proven terror ties have been allowed to re-brand themselves as political parties . taj haider , one of the prominent and founding members of the opposition pakistan people 's party , which has been in power five times since 1970 , told voa the country is again seeing the trend of extremist groups camouflaging themselves to enter into politics . `` religion and politics can not go hand in hand , but unfortunately this is our new reality . we have seen the recent by-elections in lahore and peshawar where militant-turned-political parties were able to mobilize people and gather votes , '' haider said . ",
        "`` and these so-called new political parties , with proven terror records , look determined to contest the upcoming elections in 2018 . '' in a recent high-level party meeting presided by ppp chairman bilawal bhutto zardari , the son of pakistan 's slain prime minister benazir bhutto , the government was sharply criticized on its inability to forcefully implement the national action plan and bar proscribed groups from entering the political sphere . the national action plan is a 20-point strategy devised to combat extremism in 2015 that clearly states no banned groups can operate in the country by changing their names or identity . ",
        "analysts say many other political parties are also agitated and wary about the recent political dynamic that has allowed radicalized groups to enter the political arena . `` the government has repeatedly said it will not allow the hardliners to enter into politics , but the reality is different , these parties are going into masses , '' rasul baksh raees , a prominent analyst from pakistan told voa . `` as long as these proscribed groups stick to their extreme ideologies and violence , they will be a danger to the society and democracy itself . '' ppp 's acute criticism came as hafiz saeed , the alleged mastermind of 2008 mumbai terror attacks and leader of jamaat-ud-dawa , inaugurated the office of his newly launched political party milli muslim league in the eastern city of lahore . ",
        "pakistan 's election commission rejected mml 's party registration application in october , citing its link to jamaat-ud-dawa , a u. s. designated terror-sponsoring organization . but mml looks determined to contest the upcoming state and provincial elections . the party has several offices , has launched a website , and has a social media team spreading its messages through facebook and twitter . pakistan 's government has repeatedly emphasized it will not tolerate any political party with a proven record of promoting violence and terrorism to use democracy and political means to spread their extreme ideologies . but critics still say the government is not doing enough to stop radical groups from entering politics . ",
        "`` look what happened in lahore 's recent by-election and who can forget the power show by extremists on the roads of islamabad . the government was totally helpless , '' raees said . during the lahore election in september , a mml backed independent candidate secured the fourth position in the race . the by-election was also contested by tehreek-e-labbaik , another extremist religious party created to carry-on mumtaz qadri 's mission , the bodyguard who killed punjab 's governor salman taseer in 2011 after he had demanded reforms in the controversial blasphemy law . mumtaz qadri was later sentenced to death . ",
        "in november , thousands of followers of the islamist group tehreek-e-labaik blocked islamabad roads for weeks and demanded the resignation of law minister zahid hamid , after accusing him of blasphemy . the government eventually surrendered to hardliners ' demands after pakistan 's military played the role of mediator . the experts say the emerging trend of politicizing militancy is a danger to democracy . they also point out the sectarian and hardline rationale will further complicate the situation in the country that has been trying to combat terrorism for more than a decade . `` imagine when these hardliners , through political parties , will spread their extreme views on the grassroots level . ",
        "what will be the future of this country ? '' raees said . but some politicians dismiss the blending of radicalized groups into politics . haider believes the people of pakistan can differentiate between politicians and extremists and will not allow militant-turned-politicians to thrive . `` if you look at the past , the religious parties including the jamaat-i-islami , despite having a huge following , were never able to clean sweep or get majority in the electoral process of the country , '' said haider . `` even now , with all these efforts , i believe milli muslim league or tehreek-e-labaik will not be able to pull large numbers during the general elections . ",
        "religious or sectarian votes are scattered in the country and ca n't be unified and will not help these newly established political parties to win a prominent number of seats . ''   "
