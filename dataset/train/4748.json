        "under arsene wenger , arsenal have become synonymous with a distinct style of play , player development , and unfortunately , results . every manager and every club have a footballing identity . as such , it 's the shared responsibility of the two to create a team that adopts that identity . yet , with the average tenure of a top-level manager being as short as it is , most managers do n't get the chance to stamp their mark on a team , at least not the one they envisioned . however , this is certainly not the case with arsene wenger .

        "catch the latest episode of the pain in the arsenal podcast herenot only has wenger been able to definitively impart his identity on his team , but also the entire club . for two decades , he has helped shaped everything the club does , including player development and recruitment . the result is a crop of players with a style of play that , win , lose , or draw , is distinctly arsenal . more from pain in the arsenal arsenal : rotation system to fix midfield problems ? 1 h ago arsenal : riyad mahrez a commitment to the mesut ozil way4h ago arsenal : hello , jonny evans , we will take you immediately6h ago who can replace our midfield general patrick viera ?

        "12h ago arsenal : defensive problems are not one player thick14h ago to make my point , my friend alex , recently asked me about ainsley maitland-niles . this was after maitland-niles ' first start in the premier league and , not having previously seen him play , he wondered what type of player he was . my response , `` an attack-minded , technically gifted center-mid type ... what else do arsenal produce ? `` again , after seeing the result today , but missing the match itself , he asked , after a series of melancholy emojis , `` what happened ? '' ",
        ". to which my fingers typed out with muscle memory `` too easy to play against . all pretty playmakers . no grit . `` and that 's the identity arsenal have embodied since patrick viera left all those years ago : too easy to play against . this was again the story as arsenal fell to nottingham forest in the fa cup . with a team selection of reserves , fringe players , and , at best , frequently used substitutes , motivation should have been in full supply . they had everything to prove and a good platform to make their case . ",
        "yet , there appeared to be an overarching apathy , unmoved by the need to compete . this was most clear in the 44th minute , as no one was in the remote vicinity of eric lichaj for forest 's second goal . not a single midfielder or forward had prepared for a second ball as a sloppy clearance fell to him , unmarked and unchallenged at the top of the box . at no point during the game did arsenal make it hard for forest to play . despite 69 % possession on the day , arsenal rarely looked dangerous . ",
        "and while forest predictably set out to counter-attack , the gunners did nothing by way of nullifying the threat . in a game where they should have put their opponent on the back foot , and kept them there , arsenal did anything but . but here 's the thing , i do n't think it 's beyond these players to `` get stuck in '' or `` have an edge '' . i firmly believe for anyone to make it to the upper echelon of their respective sport they must have a superior competitive drive . a drive that results in a love a winning , a hatred of losing , and seeps into every match , 50:50 , and 1v1 battle . ",
        "yet , this was far from evident when watching the forest match . so where 's the disconnect ? could it be man-management and player motivation ? is it tactical in nature ? is it a combination of both ? either way , it seems as if there 's a culture where doing the `` dirty work '' is not admired . what 's worse , it seems as if the consequences for failing to compete are minimal . next : arsenal vs forest : 5 things we learnedunfortunately , this has become expected . an occasional bad game can be written-off as unlucky . ",
        "but this is n't occasional , and you ca n't write off an identity . under arsene wenger , arsenal have become synonymous with a distinct style of play , player development , and unfortunately , results . every manager and every club have a footballing identity . as such , it 's the shared responsibility of the two to create a team that adopts that identity . yet , with ...
