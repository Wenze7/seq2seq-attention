        "marine harvest , the world 's biggest player in the salmon aquaculture business , is moving into the bay of fundy . the oslo-based company filed papers tuesday with the federal competition bureau after making a share purchase agreement to take over newfoundland-based northern harvest , which has nine sea-farm sites in the bay of fundy and a processing plant in st. george . `` we do not have any operation in this area from before , '' said alf-helge aarskog , marine harvest 's ceo . `` it was interesting for us . '' the seafood company has 12,700 employees in 18 countries . ",
        "the northern harvest purchase marks its first foray into waters off the east coast of north america . ` i think new brunswick is difficult to expand in terms of number of fish and volume growth . ' aarsgog pointed to the bay of fundy 's proximity to boston and the eastern u. s. market , and to central canada . he said the new brunswick salmon farms can also ship to a large salmon-smoking plant , ducktrap river in belfast , maine , that is already owned by marine harvest . he noted , however , that growth potential for the company is limited in the bay of fundy . ",
        "`` i think new brunswick is difficult to expand in terms of number of fish and volume growth , '' aarskog said . `` it 's rather a condensed area with farming . but newfoundland has potential . it 's a huge area , and if we do the farming right , it can grow in the future . '' overcoming sea lice there are about 100 farm sites in the bay of fundy , making marine harvest a bit player in a region dominated by cooke aquaculture . when asked about the many sea-lice outbreaks in the shallower waters of the bay , aarskog pointed to marine harvest 's research and development programs , managed in house as well as in co-operation with universities and even other aquaculture companies . ",
        "`` sea lice is an issue for the industry but sea lice can be managed , '' he said . aarskog said the company has done a lot of work on the use of the ballan wrasse , a sea lice-eating fish that can be put into pens with the salmon . marine harvest is now raising its own ballan wrasse for that purpose and the fish is now widely used on sea farms in norway , scotland and ireland . it is not clear if ballan wrasse , a fish native to the eastern atlantic , would be permitted in canadian waters . ",
        "in the summer of 2016 , more than a half-million salmon either died or were pre-emptively killed in the midst of a fast-growing outbreak of sea-lice at two farm sites in passamaquoddy bay . the sites were under licence to the gray group , an aquaculture company being operated by ernst and young . gray group 's assets were later acquired by northern harvest . fundy baykeeper matt abbott of the conservation council of new brunswick said he will be keeping a close eye on marine harvest 's arrival , `` to see if this new ownership brings about any significant changes in stocking density pressure , pesticide use , or fish escapes in a bay that is already facing numerous environmental stressors .
