        "if most car journeys are made with just a single person onboard , why not make a car that 's focused on just that one person ? that 's electra meccanica 's argument with the solo , a single-seater electric car that 's targeted at commuters and urbanites who do n't need to haul around empty seats every time . the result is a battery powered three-wheeler that looks a little like the cross between a trike and a hammerhead shark . it 's transportation shrink-wrapped down to the driver alone : the single seat is flanked by the solo 's 16.1 kwh lithium-ion batteries , keeping the center of gravity low and , so electra meccanica promises me , the driving experience fun . ",
        "top speed is , theoretically , 82 mph , but the company -- perhaps sensibly -- limits it electronically to 82 mph . 0-60 mph comes in under eight seconds , and while the 94 lb-ft . of torque might sound low , it should be plenty in a vehicle tipping the scales at a mere 1,380 pounds . horsepower from the electric motor is 82 hp . according to the automaker , range is 100 miles on a full charge . that takes three hours on a 220 v outlet , or twice that on a regular domestic 110 v outlet . ",
        "since the driver shares cabin space with the batteries , it leaves room for a surprisingly capacious `` frunk '' front trunk and a rear trunk too . electra meccanica says you 'll fit 285 liters in there . the cabin itself is n't as claustrophobic as you might expect , courtesy of a tall windshield and a shoulder line that scallops down under the side glass . all of the instrumentation is on an lcd inset deep into the dashboard ; you get sizable toggle switches for the lights and other features , and machined metal stalks on the column . ",
        "power windows and a heated seat are standard ; air conditioning is optional . it 's not going to appeal to everybody . if you only feel safe on the road in a beefy suv , the 122 inch long solo could feel like you 're racing along in a bathtub . it 'll do highway speeds , certainly , but just how comfortable you 'll be in the blind spots of trucks and vans is questionable . conversely , though , city parking is going to be a doddle -- there 's even a reversing camera -- and the solo does make a not-insignificant amount of sense as a weatherproof alternative to a bike or scooter for commuting . ",
        "the $ 15,500 price tag will get a chunk eaten out of it by state and federal ev incentives and rebates , too , making it one of the most affordable electric cars out there as well . new orders will ship in q4 2018 , electra meccanica tells me . more electra meccanica .   "
