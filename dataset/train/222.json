",
        "drill pipe is the basic part consisting drill column , the main function is deepening well hole , transmit torque and forming drilling liquid circulation passage . drill pipe is made by steel pipe and tool joints , steel pipe and tool joints are welded together by friction welding . mechanical properties of steel pipe , tool joints and weld seam meet the requirement of api spec 5dp . we could manufacture drill pipeaccording to the requirement of customers .
