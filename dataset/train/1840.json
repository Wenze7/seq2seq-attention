        "another man 's trash is another man 's treasure . well , that might be a little extreme , but the sentiment is still the same . a week after being fired by the seahawks , former offensive coordinator darrell bevell will be interviewing with the falcons for their opening quarterbacks coach position . bevell 's offenses have stalled mightily since 2015 , back when it ranked first in the nfl . it has since come in 16th in 2016 and 14th in 2017 after having years of success in the early 2010s . this past season , seattle was 23rd in time of possession and 15th in yards per game . ",
        "former panthers qb coach ken dorsey will also reportedly be in line for an interview for the position . familiarity with falcons head coach dan quinn could swing in bevell 's favor . both worked together on the seahawks , which can go a long way when deciding key coaching jobs . bevell is ready to show the nfl that he still has what it takes to help run an offense . and with matt ryan as his potential mentee , a bounce-back is definitely possible .
