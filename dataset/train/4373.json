        "a high school is closing down in rochester , vermont , after enrollment fell to just three students . vermont , like some other rural states , has been wrestling with dropping enrollment , rising education costs and tightening budgets , and is searching for solutions ; it has encouraged school districts to merge . nationally , school budgets have yet to fully recover from the impact of the 2008-2009 recession , and while enrollment is increasing overall , the proportion of students in rural schools has been decreasing over the past decade , according to patte barth , the director of the national school boards association 's center for public education . ",
        "but in many ways , vermont 's predicament is special . it is a largely rural state , and one of the least populated , with a yearly average decline of about 1,300 students due to a stagnant population . the burlington metro area , vermont 's largest , barely tops 200,000 people . the remaining 400,000 residents are spread throughout a few smaller cities and many smaller towns , not far from one another as the crow flies but often separated by the ridges and valleys of the green mountains for which the state is named . some u. s. towns have tried to pool resources and get the benefits of economies of scale by consolidating districts or schools , but one downside can be transportation , with students taking a bus an hour and a half one way , requiring them essentially to extend their school day and cut into extracurricular activities , according to barth . ",
        "mountains surround picturesque rochester , a 25-minute drive from the nearest big town . when tropical storm irene washed away roads and bridges in 2011 , it was virtually cut off from civilization . for the past decade , the talk has been about how to keep the school open with fewer and fewer students , school board chairman jeff sherwin said . rochester considered merging its school district with two other communities , but the proposal failed after not all the towns approved it . now some of its 1,000 residents are thinking about homeschooling or moving , while some families worry how they will get students to and from school in another community . ",
        "in the next academic year , the elementary school will merge with the district serving neighboring stockbridge , and each town will keep those schools open . rochester middle and high school students will go to other schools , with parents providing transportation . one option would be for parents to drop them off 4 miles away in another town that would then take them to a school in middlebury , a 40-minute drive from rochester . teachers saw that the high school , which is next to the elementary school , would likely close , so some decided to leave last year , sherwin said . ",
        "that gave the school board about a month and half to find new teachers , he said , so the board chose to pay tuition for the high school students to attend schools in other communities , he said . kimberly taylor , who has attended the rochester district all her life , said she did n't have enough time to research what school to attend , so she decided to stay . her brother attends the middle school , and their mother works in the school kitchen of the building that houses the middle school and high school . ",
        "most of her friends left to go to school over a mountain in middlebury or to an early college program in randolph , about a half-hour drive . `` i knew that not everyone would stay , but i thought a couple more would , '' said taylor , who runs cross country but had to run with the middle school team this year . she now worries that scholarship money intended for rochester graduates will no longer be available to her . karen rogers , whose daughter attends the middle school , does n't know what their family will do about school next year . ",
        "`` we 've talked about actually moving out of town , '' she said . `` we 're not sure what to do yet . '' resident connie mendell said she sees both sides of the issue . `` it 's kind of like we 're just in a really tough spot for a while . and i hate to say it but i 'm glad my kids made it through before this happened , '' she said .
