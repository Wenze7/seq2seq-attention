        "in october 2017 , vadim pushkarev , a moscow-based lawyer , uploaded his genetic code to a new service called zenome that promised him more than just information about his ancestry . this company was offering cryptocurrency . `` 23andme sells your data to other companies , '' pushkarev told me . so , he reasoned , why should n't he sell his ? zenome 's pitch is this : upload your dna data from a company like 23andme , and zenome will connect you to other companies that might want to sell you their own dna-interpreting services or to buy your data for research . ",
        "in the companies own words , it 's a `` decentralized market for genomic data and services . '' all powered by blockchain , of course . `` who is the true owner of this data : you or somebody else ? '' zenome founder alexey gorbachev told me from moscow , where the company launched in beta mode six months ago . `` we want to give people rights to manage their genetic information . if you want to sell your data , you can . if you want privacy , you can store it securely . `` now , your genetic code is extremely personal information , and for a host of reasons , like maintaining privacy around your health , it 's probably not a great idea for you to sell that data to just anybody on the internet . ",
        "zenome 's marketing does not exactly inspire confidence . an electronic music-backed video on the company 's website urges people to help `` start the fourth technological revolution , '' an invitation that feels more related to a ` 90s-themed rave than a genomics startup . but zenome is not the only company angling to create an online marketplace for buying and selling genetic information . last year , former executives from dna-sequencing giant illumina got together to start lunadna , a `` genomic and medical research database powered by the blockchain , '' which is slated to launch this year . ",
        "another company , dnasimple , matches people directly with research studies and pays them for it . a handful of similar startups are in stealth mode . bob kain , the ceo of lunadna , told me that the company 's primary goal is to incentivize more people to share their data and store it in one easily accessible place , so that more medical researchers can access it . `` companies tend not to share their data with each other . if all the companies shared there data , the databases would be 10 times larger , and we would be driving much more discovery , '' kain said . ",
        "like zenome , lunadna 's model incentivizes participation by rewarding it with its own cryptocurrency , in this case the luna coin . the company thinks of it as giving each participant a little piece of ownership over the database . luna coin , a model still in development , will have monetary value and can be cashed out , though kain did not elaborate on how exactly participants can spend them . the more you share , the more your luna coin stash grows . researchers can then buy the anonymized data from lunadna , also using luna coin . ",
        "the use of the blockchain to secure data and the community ownership model , kain said , address some of the concerns associated with consumer dna-testing companies like ancestrydna and 23andme . `` we are going to enable community members to own the database , '' kain said . these kind of marketplaces may very well be the future . human dna has become a valuable research commodity , as drug companies , academic researchers , and governments all mine dna databases in their search for new treatments and health innovations . in 2016 , one market research firm predicted that biological samples will generate $ 23 billion in revenue by this year . ",
        "at the same time , consumers like pushkarev are more aware of the value of their genetic information and want compensation for it . why should 23andme charge you to make money off of your data ? but how do you know the true value of your genetic information ? what are the security risks of sharing that information online ? and what about the risks of sharing intimate information about your health and family without knowing exactly where it might wind up ? we still do n't fully understand how sharing our dna publicly could affect us or our descendants in the future . ",
        "just last month , the federal trade commission issued a statement warning consumers about potential risks . `` a major concern for consumers should be who else could have access to information about your heritage and your health , '' the ftc wrote . a worst-case scenario , for example , is that a person could one day face employment or insurance discrimination , or even social stigma , based on their genetic information . the harvard geneticist robert green told me that a marketplace that encourages more people to share their genetic information could be a boon to medical research , but it will be hard to get right . ",
        "enabling medical research is important , but so is protecting the privacy of people 's genetic information . selling your information for medical research is one thing , but what if it 's going to be used for targeted marketing ? and medical research may not be the only way such marketplaces wind up being used . the founders of zenome , for example , were originally inspired to form the company when unilever was looking for genetic information to help it launch marmite in russia . selling your information for medical research is one thing , but what if it 's going to be used for targeted marketing ? ",
        "`` they 're taking new science , greed , consumer ignorance , and bitcoin mythology to take advantage of people , '' said petter pitts , the president of the center for medicine in the public interest and a former fda associate commissioner . `` it 's very similar to people who say ` come to mexico for a cancer cure . ' `` in addition to all the usual risks of sharing your genetic information , he said , these marketplaces add a new concern . `` if your genetic data is valuable , should you have the opportunity to share in the profit ? ",
        "absolutely yes , '' pitts said . `` but all individual genetic makeup is not equally valuable from a monetary perspective . there 's the danger of people being confused as to what they have and being taken advantage of . `` pusharev told me he originally signed up for zenome simply because he wanted information on whether or not he was a carrier of a specific genetic disease , congenital lactose intolerance , which his son suffers from . at that point , 23andme was still banned from telling consumers about health risks by the fda . it turned out he was a carrier . ",
        "but he also believes consumers should be able to profit from their data , and that monetary incentives will spur the kind of innovation that could help people suffering from genetic disorders like his son 's in the future . `` the more people do genetic tests , the more practical applications of genetic data we will achieve , '' he said . it seems almost inevitable that one day we will commonly buy and sell genetic information online . just beware of to whom you sell it .
