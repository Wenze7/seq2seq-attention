        "the run-up to the holiday season continues to bestow gifts on income investors . as it 's been in recent weeks -- and throughout 2017 , come to think of it -- the business-news ticker was busy with news of dividend raises from noted stock market names . three of the more prominent ones for the period were boeing , at&t , and waste management . let 's take a glance at each of their increases . boeing . it 's hard to avoid soaring-in-the-air analogies when talking about the new dividend from top aircraft maker boeing . the company is raising its quarterly payout a mighty 20 % , to $ 1.71 per share . ",
        "it 's also launching a new $ 18 billion share-repurchase program . lately , the company 's revenue has seen an uptick thanks to an increase in aircraft deliveries . although profitability was down -- $ 1.85 billion in q3 , against $ 2.28 billion in the same period last year -- the lower figure was due to a large , one-off tax gain in the 2016 frame . meanwhile , a spate of recent orders bodes well for boeing 's continued improvement in fundamentals . also , the rise in deliveries has goosed operating and free cash flow ; fcf in q3 saw a sturdy 15 % year-over-year rise to almost $ 3 billion . ",
        "that 's sufficient to cover the company 's dividend payout and its recent series of share buybacks . it 's a conservatively managed company , so we can expect it to maintain that dynamic . boeing 's upcoming distribution will be paid on march 2 to stockholders of record as of feb. . 9 . its payout ratio is 63 % , while it would yield 2.3 % on the most recent closing stock price . the latter compares favorably with the current 1.8 % average yield of dividend-paying stocks on the s&p 500 . the stock-buyback initiative replaces an existing program . ",
        "although boeing did n't specify an end date for it , the company did say that it expects its repurchases `` will be made over the next 24 to 30 months . '' at&t . well known as a comparatively high-yield stock investment , telecom incumbent at&t is supporting that figure with a modest increase . it just declared that its next quarterly dividend will be $ 0.50 per share , $ 0.01 or 2 % higher than before . the company , by the way , is a dividend aristocrat . this will be the 34th year in a row it has bumped its regular payout higher . ",
        "the incremental raise was perhaps justified , given recent results . at&t 's q3 revealed continued customer losses , with a net 97,000 postpaid phone subscribers and 251,000 directv customers ditching their services during the quarter . not surprisingly , both revenue and net profit fell , by a respective 3 % and 9 % to $ 39.67 billion and $ 3.03 billion . both were slightly below the average analyst estimates . that was the bad news . the good is that the company is still well in the black and continues to be a cash-generating machine . cash flow is robust and lately has been more than enough to cover that generous dividend and the most recent share buybacks . ",
        "the company will probably continue having to fight customer erosion , but it should remain a profitable and cash-generating giant nonetheless . the company 's long-simmering attempt to merge with time warner is meeting plenty of resistance from the feds , so we ca n't yet factor that into our consideration of its ability to fund the payout . at&t is handing out its new dividend on feb. . 1 to shareholders of record as of jan. . 10 . it yields a theoretical 5.2 % , while its payout ratio is 68 % . waste management . waste management , the most prominent trash hauler on the market , is about to add 9 % to its shareholder distribution . ",
        "the new quarterly dividend will be just under $ 0.47 per share . the company also announced a new $ 1.25 billion share-buyback program . these declarations come not long after waste management released encouraging q3 results . the company 's revenue rose by 5 % to $ 3.72 billion , with adjusted net profit advancing at a 6 % clip to $ 398 million . this was attributed to a rise in volume and prices in certain aspects of the company 's business , such as recycling . it believes these factors will remain in force and accordingly adjusted its fiscal 2017 earnings and free cash flow guidance upward . ",
        "it 's now projecting that per-share net profit will come in between $ 3.19 and $ 3.21 , with free cash flow of $ 1.70 billion to $ 1.75 billion . those numbers were $ 2.65 per share and $ 1.62 billion , respectively , in fiscal 2016 . waste management typically posts a profit and lands well in the black in terms of operating and free cash flow . that habit , plus the company 's reasonable optimism for the future , leads me to believe that it 'll be able to raise the dividend again before too long . ",
        "waste management has n't yet determined the record and payment dates of its upcoming distribution , the payout ratio of which is 52 % , entirely in line with the company 's long-term goal . the new distribution would yield 2.2 % on the current share price . the company did not specify an end date for the new stock repurchase program . it ai n't over till it 's over . for income investors , there 's no such thing as too many dividend raises . luckily for them , raise-heavy 2017 is n't finished yet . these are n't the final increases for the year , by any means .
