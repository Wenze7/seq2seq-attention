        "paris saint-germain coach unai emery is yet to decide whether top scorer edinson cavani and midfielder javier pastore will return to the side for sunday 's ligue 1 trip to nantes . cavani and pastore were not in the squad as psg beat amiens 2-0 in midweek to reach the coupe de la ligue semi-finals following their late return to training after the mid-season break . the south american duo were also omitted from the 6-1 coupe de france rout of rennes last weekend . emery told a news conference ahead of the ligue 1 resumption that cavani and pastore were in contention but would not offer any guarantees , with his prime concern that his league-leading squad do not lose focus . ",
        "`` cavani and pastore are recovering , '' he said . `` they continue to work . `` we 're going to see their work and decide later for their participation in the nantes match . `` i want to win on sunday in nantes and i want to prepare this match with the players who are ready . `` the group is strong mentally . it is not disturbed by this case . the players are smart , the club has plenty of experience and so do i. `` we want to maintain peace inside and outside the group . ",
        "i am happy with all the players in my group . '' veteran midfielder thiago motta remains out , while yuri berchiche is set to keep his place ahead of layvin kurzawa at left-back as psg aim to bolster a nine-point advantage over monaco at the summit . `` at the moment , i prefer to continue with berchiche because kurzawa was sick last week , '' emery added . `` the competition for this position is good .
