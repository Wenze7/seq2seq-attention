        "photograph courtesy of instgram/julianaharkavy the shredded actress has been ass-kicking her way through the cw 's ` arrow ' series . arrow arguably has the most shredded cast on tv , and its biggest badass of all might be superhero and fitness fanatic juliana harkavy . for two seasons , the 33-year-old actress has been ass-kicking her way through the cw 's arrow series as dinah drake , better known to dc fans under her leather-clad vigilante name , black canary . after arrow 's mid-season 6 return last night , men 's health chatted with harkavy about superhero fitness , working out with the cast , and how guys can grow in 2018 . ",
        "credit link : . you come from a family of athletes , and you 're obviously in great shape yourself . what 's the biggest overlap between fitness and acting ? this role has really helped me understand that in ways i never really did before . i think the physicality of being an athlete or working out , it grounds you . it centers you . i 've been able to really use that in this role . and i 'll continue to use it in the future because i think it brings you into your body . when you 're acting , that is so important . ",
        "from the beginning arrow has always had one of the fittest casts on tv . has that ever come close to becoming a competition ? that 's funny , but it 's not a competition ! it is fun . we work out together . it 's less of a competition , it 's more of a way for us to bond . everyone can stay healthy together . as you get deeper into this role , have you been able to get more hands on when it comes to the fight coordination and the stunts ? that 's been one my favorite parts of the show . ",
        "this year in particular i 've really tried to work more closely with my stunt double , whose name is ivett . she 's amazing . she 's an olympian in taekwondo . this year i had an open dialogue with her about dinah 's journey , not only emotionally but physically as well . i 've been training how to kick properly . just really basic things . a lot of boxing . the b≈ç staff , obviously . it 's just been great to learn how to tell her story physically , as a fighter . and grow as a fighter and an athlete , not just a character . ",
        "is there a different mindset to getting into superhero shape , comic book shape , as opposed to your regular person going to the gym ? i think there is . i find myself working out now more deliberately . it feels more like a job . it 's not like , `` ah , good , i got to go to the gym this week . '' i truly feel like it helps her story . she 's a superhero and she 's out here fighting guys twice her size . first of all , it needs to be believable that she can fight them . ",
        "but i also want to feel like i can fight them -- that i can roll with these big dudes . so it 's become a lot more of a serious endeavor , my physical fitness . is there any time those fight scenes feel cathartic ? oh , yeah ! i joke that my husband and i have never been happier . i get to get out all my anger on set . it 's true . you get everything out . you can punch a bag or , with my character . i can literally just scream if i need to . ",
        "it 's therapeutic . i think it 's calmed me down in real life . we 've been asking people a lot , in the light of the #metoo movement , how men can be better in 2018 . i 'd love to get your thoughts , as someone who kicks ass on-screen and off . one thing that i draw from all these different experiences , and my own experiences , is that men just need to listen . if men listened to women when they say no , when they say how they feel , that that 's not something that can be pushed around or pushed over . ",
        "i think that if we just start something as basic as men truly listening to women , which is one thing that i feel , that our voices are just not heard in the same way as men 's voices are . if they could just show us that respect , i think that would be a really great starting point .   "
