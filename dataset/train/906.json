        "liverpool 's defensive problems have been well documented this season , and the fans in the transfer tavern are eager for jurgen klopp to find a solution . it 's clear that dejan lovren , in particular , is not good enough to start every week for the reds , and so with the january transfer window fast approaching , a big name arrival is absolutely essential . it 's not going to be easy to bring a top player in halfway through the season , but klopp must try , and one player that might be perfect is jonathan tah -- who is rated at £ 19.8 million by transfer markt . ",
        "tah , currently playing for bayer leverkusen , has been making a name for himself in europe over the last few years . he 's a regular with the german outfit , having cemented his place in the heart of the defence . at just 21-years-old , he has already amassed 54 league appearances for leverkusen , with his quality not in doubt . he has also already picked up 7 international caps . a natural defender , tah 's tackling , positioning and strength all combine fantastically to make him one of europe 's finest young defenders . you do n't become a regular in a top european side without talent , and he has it in droves . ",
        "what 's more , at just 21-years-old , and with so much developing still to do , there is no telling just how good he could be . a big move , then , is surely in his future , and liverpool would be wise to bring him in . the more he plays , the better he will become , and it would make sense for the reds to invest in him now , and then they can reap the rewards for years to come . he would be the perfect player to build a faltering defence around -- agreed ?
