        "between the incessant headlines and chatter on social media , it feels like everywhere we go some libertarian evangelist appears asking us if we have a second to talk about the blockchain -- like a religious wingnut lurking outside the grocery store . the fever for a magic internet money no one actually understands is definitely something akin to religious fervor right now . in the biggest example of blind faith yet , people are apparently mortgaging their homes to buy bitcoin as it soars to previously unimagined value . at the time of publishing , one bitcoin is worth over $ 16,000 -- far above its worth this time last year when it was $ 807 . ",
        "but good luck finding places to spend it : bitcoin is getting mainstream adoption , but you still ca n't pay your credit card bill with it . the whole thing has a vibe that portends disaster , or at the very least , the beginning of a lot of stories about scammers making bank while normal people get hoodwinked . so it 's no wonder that the always-sketchy , ever-scammy , and terminally exploitative online ad industry is starting to get replaced in favor of cryptocurrency mining -- the nonconsensual use of a website visitor 's computer to make more imaginary coins . ",
        "the trend emerged in september , yet it 's making news this week thanks to twitter user noah dinkin spotting a starbucks location overtaxing its customers ' machines to mine for the cryptocurrency monero . the starbucks reward site for argentina was using its portal to run coinhive 's code to farm monero coins on starbucks customers who were using the coffee giant 's wifi . starbucks still has n't responded to public inquiries about the cryptocurrency miner , causing speculation that the company may be purposely doing the illicit mining . the wider public started to really hear about coinhive in early september , with the pirate bay 's attempt to run a cryptocurrency miner off its website . ",
        "pirate bay angered its visitors with the experiment , who at first suspected foul play , with coinhive 's non-consensual use of computer resources to farm magic internet money . there was a backlash , and pirate bay abandoned its coinhive experiment . coinhive and monero popped up in headlines again just a few weeks after that , at the end of september , when it was found in tv channel showtime 's websites . the company never commented on the coinhive issue , but speculation was that it was testing the new trend of supplementing advertising with cryptocurrency mining . ",
        "soon after that , a new problem emerged with the rush to cash in on crypto coins : vulnerable iot devices . because of course if there 's anything else that can go wrong with your connected toaster and security-challenged baby monitor , it will . now , these dumb devices are letting jerks creep into our homes to drain electricity and device resources to mine monero . in october trendmicro started documenting the rising trend of cryptocurrency mining malware and its use of smart home devices like `` home routers , ip cameras , and even smartphones . '' ",
        "the company warned that `` it takes a huge amount of power and resources to mine cryptocurrency , and the rising value will only motivate attackers to pursue it directly using more aggressive means . `` monero is one of an infinite number of ridiculously named cryptocurrencies in circulation right now . are they worth anything ? maybe ! let me consult some runes and get back to you . everyone knows bitcoin , and other coins of similarly volatile , fluctuating value go by names such as etherium , litecoin , ripple , monero , zcash , populous , tron , einsteinium ... and so on . ",
        "monero bills itself as `` a secure , private , untraceable cryptocurrency based on the cryptonote protocol . '' as of this writing , one monero is worth $ 327.82 . but good luck finding places to spend it . coinhive and its method of farming is much more ubiquitous . coinhive is a javascript library that mines monero by using the cpu resources of users visiting websites . coinhive 's shady website , which is blocked by most ad blockers , entices users to `` monetize your business with your users ' cpu power '' and `` run your site without ads . ",
        "`` which is exactly what some businesses have started doing . so have malicious hackers who are popping open websites and inserting the coinhive code to run it without anyone knowing . security blog bleepingcomputer noted that `` coinhive has been recently adopted by a large number of malware operations , such as malvertisers , adware developers , rogue chrome extensions , and website hackers , who secretly load the code in a page 's background and make money off unsuspecting users . `` like with online advertising , which is generally considered unwanted , unsafe and prone to infectious malvertising , security-minded companies and ad blockers are lining up against the use of things like coinhive . ",
        "ad blocker adguard calls it `` crypto-jacking '' and this week posted that the practice `` has soared to even greater heights , '' calling out four popular streaming sites for using it . those sites are openload , streamango , rapid video , and onlinevideoconverter . in october malwarebytes joined ad-block plugins in preventing coinhive 's javascript from running in web pages , because `` there are site owners who do not ask for their users ' permission to start running cpu-gorging applications on their systems '' and saying coinhive was the second most-frequently blocked website for its customers . ",
        "more ad blockers are taking up the charge by protecting unsuspecting users from coinhive , such as ublock origin . the miners are now considered malware . popular anti-ddos service cloudflare , which is busy trying to figure out how to let neo-nazi sites back on their platform , took a more drastic step to block coinhive scripts and sites that use them . these security companies are n't psychic : it 's crystal-clear that this kind of exploitation is n't going away . it 's only going to get worse as blockchain 's fervor continues to mystify the wider public and consume the greedy and desperate with its lure of a quick buck . ",
        "which is pretty much the story of how everything on the internet sucks right now . i mean , it 's really neat to be subjected to the exploitation of another libertarian fantasy wealth experiment gone wrong . in other words , it 's time for less trust and more self-defense . avoiding cryptocurrency miners is n't going to be easy , but using products like ublock origin who are taking an early stand is a good place to start . so is blocking javascript . avoiding the blockchain version of hare krishnas , on the other hand , is going to be trickier .
