        "playerunknown 's battlegrounds has officially left early access on pc . following a long period of server maintenance yesterday , the 1.0 version of the game was pushed live to players around the world before being announced on twitter at 3:01 a. m. est. . like clockwork , it crashed hard just a few hours later . it always takes a while for a large game update to propagate . immediately after launch , the numbers on steamcharts climbed slowly , but steadily . around 5:00 a. m. est there were one million players . a half-hour later , the number was closing in on 1.5 million . ",
        "that 's when things started to get a little wacky . at launch , one of the first things that the battlegrounds client does is connect to a server . i 'm sure it 's checking on things like the clothes you own and how many credits you 've got in the bank . but around 5:30 a. m. today , i just got a blank screen . no character , no hud , just a windswept corner of erzangel with a big hole in the middle of it where my avatar should be standing . after restarting the game several times , i finally got into a match , but with only about 10 other players in-game , the timer never started counting down to start the match . ",
        "we were stuck there , all of us , in a kind of weird limbo . one player just ran off toward the horizon . but , after a bit of work in the server room , it looks like everything is going smoothly for the team at pubg corp. . the total player count is climbing , and should be over two million within the hour . by this evening , expect the game to come close to its all-time high of more than 2.9 million . as anticipated , the final 1.0 release includes climbing and vaulting and the new desert map miramar . ",
        "there are lots of small fixes to read about , however . you can find the complete patch notes on steam . the xbox one version of battlegrounds is still in early access . no formal release date has been given .   "
