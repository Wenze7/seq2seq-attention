        "when it comes to being fiscally responsible , millennials tend to get a bad rap . but in reality , younger workers are ahead of the game in many financial regards . a good 80 % of millennials follow a budget , compared with just about 40 % of the general population . and 51 % have money set aside for emergencies . but if there 's one area where millennials are falling short , it 's life insurance . a frightening 75 % of millennial parents are currently without life insurance , according to a study conducted by online platform bestow . ",
        "and a big reason boils down to not wanting to research it . in fact , 67 % of young parents claim they do n't have time to sift through their options , and millennials on a whole are n't willing to spend more than two hours on the process . clearly , this data is problematic for a couple of reasons . first , regardless of age , it 's a dangerous idea for parents to go without life insurance . but secondly , because life insurance can be a sizable expense , to expect to sink two hours or less into researching it is just plain unrealistic . ",
        "and the sooner more young parents realize all of this , the better . you need life insurance . let 's be clear about one thing : if you have children , then you absolutely need life insurance . there 's no question about it . what you will need to determine , however , is how much coverage to purchase , and that 's not something that 's automatically clear cut . you might think a $ 500,000 death benefit will suffice in protecting your family , but that may not cut it if your goal is to leave behind enough money to pay for your kids ' college education . ",
        "of course , the more coverage you purchase , the higher your premium costs will be , so that 's something you 'll need to weigh as well . furthermore , do n't make the mistake of assuming that if one parent is a full-time caregiver , he or she does n't need insurance . if something happens to that parent , the surviving one will need to pay for child care to work -- and that 's a cost life insurance can help absorb . now the good news is that if you 're younger , you have a pretty good shot at scoring a decent premium rate -- assuming you do n't have any major health issues . ",
        "that 's just another reason why it pays to get moving on insurance -- that , and you never know when the unexpected might occur . it 's a hard thing to think about , but nobody is immune to tragedy . which type of life insurance is right for you ? hopefully , by now you 're convinced that you need a life insurance policy . the question is : should you buy term life insurance , or whole life insurance ? term life insurance provides coverage for a specified period of time , and as such , it 's generally much less expensive than whole life insurance . ",
        "on the other hand , term life policies do n't accumulate any cash value over time , whereas whole policies do . this means that if you do n't end up passing away before the end of your policy 's term , your family does n't get any financial benefit from that policy . whole life insurance , on the other hand , provides coverage for your entire life . furthermore , whole life insurance policies accumulate cash value , which means you can cash one out at any time and collect a lump sum instead of a death benefit . ",
        "why might you do that ? say you 're 65 , retired , and your kids are grown adults in good financial shape . you might choose to utilize that cash rather than wait for your family to get it after you die . the downside of whole life policies , of course , is that they 're more expensive than term policies . on the other hand , some people use them as investments , or as a means of forced savings , so if you can swing the higher premiums , you 'll have more flexibility down the line . ",
        "no matter what type of life insurance you choose to get , the key is to secure coverage sooner rather than later . being young does n't make you invincible , and there 's no reason your children should have to suffer financially if the unspeakable does indeed come to be .   "
