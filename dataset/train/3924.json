        "the new york islanders travelled to the worst team in the nhl and lost . the mission was n't difficult , play a full 60 minutes and they should come out on top . and that 's exactly what they did n't do . we identified two keys to a win for the new york islanders , give the arizona coyotes some respect and play a full game . and the last one was limit their chances . under 34 shots a game would be great . the islanders did the latter , but not the former . in the first period , the new york islanders had three shots on goal to arizona 's 14 . ",
        "naturally , that meant they went down early as arizona took a 1-0 through the first period . thankfully the islanders woke up in the second and third period , registering 28 shots combined and forcing over time . but things could have been much worse against a better team than a 1-0 deficit after one with the type of effort they showed . anthony beauvillier : man on firewe also indicated that players like ross johnston , tanner fritz and anthony beauvillier had to have big games to prove to the coaching and management staff that they belonged . ",
        "and boy did the latter have one against the coyotes . with two goals on the game , beauvillier put his tally to seven points in six games since being called from bridgeport . he 's absolutely on fire . his first was a great solo effort as he comes off the bench . racing up the wing beau gets a shot on net but has the mindset to find his rebound and tuck it into the net . all while being backchecked by coyotes defender jason demers . that first was within seconds of the second period starting up . ",
        "his second of the night would come within the first three minutes of the third as the islanders hounded the coyotes in their own end . after being knocked to the ice by demers , the defender left beauvillier on his own . bad idea to let a kid high on confidence alone in a high danger area . beau would make him pay for that seconds later as a buried an antti raanta rebound into the open net . this is new territory for beauvillier . with these two last goals , he now has 12 on the season . ",
        "that 's three more goals then he had in his entire rookie season . it sounds surprising , but it should n't be . this is a kid who had 42 goals in his draft year for the shawinigan cataractes , and another 40 the year after . next : new york islanders nhl trade deadline preview 2.0 it 's safe to say that beauvillier has found his identity . or the one he had all along . unfortunately , the new york islanders as a team have yet to find theirs as they drop a point to the coyotes thanks to a flat first period .
