        "i have met this girl accidentally in web today . she installed an app where the age limit is 18 + , so i did not know that she is 14 years old . but later she told me that and she also told me that she is thinking about committing suicide . there is a one well-known suicide game in my country called `` blue whale '' . teens follow the instructions from curators and the last instruction is to commit suicide . more than 200 teens committed suicide playing this game but we will never know the actual number . ",
        "this girl told me that she does n't want to live because everyone treats her bad including her parents and she actually wants to play this game . she lives in my city and i 'm thinking about meeting her in neutral place in order to talk to her about her problems . the only problem is that i am a 25 years old guy and i am not sure that i completely understand the mind state of 14 years old girls . though i know that there is a free psychological help points , so after becoming friends with her i will try to persuade her to go there . ",
        "do you think it 's a good idea ? or i should not interfere at whole because the communication between 14 years old girl and 25 years old guy seems to be creepy ? what do you think ?   "
