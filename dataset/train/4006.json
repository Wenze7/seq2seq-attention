        "new york -- one of wall street 's traditional warning signs for a recession is flashing yellow , and nobody seems to care . the signal lies within the bond market , where treasurys maturing in a couple years have been paying nearly as much in interest as bonds that take a decade to mature . the gap between the two is usually much wider . market watchers call this phenomenon a `` flattening yield curve , '' and it 's often been a harbinger of slowing economic growth , if not a recession . earlier this month , a 10-year treasury was offering just 0.53 percentage points more in yield than a two-year treasury . ",
        "the last time the spread was so thin was in october 2007 . two months later , the great recession began . `` the curve normally is the ultimate crystal ball portending recession , '' said rich taylor , client portfolio manager at american century investments . `` it tells us what the economy will do . and a curve this flat would suggest we have an impending recession . `` yet taylor and most of wall street say that technical factors are making the yield curve a less reliable indicator this time around , and they do n't see a recession looming on the horizon , at least not in 2018 . ",
        "even federal reserve chair janet yellen echoed the sentiment last week . how can so many along wall street feel so confident saying what have been famous last words for so many market trends : this time is different ? taylor said the curve is `` flattening for different reasons . `` when an economic expansion is several years old and the unemployment rate is low , as it is now , short-term rates are usually moving higher as a result of the federal reserve hiking its overnight interest rate . this year , the fed has raised short-term rates three times , after doing so just twice in the prior 10 years combined . ",
        "in response , the yield on the two-year treasury has climbed to nearly 1.85 percent , up from from 1.25 percent at the end of 2016 . but longer-term interest rates have not followed suit . the fed has less control over longer-term rates , such as the 10-year treasury yield , which are affected not only by forecasts for the fed 's rate decisions but also by expectations for inflation , economic growth and other things . the 10-year treasury yield is close to where it ended last year , at 2.50 percent compared with 2.47 percent . if the trend continues and short-term rates go higher than long-term rates , it would create what market watchers call an `` inverted yield curve . '' ",
        "that would be a flashing red light on the warning system because it can indicate the bond market is expecting weak economic growth . a rule of thumb says a recession would follow in about a year , and an inverted yield curve preceded each of the last seven recessions , according to the cleveland fed . one big reason for longer-term rates being stuck in place is stubbornly low inflation . raises for workers are a bit healthier than in prior years , and wage growth has historically fed through to higher inflation . but the wage gains are still only modest : about 3.4 percent , according to the federal reserve bank of atlanta . ",
        "it was closer to 4 percent before the great recession and 5 percent at the turn of the millennium . another factor keeping 10-year treasurys low is all the buying coming from overseas , said erin browne , head of asset allocation at ubs asset management . bonds overseas are paying nearly nothing in interest , and in many cases actually have negative yields . that is pushing buyers from europe and asia into 10-year treasurys , which keeps a lid on rates . that in turn has made the u. s. treasury yield curve flatter than it would otherwise be . ",
        "with central banks in europe and japan continuing to buy bonds to help their economies , analysts do n't expect their rates to climb much higher , which would keep foreign appetite high for 10-year treasurys . `` the flattening of the yield curve today is going to have a different impact on growth and corporate health than it has in the past , '' browne said . `` we do n't think that even an inversion of the yield curve , while it certainly would make headlines and people would raise eyebrows , would have the same impact in this cycle as it would historically . ",
        "`` of course , if wall street is underestimating the predictive power of the yield curve this time around , it may be a while before investors are able to tell . economists do n't even say a recession has begun until months after its start . in the meantime , the yield curve 's movements have meant more income for investors whose mutual funds have been buying shorter-term bonds . a two-year treasury is paying more than triple the interest that it was in the summer of 2016 . `` we 're more excited than we were a year ago , because we actually have things to look at and there are more opportunities , '' said thomas atteberrry , portfolio manager at the fpa new income fund , which has been buying two - to five-year bonds due to the rise in yields . ",
        "file - in this tuesday , dec. . 19 , 2017 , file photo , a trader works at his post at the new york stock exchange . a signal that economists and investors have long used to warn of a coming recession is flashing again , as bonds that mature decades from now are paying only a sliver more than bonds maturing in a couple dozen months . but this time seems to be different , fund managers say , and they see a recession as at least a year away , if not more . even the federal reserve seems to agree .
