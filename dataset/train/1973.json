        "the new york mets reached one-year deals with right-handers jacob degrom , matt harvey and noah syndergaard on friday to avoid salary arbitration cases . new york and degrom agreed on a $ 7.4 million pact , a sharp raise from the $ 4.05 million he made in 2017 when he went 15-10 with a 3.53 era and a career-best 239 strikeouts . harvey 's deal is worth $ 5.625 million and syndergaard 's agreement is for $ 2.975 million , nearly five times more than the $ 605,500 he made in 2017 . harvey , who was reportedly on the trade block in december , posted a 5-7 record and career-worst 6.70 era last season in 19 starts . ",
        "he averaged a career-low 6.5 strikeouts per nine innings in 2017 . injuries have been a bugaboo for harvey since missing the entire 2014 season for tommy john surgery , replacing the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow . he required thoracic surgery on his right shoulder in 2016 and shoulder and hamstring injuries sent him to the disabled list in 2017 . harvey , 28 , has a career record of 34-35 with a 3.51 era . degrom , 29 , is 45-32 with a 2.98 era in four big-league seasons and syndergaard is 24-18 with a 2.89 era in parts of three seasons . ",
        "the 25-year-old syndergaard was just 1-2 with a 2.97 era in seven starts last season . he missed most of the season due to a partially torn right lat muscle . the mets also reportedly agreed to terms with right-handed reliever jeurys familia , catcher travis d'arnaud and shortstop wilmer flores . -- field level media .
