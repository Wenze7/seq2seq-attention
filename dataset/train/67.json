        "after displaying three models at the 2017 detroit auto show , china 's gac motor will return to the heart of america 's car industry for the second year in a row . gac , which sells cars in china under the trumpchi and gonow brands , will bring a new electric car concept as well as two of its existing models as the company prepares to enter the u. s. market in 2019 . one of the cars gac is expected to bring to the 2018 detroit auto show is its ga8 luxury sedan . it 's about as long as a genesis g80 or volvo s90 , but the only available engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder unit that produces just 198 horsepower . ",
        "gac will likely need a more powerful option to compete in the u. s. on the other hand , the ga8 sports an in-car refrigerator , something you 'd normally expect to find on a rolls-royce or bentley . gac is also expected to bring its gm8 minivan to detroit . with just four real minivans -- the chrysler pacifica , honda odyssey , kia sedona , and toyota sienna -- currently sold in the u. s. , this segment could use a new competitor . but a chinese firm most americans have never heard of probably is n't the brand to make minivans popular again . ",
        "the third vehicle appearing in detroit is an electric car concept , which gac has n't released any details on . gac announced in november that it would begin exporting cars from its trumpchi brand to the u. s. in 2019 , although it may change the brand name because of its similarity with president donald trump 's surname , according to the new york times . the first gac vehicle sold in the u. s. will be the gs8 , a big suv the automaker brought to the 2017 detroit auto show . if gac follows through with its plans , it will be the first chinese automotive brand to sell cars here . ",
        "cars that are made in china , including the buick envision and cadillac ct6 plug-in hybrid , are currently sold in the u. s. , but they 're all the products of non-chinese automakers . gac and other chinese firms have been trying to crack the u. s. market for years , but skepticism about the quality of their cars and other factors have prevented that from happening .
