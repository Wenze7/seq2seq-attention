        "joseph percoco , a former aide and close ally of gov. andrew cuomo , goes on trial monday for alleged accepting brides from developers , the first of two corruption trials that is expect to point the spotlight on how the state handles economic development . cuomo is accused of no crimes but the trial with its potential for embarrassing testimony about the inner workings of state government is beginning at the start of an election year for the two-term democrat . it is the first of two bribery trials this year involving former cuomo aides and high-profile developers is set to begin monday in new york city . ",
        "joseph percoco , a former executive deputy secretary and political enforcer for the governor , is charged with using connections to secure over $ 300,000 in bribes . three people are accused of providing payoffs in connection with two companies that sought lucrative state contracts are set to stand trial with him in new york . percoco 's trial will be followed later this year by the trial for alain e. kaloyeros , the former president of the state university of new york polytechnic institute . the eight defendants in both trials have pleaded not guilty . the governor has not been implicated in the alleged corruption and cuomo has previously said that if the allegations are true , `` i am saddened and profoundly disappointed '' . ",
        "the trials could provide plenty of distractions as cuomo and the state legislature tackle a multi-billion budget deficit and cuomo goes for election to a third term in november . the trials are likely to renew calls for ethics reforms in albany . observers say revelations from the trials could have an impact on cuomo 's national ambitions if he eventually decides to seek the democratic nomination for president in 2020 . the evidence at percoco 's trial will lay bare the murky way in which the state goes about making economic development decisions , said susan lerner , executive director of common cause . ",
        "`` i think it will be eye-opening for the public , '' she said . `` there 's all sorts of pay-to-play aspects to it . '' the complaint alleges percoco , from january 2012 until 2014 and again in 2015 , used his official position as executive deputy secretary to the governor to seek bribes from executives at companies with business before the state . the bribes at times came through an intermediary , bank accounts and a shell company set up by todd howe , a lawyer and lobbyist who first met percoco and cuomo while working for the future governor 's father , gov. mario cuomo . ",
        "howe later pleaded guilty . the complaint says that in one case , competitive power ventures , which was building a downstate power plant , paid more than $ 287,000 to percoco by providing his wife , lisa toscano-percoco , with a `` low-show '' job . former company executive peter galbraith kelly jr. . was charged with arranging the payments . toscano-percoco does not face charges . in the other case , syracuse-based cor development executives steven aiello and joseph geradi were charged with arranging for about $ 35,000 in payments for help with economic development matters . howe began cooperating with prosecutors in june , according to the complaint , and pleaded guilty to several federal crimes . ",
        "he is expected to be the prosecution 's star witness . the information provided by howe has been corroborated by emails , documents and other witness statements , the complaint says . the syracuse developers , aiello and gerardi , are facing charges in both the percoco trial and the trial involving kaloyeros . the percoco trial is expected to last between four and six weeks .
