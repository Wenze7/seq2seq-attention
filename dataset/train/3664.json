        "cartoon depicting an imaginary attack of the nanoparticles to a virus leading to its loss of integrity . credit : Â© sunmil/epflepfl researchers have created nanoparticles that attract viruses and , using the pressure resulting from the binding process , destroy them . this revolutionary approach could lead to the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs . hiv , dengue , papillomavirus , herpes and ebola - these are just some of the many viruses that kill millions of people every year , mostly children in developing countries . while drugs can be used against some viruses , there is currently no broad-spectrum treatment that is effective against several at the same time , in the same way that broad-spectrum antibiotics fight a range of bacteria . ",
        "but researchers at epfl 's supramolecular nano-materials and interfaces laboratory - constellium chair have created gold nanoparticles for just this purpose , and their findings could lead to a broad-spectrum treatment . once injected in the body , these nanoparticles imitate human cells and `` trick '' the viruses . when the viruses bind to them - in order to infect them - the nanoparticles use pressure produced locally by this link-up to `` break '' the viruses , rendering them innocuous . the results of this research have just been published in nature materials . pressing need for a broad-spectrum treatment `` fortunately , we have drugs that are effective against some viruses , like hiv and hepatitis c , '' says francesco stellacci , who runs sunmil from the school of engineering . ",
        "`` but these drugs work only on a specific virus . '' hence the need for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs . this would enable doctors to use a single drug to combat all viruses that are still deadly because no treatment currently exists . such non-specific therapies are especially needed in countries - particularly in developing regions - where doctors do not have the tools they need to make accurate diagnoses . and broad-spectrum antiviral drugs would help curb the antimicrobial resistance resulting from the over-prescription of antibiotics . `` doctors often prescribe antibiotics in response to viral infections , since there is no other drug available . ",
        "but antibiotics are only effective against bacteria , and this blanket use fosters the development of virus mutations and a build-up of resistance in humans , '' says stellacci . tricky nanoparticlesuntil now , research into broad-spectrum virus treatments has only produced approaches that are toxic to humans or that work effectively in vitro - i. e. , in the lab - but not in vivo . the epfl researchers found a way around these problems by creating gold nanoparticles . they are harmless to humans , and they imitate human cell receptors - specifically the ones viruses seek for their own attachment to cells . ",
        "viruses infect human bodies by binding to replicating into cells . it is as if the nanoparticles work by tricking the viruses into thinking that they are invading a human cell . when they bind to the nanoparticles , the resulting pressure deforms the virus and opens it , rendering it harmless . unlike other treatments , the use of pressure is non-toxic . `` viruses replicate within cells , and it is very difficult to find a chemical substance that attacks viruses without harming the host cells , '' says stellacci . `` but until now , that 's been the only known approach attempted permanently damage viruses . '' ",
        "the method developed at sunmil is unique in that it achieves permanent damage to the viral integrity without damaging living cells . encouraging results on several virusessuccessful in vitro experiments have been conducted on cell cultures infected by herpes simplex virus , papillomavirus , respiratory syncytial virus , dengue virus and hiv . in other tests , mice infected by rsv were cured . for this project , the sunmil researchers teamed up with several other universities that contributed their expertise in nanomaterials and virology . more information : broad-spectrum non-toxic antiviral nanoparticles with a virucidal inhibition mechanism , nature materials .
