        "from the metal roof and a/c system to the backyard 's artificial turf and the zoysia sod out front , this 1930s midtown bungalow brings a lot of `` new '' to the table -- without wrecking its timeless charm . freshly renovated and very blue , the penn avenue three-bedroom stands two blocks south of piedmont park , on what the listing enthusiastically declares is the `` best street in midtown ! !! '' that 's debatable , but the prettiness of the facade probably is n't . the front porch , with views to similarly well-kept old homes , is an atlanta classic . ",
        "inside , find a highly functional but not-sprawling 2,219 square feet . the straight-shot open floorplan leads back to a renovated kitchen that some might declare dated already . another sticking point could be the driveway parking at a price point like this , though the location certainly lends itself to non-vehicle transport . in the positive category are the upstairs guest suite , the sweet screened-in back porch , and a new brick patio . the backyard 's small size , like its zero-maintenance turf , would surely be a perk for many intowners . it 's an admirable package overall , and proof that even this price does n't snag an estate in atlanta 's more desirable pockets anymore .
