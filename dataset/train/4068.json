        "a recent discovery by scientists at rutger university has revealed a massive amount of magma underneath the geographic area of new england . image source : youtube video screenshotmagma in new englandit 's important to preface these findings by stating that new england residents have no reason to panic or evacuate , because the potential volcanic eruptions are not expected to be anywhere near severe . a team led by geophysicist vadim levin from rutgers university elaborated on the discovery in a recent statement . `` the upwelling we detected is like a hot air balloon , and we infer that something is rising up through the deeper part of our planet under new england . '' ",
        "the information that led to this discovery was collected using the earthscope program from the national science foundation . earthscope is responsible for placing a huge amount of seismic measurement devices all across the united states , in hopes that we can better track the activities that lead up to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions . `` we 're interested in what happens at the interface between tectonic plates -- thick , solid parts that cover our planet -- and material in the upper mantle beneath the plates ... we want to see how north america is gliding over the deeper parts of our planet . ",
        "it is a very large and relatively stable region , but we found an irregular pattern with rather abrupt changes in it . '' this new information has reaffirmed the fact that there 's much we have yet to learn about the world around us . `` our study challenges the established notion of how the continents on which we live behave , '' levin said . `` it challenges the textbook concepts taught in introductory geology classes . '' research implicationsas mentioned above , there 's very little reason for new england residents to worry . the magma located in massachusetts , vermont , and new hampshire will not result in volcanoes for millions of years . ",
        "with the entirety of human existence thought to only have been around for a few million years , this information has few practical applications for the average joe . levin mentioned in his statement that even if volcanoes were to erupt , the damage would pale in comparison to the damage from an expected explosion from the yellowstone supervolcano . that eruption is also a long way off , so it 's not something worth worrying about either . still , the discoveries of the magma have definitely changed how we view the world underneath the surface . the fact that new findings indicate that magma is floating underneath our feet shows just how little we actually know as we move deeper towards the earth 's core . ",
        "while we definitely wo n't see any negative effects from this magma during our lifetime , the discovery raises new questions about why this hotbed of volcanic activity actually exists . this new finding is only the start of years of continued research as we challenge our preconceived notions of how geology works . `` it will likely take millions of years for the upwelling to get where it 's going , '' said levin , `` the next step is to try to understand how exactly it 's happening .
