        "each chapter will be written by improvisation and inspired by a random inspirobot poster until we reach a natural end . i hope you enjoy it ! read chapter 1 here . perspectiveno one could see the world quite the same way as austin fairmont , though he wished more did . it was n't that they could n't , because as long as monetary power had existed , there had been those who 'd fallen into it by luck and circumstance . they could 've seen the error of the system as well , the cracks in the wall of society 's illusion . ",
        "but they did n't , and so he remained in a class of his own . that class certain had its perks , however . he sat quietly in the corner of the college cafeteria , his three closest friends beside him , all silently observing the other students , wondering at the inner workings of their minds . were they all here to pursue degrees they thought would make them financially successful ? or did some of them think like him , that knowledge sated far more worldly desires than money every could ? `` oh , my god . ",
        ". . '' a soft , female voice said from behind him . he turned lazily toward the sound and regarded the speaker curiously . she had the plastic attraction , store-bought and cast from a mold like all the other boys and girls who desired society 's perfection instead of their own . `` you 're austin fairmont ! i had no idea you went to this school ! '' as expected , another fangirl of the rich fairmont name , a family legacy spanning six decades in real esate and country clubs -- both places austin despised . ",
        "`` i am , what of it ? '' he asked rudely . the woman gave a huff and stared at him . she opened her mouth to speak but before she could , shannon spoke from austin 's right . `` you 're about to accuse austin of being rude . you better leave before you cause a scene . '' with an uncommon wisdom , the woman left without another word , dumbstruck by shannon 's ability to read her mind . most people were . few had an appreciation or even knowledge of telepathy . `` speaking of scenes , '' lucas said from across the table . ",
        "`` i think we may have found another . i 'm hearing some whispers , and if you look over there . . . '' all four of the table 's occupants looked behind austin to where a bespectacled student glanced around frantically . only lucas could hear the whispers , but it was tara who sat on austin 's left who would make the confirmation . `` yes , two sprites dancing around her . '' `` keep me informed , '' austin said . `` austin , they 're about to attack her ! '' tara whispered harshly , and austin wasted no time in springing to action . ",
        "he held his hand out , open-palmed toward the woman to increase his focus , then pushed her over with telekinetic force . she fell forward with little dignity , and austin used the rest of his focus to keep her against the ground . they 'd learned long ago that sprites only attacked moving targets . the longer she remained still , the better chance she had to be left alone . `` they 're moving off , '' tara confirmed after a moment . austin relaxed his grip and watched as the girl accepted her glasses from a tall stranger beside her . ",
        "she ran from the cafeteria as soon as she made it to her feet , and austin felt guilty about adding to her embarrassment . but embarrassment was always better than being tormented by sprites . the little bastards from the nether realm were becoming more frequent of late , and once they found a receptive target they rarely let it go . austin looked back at the others nodding appreciatively to them all for a job well done . shannon , lucas , and tara had all come into his life at different times , times when he 'd realized the haze of reality had cracked even further than before . ",
        "he 'd given up wealth and financial opportunity time and time again for these people , against his proud father 's wishes and rejecting his family 's money in order to pursue the life he wanted . the life he wanted lay before him , now . he had to find that girl and make sure she knew the truth before it was too late . ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ thank you for reading ! i write fiction for a living , and i 'm currently trying make ends meet . if you like this short story and would like to read my other work , find out more at patreon or email me at samuel .
