        "washington -- the trump administration has approved a plan to provide lethal weapons to ukraine , u. s. officials said friday , aiming to fortify the former soviet republic military as it fights separatists backed by russia . the new arms include american-made javelin anti-tank missiles that ukraine has long sought to boost its defenses against tanks that have rolled through eastern ukraine during violence that has killed more than 10,000 since 2014 . previously , the u. s. has provided ukraine with support equipment and training , and has let private companies sell some small arms like rifles . ",
        "the officials describing the plan were n't authorized to discuss it publicly and demanded anonymity . the move is likely to escalate tensions between the united states and russia , as president donald trump contends with ongoing questions about whether he 's too hesitant to confront the kremlin . ukraine accuses russia of sending the tanks , and the u. s. says moscow is arming , training and fighting alongside the separatists . trump had been considering the plan for some time after the state department and the pentagon signed off earlier this year . president barack obama also considered sending lethal weapons to ukraine . ",
        "the state department , responsible for overseeing foreign military sales , would not confirm that anti-tank missiles or other lethal weapons would be sent . but in a statement late friday , state department spokeswoman heather nauert said the u. s. had decided to provide `` enhanced defensive capabilities '' to help ukraine build its military long-term , defend its sovereignty and `` deter further aggression . '' `` u. s. assistance is entirely defensive in nature , and as we have always said , ukraine is a sovereign country and has a right to defend itself , '' nauert said . ",
        "the white house 's national security council declined to comment . although the portable javelin anti-tank missiles can kill , proponents for granting them to ukraine have long argued they are considered `` defensive '' because the ukrainians would use them to defend their territory and deter the russians , not to attack a foreign country or seize new territory . under law , the state department must tell congress of planned foreign military sales , triggering a review period in which lawmakers can act to stop the sale . it was unclear whether the administration had formally notified congress , but lawmakers are unlikely to try to block it given that democrats and republicans alike have long called on the government to take the step .
