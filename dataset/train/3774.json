        "five people were killed when a city bus ploughed into a pedestrian underpass in western moscow on monday , traffic police said . it was not immediately clear what caused the accident as authorities said they were looking into several possibilities , including a technical malfunction . `` a bus drove into a pedestrian underpass , '' a traffic police spokesman , artyom kolesnikov , told afp . `` according to preliminary information , five people died . `` footage broadcast on national television showed a bus driving onto the pavement and then down the stairs of the underpass , running over several pedestrians before coming to a stop . ",
        "moscow police said in a statement they were looking into two possible causes of the accident - the driver losing control of the vehicle and a technical problem with the bus . `` the driver of the bus began movement and then changed his trajectory , which resulted in the bus going down into the pedestrian underpass , '' the statement said . `` the driver has been detained . police employees are working with him , '' the statement said . three people have been hospitalised , the statement added . the accident happened around 3 pm near moscow 's slavyansky boulevard metro station , a prestigious residential area near one of the capital 's main avenues .

        "sirens were blaring around the metro station , with authorities preparing to pull the bus out of the underpass with a cable , an afp correspondent at the scene said . the underpass and surrounding area were cordoned off by police , and several black body bags could be seen on the pavement , partially covered with falling snow . the emergencies ministry said two helicopters had been dispatched to the scene to help evacuate the victims . `` there are dead and wounded , '' tweeted moscow mayor sergei sobyanin . `` we are providing emergency aid , '' he said , offering condolences to families of the victims .
