        "jason day has been backed to put a disappointing 2017 behind him and become world number one again in the new year . day had a year to forget when failing to pick up a single win , which resulted in him dropping to 12th in the world ranking . injuries did not help his cause , while his mother suffering a serious illness also distracted the australian and forced him to focus on family matters rather than golf . however aussie golf icon jack newton is backing day to put all his problems behind him and return to the top of his game in 2018 . ",
        "`` he has n't played enough golf . he 's had all kinds of things going on with his body , '' he told aap at the jack newton celebrity classic . newton said day at his best was superior to world no. 2 jordan spieth but acknowledged american johnson deservingly held the top spot . `` i think he can get back to no. 1 . i think he 's got spieth covered , '' he said . `` in the pga that he won , he was hitting it 30 yards past spieth . `` day 's a good putter , he 's a long hitter . ",
        "he can hit a lot of really good shots . he 's quite capable of getting back to no. 1 , although i think dustin johnson 's going to be a hard man to roll . `` dustin johnson , when he wants to let one go , he hits it 370 . when he wants to just get in one the fairway , it goes 340 . he never had a good short game , but he 's got a good short game now .
