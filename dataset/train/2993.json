        "my ex and i broke up 2 months ago because he was n't ready for a relationship because he wanted to get himself together financially and mentally and said he was not able to give me what i deserve because he is not mentally prepared and wanted us to still be close friends and i understood even though i did n't want us to break up . after that he would flirt with me here and there , weeks go by and i realised he messaged 2 girls saying how he is trying to shoot his shot and did it by promoting his business to them first . ",
        "i was upset by that since he was ` not ready for a relationship ' . when i would message him , he would reply but then after a while he would stop replying . today he even liked a tweet which said ` single life is getting boring but i 'm not going to settle for just anyone ' . that honestly got to me because i did all i could for him and was always there for him not just in the relationship but our friendship too . those girls he messaged ended up not replying to him and they talking . ",
        "why would he do this ? am i overreacting ?   "
