        "with all of the rotations terry stotts has experimented with this year , pat connaughton consistently gets minutes off the bench each night . until recently , terry stotts seemed to choose his reserves by pulling random names out of a hat . each game , a new batch of guys hit the floor alongside either damian lillard or cj mccollum . but through all the madness , one always played at least ten minutes -- pat connaughton . why is pat connaughton the single bench constant ? answer : his three-point shooting . after allen crabbe was salary-dumped this offseason , the blazers became delinquent in the category . ",
        "21st in threes made and 26th in threes attempted is a far cry from previous campaigns . three players contribute 7.5 of the 9.4 three-pointers made per contest -- dame , cj and al-farouq aminu , all in the starting lineup . off the bench , only pat connaughton averages over one three-pointer . he makes 1.1 of 2.9 perimeter shots each game , with a season-high of four on opening night . reserve counterpart shabazz napier nearly hits one triple per night , but also attempts just two nightly . recently , his midrange game has been most effective . ",
        "other bench players , like zach collins and ed davis , rarely find themselves shooting from outside . plays are designed to get these big men rolling to the basket after setting a pick . only with meyers leonard , who is out of the current rotation , does the screen-setter roll beyond the arc . while connaughton does n't hit his threes at a blistering rate , he spreads the floor . having pat , and to a lesser extent napier , on the wings keeping their defender honest , allows lillard and mccollum to run pick-and-rolls . the starting lineup has two outside threats alongside the ball handler , as does the bench . ",
        "maintaining the same offensive flow between units promotes consistent scoring for the blazers . pat connaughton sees floor time every game for this reason , and hopefully the experience will only increase his three-point efficiency . more from rip city project blazers end winning streak , fall in 4th quarter to timberwolves14h ago the portland trail blazers ' unique winning environment22h ago blazers can crack top-four in west with win over timberwolves1 d ago two-way player wade baldwin iv debuts with texas legends2d ago trail blazers win third in a row , beat the hornets 93-912d ago with all of the rotations terry stotts has experimented with this year , pat connaughton consistently gets minutes off the bench each night .
