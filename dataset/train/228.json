        "hanoi - the corruption trial of a vietnamese former oil executive who was allegedly kidnapped from germany opened on monday , a high-profile case that can carry the death sentence . vietnam 's communist government has embarked on a snowballing anti-corruption campaign , which observers say is politically driven and mirrors a graft crackdown in neighbouring china . scores of former officials , bankers and state executives have been arrested or jailed , including a senior banker who has been sentenced to death . on monday a court in hanoi said it had started proceedings against trinh xuan thanh , the former head of state-run petrovietnam construction , for alleged mismanagement and embezzlement . ",
        "thanh appeared before the court together with ex-politburo member dinh la thang and 20 other senior officials . they are accused of causing $ 5.2 million of losses for the state during an investment by petrovietnam in the construction of a thermal power plant . german authorities say thanh was kidnapped from a berlin park in july and have decried the brazen cold war-style seizure as a `` scandalous violation '' of its sovereignty . vietnam denies the kidnap and insists the fugitive thanh had returned home voluntarily to face the charges . `` this is a very serious case , drawing wide public attention , '' said an online announcement by hanoi 's people 's court , adding the accused all held key positions at major state-owned institutions . ",
        "after a two-week trial , thang and thanh could face 20 years in jail for mismanagement . in addition thanh faces an embezzlement charge , which can carry the death penalty . the downfall of thanh and the other men on trial has stunned a public unaccustomed to questioning the role of officialdom in an authoritarian country which routinely quashes dissent . but the leadership is at pains to parade its anti-graft credentials , experts say , as well as remove political enemies . in a linked case , last week singapore deported fugitive vietnamese intelligence officer phan van anh vu , who held a senior rank in the secret police . ",
        "vu was trying to seek asylum in germany , his lawyers said , arguing he may have information about thanh 's kidnapping on german soil . in ho chi minh city the trial of 46 people -- including former banking tycoons pham cong danh and tram be -- also began on monday . they are accused of violating lending regulations that caused losses of around $ 270 million to the vietnam construction bank . transparency international has ranked vietnam 113 out of 176 on its corruption index , worse than its southeast asian neighbours thailand , the philippines and myanmar .
