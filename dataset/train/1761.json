        "a roar pierced the air at cape canaveral in florida for a few seconds on wednesday . the sound was the cry of the engines on the falcon heavy , a massive launch vehicle developed by elon musk 's spacex . the heavy had been hauled to the launchpad at kennedy space center for a brief but crucial test that will determine whether the rocket is ready for its maiden flight , which musk has said will take place later this month . the milestone , known as a static-fire test , involved securely anchoring the falcon heavy to the launchpad , loading it with propellant , and then igniting its 27 engines at full thrust . ",
        "for several seconds , plumes of thick smoke billowed out from the base of the launchpad and created a big white cloud . musk tweeted shortly after the static-fire that the test was `` good . `` falcon heavy hold-down firing this morning was good . generated quite a thunderhead of steam . launching in a week or so . pic . twitter . com/npaqatbnir -- elon musk january 24 , 2018spacex did not broadcast the test online , but the action was live-streamed on social media by journalists staked out on a beach nearby . the action starts at about the 16:22 mark : #falconheavy static fire -- chris g - nsf january 24 , 2018a static-fire test , designed to check the engines and various systems of a rocket , is the final step in preparations before a launch . ",
        "the engines fired at full power on wednesday . the heavy was pulled upright on launchpad 39a , the site of launches during the apollo and space shuttle programs , the second week of january . reporters and other observers clung to computer screens and waited . a six-hour window for the static-fire test that opened that week afternoon came and went , and the test was rescheduled again and again , until this wednesday . for a few stressful days , it looked like the federal government threatened to delay the test for days or even weeks . the process resembled a precarious game of jenga . ",
        "`` we 're stepping through this carefully , it 's a beast of a vehicle , '' explained gwynne shotwell , spacex 's president and chief operating officer , during an appearance january 11 at an aerospace conference in texas . and what a beast it is . the 230-foot-tall falcon heavy is essentially a monster mashup of three falcon 9 cores -- two of which have already flown solo . it can produce a maximum thrust at liftoff of more than 5 million pounds , which would make the rocket , if it flies , the most powerful rocket in operation , ahead of the delta iv heavy , manufactured by the united launch alliance , a joint venture of boeing and lockheed martin . ",
        "while the heavy will carry only a tesla car on its maiden launch , spacex says it will be able to lift 119,000 pounds of cargo into orbit . musk hopes the heavy will someday transport astronauts and hefty payloads to the moon and mars . for impatient watchers , eric berger at ars technica pointed out that false starts and days of delays are par for the course for high-stakes launches . `` what 's up with these falcon heavy delays ? well , for perspective , the first saturn v rocket launch required a 17-day countdown demonstration test to fuel and power up the rocket , '' berger tweeted . ",
        "`` these things take time if you want them not to go boom at the wrong time . `` like the falcon heavy , the saturn v rocket was a heavy-lift launch vehicle used by the u. s. government to boost astronauts to the moon and launch skylab , the first american space station , in the 1960s and 1970s . engine tests in the rocket industry are routine and fairly quick affairs , and spacex 's tests of the falcon 9 rarely make news . but there are no guarantees in rocketry . in september 2016 , a falcon 9 exploded on the launchpad while being fueled for the engine test . ",
        "the incident destroyed the rocket and its $ 200 million payload , an israeli communications satellite . the falcon heavy went up on the launchpad just days after spacex launched a top-secret u. s. government payload that sparked rumors about whether it had failed . news reports citing anonymous sources suggest the payload , a satellite , failed or was lost . northrop grumman , the company hired to manufacture the satellite , said it could not comment on a classified mission . spacex said the falcon 9 in the launch worked exactly as it should , and not much else . ",
        "spaceflight observers say the fault likely lies with northrop grumman , but the mystery briefly cast a pall over the highly anticipated falcon heavy preparations . the roar of the falcon heavy 's engines on wednesday will likely drown out speculation about the zuma mishap , as space-watchers anticipate the announcement of a launch date for the new rocket . spacex will , once more , fuel up the rocket , fire the engines , and hope the whole thing does n't blow up .
