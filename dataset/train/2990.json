        "travel is the `` latest thing '' with all kinds of benefits touted in a gazillion online articles . i 'm going to jump on the bandwagon because recently i have realised one of the most valuable skills i learned as a child who grew up travelling , is adaption . having said that we tend to dislike the ultimate adaptors . perhaps this article is really an advocate of staying at home ! before i begin it would be worthwhile to explain some details about my family . i am english , of which , throughout my life , i have felt mostly shame about rather than pride . ",
        "i feel shame because of all the injustice we have reaped across the earth as imperialists . i 'll save that for another day though . i am most proud of the diversity in britain over anything else . i am also proud of kendal mint cake . kendal mint cake rocks . my mother is also english , but she grew up abroad . firstly , as a child , she lived in the falkland islands and then as a child and teenager in swaziland . my mother has never felt at home in the uk and perhaps that is another reason , through some kind of osmosis , i never cared for the place very much . ",
        "my father is also english . he is a bit of a hippie and i probably got a lot of my liberal anti-establishment views through osmosis from him . as a child , we travelled a lot . mostly , we would go on low-cost camping trips or road trips or camping road trips . one of my most keen memories of a family holiday was when we went to spain . we stayed in a crumbling windmill with no running water . i remember lying on my back , falling asleep , in this little metal frame bed , surrounded by the wooden panels of the windmill sides . ",
        "i remember a rickety looking mirror on the wall and a gecko that lived behind the mirror . i really loved that gecko . we would get water from the nearby river in a bucket to flush the toilet and i remember one day finding a frog in the bucket . i remember screaming my protests as my mum insisted on washing me in the cold river . i remember one day going for a walk and as the four adults struggled to make it across the fast flowing river with widely spaced stepping stones they decided to throw me across . ",
        "setting loose from my father 's arms , cool air , a sensation of lightness , the water rushing below , then thump as my parent 's friend caught me in his arms . he was always my hero from that moment . somehow , in another long story i will save for another time i now live in the desert and my husband is a bedouin arab . we make a great team but recently i have realised that was it not for all those years travelling with my parents i probably would not still be living here . ",
        "travelling teaches adaptability . i know this is not the most touted benefit of travel , but for me , i think it is one of the most important ones . why ? because living peacefully with others who have a different culture or a different viewpoint or a different religion requires adaptability . i mean where i live now could not be more different from the uk . the place i belong . i do n't miss the uk but what i do miss is the comfortable feelings of self that you get when you are surrounded by people who have the same culture as you . ",
        "you know what to say and where the lines are between humour and offense . you know where the lines are between what you can and ca n't be open about . you know where the lines are between people ; what is friendly , what is flirting , what are appropriate conversations between people . you are the lines and the lines are you . except , when you are the alien , you are the stranger in the land , all the lines change . you can be having a conversation and then suddenly you realise the person you are talking to is not reacting how you expected them to . ",
        "there are these moments when there is a kind of look you come to know , which means you goofed up there . you went over the line or under the line or you bulldozered the line . i had to laugh in disbelief last year when i read a report on the news about syrian refugees in australia . some authority person in the article was complaining that after 1 year they were not settling in well or looking or behaving australian enough . i mean 1 year ! you must be joking right ! you think they are going to arrive traumatised from war with a very different culture to australian culture , after one year fully integrate with australians and if they do n't they should go home ! ",
        "that spokesperson has clearly never spent time living anywhere other than the place they belong . this is why so many people who are refugees and immigrants to other countries for reasons such as war or undue hardships have such a hard time . change is hard to cope with and if you did n't go somewhere because of the love of the place , rather as a necessity to preserve your life or to try to provide for your loved ones , you are going to miss the place you belong to even more . why is it when we live abroad we seek others like us . ",
        "across the globe , you will find expats associate with expats . this is why when people move to another country for economic reasons or fleeing war or hardships they will find other people of their own nationality and associate with them . when we are together with people of the same culture as our own we feel comfortable . our self is validated . we know where the lines are . travel teaches adaptability . when you travel , i mean really travel , not the 5 * ritz carlton style of travel , you learn to live in different physical circumstances . ",
        "you learn to get a good night sleep even if there are no sheets or the sheets are questionably clean . or if there are physical conditions very different to what you are used to . you learn to negotiate , communicate and connect with people through means other than a conversation . you realise how different the people of the world are and actually , you have to let this teach you humility , to not assume your own `` rightness '' . i travelled a lot as a child and because i did i do n't worry about my house which has walls one breeze block thick , no paint inside or proper floors . ",
        "i do n't worry about the bad plumbing or dodgy electricity or the dangerous gas appliances . i feel grateful for what i have because so many people do n't even have a home . i do n't worry about the power cuts : d. i do n't worry when the water runs out . i do n't worry about not having any loo roll . i cope . i cope with and adapt to physical difficulties and inconveniences because as a child , teenager and young adult i travelled . i do n't take any credit . i do n't cope or adapt because of any particular virtue i have over other people . ",
        "i adapted because travel teaches you to adapt . then , when you can adapt physically without too much stress or heartaches you have the energy to cope with the real work of living as an alien . or the real work of living in your own community where you belong , aliens joining you there . feeling out the lines . pushing with your fingertips , toes , eyes . finding the way through without losing your self . retaining your core , but making changes too . and this is really what integration is . a position when you have all made an evolution . ",
        "you retain who you are but you change too . then the work is complete and you can say you belong in your new home . or you can say the refugee 's or immigrants belong in your community . you know where the lines are . you know the landscape . you know how people will react , what you can and can not say . so i say let us take our children and travel because the world today needs adaptable people .
