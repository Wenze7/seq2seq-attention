        "on december 18 , 2017 , the u. s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit dismissed the u. s. government 's appeal regarding a bureau of safety and environmental enforcement notification of incident of noncompliance civil penalty issued against an oilfield contractor . this development brings closure to the long-standing question of whether bsee has authority to enforce civil and criminal penalties against offshore contractors . backgroundfollowing the tragic explosion and subsequent sinking of the offshore drilling rig deepwater horizon on april 20 , 2010 , bsee issued numerous incs to offshore lessors and operators as part of larger u. s. government concerted efforts to hold alleged wrongdoers accountable . ",
        "surprisingly though , bsee also attempted to issue incs to oilfield contractors for reasons such as failing to `` protect health , safety , property and the environment , '' failing to `` take measures to prevent unauthorized discharge of pollutants , '' and failing to `` take necessary precautions '' related to well control . by issuing incs to contractors , bsee took novel steps towards imposition of civil penalties and fines in an enforcement posture with which offshore stakeholders at that time had not previously experienced . in fact , prior to the deepwater horizon incident , bsee did not take civil penalty enforcement action against oilfield contractors . ",
        "rather , the regulations had been applied to the drilling site operator and lessee . in this regard , the entities to which the regulations apply hinge upon a determination of the definition of `` you . '' for example , the regulations require that `` you must protect health , safety , property , and the environment , '' and `` you must take necessary precautions to keep wells under control at all times . '' . the term `` you '' is defined only as `` a lessee , the owner or holder of operating rights , a designated operator or agent of the lessee ... . '' ",
        "30 c. f.r. ยง 250.105 . in august 2012 , bsee issued an interim policy document no . 12-07 entitled `` issuance of an incident of non compliance to contractors , '' which established parameters by which bsee would consider issuing incs to contractors conducting offshore exploration , development , and production activities . while ipd no . 12-07 purported to declare bsee 's justification for issuance of incs against contractors at a time when there was governmental focus on the severity of the deepwater horizon incident , such enforcement steps were nonetheless unprecedented and thus the question of whether bsee had the authority to issue civil penalties given this background was questionable . ",
        "the `` black elk '' case and oilfield contractor criminal penalty liabilitythe issue of criminal liability for contractors was resolved earlier in 2017 . set against the backdrop of the subsequent enforcement posture following the deepwater horizon incident , the department of justice sought criminal sanctions for ocsla violations against the owner and operator of the platform , several oilfield contractors , and the lease holder black elk energy offshore operations , llc , following a platform explosion in 2012 . the contractors moved to dismiss the charges on the grounds that oscla did not cover their conduct since they were neither an operator nor lease holder . ",
        "the district court ruled for the contractors , and the government appealed . ultimately , in september 2017 the fifth circuit affirmed the district court 's judgment and ruled against the government , finding criminal liability did not apply to contractors since the regulatory definition of `` you '' only applied to lessees , permittees and designated operators . united states v. moss , et al. , 872 f. 3d 304 . the court also noted that agency policy for 60 years had been silent on criminal enforcement against contractors and declined to counter that precedent . a little less than three months later , the fifth circuit also resolved the question of contractor 's civil liability as discussed next . ",
        "island operating co. . and oilfield contractor civil penalty liabilityin june 2012 , island operating co. 's employees were working for apache on a platform on the outer continental shelf . the employees caused a chemical spill and fire that resulted in a discharge in the gulf of mexico . several months later , bsee issued an inc to island for a violation of failure to `` protect health , safety , property , and the environment by ... performing all operations in a safe and workmanlike manner . '' island appealed the issuance of the inc to the interior board of land appeals . ",
        "in their appeal , island argued that interpretation of oscla did not authorize bsee to take enforcement measures against service providers such as contractors , but rather only against operators or lease holders . this interpretation of oscla was buttressed by decades of precedent by bsee on failing to take enforcement action against contractors . nonetheless , on september 25 , 2015 , the ibla affirmed bsee 's issuance of the inc to island , interpreting ocsla 's authorities broadly and rejecting the notion that years of civil penalties inaction against contractors amounted to mandatory policy . island 's appeal to the western district of louisiana followed . ",
        "on appeal , island challenged bsee 's authority to issue an inc and enforce the safety and environmental provisions under ocsla and its implementing regulations against contractors . island operating co. , inc. . v. jewell , 6:16-cv-00145 , 2016 wl 7436665 . the district court reviewed both the plain statutory language of the ocsla , as well as its implementing regulations , and found that the while the relevant regulations may appear to have been drafted more broadly to impose a duty on the person actually performing the work , such an interpretation would impermissibly exceed the reach of ocsla . ",
        "thus , the court found invalid any bsee enforcement action against island for failure to comply with oclsa since island was neither a lease holder nor a permit holder . more importantly , since island was not a lease holder or permit holder and thus did not have a duty to comply with applicable ocsla statutes or implementing safety and environmental regulations , the court found that bsee had no authority under ocsla to impose a civil penalty or fine against island . in may 2017 , the government appealed to the u. s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit , and on december 18 , 2017 , the fifth circuit dismissed their appeal , bringing finality to the case . ",
        "notably , ipd no . 12-07 is no longer available on the bsee website . conclusionsthe question of whether oilfield contractors were subject to bsee civil penalties has been a point of consternation for several years in the offshore energy development and exploration sector . with this ruling , the court effectively struck down bsee 's overreach and its attempt to apply an overly broad interpretation of ocsla and its implementing regulations . importantly , offshore stakeholders now have a clear understanding of their civil -- and criminal -- risk and liabilities when operating on the ocs .
