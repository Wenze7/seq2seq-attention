        "kosovska mitrovica - leading kosovo serb politician oliver ivanovic was killed on tuesday in a drive-by shooting as he arrived at his party headquarters , his lawyer and a party official said . the killing occurred on the very day that belgrade and pristina had started talks on normalising ties after a break of more than a year . `` i am informed that he was shot dead on the spot and efforts to revive him at mitrovica hospital were unsuccessful , '' lawyer nebojsa vlajic told afp . he said ivanovic , who was set to face a retrial on charges of war crimes over the kosovo conflict after an earlier conviction was thrown out , had been hit by five bullets . ",
        "ivanovic , 64 , of the social democratic party , was considered a moderate politician in the ethnically divided flashpoint town of mitrovica . a former serbian state secretary for kosovo , ivanovic was a key interlocutor with nato , the united nations and later the european union after the 1990s war and was seen as backing dialogue with kosovo 's ethnic albanians . - emergency meeting - serbian president aleksandar vucic swiftly called an emergency meeting of the council for national security after the shooting , national broadcaster rts reported . in brussels , a delegation from belgrade walked out of the talks with kosovo albanians that had resumed earlier tuesday after more than a year 's hiatus , according to local media in belgrade . ",
        "under the pressure from the international community and european union auspices , kosovo and serbia have been trying to normalise ties almost 20 years since the start of a bloody war that claimed 13,000 lives , mostly ethnic albanians . the 1998-99 war between serbian security forces and kosovo albanian guerrillas was ended by a nato air campaign . predominantly ethnic albanian kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in february 2008 . belgrade still refuses to recognise the move by its former southern province .
