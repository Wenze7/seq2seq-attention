        "colorado , 2004the snow is falling , and while the enchanted snowflakes make their way to the ground , their beauty distracts me from my concerns for a merely moment . i desperately need to get to my second job . i ca n't help but think that my rather nice morning job - where i interpret for customers , assist them with their payments , bookings , and advise them the best way to enjoy their vacations in these cold and remote mountains - is a marvelous opportunity for a recent graduate . and although the payment is rather disappointing i 'm still happy for having the opportunity to work legally in the states . ",
        "but being short at the end of the month is not something that particularly makes me happy . so , as always in life , we ca n't blame the circumstances , we must take action . so , i took a second job bussing tables at a local restaurant . yes , cleaning tables , taking the trash out , vacuum the place . in other words , i make the place shiny ready for our customers , who if served well , would leave a tip not only for the waiter but for the lovely latino girl , who smiles at them while filling their glasses with fresh cold water . ",
        "but i 've missed the bus . could n't the mean driver just wait a couple of seconds more ? what should i do now ? i better start walking , or i 'll freeze to death . making my way down the road covered in snow , i know that walking to the restaurant is the only plausible alternative . and it 'll take me about two hours to get there , without taking into consideration the possibility that i might be run over , because , these are the mountains , and the main road is the highway . ",
        "so , i decide not to take the latest possibility into account , because , you know ? i want to keep things positive . after few minutes walking down the mountain , i notice cars coming , and then i decide to hitchhike . to my surprise , a car stop . i run towards it and once i reach it , i nervously open the door . to my surprise , i am welcomed by the sweetest smiles , i 've seen in a long time . ito-san and his lovely wife , nozomi-san . they dropped me at the restaurant and we begin a unique and everlasting friendship . ",
        "tokyo , 2016today , i 'm meeting ito-san and nozomi after eight years . the last time we meet was 2008 but since then life has changed so much for us . i got married , moved cities while they 've had grandchildren and moved countries . and although , we 've kept in touch all this time , i am a little concern about how to connect with my old friends . i spot them . i walk towards them and without saying much i hug nozomi-san , and ito-san . in this warm embrace , i feel my concerns melting away , and i am just left with joy and happiness . ",
        "we made our way to the sushi restaurant they so thoughtfully selected for our dinner party . while enjoying freshly made sushi and beers , we start catching up . they show me pictures of their beautiful grandchildren , and i tell them all about my projects . and , although , i know in my heart i 've taken the right decision about my career , there 's a part of me that needed reassurance . encouraged by the alcohol , i shared my concerns , and it 's here when ito-san looked me directly in the eye and said : `` in life , you 're going to find predicaments . ",
        "sometimes , you might feel there is a wall . it might feel like it is the end of your life . but is it really the end of your life ? or rather the end of the life you were living ? i assure you it 's not the end of your life . and the situation you are living is neither the end of your life nor life threatening . therefore , there 's nothing to fear . you 'll be okay . '' i was so touched listening to his words that i only managed to nod in agreement . ",
        "maybe ito-san knew that i needed to hear those words . maybe , in my hopes , he saw himself when he started doing business as a young man in the not-yet-fully recovered japan . whatever the reason , i feel grateful , because an advice like this , can be the ultimate difference between quitting or keep trying . when we finish dining , we made our way back to the station . i hugged ito-san and nozomi-san one last time before letting them go . and thank them again for always listening to me , and as always take me in the right direction .
