",
        "`` my nephew rejected the prosecutor 's claim that he had thrown stones at israeli soldiers . he said he went out to meet some of his family 's needs and got stuck in the middle of the scene , `` said rashad . `` he even pointed out that a large number of soldiers swooped on him and blindfolded him while he was trying to escape from the sound bombs and the scene . '' the teenager became widely recognized after his photo went viral on social media . al-juneidi 's arrest comes at a time when the occupied palestinian territories are witnessing protests against last week 's decision by us president donald trump to recognize jerusalem as israel 's capital and the announcement of plans to move the us embassy from tel aviv to the contested city .
