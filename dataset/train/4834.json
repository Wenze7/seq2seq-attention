        "bitcoin 's euphoric rise has spread , something like cancer , into other `` alt coins , '' pushing up the value of ethereum and litecoin , among other cryptocurrencies . ask the regular joe diving into cryptocurrencies via credit cards the difference between regular bitcoin and various bitcoin `` forks '' like bitcoin cash , bitcoin gold and bitcoin diamonds . joe probably does n't care . price hikes are creating the excitement , not any real currency trading discussions on , say , statement-of-work vs. proof-of-stake . the focus is on whether bitcoin will hit $ 20,000 on the u. s.-focused exchanges . ",
        "nothing else seems to matter . but the bitcoin bulls , especially those who care about the bigger picture , need to answer these issues ; bitcoin = biggest bubble of all time in a chart from convoy investments that went viral tuesday , bitcoin is now officially the biggest bubble the world has ever seen , as measured as a multiple of its starting price . the spike eclipses the chaos around dutch `` tulip mania '' in the 1600s , the mississippi bubble of the 1700s , and the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s . ",
        "the rise has been so swift and severe that even bitcoin insiders are joining with regulators and other officials to warn of the downside risks . coinbase founder brian armstrong wrote in a blog post that bitcoin prices are volatile and that folks should `` invest responsibly . '' mike novogratz , a famed hedge fund manager turned crypto-investor , called it `` the biggest bubble of our lifetimes . '' even the founder of liitecoin told potential buyers monday night that buying his currency is `` extremely risky '' and that he expects to have a multi-year bear market where its value could drop 90 % . ",
        "securities and exchange chairman jay clayton on monday reminded speculators that cryptocurrency markets , by design , offer less investor protections than the traditional securities market because of their decentralized , supra-national nature -- a `` feature '' according to its proponents . he also touched on what 's been a primary driver of bitcoin 's initial popularity : an absence of government regulation or oversight , fueling its use in tax avoidance schemes and the trading in illicit substances . do you know what bitcoin 's `` kryptonite '' is ? bitcoin bulls would do well to play devil 's advocate and consider the number of risks that could quickly lance the boil of speculation in cryptocurrencies . ",
        "the largest is a regulatory crackdown not unlike what happened in china , which was until then the hotspot for bitcoin activity globally . governments have a long history of outlawing economic and financial market activities not deemed in the common interest , even in the u. s. , from crackdowns on `` bucket shops '' that allowed people to make highly leveraged bets on the direction of stocks and commodities to the prohibition of private ownership of gold during the great depression . already , the irs is stepping up its enforcement of collecting capital gains from cryptocurrency winnings . ",
        "moreover , it 's worth remembering that bitcoin 's infrastructure is n't efficient . it takes minutes to settle transactions -- far slower than traditional payment processors like visa . bitcoin mining is already consuming the same amount of electricity as denmark according to one estimate . and the entire system has shown a vulnerability to theft and hacking with no legal recourse for victims . competitive offerings like apple pay messaging , zelle , and venmo offer many of the benefits with fewer risks . inflation would change everything above all , bitcoin 's rise is a product of the post-crisis era of ultra-aggressive cheap-money stimulus from global central banks . ",
        "here at home , the federal reserve 's balance sheet has swelled from around $ 800 billion to more than $ 4 trillion . the failure of lehman brothers , bear stearns and washington mutual , among others , created an impression of fragility and vulnerability in the banking system at a time when ultra-low interest rates were a disincentive for holding deposits . bitcoin gets around this , with in-built scarcity and its supposed `` peer-to-peer '' nature offering a free market refuge from wall street , the dollar and pesky institutions like the central banks . it 's a role that traditionally has been played by precious metals , with silver and gold bullion and coins seen as the ultimate safe haven . ",
        "but years of listless trading , allegations of market manipulation , and a lack of a `` digital '' veneer has allowed cryptocurrencies to usurp this position . just in time for a possible reversal of post-crisis trends . the federal reserve has been tightening monetary policy for two years , with another rate hike likely this week and another three hikes penciled in for 2018 . inflation is picking up amid labor market tightness , the latent effects of global monetary easing , and the looming passage of a simulative gop tax cut bill in washington . a hawkish fed would likely lead to a rebound in the u. s. dollar , a breaking of the speculative fever on wall street , and an undermining of many of the reasons bitcoin was created in the first place .
