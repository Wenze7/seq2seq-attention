        "by chris kenning - the paramedics find them everywhere - slumped over car steering wheels , barely breathing in doughnut shop bathrooms or dead in derelict apartments and expensive mansions . for the cataldo ambulance service crews outside boston on the front lines of the u. s. opioid epidemic , the flood of overdose calls is a grim daily reality , despite expanded access to overdose reversal drugs . `` when i started , this was a rare thing . you did one or two here and there . now , we do quite a few , '' said dave franklin , 44 , a supervisor at the private service that contracts with cities who has worked in the field for more than 20 years . ",
        "in massachusetts , ems opioid overdose calls hit 20,978 in 2016 , up from 8,389 in 2013 , according to a state report . amid wider use by bystanders and police of naloxone , a drug that reverses overdose symptoms , state figures showed a small drop in opioid deaths in the first nine months of 2017 compared with 2016 . but franklin does not yet see a turning point . `` it 's not going away anytime soon . people are still dying regularly , '' he said . in the united states , deaths from drug overdoses have surpassed deaths by firearms and motor vehicle crashes , according to a 2017 drug enforcement administration report . ",
        "president donald trump has declared a public health emergency over opioid abuse , promising to increase treatment but initially dedicating no money for it . opioids , primarily prescription painkillers , heroin and synthetic drugs like fentanyl , a pain medicine 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine , are fueling the crisis . opioid-related overdoses kill 91 people in the united states each day , the drug enforcement administration said . on thursday , the centers for disease control reported , based on the latest available figures , that the u. s. rate of drug overdose deaths in 2016 grew 21 percent from the prior year . ",
        "`` it 's hard to watch , and it 's devastating , '' said domenic corey , 27 , who has seen the evidence up close working as a cataldo paramedic . mornings before starting his shift , another cataldo paramedic , andrew simpson , grabs his stethoscope , intravenous supplies , scissors and pen light . at the ambulance , he checks to make sure there is enough naloxone . they carry more than double the amount they once did because stronger opioids mean that multiple doses of naloxone are often required for someone who is barely breathing . ",
        "simpson , 34 , works at least two 24-hour shifts a week in a high-turnover job that can be stressful and where pay starts at $ 14 an hour . just touching fentanyl can send an ems worker into overdose . simpson 's radio crackles with calls . difficulty breathing . person down . unresponsive . overdose . they turn on the lights and roll . from experience , they know it might be a man who overdosed into unconsciousness while driving , a teen or elderly user passed out in a park or an already stiffened corpse in a hotel room strewn with needles and powder . ",
        "on arrival , they spray naloxone up the nose or inject it into the user , pump oxygen into lungs and wait . some respond gulping for air or vomiting and confused . `` why are you in my house ? what 's going on ? '' simpson recalled as a common question from recipients of his aid . some people are grateful and repentant , crying , shaking hands and promising to get treatment . others deny they took drugs at all . the calls often come in waves when fentanyl too potent for users hits the streets . ",
        "time of day matters , too . `` if it 's in the afternoon , there 's a much better chance they are still alive , '' he said . `` if we get the call at 7 a. m. , they probably shot up the night before . `` the paramedics say they often see families torn apart in front of their eyes or bereaved parents . `` you see the parents , they 're crushed ; just the look of defeat , you know ? they lost the most important person in the world to them . i ca n't even imagine . ",
        "but you see it over and over again , '' corey said . the cost of naloxone has risen with demand , eating into the service 's budgets , franklin said . but they are also using their steady overdose runs to help some cities map drug hotspots and for police to visit users to urge them into treatment . `` in the back of the ambulance , you talk to them and hope they get treatment , '' simpson said , explaining that most agree they need to get help . `` but then at times i 'll see the same person three months down the line and they have overdosed .
