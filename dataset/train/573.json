        "israel and jordan have struck a deal to heal the diplomatic rift caused by the shooting deaths of two jordanians at the israeli embassy in amman last year , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's office said on thursday . however the statement did not repeat jordan 's claim that israel had apologized for the incident or that it will pay compensation to the victim 's families . `` the israeli embassy in jordan will return to full activity immediately , '' netanyahu 's office said . `` israel attaches great importance to its strategic relations with jordan , and the two countries will act to advance their cooperation and to strengthen the peace treaty between them . ",
        "`` moments earlier , a jordanian government spokesman said israel 's foreign ministry had apologized , pledged to pay compensation and vowed to `` follow up '' legal proceedings against the security official at the center of the crisis . however the israeli release did not address that claim , saying only that `` the israeli authorities will continue reviewing the materials regarding the july 2017 incident and anticipate making a decision in the coming weeks . `` jordan has repeatedly insisted that israel must put the ex-head of security at the amman embassy , known only as ziv , on trial before an ambassador can return to amman . ",
        "however it is not clear if the deal includes laying charges against him . the most serious crisis between the two countries was sparked on july 23 last year , when 17-year-old mohammed jawawdeh was shot dead by ziv during what jordan described a row over the late delivery of furniture . a local doctor and the landlord of ziv 's residence , bashar hamarneh , was also killed by stray gunfire . ziv reportedly told police that upon discovering he was israeli , jawawdeh drew a screwdriver and began trying to stab him in the neck . jordanian officials were enraged when ziv received a hero 's welcome in israel following a diplomatic stand-off which saw the israeli mission in its eastern neighbor closed and diplomats kicked out . ",
        "jordan and israel signed a peace treaty in 1994 , and despite often tense relations , israel considers the country to be a stable bulwark against radical elements penetrating its long eastern border .   "
