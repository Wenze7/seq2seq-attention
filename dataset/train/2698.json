        "tiaotiaowu , one of the latest apps targeted at elderly people who love strutting their moves in public spaces , looks well-positioned to capitalize on an expanding aging population . square dancing , or guangchangwu , has for decades been a popular pastime among middle-aged and elderly citizens in china . but while many young people would find it embarrassing to be involved with an activity that is associated with the older generation , 27-year-old han xiaoyuan deals with it on a daily basis . han is the founder of tiaotiaowu , a social networking application for square dancing enthusiasts that allows them to find new friends , join dance groups and share multimedia content . ",
        "users can also learn how to improve their dance techniques through instructional videos as well as register for leisure tours to parks and competitions . tiaotiaowu has organized about 50 square dancing competitions since its inception in march 2016 . developed by han 's startup shanghai xinglian information technology , the app is now the largest digital platform for square dancing in shanghai and the second-largest in the country . tiaotiaowu presently has more than 400,000 active monthly users . according to yiguan travel and health research center , the most widely used square dancing app in china is tangdou . ",
        "designed by a beijing-based startup , the app presently has about 6.4 million active users . square dancing has long been a controversial issue in chinese society , largely because participants occupy large public spaces such as parks and prevent others from using them . the loud music that accompanies the activity has also irked many members of the public . `` like most people , i used to see square dancing grannies as a nuisance , because they would occupy large public spaces and blast their music , '' said han . `` but i realized that if we can admire the street dances by young performers , why is it that we can not do the same for these elderly people who are simply trying to enjoy their lives ? ",
        "they just need a more organized platform to support their hobby . '' to address these issues , the competitions that are organized by tiaotiaowu feature music that is mellower in nature . the company also sources for venues that are suitable for hosting such an activity , such as community centers and private dance halls . `` many of those from the older generation are eager to catch up with this fast-moving society we live in today . products such as tiaotiaowu can help them understand the digital world , '' said luo yanfen , chief assistant at the shanghai bureau of east silver valley , an online financial advisory platform that sponsored one of the square dancing competitions by tiaotiaowu last year . ",
        "ding yiling , a square dancer from shanghai , is among the fans of tiaotiaowu . `` i feel that this company is genuinely concerned about square dancers and is not just focused on making money from its users , '' said the 66-year-old . ding added that the company could explore introducing additional features to the app in the future , such as sections that contain useful lifestyle and financial tips for the older generation . according to statistics by beijing daily , there had been around 60 apps related to square dancing since 2015 . many of these apps have since been taken down due to a lack of funding or insufficient volume of active users . ",
        "in order to stay competitive in a fast-growing market segment , jiang xinwei , senior analyst at yiguan travel and health research center , pointed out that square dancing app makers could consider collaborating with other industries such as entertainment , education and medicine to create a more informative app for users . according to xinhua news agency , the chinese government predicted that the number of elderly people in the country will expand to form about a quarter of the overall population by 2030 . this would in turn result in a growth in the square dancing market where an increasing number of senior citizens have been spending their money . ",
        "products like team uniforms , qipaos , dancing shoes and electronic devices including speakers are among the most common things that square dancing enthusiasts buy . consumption among the senior citizens , who make up the majority of the square dancing population , is indeed growing . based on a report by the chinese business network data , a strategic data platform , 10.3 percent of the total number of e-shopping consumers in 2015 were those aged 51 to 70 , up from 5.8 percent in 2011 . in addition , the number of square dancing enthusiasts purchasing things through mobile phones grew by about 30 percent during the same period .
