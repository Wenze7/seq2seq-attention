        "praise the lord , the miz is back in this week 's with spandex wwe raw open discussion thread : much to the delight of the miztourage , the miz is returning to raw , live in memphis . as team red prepares for the royal rumble event on jan. . 28 , what might the a-lister have in store ? our five-point preview : 1 . the miz is back , and while that probably means a miz tv segment where he challenges roman reigns and then reigns beats up three guys , i hope we get elias being formally added to the miztourage as their traveling bard . ",
        "just exclusively writing and performing songs about how great the miz is . 2 . and then later in the show , miz is like , `` when did you stop being a stunt double and learn to play guitar ? `` 3 . the dot com preview asks what 's next for `` finn bálor and his good brothers , '' so hopefully that means they 're keeping the team together and not abandoning it as a one-off . that 's good news for all parties , because there are n't three dudes on raw who need direction more right now than bálor , anderson and gallows . ",
        "4 . enzo amore is supposed to finally defend his cruiserweight championship after having the entire tournament rescheduled due to real life issues and then the championship match getting delayed for real-life illness . let 's hope cedric alexander does n't develop gout on monday morning and have to bow out . 5 . can uh , can we get the revival on the show again this week ? thanks guys . +1 your favorite comments from tonight 's thread and we 'll put 10 of the best in tomorrow 's best and worst of raw report . you know the drill .
