        "`` i have cared for you since you were born . yes , i carried you before you were born . i will be your god throughout your lifetime -- until your hair is white with age . i made you , and i will care for you . i will carry you along and save you . '' today brings a special perspective on life for me . recently , i sang for a funeral of a baby that only lived for one hour after birth . his parents knew for the last 4 months of pregnancy that this would likely be the case , but they loved him and bore testimony of god 's goodness and nearness . ",
        "44 years ago , my little brother , walt , was born prematurely . babies his size routinely survive and prosper now , but medical technology in 1973 did not provide that opportunity . he lived a few days , but never left the hospital . i was never in the room with him . i saw him inside an incubator through a window . god carried both those babies . he carried them in the womb and he carried them into his presence . i do n't know why i have been allowed to live until i am beginning the `` hair white with age '' stage , but i know he has been carrying me . ",
        "that reality makes me want , even more , to fulfill his purpose for my life . question : can you think of times throughout your life that you were aware that god was carrying you ? what can you do to cultivate that awareness today ?   "
