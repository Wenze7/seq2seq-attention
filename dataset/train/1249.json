        "wta founding member billie jean king says margaret court arena should be renamed over her contemporary 's views on homosexuality . court holds more grand slam titles than any player in the history of tennis , with 64 victories across singles and doubles competition , but has become a controversial figure in recent years after backing ` no ' in australia 's same-sex marriage vote , suggesting that women 's tennis is `` full of lesbians '' and comparing lbgtiq culture to `` hitler '' . australia 's 64-time grand-slam champion has regularly defended her stance as part of her christian beliefs . ",
        "king says she lobbied on behalf of court to be recognised after the main tennis stadium in melbourne was named after rod laver , however the american - a lesbian and civil-rights campaigner - says she would now refuse to play on the show-court named after her former rival . `` i was fine until lately she said so many derogatory things about my community . i 'm a gay woman ; about the lgbtiq community , '' king said at a news conference after she was named the wta 's ` woman of the year ' in honour of the 50th anniversary of her first australian open triumph . ",
        "`` i personally do n't think she should have her name anymore . `` if i were playing today , i would not play in this court . '' australian open tournament director craig tiley was quoted suggesting that `` conversations '' had been held about the court 's name , but stopped short of suggesting that a change was in the offing . `` our position has n't changed , '' he said . `` margaret 's views are her views . is up to a broader group of people and not up to one person or organisation . '' ",
        "tiley also confirmed that court would not attend the year 's first grand slam , a move king lamented . `` i wish margaret was here this year , '' she said . `` we usually sit next to each other . ''   "
