        "on top of that , we have two expiring levies that are up for renewal . both our technology levy and our educational program and operations levy will also be on the ballot this february . two levy renewals and a new bond sounds like a lot of money , and it is . but we find ourselves in an uncommon -- and economically favorable -- situation . recent changes in state law have generated a more equitable funding model for districts throughout the state . this means that the state will now be collecting a tax to fund education , but that tax will actually be much lower than the amount we were authorized to collect in our previous maintenance and operations levies . ",
        "our financial advisor indicates that local school taxes will actually go down for our taxpayers in 2019 , even if the levies are renewed and the new bond is approved . state tax fix leaves local levies and bonds up to votersthis summer , state legislators increased property taxes with the intent of lowering local school taxes -- not eliminating local school taxes . it 's a good concept , and a step in the right direction . but it 's not perfect . the new funding formulas in the new law create uneven gaps in how much different districts can ask voters to approve . ",
        "this means some districts can ask voters for more money per student than others . this is not an equitable solution for all students and districts in the state . plus , the state money must be spent in very specific ways . bethel , like every other district , has unique situations regarding local programs that are important to our students . so while we use our local educational programs and operations levy to fund special education programs and extra transportation costs , that might be different in other districts . the local levies allow local control , but the new restrictions eliminate much of our local control for programs our community wants to see in our schools . ",
        "that said , the state 's new funding model , though a work in progress , is a step in the right direction . bonds are for buildingone thing house bill 2242 did not fix was the need for capital improvement bonds for districts . local school districts are still responsible for the majority of the cost to build new schools and fix old ones . bethel is one of many districts in the state asking voters to approve a new bond in 2018 . our new bond is $ 443 million . along with the two replacement levies also on the ballot in february , it 's a lot of money to ask of voters . ",
        "but this is a unique opportunity for our district . local school taxes are going down in 2019according to our financial advisors , local school taxes will be going down for bethel residents in 2019 . that 's after they go up slightly in 2018 , which is an `` exception year '' due to action of the legislature . but in 2019 , local school taxes will go down so much , that even if both levies and the new bond are approved , bethel voters would still see a reduction in their local school taxes . this is not the case in every district . ",
        "this is a very unique opportunity for bethel . so the district is hoping voters will see the need , and see the opportunity , as they cast their ballots in february . `` property-rich school districts like those in the seattle area will pay more for public education . that money will then be sent to the state , and the state will then turn around and send it to -- in our case -- bethel . as a result , our local taxpayers do n't have to pay that money , '' said bethel superintendent tom seigel . ",
        "the deadline to register to vote in the special election is january 15 , and election day is february 13 . more information about the bond is available here .   "
