        "we all thought that during this past preseason the oakland raiders would be building off of their stellar 2016 campaign where , if not for a severe injury to starting quarterback derek carr , they could have competing for a spot in the super bowl . with carr back , there was no excuse for them not to one-up their previous 12-4 record . instead , through 16 weeks they are a disappointing 6-9 with no chance for any postseason appearance . as a result , there 's no harm in pulling starters in order to get an early look at what the depth chart could look like for 2018 . ",
        "connor cook 's first and last start in the nfl came during 2016 's wild card round against the houston texans . the quarterback struggled mightily going 18-45 for 161 yards a touchdown and three interceptions , paving the way for a 27-14 loss . let 's get a look at what he can do in a meaningless game without as much pressure . there is no reason for the raiders to risk getting carr injured . hopefully , he 'll have more success as the team tries to keep their starters healthy while closing it out on the road against division rivals , the los angeles chargers , who are battling for a spot in the playoffs .
