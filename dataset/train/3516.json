        "spoilers , and venting ahead : let 's imagine that you put a coin , heads up , in a machine and it could flip the coin with the exact same strength , and under the same conditions , an infinite amount of times . in our universe the coin would land 51 % of the time as heads , and 49 % tails ; and i suspect that in the star wars universe it is 50 -- 50 . luke wants to kill the jedi because the jedi need the sith to exist . unfortunately the ceo and creative building at disney would never let that happen , and so we will get more star wars films , even if we must pretend the jedi are dead at the end of the next film . ",
        "corporations ruin movies . it 's starting to happen with marvel ; every single movie has a joke that undermines any sincerity . it has now happened with disney ; i was fine with a few jokes , but the snarky comments are not star wars . the disney corp is unwilling to do what is necessary to advance cinema . it 's why they keep dropping directors . they are unwilling to take an artistic vision for what it is . i swear that this is the last card hollywood will play before it dies . i ca n't see how they will recover when audiences grow tired of these formulaic mega movies . ",
        "queue the era of small independent fills and cheap cgi . for those that think this is a new star wars film , it 's not . it 's just three things chopped together : the empire strikes back , return of the jedi , and battlestar galactica . to me , it undermines the first trilogy . the return of the jedi has this massive battle taking place whose outcome is divorced from the battle between jedi and sith , but will actually decide events ; but , thematically the only thing that matters is the battle between good and evil , even though it has no effect on the plot . ",
        "that 's the brilliance of it . here , in the last jedi , the battle between good and evil has the same positioning , and then it 's all undermined when ghost luke shows up and denies kylo ren the ability to kill him , and proceeds to make him look like a pathetic fool . this is my least favorite star wars movie , and i feel like it 's strange world i 'm living in . i 'm starting to think that the prequels are the best star wars movies . they were at least thematically complex . ",
        "the problem is that i 'm too much of a star wars fan . probably the same problem that the fans had going into the prequels , after the long wait from the original trilogy . also , the prequels are terrible individual movies , but rather good in a back to back movie-fest . the rose finn arc was my favorite . i loved it , except for the ending . they should have brought george r. r. martin in as a writer . kill him . by setting up his death and not delivering you undermined all of the emotions i felt in the good parts of the film . ",
        "after a song of ice and fire , i expect death and i 've been regularly pissed when it 's not delivered . the death of the entire resistance does n't emotionally matter to me , only the characters , and they all lived , minus the easy deaths . i hate the flying outside of range idea . that 's such a stupid idea that was played out in storytelling by the 1950 's . it 's so cheap and has a million solutions . just light speed in front of them for fucks sake . pincer the fuckers . ",
        "maybe the first four seasons of game of thrones have just given me an elitist taste , but if you paid me i could come up with a thousand ways around that . the villains of these movies are so passive aggressive it makes me cry . they just sit and expect things to happen . domhnall gleeson is n't a bad actor , but his direction in these movies is terrible . the idea of a boisterous hitler in-charge of the first order is cool , but they have turned kylo and hux into cartoon characters who are emotionally weak and passive in the films . ",
        "vader motivated fear and dread , but now all this movie can do is make fun of the deepness of his voice . that 's all the venting i have for now . i 've been growing more and more pissed about the movie every few minutes since i saw it . i feel like disney can live on the marvel and star wars life-force for a few more years until the market for these things collapses , and i 'm sad that i want that to happen .
