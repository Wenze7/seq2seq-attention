        "it 's late . i mean late like he 's already been asleep a few hours and he goes to sleep late , late . so late its early . there 's a noise , downstairs . it 's not one of the usual suspects ; creaky pipes , the dog . the dog 's up here -- and he 's growling timidly under the bed . there 's a noise , downstairs . it 's a noise that absolutely nothing in his house makes . not metallic , nor plastic or wooden . it 's not a banging , or a scratching , or a scraping . ",
        "it 's ethereal , shimmering . up , and out of bed . but quietly . slowly . barely breathing . he 's wearing pants and a t-shirt , no socks and no idea what to do next . he does n't have anything that might function as a weapon , nothing . though even if he did , he would n't know what to do with it . the lamp will have to do . he unplugs it -- taking care to be as quiet as possible -- and grip its base with his right hand . he tests the weight of it , even gives it a half-hearted practice swing . ",
        "unwieldy . the hall stretches out in front of him . dark , ominous and somehow no longer his own . three steps down it and the noise is still going strong . whirling and wooshing . the dog 's staying well put , coward . he glances back at the canine and the look he 's met with says `` you do n't have to do this , man '' . but somehow , he knows he does . the top of the stairs now . the noise is growing louder and more solid . his hands tremble and clasp the makeshift-weapon desperately . ",
        "when he was young , he 'd hope for moments like this . something different , something exciting , something other-worldly . `` god , this whole damn world is boring boring boring ! i want something to happen , something like in a film '' . he takes a moment , to curse his younger self . his foot leaves the bottom step and touches ground . adrenaline courses through him as he notices unnaturally bright light , emanating through the crack under the door . it makes a stomach-churning creak as he pushes against it . everything happens at once . ",
        "searing , blinding pain and then nothing . the lamp was no use .   "
