        "atar - sitting by a tent in the vast , sun-bleached mauritanian desert , 71-year-old elisabeth godin smiles , unconcerned about her safety despite warnings from her friends and family . for most of the last decade , the spectacular dunes , barren canyons and oases of the adrar region have been a no-go zone for european nationals . the danger of terrorist attacks and kidnappings is still real , reflected by mauritania 's decision to join four other countries in fighting jihadism in the sahel . but after france eased its assessment of the security risk for the adrar , a tiny number of french visitors are now returning , stirring hopes for the blighted local economy . ",
        "`` i missed the sahara . the colours of the dunes , the wind on the sand , the starry skies , '' godin , a retiree from la rochelle in western france , told afp . `` when i sleep under the stars in the middle of the camp , i feel like i 'm in a cocoon , '' she said , on a rocky plateau surrounded by acacia trees . centuries ago the ancient mauritanian towns of chinguetti , oualata , tichitt and wadan were key hubs for the camel caravan trade , which would snake across the sahara selling gold and salt . ",
        "`` ever since i was a kid i was fascinated by the legends of the great caravans , '' said an awestruck visitor , guillaume jordan . - jihadist blow - adrar , a region 400 kilometres northeast of the mauritanian capital nouakchott , once had had a small but thriving excursion business , offering the extremes and the beauty of the desert to european travellers with a taste for adventure . in the 2000s , the region drew up to 14,000 visitors a year , mainly from france -- which , as the former colonial power , has a deep affinity with mauritania -- but also the netherlands , italy , spain , japan and britain . ",
        "but the activity was dealt a crippling blow when four french tourists were shot dead in 2007 , an attack claimed by an al-qaeda affiliate . the following year , another local money-spinner , the celebrated paris-dakar off-road auto rally , was cancelled because of security concerns . the race was later relocated to south america . the tour business staggered on before all but drying up in 2011 after further jihadist attacks . the first seeds of hope were sown last march , when the french foreign ministry gave a cautious downgrade of the region 's security risk . ",
        "it rated the risk as `` orange , '' meaning that travel there is `` not advised except for essential reasons . `` encouraged by the change , the french tour company point-afrique voyages , relaunched chartered flights between paris and atar , the main regional city , at christmas -- the first to fly this route since 2011 . a total of 14 flights -- supported by some 350,000 euros in subsidies by the mauritanian government -- have been scheduled until march 24 . the flights are already half-filled , with more than 1,000 visitors signed up , says point-afrique voyages . ",
        "`` since the flights to atar resumed , the figures for people coming by land have also risen , '' said mohammed ba ould ne , head of mauritania 's national tourism office . kadi mehdi , director of mauritanides voyages , described 2018 as `` a test season '' for a revival of european visitors . the tourism industry 's big challenge is to prove the country is safe , he said . `` dozens of police are constantly patrolling the area . we do not see them , but they are there , '' said mehdi . - ` benefits of tourism ' - the flights and growing trickle of visitors provide hope to the many guides , camel owners and hoteliers who have been unemployed , many of whom are the economic victims of terrorism . ",
        "`` we have been at a near standstill for almost a decade . now that planes are arriving , the city is starting to live again , '' said hostel owner lemine bahan . the trickle-down benefits of tourism should not be under-estimated , said point-afrique voyages director , maurice freund . mauritania is part of the so-called g5 sahel group , which also includes burkina faso , chad , mali and niger . these countries are setting up a five-nation force to combat extremists . `` mauritania has made enormous efforts to secure its territory , '' freund said . ",
        "but `` military force will never solve the problems alone , '' he said . `` tourism is a tool for peace . '' by nora schweitzer .   "
