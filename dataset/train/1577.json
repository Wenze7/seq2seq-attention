        "philadelphia -- not all businesses are closed on christmas day ... and that includes a bar in queen village , where it 's expected to be busy thanks to the steelers and the eagles games . o'neals pub is open every day of the year , and i think the owner actually laughed at me when i asked him if they were going to be opened on christmas . `` yes , i did laugh at you and yes we are always open , '' owner greg `` spoony '' rand said . `` we are an irish bar we are opened 365 days a year and on leap year we are opened 366 days a year . '' ",
        "he says o'neals will open at 11 a. m. and there will be happy hour specials during the steelers game and beer specials during the evening eagles game . the bar has been called the house divided in past , because pittsburgh and philadelphia sports fans both hang out out there . `` i know everybody thinks we are a steelers bar , but we 're by far first eagles more than anything , '' he said . and saint nick himself is expected to stop by before heading back to the north pole , no not nick foles , santa claus .
