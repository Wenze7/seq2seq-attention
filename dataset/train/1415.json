        "net neutrality is not a simple topic to understand . although the underlying principle -- all internet traffic should be treated equally -- is short and sweet , how that principle is applied , and why net neutrality is important , is something that 's eluded thousands of column inches and millions of youtube explainers . but somehow burger king , a fast food chain known for bad tv commericals and always losing to mcdonalds , has squeezed an explanation that anyone can understand into a two-minute video that you really need to watch . burger king does n't try and explain net neutrality in words ; instead , it simply applies what would happen without net neutrality to the world of burgers . ",
        "in the video , a burger king outlet offers three kinds of whoppers : the standard , low-priority whopper , and two faster but more expensive alternatives . customers get confused and then visibly upset when it becomes clear that the whole thing is a marketing ruse to get more money out of customers . funny though the video is , it does an admirable job to cutting to the important parts of net neutrality : the unfairness and overt profiteering that can exist without healthy competition or rules preventing anti-consumer pricing policies . now , the example that burger king creates would never work in the fast-food industry . ",
        "burger king faces stiff competition from dozens of other chains , often chains that have restaurants directly opposite a burger king . introduce the kind of dumb policy that burger king applies in the video , and you 'd lose all your customers overnight . but that does n't work for the home internet market . only 20 percent of us households have a choice when it comes to high-speed broadband provider , as the big cable companies mostly operate regional monopolies . some internet is better than no internet , so even if your connection is slowed , capped , or subject to price hikes , you 're going to keep paying .
