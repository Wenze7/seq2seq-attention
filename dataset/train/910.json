        "live st. john 's more streams arguments made in favour of renegotiating the churchill falls-hydro-québec deal were met by stiff questions in the supreme court of canada on tuesday . the nine judges repeatedly questioned lawyers for the churchill falls corporation on the basis of their arguments and why they thought the court should meddle in a decades-old contract . `` there 's no suggestion that churchill falls has received anything less than it was contracted , '' said justice russell brown during arguments by lawyer doug mitchell . `` well i would submit that is actually not the case , '' mitchell responded . ",
        "`` cflco gets the amount provided for in contract , yes . but that 's just a literal reading of the contract . '' partnership or separate entities ? mitchell , along with co-counsel audrey boctor , argued the churchill group entered a co-venture with hydro-québec in 1969 . while nothing in the contract states they were to be partners in the deal , or share profits and risks , they argued the two sides were co-dependent . while they were not an official partnership , mitchell said this made them `` akin to a partnership , '' and thus hydro-québec has acted in bad faith by not renegotiating the notorious lopsided terms . ",
        "the deal has generated $ 27.5 billion for quebec , while it has returned about $ 2 billion for newfoundland . it does not expire until 2041 . hydro-québec buys power from the churchill falls hydroelectric generator at a fixed price and sells it to other regions for huge profits . ` when you enter into a 65-year contract , you must do that knowing the world will turn over a couple of times in the process . ' the two sides went to quebec superior court in 2010 , with cflco arguing unsuccessfully the sizable profits from electricity were unforeseen in 1969 and that hydro-québec had a duty to renegotiate the contract . ",
        "on monday , lawyers for hydro-québec disputed the partnership argument , saying they were not co-dependent . while mitchell and boctor said hydro-québec had no other viable options for power generation in 1969 , their opposing counsel said quebec had ample untapped resources they could have developed . paradigm shift was unforeseen the churchill falls lawyers also argued unforeseeable events derailed the contract and , by refusing to renegotiate terms , hydro-québec did not act in good faith . several judges questioned if fluctuation in rates over a long-term contract could be considered `` unforeseeable . '' mitchell and boctor said it was more than just fluctuation -- it was a global paradigm shift , mixed with hydro-québec 's switch from a non-profit company to a profit generator . ",
        "brown was the most vocal of the supreme court judges , interjecting several times to offer opinions and ask questions . `` when you enter into a 65-year contract , you must do that knowing the world will turn over a couple of times in the process , '' he said . a decision in the case is not expected for about six months .
