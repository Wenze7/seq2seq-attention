        "if you were going into `` star wars : the last jedi '' expecting some great admiral ackbar scenes , sorry to break it to you : it 's a trap ! ackbar did n't get a ton of screen time in the original `` star wars '' trilogy , showing up for a limited amount of scenes in `` return of the jedi . '' but the hero of the battle of endor went on to become one of the most-memed , quoted and parodied characters of the franchise , even reaching no . 14 on huffpost 's own ranking of `` star wars '' characters . ",
        "with all this fanfare , and even an appearance in `` the force awakens , '' it was a shock in `` the last jedi '' when ackbar was killed off-screen during a kylo ren-led attack on the rebels . in the scene , ren holds off on firing at a rebel ship containing leia , but his squadron does n't . they blow up the bridge of her command ship , seemingly killing all the leaders within -- save for leia , of course . though viewers do n't see his actual final moments , gial ackbar 's death is confirmed in a line of dialogue following the incident , which explains that nearly all of the rebel leadership , including ackbar , were killed . ",
        "then , just like that , everyone moves on . and we were all like , `` ack-cuse me ? '' many fans felt the same . after the movie 's release in december , we asked `` last jedi '' editor bob ducsay about ackbar 's death . `` that was how it was designed , '' he said , confirming the off-screen moment went down as originally planned . however , ducsay also admitted to some second thoughts about the unceremonious send-off . `` it 's interesting that you mentioned it , '' he said , `` because i watched the film last night and i thought , hmmm , maybe that 's too incidental . ",
        "it 's a very funny thing about that because what happens ... i do n't typically watch movies that i work on much afterwards , because you 're so familiar with it . but this movie i 've seen now a couple times with an audience . and it occurred to me last night that what does happen when i watch movies ... is i generally find things that are like , hmmm , i wonder if i should do that differently . which is some really horrible form of personal criticism because there 's really nothing to be done . ",
        "'' `` that 's how it was designed , '' he concluded . `` that 's how it was intended . but it is slightly incidental , is n't it ? '' you can say that again , bob . as vulture pointed out , ackbar was at least given a grand memorial service after he died of old age in the unifying force , a book from the `` star wars '' expanded universe . he 's not just , you know , killed off-screen and forgotten about . as abrupt as ackbar 's departure seemed , it should be noted that actor erik bauersfeld , the voice of ackbar , died in april 2016 , reportedly only a couple of months into filming of `` the last jedi . '' ",
        "so , regardless of how it happened , the latest film does seem like an appropriate time to say goodbye to the admiral . at ease , you beautiful fish-eyed , salmon-colored , squid-man , you . this article originally appeared on the huffington post = txtlnkusaolp00000595 .   "
