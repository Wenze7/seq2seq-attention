        "michael kors presented the walk , a revolutionary global street style campaign recently in shanghai . the 58-year-old designer michael kors compares his job to that of a mind reader . and he says that chinese young consumers will soon want recycling while at the same time not sacrificing the fine touch of luxury . `` you have the most sophisticated generation not only in china , but also in the world . teenagers here have so much information at their fingertips . so i think they will start talking about recycling , '' says kors in shanghai , where his eponymous brand recently hosted an event called the walk . ",
        "`` i think this generation is not happy giving anything up when they do luxury shopping . so even when they are buying something that is good for the environment , they still want it to be beautiful . so we will have to find a way to include both . it 's challenging but also interesting for me as a designer , '' he says . but when it comes to the shanghai stop of the global campaign , which has already toured london and tokyo and is expected to go to los angeles as well as new york , the american designer and project runway judge does n't like to be led by the nose by the younger generation . ",
        "instead , he wants to take the lead . `` in today 's world , a young person , if not everyone , spends so much time on their phone that we want to have a party that is all about experience , '' he says . so , the street-style campaign features a 15-meter-long `` kors walkbox '' , in which the 55-square-meter led screen shows models cat walking against the backdrop of iconic world landmarks in various cities . this also marks the brand 's first campaign in china since it named actress yang mi as its global ambassador on sept. . ",
        "at the event , the 31-year-old beijing native , in an all-black dress , joined greek princess maria olympia and supermodel ella richards , the granddaughter of rolling stones guitarist keith richards . speaking about why he picked yang for the campaign , he says : `` it 's not about nationality . yang mi for me is feminine , sophisticated , and youthful at the same time . '' meanwhile , the brand 's latest financial reports show that by september , in its second quarter , its sales in the asian market , including china , has jumped by an astonishing 30.4 percent year on year to $ 124 million . ",
        "commenting on the results , he says : `` we do n't talk numbers . but i will say that we have lots of customers who love her sense of style , chinese customers and global . to me it 's not china versus the states or europe . it 's the world . i think she represents a modern , feminine , successful , globe-trotting woman . '' separately , kors says that the brand in china now has a very diversified clientele ranging from teenagers to 60-year-old women . `` chinese consumers who buy michael kors are not fashion victims . ",
        "they are too busy to be victimized , '' he adds . he said that the relationship between customers and designers is like playing tennis , with the two parties inspiring each other , while a good designer 's job is to understand what customers want before they know it . xujunqian@chinadaily . com . cn .
