        "on friday , an entrepreneur named andy coravos tweeted a screenshot of an article claiming that instagram doctors its feed of likes to keep users more engaged . `` instagram strategically * withholds * ` likes ' from users that they believe might disengage hoping they 'll be disappointed and recheck the app ? ! harvesting painful insecurities . this is so messed up , '' she said . the tweet went viral , quickly racking up more than 5,000 retweets . for those who have become wary of social media 's affect on our lives or view social media platforms as inherently problematic , the idea that instagram was somehow withholding likes from users in order to prey on them for engagement was easy to believe . ",
        "there 's just one problem : it 's not even remotely true . the tweet was proven false almost immediately , and countless users tweeted at coravos to correct her statement . instagram 's co-founder and chief technology officer mike krieger even weighed in and replied to coravos . `` to be super clear , we do n't do this , '' he said , before giving coravos a full technical explanation on how instagram does not withhold likes . but coravos , like so many twitter users who spread false information , refused to delete her tweet . after being confronted with the fact that her original tweet was misleading , she said , `` given the new information , there should be mechanism to ` recall ' the original tweet to stop the spread . ",
        "i do n't believe in deleting tweets . you should be able to examine its history/context . newspapers have a way to make ` corrections ' ; twitter should , too , '' she said . it 's all well and good to start some high-minded debate about twitter 's product roadmap and whether tweets should have an edit button -- that conversation has been going on for years -- but theoretical discussions about edit buttons or tweet history do n't stop the spread of false information , deleting your tweet does . sending a follow up tweet or `` correction '' threaded to your original tweet is also insufficient . ",
        "no one will see , much less retweet , the reply , and the original viral tweet will continue to spread on its own . meanwhile the user who shared the false information basks in a flood of retweets and favs . for users who send out false information on twitter , there is only one way to truly correct the record and the first step is to delete their original tweet . allowing a false tweet to stand is proactively facilitating its ability to spread . twitter is a unique platform in that each tweet functions as a unique , non-editable unit of content . ",
        "every tweet exists in the vacuum of the platform and can only be shared individually . recently , twitter has taken steps to promote threads , but there 's no way to link to a complete thread as a whole or force everyone who sees a particular viral tweet to see the `` follow up '' or `` correction '' that was issued as a separate piece of content aka tweet . if a user truly wants to correct the record the best method is to screenshot the offending tweet , delete it , issue a new tweet explaining that the information was false , and attach a screenshot of the original tweet for context . ",
        "it should look like this : unfortunately , most twitter users spreading false information will never do this because they are either willfully pushing an agenda via fake news or do n't want to sacrifice their ill-gotten retweets and favs . we 've seen this with every hurricane shark tweet and piece of fake news tweeted about barack obama , hillary clinton , president donald trump , and more . anyone on twitter knows how addicting it can be to watch the fav and retweet count skyrocket on a particularly fire tweet . in a follow up to her original response explaining why she would n't take her original tweet down coravos said , `` deleting the original tweet does not solve all of the problems . ",
        "this is a system/product failure . we need a better @twitter . `` we do need a better twitter . but in the meantime , delete your tweet .   "
