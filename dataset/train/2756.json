        "major league soccer made it official on wednesday : nashville is getting an expansion team . the first of four promised mls expansion teams was announced and awarded to nashville . commissioner don garber was among the speakers at wednesday 's press conference that made the news , which been reported a couple days prior , official . `` nashville was not on our radar screen , but one of the things that we take pride in is being open to any discussion to will lead to growing the game in north america , '' garber said . while calling nashville a city in the midwest is a stretch , the tennessee team will become the third-closest team to the fire . ",
        "the two closer cities come with asterisks . minnesota is in the western conference , meaning the fire play the loons just once a year , and columbus , the fire 's biggest rival , is in danger of being relocated to austin , texas . it was n't announced when nashville will begin play in mls , although a usl expansion team will kick start things in 2018 before the team moves to mls . when nashville begins play in mls , it will join the eastern conference and could restore balance to the two conferences . los angeles fc 's entry in 2018 has brought the league to an odd number , 23 teams . ",
        "an additional expansion team is expected to be announced before the end of the year . the three candidates for that are cincinnati , sacramento and detroit . the latest reports seem to be favoring cincinnati and sacramento , although no reports have leaked any information as to which one is getting the nod . while cincinnati would be a new regional foe for the fire , sacramento would continue to leave gaps in the midwest . as more cities and teams are added to the mls map , more rivalries have been created . for all of the attention that has been paid to the trio of cascadia teams , seattle did n't have portland and vancouver to play until 2011 . ",
        "new york city fc 's addition in 2015 has made any games between nycfc and the new york red bulls one of the premier games on the schedule . two recent expansion teams in orlando and atlanta have a budding rivalry . lafc 's arrival should make any game against the la galaxy a tense affair . meanwhile , the fire-columbus rivalry has taken a back seat and could go away . while a marquee rivalry game is n't make or break for the fire , it would bring more excitement , even if only on those matchdays . cincinnati could potentially fill in for columbus if the crew leave , but that would take time . ",
        "detroit would make sense as a rival given the history of bulls-pistons and blackhawks-red wings , but that bid does n't seem to have much steam at the moment . for now , the fire and its fans wait for another geographical rival to add an extra intriguing match or two to the schedule .   "
