        "bloomberg 's reed stevenson reports on what 's behind major changes at facebook . mark zuckerberg might value his friends more than his shareholders . in a facebook post thursday , the social media giant 's chief executive officer outlined a series of shifts designed to orient users ' news feeds toward content from family and friends at the expense of material from media outlets and businesses . shares of facebook fell as much as 5.5 percent to $ 177.40 friday . one line in particular might be unsettling the company 's investor base . `` by making these changes , i expect the time people spend on facebook and some measures of engagement will go down , '' he wrote . ",
        "as zuckerberg looks to strike the right balance between the needs of shareholders , regulators and users , wall street is trying to figure out how these changes affect the interplay between the time users spend on the platform , the amount of ads they 'll see , and how much facebook will be able to charge for each one . here 's what analysts are saying about facebook 's decision to prioritize personal connections .   ",
        "stifel analyst scott devitt `` the recent narrative has shifted to social impact , which is concerning to us ... the company faces quite a challenge -- address platform issues that run counter to monetization and negatively impact short-term performance , or ignore the challenges and put the franchise at risk ... recent commentary by early facebook employees , early facebook investors and others , as well as a congressional investigation of facebook 's impact on the 2016 presidential election are cause for caution for us given our potentially na√Øve believe that socially responsible consumer companies have a long-term mandate for success that requires doing well by doing good .",
        "`` in a follow-up note , devitt then said : `` there is too much uncertainty relating to the economic impact of facebook 's pending news feed changes for us to be comfortable retaining a buy rating on the stock . we are lowering our rating to hold . `` jpmorgan analyst doug anmuth `` it is too early to know the full impact of these changes , and we are not adjusting any numbers right now , but it does create risk to facebook 's financials . mark 's post , quite deliberately we think , does not mention ads or advertising . ",
        "but it does call out posts from businesses and brands , and it 's possible these change will result in lower ad load in the news feed ... we expect near-term weakness in facebook shares . `` pivotal research group analyst brian wieser `` usage was already falling prior to this announcement , if from very high levels ... the impact of reduced ad impressions on revenue can be mitigated to some degree because a -rrb- instagram is still growing b -rrb- facebook likely has pricing power c -rrb- there are many ways to manage ad inventory , such as by focusing on higher-paying advertisers rather than lower-paying ones and d -rrb- ongoing improvements in targeting or otherwise satisfying marketer goals can mean less inventory is required to satisfy advertiser goals in many instances . ",
        "still , revenue growth deceleration seemed inevitable heading into this year even before the news . in short , company 's actions bring a headwind to growth in the near-term . `` evercore isi analyst anthony diclemente `` we 'd be buyers on the pullback . our view is that facebook is making the change from a position of strength and the move is likely a longer term positive for the quality of time spent on the platform ... we believe it is conceivable that a further reduction in available inventory simply leads to higher ad prices and revenue trajectory is mostly unaffected ... de-emphasizing news could buy a little breathing room from regulatory scrutiny . ",
        "to the extent that concerns regarding the presence of ' fake news ' may have been placing increased regulatory scrutiny on facebook , these algorithm changes could help reassure regulators that facebook is making every effort to remedy known issues . `` bank of america analyst justin post `` with the influx of public content in recent years , mr. zuckerberg indicated that the news feed has diverged somewhat from the intended focus on social connection . facebook is revising the product team goals from helping users find relevant content to helping users have more meaningful social connections . even within public content , the goal is to favor that which encourages meaningful interactions between people . ",
        "at its core , the goal appears to be realigning facebook as a social platform and less of a media/news outlet ... we expect the content shift and commentary on potential usage pressure to raise some concerns on potential revenue headwinds . while ad supply may face some added pressure in 2018 , we think an improving user experience and higher quality content could drive higher ad prices to counterbalance . `` atlantic equities analyst james cordwell `` the changes appear informed by facebook 's research that time spent on social networks interacting with friends can be positive for well-being , while passively reading articles or watching video can have the opposite effect . ",
        "it also seems likely that the problems facebook has run into in distributing news have played a part in the decision , with the company maybe also questioning the value of some of its lower quality , hard-to-monetise video watch time . indeed , if the majority of the expected engagement reduction comes from time spent watching video and reading articles , then the impact on newsfeed scroll time and associated ad volumes could be much more modest , and potentially even positive ... the implications of these changes are likely unhelpful for the stock 's multiple in the near-term , especially if it continues to make the platform more reliant on price over volume to drive growth and is viewed as diminishing the longer-term video opportunity . ",
        "`` piper jaffray analyst sam kemp `` facebook 's announced changes to news feed reflects that core facebook has strayed toward a cluttered use case that prioritized publisher content , rather than bi-directional content ... we see this as the right long-term decision for the platform and , over the near-term , doubt that this will have a material impact on revenue for two reasons : 1 -rrb- instagram 's ad performance has gained advertiser attention in the past year and , given it shares the same ads manager with facebook , is in a strong place to absorb any unallocated budget due to impression declines at facebook and 2 -rrb- the past several quarters have demonstrated that advertisers are willing to absorb higher ad prices as impression quantity compresses .",
        "`` credit suisse analyst stephen ju `` the end result in our view is that facebook is once again making the same volume versus monetization trade off which started late 4q16 . at this point facebook 's ability to offset with better ad price growth should not be a matter of debate given the results of 1q17-3q17 . and brands and businesses may now presumably have to incur increased fees for greater access to the facebook user .
