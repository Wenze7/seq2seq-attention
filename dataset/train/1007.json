        "as a distinguished alumni of michigan state university , an award i received in 2014 , i 'm appalled by the larry nassar case . i 'm heartbroken for the young women gymnasts abused by nassar , who was based at msu , and whose pleas for help went unheard by adults who might have prevented them from harm . i 'm also kind of stunned that msu 's president , lou anna simon , has not yet resigned , given the university 's association with nassar . but , then , neither has president trump , in the face of allegations that he paid off a porn actress , on top of everything else that has happened during his presidency . ",
        "nor did michigan gov. rick snyder , when members of his administration were charged in the flint water scandal . there is clearly , now , a fine art of not-resigning . it 's an exquisitely cynical reflection on what has happened to our society and our sense of moral outrage in the lightning fast media age . in the past , any of these stories might have ended with a simple conclusion : they would have stepped down . after all , harry truman had a sign on his desk that famously read , `` the buck stops here . '' ",
        "every business leader of any note will tell you that the chief executive is ultimately responsible for any nefarious activities , by the ceo or at the company , that took place while they were in charge . it 's true in other parts of society , too . as a roman catholic , i have been shaken by the priest abuse scandal , which brought down cardinals and you might argue , led to the retirement of a pope . as a sports fan , i also was in shock at the penn state university abuse story , which toppled one of the most famous coaches in college football history . ",
        "but , just a few short years after penn state , the country 's emotional temperature no longer rides as high in the face of scandal . and , given the vatican funeral that former boston cardinal bernard law received , memories apparently are fading quickly , too . one of the most talked about movies this year is `` i , tonya . '' it paints figure skater tonya harding as a victim of her own troubled circumstances , rather than someone who set out to destroy the career of her rival , nancy kerrigan , in 1994 . ",
        "this weekend , the chicago tribune posted an excerpt on its facebook page from a column that read in part , `` tonya harding is having her redemption '' which , as you might expect , set off some heated comments . harding has never slunk away in shame , and in fact , is having something of a moment at awards shows and in interviews . she might seem tone deaf to what people actually think of her , but she 's enduring , as are simon , trump and snyder . how is this possible ? i asked john baldoni , the author and noted expert on leadership , to help me understand it . ",
        "baldoni believes both trump and snyder have hung on because they are elected officials . and , barring a push for impeachment and conviction , in trump 's case , or a statewide recall campaign , in the case of snyder , they simply get to keep their jobs . they have n't resigned , because they do n't have to resign . that is n't as true , he notes , in the corporate world , because ceos are accountable to boards of directors and the shareholders who invest in their businesses . `` i will say that if trump or snyder were execs in either corporate or nonprofit organizations , they would be history , '' baldoni says . ",
        "`` perception of wrong doing would have eliminated them from credibility . sad to say standards for elected officials are much lower . '' in the case of simon , she received the support last friday of her bosses , the msu board of trustees , albeit the least-supportive support that any college president could ask for . `` through this terrible situation , the university has been perceived as tone deaf , unresponsive and insensitive to the victims . we understand the public 's faith has been shaken , '' the board said in a statement . but it concluded , `` we continue to believe president simon is the right leader for the university and she has our support . '' ",
        "simon , who i met when i received my distinguished alumni award , is an msu lifer . unlike many people who rise to become university presidents , she 's never worked anywhere else . she 's been in east lansing since arriving there to work on her doctorate in 1974 . she loves msu , knows the university inside and out , and is as cemented to the campus as the sparty statue . too , east lansing is just distant enough from the big city fray of detroit or chicago to avoid a constant spotlight . this has allowed the nassar case to get perhaps less attention than it might have received had it happened in ann arbor or evanston , even though there has been steady reporting by news outlets such as the indianapolis star and usa today for the past two years . ",
        "now , nassar 's abuse is finally getting the exposure it should have received all along , thanks to the multiple victim statements that are being read at this sentencing hearing , including a widely noted one by olympian aly raisman . and , the pressure is mounting on simon , as is the incredulity at her perseverance . still , that might not be enough to dislodge her . clearly , the msu lawyers are reading a broader public sentiment . they 're seeing that the country , in general , is n't automatically demanding that its leaders step aside when they 're treading in mire . ",
        "simon , they may be gambling , might just be able to wait this one out . that strategy may be effective , but it does n't mean it 's right . says baldoni , `` when the public acquiesces to bad behavior , they lower the standards of acceptance . hence , trump is ` normal . ' what suffers is respect for integrity and accountability . '' if he were alive in 2018 , truman might need to get a new sign . follow micheline maynard on twitter at micheline maynardaly raisman at last week 's nassar trial hearing . "
