        "salt lake city -- the u. s. supreme court has declined to hear an appeal from residents of a small utah city challenging endangered-species protections for prairie dogs , but the plaintiffs say their case alleging that their community has been overrun by the animals has made a mark as the trump administration moves to loosen the contested rules . the lawsuit was a key driver of the new federal plan that would make it easier to remove or kill prairie dogs , lawyers for the residents of the southwestern city of cedar city said monday . attorney jonathan wood said his clients were disappointed the supreme court declined to hear the case on monday , but heartened by the new plan from the u. s. fish and wildlife service allowing prairie dogs to be killed or removed from private property to public land more frequently . ",
        "`` that is solely due to the lawsuit and is a far better result for prairie dogs than the decades of conflict generated under heavy-handed federal regulation , '' wood said in an email . animal activists , though , say the administration 's proposed rollback of protections for the threatened utah prairie dogs would be a death warrant for animals when they 're found on private land . they 're considered key to the ecosystem because their burrows turn up the soil and can be used as homes by other animals . they 're also an important food source for predators . ",
        "`` i believe that any attempt to transfer more control over to local government hostile toward protection of certain threatened and endangered animals is a bad thing , and can only place more species in peril , '' harris said in an email . the utah prairie dog was listed as endangered in the 1970s when their numbers dropped to 2,000 as land was cleared to make room for farming , ranching and housing . they rebounded under federal protection , and numbered about 26,000 in spring of 2015 , according to the state tallies . the numbers have fallen somewhat since then , to about 21,000 animals , though state wildlife managers chalk that up to normal ebbs and flows .

        "the fish and wildlife service has said its plan will preserve the prairie-dog numbers while helping frustrated property owners in cedar city , about 250 miles south of salt lake city . comments are being taken on the plan through jan. . 20 . the supreme court 's decision ended the long-running federal lawsuit filed by a group calling itself people for the ethical treatment of property owners in 2013 . they won an unusual court victory when u. s. district judge dee benson struck down endangered-species act protections in 2014 , a ruling wood said was the first of its kind . ",
        "the group represented by the california-based pacific legal foundation said federal regulations protecting the creatures blocked residents from doing what they wanted with their own property . the rules forbade doing things that might affect the creatures , including shooting them or moving them or building fences , with few exceptions . they said that led to burrowing creatures moving into playgrounds , cemeteries and backyards . activists said the decision threatened to undermine the endangered species act , and an appeals court overturned it this spring . the high court declined to re-consider that decision . file - in this aug. .
