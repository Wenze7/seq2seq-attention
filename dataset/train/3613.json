",
        "the officials who were busy doing this could have been working on something that more directly benefits the impoverished people they are supposed to be helping . yet the local officials had to do it , because the groups of officials have the power to evaluate their performance . officials from different cities are arranged to evaluate the effectiveness of the poverty alleviation work of each other . the evaluation system is designed to supervise local officials , yet in practice it has caused bad results . it is urgent and necessary to replace this with third-party inspections . actually , the poor families that need help should be given the biggest say on whether the local officials have helped them enough . ",
        "all that is needed is to publicize all the contact information of higher-level supervisors , so that the poor families can conveniently complain against local officials if there is any problem . that will be much more effective than the existing evaluation system .   "
