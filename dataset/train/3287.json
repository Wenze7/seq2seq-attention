        "hedge fund mogul barry rosenstein found himself playing defense on tuesday . the jana partners founder was pressed on his very public move to get apple to become more socially responsible -- while jana is trolling for dollars for a new fund that is being set up to invest in socially responsible companies . rosenstein 's jana partners urged apple in a letter on saturday to do more to curb youth iphone addiction . even hedge fund moguls think kids are spending too much ... `` parents need to help , '' rosenstein said in a cnbc interview , adding that is it difficult to navigate the sea of existing parental control features and apps . ",
        "his remarks were delivered hours after the iphone maker announced `` new features and enhancements '' are in the works to better protect kids . the new measures are in addition to features it has had in place since 2008 , apple said . this is an `` easy fix '' for apple , rosenstein said , adding that he was `` encouraged '' by the company 's announcement . but the interview turned tense as rosenstein and his colleague charles penner found themselves defending an activist stake in a company that already claims to be doing what it is being asked to . ",
        "there are apps that may be more harmful to children , the hedgies were told . `` apple is the smartest place to start , '' penner said , adding that it is `` the gateway to these more problematic apps . '' the apple move is a new type of play for jana , which is better known for urging break-ups or mergers for the company it targets . although the new fund has yet to launch , rosenstein said he did n't want to wait to make the apple investment , believing that company could soon be hurt by `` growing societal unease '' with technology . ",
        "jana teamed up with the california state teachers ' retirement system in its apple investment . apple has formed a committee to research and promote better iphone habits . apple shares closed tuesday at $ 174.33 , down 2 cents .   "
