        "swansea are desperate for points as they look to keep their premier league status , but face a liverpool side unbeaten in 18 games and full of confidence after their stunning win over runaway leaders manchester city last weekend . the reds are looking to consolidate their place in the top four and keep breathing down the necks of second placed manchester united . here 's all you need to know before monday night 's clash : classic encounterthe two sides met on match day four of the 2013/14 premier league season , with on-fire liverpool coming up against jonjo shelvey , a man they had sold to the swans for Â£ 5m that summer . ",
        "the then 21-year-old would have a starring role in the monday night fixture for good and bad reasons . the midfielder made his mark by scoring against his former employers after just 87 seconds , the first goal liverpool had conceded that season . however , shelvey would quickly go from hero to zero as his clumsy back pass played daniel sturridge in and the reds forward snapped up the gift to equalise . shelvey then seemed to forget he had left liverpool for a second time , playing an awful pass straight to victor moses , who powered his way through and fired the visitors ahead at half-time . ",
        "swansea would nick a point though , as michu fired home from a lay-off to ensure an entertaining 2-2 draw , a result which ended liverpool 's 100 % record that season . team newsswansea are likely to go with nearly the same xi that drew with newcastle last week , with the only change being wilfred bony coming in up front for oliver mcburnie . as for liverpool , virgil van dijk is set to make his premier league debut for the reds after missing the win over man city , whilst jurgen klopp is likely to continue his rotation policy with ragnar klavan potentially coming in alongside him . ",
        "reds skipper jordan henderson could also return after being rested for the city win , with emre can possibly dropping to the bench for this one . loris karius is set to continue his run as first choice goalkeeper as the german looks to prove his worth at anfield . alberto moreno and daniel sturridge are both still out with injuries . potential swansea xi : fabianski , van der hoorn , mawson , bartley , olsson , ki , dyer , clucas , carroll , ayew , bony . potential liverpool xi : karius , alexander-arnold , van dijk , klavan , robertson , oxlade-chamberlain , wijnaldum , henderson , mane , firmino , salah . ",
        "predictionconfidence at swansea is relatively low , whilst the vibe at liverpool could n't be any better . jurgen klopp 's men are going about their business nicely and will really fancy their chances here . swansea 's defence has been awful this season , and it 's hard to see how they will cope with liverpool 's blistering offence and their high press . expect the visitors to take their unbeaten run to 19 here with a fair few goals flying in . swansea have looked lost in their games and desperately lack any offensive quality after the summer departures of fernando llorente and glyfi sigurdsson , both of whom scored in the swans shock 3-2 win at anfield 12 months ago . ",
        "prediction : swansea 1 - 3 liverpool .   "
