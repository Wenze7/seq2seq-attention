        "jian , china -- the former smuggler sits on the floor by a muted tv set , smoking cheap north korean cigarettes one after the other . his hands are rough from years of hard work . his belt is knotted to keep his pants from slipping around his pole-thin waist . the mountains of north korea , his homeland not even a mile away , fill the room 's only window . he spent nearly all his 50-some years in those mountains , sometimes earning more than $ 1,500 in just one trip along the secret trails and quiet river crossings of the china-north korea border . ",
        "he smuggled everything from tvs to clothes into north korea , a nation shaped by decades of repression and isolation . he smuggled out mushrooms , ginseng and the occasional bit of gold . `` i could bring in 10 televisions at once , the same thing for refrigerators , '' he says , smiling broadly . `` in the past , i could bring in so much stuff . `` but no more . north korea is changing , quietly but powerfully , with the rise of the young ruler kim jong un echoing even to those secret trails . ",
        "increasing international sanctions have left a handful of well-connected chinese businesses now controlling much of the trade -- legal and otherwise -- along the frontier . that 's bad news for the small-time smugglers who long dominated the border . `` it 's the smaller traders who are feeling the heat . they 're going to lay low , '' says john park , director of the korea working group at harvard 's kennedy school of government . `` but this becomes an opportunity for larger companies with north korean clients . `` in north korea , smuggling is far more than a crime . ",
        "for two decades , smugglers have secretly knitted the isolated country to the outside world , bringing in food during a brutal famine and , later on as a small consumer class began to grow , everything from chinese car parts to dvds of south korean tv shows . they ferried in tvs and ferried out families looking to escape life in the north . smuggling became a respected profession , offering thousands of poor villagers a road to the emerging middle class . the troubles of this underground community today reflect the immense role that the frontier plays in the country 's economy , and offer a window into a secret world that outsiders almost never see . ",
        "in rare detailed interviews , nearly a dozen people tied to smuggling networks , most either former smugglers or black market traders , say their world has been thrown into turmoil in the years since kim jong un came to power in late 2011 . the 870-mile border is the linchpin of north korea 's economy , with china accounting for 90 percent of its trade . while north korea has faced international trade sanctions for over a decade because of its nuclear and missile programs , china only began significantly ratcheting up enforcement over the past year , amid a surge in pyongyang weapons tests . ",
        "trade has declined amid the chinese crackdown , but analysts say a range of products , from laborers to cellphone parts , still flow across the frontier , the path smoothed by bribes and powerful politicians in both countries . as sanctions have tightened , the trade machine has simply grown more complex . when north korean coal exports were forbidden , shiploads were channeled through russia to hide their origin , u. s. officials say . when north korea 's overseas businesses faced scrutiny or closure , they opened front companies or hired chinese middlemen . when buyers objected to clothing made in north korea , factories reportedly began adding `` made in china '' labels . ",
        "goods are sometimes transferred from one ship to another at sea , investigators say , to camouflage trade with the north . as this peculiar form of globalization reverberated along the border , many longtime smugglers simply could n't keep up . `` i used to make a lot of money , '' says another ex-smuggler , a gravel-voiced chinese man in his mid-40s now working as an occasional laborer in south korea . `` but it 's not like that today . `` it 's lunchtime in ulsan , the industrial city where he has lived since leaving the border last year , but he 's sitting in a restaurant nursing both a bad hangover and a beer . ",
        "for years the smuggling process had been straightforward , he says , with north korean border units allowing him to bring his goods across in exchange for bribes . `` these guys would just let the smuggling happen . `` the man , like all those interviewed with ties to smuggling , spoke on condition of anonymity , since he was admitting to breaking numerous laws . he is chosonjok , from china 's ethnic korean community . many early smugglers were either chosonjok or chinese residents of north korea , known as hwagyo . he made his career running scrap copper into china , communicating with his north korean partners on chinese mobile phones , which are illegal in the north but work sporadically in border areas . ",
        "once a shipment was arranged , cars would be dispatched carrying tons of metal to isolated stretches of the yalu river , which marks north korea 's northeastern border with china . much of the region is deeply rural , with small mountains flanking the river and very few roads . surveillance is often light outside the handful of cities . `` do n't accommodate border trespassers , '' a sign warns in a small chinese town . even in security-obsessed north korea , where getting to the border requires a special permit , guardposts are still sometimes more than a half-kilometer apart . ",
        "there 's plenty of space for illegal work . the copper smuggler would arrange for hired north korean soldiers to haul the metal in 50-kilogram sacks to the chinese shoreline , carrying the bags through shallow water or floating them on rafts made from inflated inner tubes . cars waiting in china would then whisk the copper away . for every shipment , he would send takeout meals , bottles of beer and snacks -- especially pig 's feet -- for the soldiers . `` i 'm a kind-hearted person so i 'd bring them lots of good food , '' he growls . ",
        "on a good day , he says , he could move six tons of metal across the border , earning him upward of $ 3,600 . he could do that a few times a year . when demand dropped for copper he switched to north korean rabbit fur , which he could sell to chinese clothing manufacturers . then , about two years ago , things grew increasingly difficult . north korean border guards grew wary . rumors spread of harsh punishments : `` anyone caught would be killed . '' eventually , his partners refused to work with him . ",
        "`` they told us they were too scared to do it any longer , no matter how much we were willing to pay . `` smuggling has been part of life here for centuries , but began growing exponentially in the mid-1990s , when north korea 's economy broke down and famine savaged the country . as government control loosened amid the turmoil , desperate northerners began crossing the border into china , searching for food , work or something to trade . while the famine and the turmoil eventually eased , a quietly budding market economy held on . ",
        "as did the smugglers . `` when i was young , everyone wanted to be a soldier , a doctor or a teacher , '' says a refugee in her late 40s , a former north korean radio propagandist and black market trader now living outside seoul . `` but later on , after the famine , every child began dreaming of becoming a smuggler . `` at the house overlooking the north korean mountains , the ex-smuggler says poverty pushed him into running goods illegally . he had a government-assigned job , like nearly all north koreans , driving a truck in a small city . ",
        "but official salaries can pay as little as 1,000 north korean won -- less than $ 1 -- a month . `` it was the kind of money that would let you eat out -- once , '' he says , leaning back against the wall . he began using his employer 's truck to ferry merchandise for small traders , who would buy goods from one of the growing number of semi-underground markets , then sell them in another . `` i traveled everywhere , '' he says . `` something that was sold for 10 won here could be sold for 20 won at another place . ",
        "`` eventually he began crossing into china , buying tvs , stereos , refrigerators and clothing , then arranging for boats or rafts to ferry everything back home . in an area where the line between trading and smuggling can be almost impossible to parse , where nearly everyone pays or takes bribes , he describes his work as an `` authorized business , '' since he 'd paid officials to let him move his merchandise . `` from the outside it does n't look legitimate , but to the people on the inside , that 's just how the marketplace in the border region works , '' said park , the professor with the korea working group . ",
        "he has studied how a handful of chinese companies have come to dominate the border as trade sanctions tightened , acting as intermediaries for north korean firms and profiting from the increased risks . while u. s. law effectively forbids american trade with north korea , china has only selectively restricted commerce with the north . pyongyang also does business legally with countries from pakistan to thailand , trading in everything from textiles to seafood . the pressure on the small-time smugglers did n't come all at once . some trace it to the final years of longtime dictator kim jong il , who died in december 2011 . ",
        "others say it began under his son and successor , kim jong un . the younger kim has launched a series of purges since coming to power , ousting and sometimes executing a series of powerful officials . the domino effect of those purges , with ever-lower officials being pushed aside , eventually reached the border . `` when your business depends on bribing border officials and the officials are being changed every 9-to-12 months , then that makes things all the harder , '' said justin hastings , a university of sydney scholar who studies north korean trade networks . ",
        "the smugglers ' most recent troubles , he believes , are from chinese officials enforcing sanctions and `` cracking down in ways they had n't done before . `` in 2012 , north korean border officials began ordering smugglers to `` regulate '' their businesses , says the ex-smuggler now living in china . eventually , as the informal rules tightened , he was limited to what he could carry . his profits plummeted . `` i was only making enough money to pay for my travel expenses and my meals , '' the he says . he left for china when his business collapsed , moving in with relatives . ",
        "life was supposed to be easier on this side of the border . but he barely speaks chinese , ca n't find work and knows almost no one . `` all my friends are there in north korea , '' he says , nodding toward the mountains . his one solace is soju , a vodka-like alcohol loved in both koreas . `` i drink here at my home . one shot with each meal , every day .
