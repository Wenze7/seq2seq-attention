        "the south bay lakers end 2017 with a big win over the salt lake city stars , and they did it without vander blue , alex caruso and ivica zubac . the south bay lakers , who rank second in the g-league in 3-point percentage and field goal percentage , needed a win against the salt lake city stars to get over the hangover from the contested one-point loss to the agua caliente clippers game two nights prior . the team lost to rival ac clippers by one measly point , 118-117 , on a controversial play in the final seconds of the game . ",
        "the lakers were ahead most of the game but then the score evened up , and it stayed that way through the second half . vander blue scored 24 , ivica zubac and thomas bryant both scored 18 points . scott machado scored 13 points and showed his floor-general prowess once again . to finish out 2017 , the sb lakers took on the salt lake city stars for the 70th time in g-league history . the stars came into the game 3-19 desperate for a win . every player on the lakers roster got minutes as they out-scored the stars and were up as much as 24 points during the game . ",
        "the stars had the lead only once by two points . the fans in attendance filled the seats saturday night , and they were a loud bunch ! south bay point guard scott machado is really feeling his mojo on the court these days . he started the game with back to back to back shots , and then a third which ended up being a sweet bank shot three . then machado sent a lob to thomas for a dunk . this duo is starting to gel a bit more without alex caruso , who was assigned and moved to the los angeles lakers . ",
        "just when you thought south bay might have slowed down a bit , machado passed a bounce pass back behind him and travis wear picked it up and slammed it home . this would n't be the first time that night he brought the roof down . the second was when he faked right then decided to take to the rim with one hand . boom ! in all , six sb lakers scored in double figures , and two earned double-doubles . impressive ! travis wear topped the leaderboard with 27 points , 8 rebounds , and 3 assists . ",
        "wear made an impressive five of six of his 3-point shots . scott machado scored 21 points and earned a double-double with 11 assists adding four rebounds demarcus holland earned a double-double scoring 17 points and snatching 10 rebounds . he also notched four assists . stephaun branch logged 13 points , six rebounds and a steal on the night . ian baker got some playing minutes tonight and scored 11 points , grabbed three rebounds and dropped four dimes . thomas bryant added 10 points , eight rebounds , three assists , and a steal . here are highlights and post-game interviews with wear , machado , and head coach coby karl . ",
        "they also talk about the controversial play at the end of the loss to the ac clippers two night prior : machado and wea , r along with branch , should be looked at by nba scouts for call-ups or two-way contracts as they are really looking good on the court . they are playing with ice in the veins if you will , putting up respectable numbers . south bay veteran andr√© ingram only needed to score one point to move into sole possession of the tenth all-time scorer . ingram scored four ! he now has scored 3,583 points and needs just 46 points to move into 9th place above texas 's justin dentmon .
