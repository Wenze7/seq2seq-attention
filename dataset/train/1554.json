        "syracuse coach jim boeheim said before the season his team would be good defensively and struggle at the other end . that assessment was spot-on . with the start of atlantic coast conference play sunday night with a home game against virginia tech , the orange are putting up solid numbers on defense . syracuse ranks ninth nationally in blocks with 83 , seventh in rebounding margin , seventh in offensive rebounds , ninth in total rebounds and first in the acc in steals per game . `` our defense has been good . it has been good all year for the most part , '' boeheim said . ",
        "`` there are always some breakdowns , but overall our defense has been pretty good . we just have to ... get something going on the offensive end . `` after its win over eastern michigan on wednesday night , syracuse was tied for 242nd nationally in scoring at 72 points a game , just ahead of virginia . the orange also are hitting just 30 percent behind the arc . that leaves little margin for error when their top scorer struggles . guard tyus battle is averaging 20.1 points , third in the acc , but he 's sputtered at times and his teammates failed to pick up the slack in syracuse 's three-point overtime loss at home to st. bonaventure last week . ",
        "against the bonnies , battle shot 3 for 18 and made just 1 of 9 shots from behind the arc . against eastern michigan he could n't find his range in the first half , missing all five 3-pointers . the teams went into halftime tied before the orange rallied behind battle for a 62-47 win - he hit 6 of 9 from the floor , 3 of 4 from long range , in the second half . `` we 've lost before , '' freshman forward oshae brissett said . `` against good teams , we just know what we need to do - learn from our mistakes . ",
        "`` brissett has been a pleasant surprise , averaging a double-double , freshman forward marek dolezaj has been a sparkplug with his hustle , and junior point guard frank howard has been a catalyst , also averaging 15.2 points . howard 's 53 turnovers , though , have negated some of the positives he brings to the floor - he leads the acc with 30 steals . the orange have one problem that wo n't go away - a thin bench . the departure of graduate transfer geno thorpe has left the team with only eight scholarship players , and injuries to 6-foot-10 freshman center bourama sidibe have forced him to miss three games and parts of three others since an early-season loss to then-no . ",
        "2 kansas . boeheim hinted a medical redshirt might be an option if sidibe does n't show signs of recovering . `` we are not going to play him unless we feel that he can play , '' boeheim said . since joining the acc , syracuse has won four of five against virginia tech , though the hokies won the previous meeting between the teams last season . syracuse travels to wake forest on wednesday and is back home to face notre dame next saturday . `` we have had a lot of tough games and i think we will survive it , '' boeheim said . ",
        "`` we have to try to get through it and try to get better . the team has shown a lot of determination , a lot of grit , and they keep battling out there . `` the orange on sunday will wear a uniform patch honoring kelly seubert , boeheim 's former administrative assistant . seubert , who played an intricate role in most of the operational duties in the basketball office , died in august of cancer after 13 years on staff . the patch will remain on the uniforms for the rest of the season . boeheim and his staff will wear commemorative pins resembling the patch .
