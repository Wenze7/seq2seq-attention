        "roger federer fears that he might not be able to repeat his `` fairytale '' 2017 australian open victory this month , but the men 's singles favourite did little to dampen expectations regarding a 20th grand slam title on tuesday as he began his latest melbourne campaign with a typically dominant victory over aljaz bedene . federer 's triumph over old rival rafael nadal in the final of last year 's tournament , which came after a six-month injury lay-off , was his first in a major tournament for five years . it sparked a memorable renaissance that also included a ` sunshine double ' - victory at indian wells and miami - a record eighth wimbledon success and another defeat of nadal in shanghai that saw him move level with ivan lendl for second place on the list of open era title-winners . ",
        "he later pulled clear by winning the swiss indoors in basel . despite his advancing years , the 36-year-old went into the latest edition of the australian open as the front-runner with andy murray absent following hip surgery and the likes of nadal and novak djokovic returning from injury . he had little trouble in seeing off bedene , the former british davis cup hopeful who has now switched his international allegiance back to slovenia . federer took only 99 minutes to wrap up a confident 6-3 6-4 6-1 straight-sets victory and set up a second-round tie against jan-lennard struff of germany . ",
        "`` my dream was always to play for a long time , '' he said after that latest win , per the herald sun . `` i did n't expect to play this well and come back as the defending champion this year but i 'll take it . i 'm loving it and hopefully i can play for a little longer . `` i 'm hoping for it to go well again , i 'm just not sure it can go that well ; last year was just so good . i 'm worried it kind of wo n't be because i 'm a year older , guys are coming back again ... i ca n't control it all and last year was a fairytale . ",
        "`` day two round-upelsewhere on day two at melbourne park , djokovic marked his return to action with a straightforward defeat of donald young and maria sharapova powered past tatjana maria as simona halep defeated wildcard destanee aiava . british number one johanna konta will face bernarda pera next after confidently seeing off madison brengle , but heather watson fell at the first hurdle with defeat to kazakh yulia putintseva . anna-lena friedsam proved no match for compatriot and 2016 winner angelique kerber , while karolina pliskova beat veronica cepede royg , garbine muguruza eased any lingering fitness fears by vanquishing jessika ponchet and carolina garcia knocked out carina witthoeft .

        "alexander zverev and stan wawrinka eliminated thomas fabbiano and ricardas berankis respectively and there were also wins for dominic thiem , david goffin , tomas berdych , fabio fognini , richard gasquet and sam querrey . in the women 's singles eugenie bouchard , elena vesnina , madison keys , agnieszka radwanska , mirjana lucic-baroni and barbora strycova all reached the second round . in terms of shocks , milos raonic was ousted by lukas lacko , fernando verdasco toppled roberto bautista agut and women 's 11th seed kristina mladenovic suffered her 15th successive loss at the hands of romania 's ana bogdan .
