        "rexshutterstock at the 12th annual academy awards , the civil war romantic drama `` gone with the wind '' won an record eight oscars from of its 13 nominations . it broke the record for number of wins set by frank capra ` s `` it happened one night '' five years earlier , when it claimed five academy awards . setting seven oscars as the benchmark for our definition of a sweep , these were fairly common occurrences at the academy awards in the ensuing decades of the 20th century . there were two in the 1940s : 1944 's `` going my way '' and 1946 's `` the best years of our lives '' . ",
        "a staggering five films did this in the 1950s : 1953 's `` from here to eternity '' ; 1954 's `` on the waterfront '' ; 1957 's `` the bridge on the river kwai '' ; 1958 's `` gigi '' , which set a new oscar record for most wins . ; and 1959 's `` ben-hur '' , which broke it . sweep fever continued sporadically in the following two decades . there were three in the 1960s : 1961 's `` west side story '' and 1962 's `` lawrence of arabia '' 1964 's `` my fair lady , '' . ",
        "and three in the 1970s : 1970 's `` patton '' and 1973 's `` the sting '' both number best picture among their wins while 1972 's `` cabaret '' was the belle of the oscar ball until it lost the final award to `` the godfather . '' the 1980s and 1990s each had four sweeps : 1982 's `` gandhi '' ; 1984 's `` amadeus '' ; and 1985 's `` out of africa , '' 1987 's `` the last emperor '' ; 1990 's `` dances with wolves '' ; 1993 's `` schindler 's list '' ; 1996 's `` the english patient '' ; and 1997 's `` titanic '' , which equaled the record set by `` ben-hur . '' ",
        "but since the turn of the century , only two films have accomplished the feat : 2003 's `` the lord of the rings : the return of the king '' , which matched the record of `` ben-hur '' and `` titanic '' ; and 2008 's `` slumdog millionaire '' . a few other films have come close , like 2002 's `` chicago '' and 2009 's `` the hurt locker '' . 2013 's `` gravity '' swept the technical categories but lost best picture to `` 12 years a slave , '' which went three for nine . ",
        "as for many of the other recent best picture winners , their awards total has been shockingly low . look at 2005 's `` crash '' ; 2012 's `` argo '' ; 2015 's `` spotlight '' ; and 2016 's `` moonlight '' . others have n't done much better such as 2001 's `` a beautiful mind '' ; 2004 's `` million dollar baby , '' ; 2006 's `` the departed , '' ; 2007 's `` no country for old men '' ; and 2010 's `` the king 's speech '' it 's good to be king -- but it 's even better when the castle is filled with gold . ",
        "at the fifth annual academy awards , `` grand hotel '' received the academy award for best picture -- and nothing else . if the days of the oscar sweep are truly over , it wo n't be long before we see another film pull a `` grand hotel '' -- and check out of the greatest awards show on earth with a single statuette . be sure to make your oscar nomination predictions so that hollywood studio executives can see how their films are faring in our academy awards odds . do n't be afraid to jump in now since you can keep changing your predictions until just before nominees are announced on january 23 .
