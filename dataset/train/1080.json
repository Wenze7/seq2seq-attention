        "southampton boss mauricio pellegrino has praised the resilience of his players following the saints 1-1 draw with bournemouth . the cherries went ahead through ryan fraser shortly before half-time but charlie austin scored his third goal in two games after 61 minutes to help secure a point for his club . `` i was encouraged with our good reaction , '' pellegrino told sky sports . `` sometimes the opponents controlled the situation , sometimes we controlled things better than them . `` that is football , that is our job . sometimes we have to control the ball to be more comfortable . ",
        "they pressed well impressively at the beginning but our reaction was positive . `` it was a tight game but both teams wanted to win the game with their ideas . for the ninth time we made a mistake at this level that we can not concede . but in the second half we were much better and we equalised . `` but until the end the game was up and down all the time with both teams showing they want to win . it 's one point , we obviously wanted three , but we could n't get them . '' "
