        "i really hate confrontation of any kind . i like to keep things easy breezy as much as humanly possible . but there are some times when having the hard or awkward conversation is something that just has to be done . maybe it 's confronting a family member about their opinions at dinner or telling your roommate her messy boyfriend needs to either leave or start paying some freaking rent . whatever the case may be , there are times when you just have to have suck it up and talk it out . the same is true about topics to talk about with your partner . ",
        "here 's the thing : there are some conversations that may be really difficult to have with them early on . however , over time , they tend to become easier to have as the dynamic between you evolves . in some ways , what you do and do n't comfortably discuss with them acts as a sign about where you are in the relationship . so if you are unsure if you 're ready to take your casual relationship to the next level and become exclusive , there are five topics you should definitely feel open to talking with your partner about . ",
        "not only will your comfort level tell you where you heart and mind are currently , but these are also the things you really need to know about someone before you get serious to tell if you actually have a viable future with them . here are the things you need to be comfortable talking to your partner about before you lock it down . 1 . personal life goals before you can even consider having a future with someone , you have to have an idea of what the future looks like to someone . you also need to feel comfortable describing what shape you see your life taking and if your visions for the future are compatible . ",
        "for instance , maybe you want to go spend a couple of years touring the world abroad , while they want to focus on their career and buy a home in the next five years . those two visions are not a great match and definitely something you need to talk about before things get serious . 2 . each of your finances this one , my friend , is a biggie ! when things are just starting out and you 're in the throes of romance , you may underestimate the role that finances will have on your future . ",
        "they are the source of most relationship friction , and you need to make sure you two have the same philosophy about how to handle your finances . 3 . your families -- both present and future when you become exclusive , there is some implied expectation that the relationship could potentially go the distance . if that 's the case , then suddenly , you are n't just `` you , '' but you 're also whoever is a part of your package -- in other words , your families . you need to be able to talk to each other about the dynamic you have with each of your families and how to best negotiate those waters . ",
        "even more importantly , you need to be able to discuss what kind of family you might want to have of your own some day and make sure that those plans align as well . 4 . your shared sex life i mean , come on , you have to be able to talk about sex if you 're going to get serious with someone . great sex comes as a direct result of great communication . you should feel comfortable talking with each other about what you do and do n't like and maybe even some fun things you 'd like to give a whirl in the future . ",
        "5 . expectations in the relationship talking about your expectations can be really hard if you 're someone who typically does n't feel comfortable making demands . but if you want the relationship to have a fighting chance , you have to feel safe enough in it to be able to communicate all your wants and needs to each other . does that seem scary ? i promise it 's not so bad . however , if there are any topics here that you just do n't think you 're ready to talk about , that 's ok . it just means it 's time to slow down and let your relationship grow at its own pace .
