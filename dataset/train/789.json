",
        "someone ... please help . do n't say water . or tylenol . or iron . or magnesium . i need witchcraft . '' her followers responded in their thousands with recommendations ranging from lavender and rosemary essential oils , espresso coffee along with tylenol , or even more bizarrely a mcdonald 's egg mcmuffin with a small coffee , advised one follower . the 32-year-old lip sync battle co-host , who shares daughter luna , 20 months , with her musician husband john legend , announced their pregnancy on instagram in november , with a cute video featuring the couple 's daughter .

        "`` luna , what 's in here ? '' the mother-to-be can be heard asking , referring to her stomach , prompting little luna to reply , `` baby ! '' `` it 's john 's ! '' chrissy captioned the clip . chrissy previously revealed she was going to be implanted with a frozen embryo as part of their in vitro fertilization treatment to expand their family . the last time she did this , the couple ended up with luna , and she hoped the third time would be a charm too . `` the first little girl did n't work , and then the second is luna , '' she explained to instyle magazine . ",
        "the pregnancy resulted from the third and final embryo from a batch of 20 eggs they had previously had frozen .   "
