        "-- iron ore has rallied back into a bull market . prices are surging as china 's crackdown on steel output this winter runs down inventories , helping mills ' profitability and stoking demand for high-grade ore even as investors discount signs of ample supply . spot ore with 62 percent iron content jumped 3.7 percent to $ 72.68 a metric ton , the highest since sept. . 14 , according to metal bulletin ltd. . that 's more than 20 percent up from the low hit in late october , meeting the common bull-market definition . earlier , on monday , futures in asia rallied , with the sgx asiaclear prices rising 2.9 percent to $ 71.29 a ton . ",
        "iron ore 's gains -- which will aid miners including rio tinto group , bhp billiton ltd. . and vale sa -- are buttressed by china 's unprecedented push to rein in steel output this winter to cut pollution . while that initiative may result in less steel being made in the world 's top producer , lowering overall ore demand for several months , it 's also supercharged prices as inventories collapse . citigroup inc. . has singled out iron ore 's bullish prospects in the first quarter of 2018 , raising price forecasts for both next year as well as for 2019 . ",
        "`` the rally is expected to be driven by a further tightening of the chinese steel market , chinese steel mills ' active restocking of high-grade iron ore , seasonally weak seaborne supply , and a recognition that iron ore supply growth passes its peak during the first quarter of 2018 , '' citi said in a report that laid out the bank 's views on commodities for the coming year . as china 's crackdown on mills gathers pace , holdings of reinforcement bar fell 9.4 percent last week to the lowest level in data that stretches back to 2010 . ",
        "at the same time , spot rebar prices have rallied to a multi-year high , and futures in china advanced again on monday . those trends are aiding mills ' profitability in the country that accounts for half of worldwide steel production . ` strong margins ' `` buoyed by such strong margins , mills have gone on to restock in earnest , which has played a part in pushing prices up as a result , '' said hui heng tan , an analyst at marex spectron . still , there 's plenty of ore around . among the signals , port holdings in china are at an all-time high and are large enough to cover more than a month 's worth of imports . ",
        "elsewhere , exports from brazil totaled 34.2 million tons in november , a record for that month , and up almost 9 percent from a year ago . miners ' shares rose on monday . in london , rio -- which announced a new chairman -- added as much as 2.3 percent to 35.84 pounds . earlier in sydney trading , bhp gained 1.6 percent and fortescue metals group ltd. . added 1.5 percent . the three are australia 's largest shippers . china 's drive to clean up its environment , especially the quality of the air , has prompted increased demand for higher-grade ore , exploding the difference in prices between purer and less-pure material . ",
        "the better quality material , especially 65 percent content , causes less pollution and is more efficient . rio chief executive officer jean-sebastien jacques told investors on monday that the shift in china 's steel sector toward higher-quality , imported ore looks set to endure as mills try to raise productivity . the wider discounts applied to lower-quality products are being sustained and `` there 's more and more evidence that this discount or spread is here to stay , '' jacques said . -- with assistance from david stringer to contact the reporters on this story : jake lloyd-smith in singapore at jlloydsmith@bloomberg .
