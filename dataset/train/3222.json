        "the fed said it would continue to monitor inflation and , should pressures ` build unduly ' it could hike interest rates faster increases than expected - Â© ian dagnall / alamy stock photous central bank policymakers were unsure over the economic impact of president donald trump 's tax reforms , minutes from the december meeting showed , though `` gradual '' interest rate rises look set to continue . at the meeting on dec 12 and 13 , which took place before mr trump 's tax reforms came into law , many of the federal reserve officials expected `` proposed cuts in personal taxes to provide some boost to consumer spending '' and a `` modest boost '' to capital spending . ",
        "some officials said lower personal tax rates could also increase labour supply in the us , though the fed said this was `` quite uncertain '' . however , `` a number of participants expressed uncertainty about the magnitude of the effects of tax reform on consumer spending '' as well as on capital spending , it said . the federal reserve added that some business contacts and respondents to surveys suggested firms were cautious about expanding capital spending in light of the proposed tax changes . the reforms , which were signed into law on dec 22 , include a cut to the corporation tax rate from 35pc to 21pc and a lowering of the income tax rate for most earnings brackets . ",
        "the comments were made in documents released from the last fed meeting , at which the interest rate was hiked for the fifth time since the 2008 financial crisis , to 1.5 pc , and included signs that further interest rate rises this year look likely . most participants at the meeting voiced their support for `` continuing a gradual approach to raising the target range '' for the benchmark policy rate , though the fed said it would continue to monitor inflation and , should pressures `` build unduly '' this could result in faster increases than expected . ",
        "policymakers currently anticipate another three hikes this year , two in 2019 and two in 2020 , taking the federal funds rate to just above 3pc . rabobank senior us strategist philip marey said : `` all 'n all , the the federal open markets committee appears to be losing cohesion as the end of chair yellen 's term comes in sight . `` conflicting views on inflation and the appropriate amount of rate hikes , as well as doubts about the current monetary policy framework , will be a challenge for powell when he takes over after the january 30-31 meeting of the fomc .
