        "at times i 've felt not believing in the existence of a high power despite leading a life of comfort in excellent health is extremely selfish on my part . maybe it is . then i watch the news . there is so much pain and suffering all over the world . countless innocents dying every single day for no fault of their own . children writhing in agony . people with nowhere to go begging for mercy . war tearing families apart . homes that once echoed with laughter turning into ashes and dust . what did they do to deserve this ? ",
        "since time immemorial , suffering has gripped more of us than we care to acknowledge . centuries ago , it was ailments like the plague . now , it is war driven by greed , sustained by insatiable egos of spoiled pricks in positions of power they do n't fucking deserve . i read about the conflicts in syria , palestine , iraq , yemen ; the exodus of the rohingyas ... i see only glimpses of the desolation these people have grown used to , and i 'm haunted . i feel ashamed that a few of us get to be oblivious to all of this , while they live lives worse than our worst nightmares . ",
        "if there was god , if there was a fucking plan , there would be some degree of mercy for those poor souls ; there would be some relief . but no . when the clutches of war loosen on a fortunate few , more take their places . it never ends . at least little children would be spared . i remember seeing a photo of a five-year-old from aleppo , omran daqneesh , sitting in an ambulance like a living corpse following an airstrike that killed five other children . i could tell by the look on his face , half-caked with blood , that he had been through enough . ",
        "he survived , but what of the millions that did n't ? some days , it weighs down on me so heavily that i cry . what if i was next ? nobody would give a flying fuck about it . god , defined by any religion on earth , is nothing more than an egomaniac who will condemn you to hell if you do n't stroke their ego . it does n't matter how you lived your life ; if you did n't kneel , you 're going to hell . so a supreme , all-knowing , all-powerful being expects you to believe in them while not seeing anything but pain and suffering all around you on a daily basis ? ",
        "what kind of sick joke is this ? why should i count my blessings when others are scavenging for their loved ones beneath the rubble ? so god , if you really do exist , do just one thing : rid the world of suffering . for one day at least . if and when that happens , i 'll let you into my heart . i 'll spend the rest of my days repenting for ever having doubted you .
