        "spurs coach gregg popovich discussed in detail before a recent game in los angeles what the club looks for when evaluating potential draft picks . `` you are looking for qualities in an individual , and those qualities usually will tell you that at some point that person will fit into your system , '' he said . `` so your intel work and your background work is really important to find out what kind of team situations they have been in , whether they have respected their teammates , felt responsible to their teammates , responsible to their coaches , whether they have gotten over themselves , whether they have senses of humor . ",
        "`` all those things are important in finding out if they can deal with what you do in the nba . '' when studying derrick white before last year 's draft , the spurs put nothing but check marks next to each one of those traits outlined by popovich . the colorado-ex also had plenty of people to vouch for him . `` he comes from a great family , '' said white 's longtime trainer , marcus mason . `` his parents are second to none . one thing about them , they allowed his coaches to coach him . ",
        "he is very coachable . '' in other words , his family is far removed from the attention-seeking lavar ball , who recently created a firestorm around the nba by saying coach luke walton had lost the lakers . los angeles , of course , includes lonzo ball , a potential franchise point guard who , like white , is in his first year . the lakers spent the no . 2 pick in the draft on ball , while the spurs selected white 29th overall . while ball averages around 10 points and seven assists in 33 minutes for los angeles , white has played sparingly for the spurs because they view him as a project . ",
        "so he spends much of his time in the g league while exhibiting a great attitude in his firm belief that no club develops young players like the spurs . `` that 's the great thing , '' white said . `` a lot of people here have developed with the program . you just have to trust it . '' so he dutifully drives himself back and forth between san antonio and austin to play valuable minutes for the spurs ' developmental team . `` it 's kind of weird not knowing where you are going to be , '' white said . ",
        "`` things change like every day . i 'm just trying to enjoy the whole process , and wherever i 'm at , make the most of it . '' he certainly did that in l. a. , scoring four points and hitting his first career 3-pointer in seven solid minutes of work . he was one of the rare spurs in the 93-81 loss who finished with a positive plus/minus rating . but white knows such stints with the spurs will be rare when the club finally gets everybody healthy . still there are worse things in life than playing in austin . ",
        "`` it 's pretty nice , '' he said . `` there are a lot of things in austin that are not in san antonio . i try different restaurants . it 's been cool . i 'm just trying to enjoy it . they put me in a nice hotel , so it 's not too bad . '' the biggest challenge for white has been trying to mesh with players he does n't work with regularly . `` i know them pretty well now , but at first you just meet them for the first time and it 's like a pick-up game , weird , '' he said . ",
        "`` but the guys have been pretty good up there in welcoming me and they are all great guys who play the right way , so it 's easy . '' white said on the recent west coast trip that he tries his best not to pay attention to other members of his rookie class . that single-minded approach has served him well . `` you can see what others are doing and the season they are having , '' white said . `` but it 's different for every scenario and situation , so you never know what it would be like if i were in a different team . ",
        "i try not to focus too much on that . '' instead he pays attention to the journey of fellow youngsters like guard dejounte murray , who saw plenty of time in the g league as a rookie last season . the progress of murray , who was also the 29th overall pick , was on full display at the staples center . he was one of the few bright spots in the game for the spurs , starting in place of the injured tony parker and finishing with 14 points on 7-of-14 shooting and 11 rebounds for his third double-double of the season . ",
        "in 26 minutes , murray also contributed five assists , three steals and one block . he drew praise afterward from spurs center pau gasol . `` he 's starting to take advantage of his opportunities to play , and he 's got good qualities , '' gasol said . `` he 's athletic . he 's got size . he 's aggressive on both ends of the floor . obviously , he has a lot of growing up to do , but he 's playing really well . '' the spurs hope the same will be said eventually of white . ",
        "`` derrick has n't had as much yet , but he 's using austin effectively , '' spurs general manager r. c. buford said . given white 's limited minutes , popovich declined to provide an in-depth assessment . `` he is a good kid , '' the coach said . `` he 's a young kid . he 's got a good future . '' it 's a safe bet popovich is right about that , especially if white continues to diligently follow the road map laid out for him , even if it includes frequent stops in austin . ",
