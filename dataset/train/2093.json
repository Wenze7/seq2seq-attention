        "neil warnock has revealed that cardiff city will be financially ` punished ' if they do n't play liverpool loan star marko grujic . the serbian midfielder joined the bluebirds from the premier league side yesterday , with jurgen klopp wanting the player to go somewhere he will play . despite the penalty clauses that cardiff could face for not using grujic , the liverpool echo report that warnock has no problems with how the deal is structured . `` jurgen wants him to play games and i think some other clubs have so many midfield players that he probably would n't get many games . ",
        "we have n't had to give assurances , but we get financially ` punished ' if we do n't . '' `` but that 's quite acceptable and , to be honest , a good deal or both parties , because i want to play him , i 'm not signing him to make the numbers up . he 's a good lad , and a good player . '' the 21-year old will be hoping to get some regular football under his belt in order to make the serbia squad for the world cup in russia in the summer and has gone straight into the squad for the game at sheffield wednesday tomorrow . ",
        "the verdictthis is a very interesting clause , where liverpool clearly benefit , and you could argue it influences warnock 's team selection which is n't right . of course , if everything goes well then it wo n't be an issue . should he perform to the standard we know he can then grujic would be a massive benefit to cardiff and could help them win promotion . obviously , if he does n't settle and consistently keeps his place it could upset the atmosphere in the dressing room which has been key to the bluebirds success . thoughts , cardiff fans ?
