        "say you 're on the sofa , scrolling on your phone , looking up at the tv every now and then when a commercial really catches your eye . it 's an express commercial where you do n't shop very often but the model looks extremely familiar . you put your phone down , take a closer look and it 's steph curry . the golden state warrior 's mvp steph curry . an athlete on a clothing commercial ? you never would have taken a second glance if that was n't steph curry rocking a suit that now all the sudden looks appealing . ",
        "you would never guess that an nba superstar who is always on the court would model express men , degree deodorant or advertise an insurance company such as state farm . now take a look at steph curry 's instagram . it 's engaging . quality . up to date . positive . team and family oriented . and companies pick up on that . that 's why companies decide to link up with athletes such as curry to create endorsement deals that benefit both parties ... and not to mention , athletes earn over millions of dollars from off court deals through these endorsements . ",
        "benefits of endorsementsadditional pay off court , higher reach among different audiences , better reputation as an athlete that engages with his community , collaborating with big companies , leads to other endorsements etc. . the benefits of endorsement deals are endless . but to get those endorsements , work is required - on the athlete 's social media that is . high marketability players vs low marketability playerscomparing the difference in players with low marketability versus high marketability is distinct . athletes who are destined to have endorsement deals if they do n't already have a copious amount of followers and likes , their social media @ name as their actual name , post high quality , positive content regularly , and engage with their audience . ",
        "how cool would it be to watch nick young , for example , subtweet you ? you would tell everyone you know about it and they would more than likely go follow him . hints , engaging with your followers . endorsements increase multiple revenuesathletes are known to be promoted on and off the field so why not use this to one 's advantage ! let 's go back to steph curry for example . he promotes under armour . under armour already being a multi millionaire company , increases their sales whenever steph curry wears and promotes their brand , both on and off the court all while curry 's revenue and even the nba warriors ' merch increase also . ",
        "when is your next endorsement going to happen ? take our advice , companies want their brand to be represented with a respected and dedicated athlete who also has a great presence on social media because that makes them more known and more money while it does the same for the athlete . it 's a win win situation . and while it 's hard to play on the court and keep up with social media , that 's what companies such as n2 are for . throw us the ball and we 'll help your shoot .
