        "there is a dark side to finding your passion . it means being vulnerable to everything in your life , whether its relationships , fears , unknowns , fear-of-the-unknown , it takes strength . strength used to be measure in one 's ability to confront the wilds of nature . our ancestors came across deadly animals , venomous snakes , desert heats , crossing thunderous plains to settle in lands that were once unknown to create lives , families , friends and communities . through agriculture , community and generations of story tellers , creators began to write , understand , and communicate through artistic vision . ",
        "whether they were mapping directions , painting on walls , or dancing with the fires at waters of the earth . after thousands of years of humanity , and millions of years of evolution we have become supremely intelligent , creative , and understanding of our consciousness . back to today , we wake up and find ourselves dragging along for the next cup of coffee . patiently working for our next pay check , raise , house , or whatever it may be . what i 've been learning is that passion takes the perfect balance of pushing forward and falling back . ",
        "to me that means pushing forward everyday to find creative inspiration , live positively , and step closer to our beings . by falling back i mean letting go of the circumstances we face , depressions , lost feelings , mundane realities , and understanding that creativity comes in waves much like all other forms on this plain . i have been learning to let go of my circumstances and come to terms with being a creative ; late nights , early mornings and some days of no productivity whatsoever . this is all part of the game and takes the courage to move forward , no matter what the day brings ! ",
        "keep pushing . let it push you .   "
