        "the north koreans are coming , a surprising development that adds a bit of intrigue to the winter olympics . the russians are coming , too , and probably in greater numbers than most suspected in the wake of an official ban for running a doping scheme that made a mockery out of the last games in sochi . no , they wo n't wear russian uniforms , and the country 's medal count wo n't be tallied on the big board in pyeongchang . there will be no playing of the russian national anthem should they win gold medals , which they surely will . ",
        "yes , the russians will be in south korea , despite an official ban of the country from the olympics . the only real question now is how many cheaters will be among them . forty-two of the 43 russian athletes given lifetime olympic bans for doping at the 2014 winter games have appealed to the court of arbitration for sport , hoping still to be allowed to compete at next month 's olympics . their appeals have been fast-tracked , with the cases to be heard beginning jan. . 22 with verdicts issued by jan. . 31 . among them is speed skater olga fatkulina , who just last weekend won gold in the women 's team sprint at the european championships . ",
        "another banned skater , alexander rumyantsev , won two silver medals in the competition held in kolomna , russia . both were part of the russian team in sochi that dominated the medal counts for all the wrong reasons . russians won 33 medals in all , a number that has officially now been reduced to 20 after olympic officials stripped many medal winners for their participation in the doping scheme . that both are still competing in major competitions -- and could conceivably still compete in pyeongchang -- is yet another reminder of the difficulties of eliminating a drug culture that has long been pervasive in international sports . ",
        "the russian ban is not really a ban at all , no matter how the court of arbitration for sport rules on the banned athletes . russia already won a concession to have its athletes referred to as `` olympic athlete from russia , '' or `` oar '' and you can be sure the russian medals will be tallied , whether officially or not . the head of russia 's olympic committee last month said there could be 200 russians competing in south korea , not that far off from the 232 that competed for the home country in the 2014 olympics in sochi . ",
        "they may not hear their anthem or see their flag , but they 're still competing for their country . and they will win enough medals to make their presence known . that 's a problem , because the russians have already demonstrated that they will do anything they can to win medals . they won so many of them in sochi that they led the medal count , thanks in part to an elaborate state sponsored system of rigging drug tests in the sochi anti-doping laboratory . whatever russian athletes do in pyeongchang will be suspect , no matter what uniform they 're wearing . ",
        "and that does a disservice to the athletes competing against them , who will have to wonder if they are on a level playing field . the viewing public also has a right to be suspicious . the winter olympics are the ultimate showcase for ice and snow sports , but viewers might start tuning out if they believe the competitions themselves are too flawed to be fair . the good news for south korean organizers is there will be another storyline to distract from the russian scandal . that will be the inclusion of a few north korean athletes in a rare rapprochement between the two countries . ",
        "unlike the russians , the north koreans wo n't win any medals . figure skating team ryom tae ok and kim ju sik are the only athletes who have qualified for the games from their country , though a few others could be invited as a goodwill measure by the international olympic committee . bringing the two koreas together , even if it is only for show , is a good thing . there 's a lot at stake on the korean peninsula that goes far beyond sports , even at highest level of the olympics . the north koreans should be there , even if just a few athletes actually get to cross the border . ",
        "the russians , meanwhile , should have just been told to stay home . ____ tim dahlberg is a national sports columnist for the associated press . write to him at tdahlberg@ap . org or .   "
