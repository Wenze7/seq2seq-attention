        "diversity makes your team stronger -- yet it can also present its own set of challenges . generational diversity is especially difficult to manage . while there are limitations to the sweeping statements and broad inferences to be made about boomers , gen xers , etc. , the simple truth is that people from different generations can bring different motivators and different assumptions to the workplace . and as a leader , you have to juggle all of those things , all while keeping your entire team on the same page , aligned with the same sense of mission .
