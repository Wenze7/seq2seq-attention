        "just over a week after a sting attempt on the washington post apparently tied to project veritas spectacularly backfired , project veritas president james o'keefe was honored as a `` hero '' by the conservative group united for purpose . o'keefe accepted the `` impact '' award from united for purpose 's president , ginni thomas , who is married to supreme court justice clarence thomas . `` proud to receive the impact award from ginni thomas on behalf of the @project_veritas team , '' o'keefe wrote in an instagram caption documenting the ceremony , which took place at the trump international hotel in washington , d. c . ",
        "according to united for purpose , recipients of the award must demonstrate `` broad impact , '' show `` tenacity , courage and perseverance even under hostile attacks , '' or be `` an asset to the whole liberty movement , '' among other criteria . project veritas is a conservative organization that claims its mission is to expose biases in the mainstream media by going undercover . it has an impressive record of failed stings , apparently including a recent attempt to discredit the post 's groundbreaking reporting on republican senate candidate roy moore and his alleged sexual harassment of teenage girls when he was in his 30s . ",
        "through standard background checks , the post uncovered that a woman claiming to be another moore accuser was likely affiliated with o'keefe 's group and was seen walking into project veritas ' offices . she approached post reporters as part of an organized attempt to trick the paper into publishing a false story so it would cast doubt on the accounts of other women who say moore victimized them , the post reported . `` the intent by project veritas clearly was to publicize the conversation if we fell for the trap , '' post executive editor martin baron said last week . ",
        "`` because of our customary journalistic rigor , we were n't fooled . '' o'keefe refused to comment when reporters asked about his group 's ties to the failed sting attempt .   "
