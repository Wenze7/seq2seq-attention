        "the only openly gay prince in india -- where same sex relations are illegal -- is welcoming lesbians , gays , transgender people and others shunned for their sexuality or gender into his palace . prince manvendra singh gohil , heir apparent to the throne of rajpipla in western gujarat state , said it was particularly hard to come out in small-town india , where traditional values hold sway and heterosexual relations are the norm . `` people still face a lot of pressure from their families when they come out , being forced to marry , or thrown out of their homes . ",
        "they often have nowhere to go , no means to support themselves , '' he told the thomson reuters foundation . so the prince , 52 , is building a centre for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people on the grounds of his ancestral palace . `` i am not going to have children , so i thought , why not use this space for a good purpose ? '' gohil said , adding that he will offer rooms , a medical facility and training in english and vocational skills to help people find jobs . gohil came out to his family more than a decade ago , prompting his mother to take out a newspaper advertisement disowning him . ",
        "erstwhile royalty in india are still in the spotlight , many holding positions in the government . after coming out , gohil set up the lakshya trust , a charity for lgbt people in his conservative home state , and became a champion for gay rights . he has made numerous international appearances , including on the oprah winfrey show . indian man says he was forced to marry woman at gunpoint after being kidnappedhe is a vocal critic of india 's colonial-era law that criminalises consensual sexual relations between same sex adults . earlier this week , the country 's top court said it would reconsider its 2013 decision to uphold the law . ",
        "`` lifting the law will encourage more people to come out and live their lives freely . but it may also mean more people in need of support , '' gohil said . gohil said he is renovating and extending his palace , built in 1927 , on the 15-acre site , installing solar panels for power , and reserving some land for organic farming . novel dissects the lives of india 's bohemian poet laureatesan online crowdfunding campaign and donations are financing the centre , which will be managed by his charity , he said . gohil 's high profile has helped the lgbt community in india enormously , said harish iyer , a gay rights activist who hosts a radio show dedicated to lgbt issues . ",
        "`` for him to be one of us , the stakes are even higher , so providing this space is a great gesture , '' he said . `` we are lucky to have many lgbt-friendly spaces in cities like mumbai and delhi . but in smaller towns , there are not so many places , and that is where they are most needed .
