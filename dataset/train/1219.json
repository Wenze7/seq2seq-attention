        "jason pierre-paul was in the giants locker room friday , putting his watch on his left wrist using his mangled right hand . it 's easy to forget what the giants defensive end has had to overcome just to play football until you see the visual evidence . the damage from a july 4 , 2015 , fireworks explosion will be with him for the rest of his life . football wo n't . perhaps that 's why even with the giants in the midst of perhaps the worst season in franchise history , he is looking forward to boarding the airplane for arizona on saturday and playing the cardinals on sunday . ",
        "he does not take a single game for granted anymore , and it 's why he 's treating a broken bone in his damaged hand like it is a hang nail . `` it 's very minor , '' pierre-paul said of the previously undisclosed injury suffered last week against the eagles . `` ai n't no sympathy over here . i 'm going to go out and play a game and i 'm going to play 110 percent . so it better be ready . '' pierre-paul lost most of his right thumb , all of his right index finger and the top of his middle finger in the accident . ",
        "after wearing a protective glove last year and most of this year , he went back to the wearing a club against the eagles . `` it 's not going affect my play at all , '' he said . `` with it or without it , i 'm going to be the same person . i can protect myself . i 'll be out there running this week . i 'm very excited to play football . '' he knows the feeling of thinking his career is over . that kind of fear sticks with you . that 's why 2-12 is just a number and sunday is another opportunity to do what he was born to do -- chase quarterbacks . ",
        "there 's also another reason he practices and plays through pain . it 's the way he was taught . pierre-paul was part of the giants ' last super bowl team in 2011 . it was just his second year in the nfl , a year in which he collected 16.5 sacks and was named first-team all-pro . it 's not the accolades he remembers , but the lessons taught to him by the veterans on that team . `` i was blessed to learn from older cats like justin tuck , osi umenyiora , mathias kiwanuka , dave tollefson and even my old coach nunn and coach coughlin , '' pierre-paul said . ",
        "`` there were a lot of guys who have come through here , and i 've learned so much from them . it 's not about how the season 's going or what your record is . you 're playing with a brotherhood . that 's why you keep it going . '' the season is more enjoyable when you 're in contention for the playoffs . but it ca n't be all about the trophy . `` sometimes you just play for pride , giants pride , '' he said . `` it 's really not about us . ",
        "it 's about what has come through here . this might be one of the worst seasons ever in giants history , but we 've got to look past it and get ready for sunday and then next year . '' jason pierre-paul was back on the practice field friday , his ... pierre-paul said he often hears from his former teammates . kiwanuka reached out three days ago to offer encouragement . once a giant , always a giant , in good times and bad . pierre-paul , who has 6.5 sacks this year , wants his actions to speak louder than words . ",
        "`` no matter how the season is going , '' he said , `` i want you to turn on the film and watch jason pierre-paul know and know that he 's doing everything he can to win . '' he is confident the front office will make the right hires and acquire the right talent to make the giants a contender sooner rather than later . `` i look forward to that and i know the fans look forward to it , too , '' he said . `` we just have to finish this year off strong and have fun doing it . '' ",
        "that 's rule no . 1 . football should always be fun . `` that 's why i 'm ready to run around and have fun and get some tackles and a couple of more sacks , '' he said . ai n't no sympathy here .   "
