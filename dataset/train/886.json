        "sunderland are on the verge of signing livingston striker matthew knox , according to the daily record . the 18-year-old recently enjoyed a trial period at the stadium of light , a week-long period in which he impressed in a match on wednesday and chris coleman looks set to make an offer within the next two days . knox has also spent time with barnsley but that impressive trial performance has made sunderland keen to secure the signature of the former scotland under-17 international . the hitman has also spent time with some major clubs in the past -- he has had trials with manchester united , liverpool and rangers in the space of the last year . ",
        "the verdictsunderland need much more than this . knox will be keen and eager to learn but sunderland need a striker who has much more experience and can inspire the young forwards they already have at the club . knox is unlikely to inspire confidence from the stadium of light faithful -- although if he puts as much pride and passion into his performances as you 'd expect from a youngster who is keen to prove themselves , that would go a long way . sunderland fans -- what do you make of the impending deal to sign knox ?
