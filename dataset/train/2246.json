        "photo by issac baldizon/nbae via getty imagesif the los angeles lakers are serious about making a deal for demarcus cousins before the 2018 trade deadline , they could end up offering one of these packages . the los angeles lakers have a plan . at some point between now and the beginning of the 2018-19 nba season , they hope to acquire two superstars who can return this franchise to relevance . the latest rumors suggest demarcus cousins could be one of those players . instead of waiting for him to hit 2018 free agency , though , the lakers could look to make a trade with the new orleans pelicans before the feb. . ",
        "8 deadline . it would be a bold move that would cost los angeles some significant assets . at the same time , locking him down early would n't be the worst idea . either way , i decided to take a swing at what a potential cousins trade could look like for the lakers . chances are other teams could offer more for the dominant big man , but that does n't mean magic johnson and rob pelinka could n't try to get a deal done . related story : way-too-early redrafting of lakers ' 2017 draft classwith the help of the espn trade machine , i 've put together a few potential trade proposals for cousins . ",
        "they are n't home runs by any means , but it 's not like los angeles has a ton of assets to work with . that is , at least not that seem to be `` untouchable . `` so here they are -- my three trade proposals to bring cousins to los angeles before the trade deadline . photo by andrew d. bernstein/nbae via getty imagestrade no . 3in this situation , the lakers get the best of both worlds . not only do they land cousins , but they also unload luol deng and his albatross of a contract . ",
        "yes , they take on omer asik and his $ 10 million annually over the next three years . still , that 's about $ 7 million annually less than deng , so it 's a win . more importantly , they get a worthless contract off the books . asik wo n't provide much value , but at least he does n't cost as much to keep around . he 's also a more movable asset who can be traded again at a later date , or simply be bought out . losing clarkson and randle is tough , but it 's a move the lakers appear willing to make . ",
        "larry nance jr. . and ivica zubac are included to add value while helping the pelicans fill the frontcourt minutes with both cousins and asik gone . i know the common belief is that magic and pelinka are n't willing to part with future draft assets , but getting cousins in return makes it worth the risk . finally , the lakers at least get a 2019 second round pick in return . it likely wo n't offer a ton of value , but this los angeles scouting staff has proven itself capable of finding diamonds in the rough . ",
        "with three young prospects departing , it helps fill out the roster or least add some upside to the lakers ' g league team . again , the focus here is on getting rid of deng . unfortunately for the lakers , i do n't see the pelicans taking him on , even if they do have a need for more talent at small forward . photo by rocky widner/nbae via getty imagestrade no . 2chances are the pelicans are n't interested in taking on deng 's contract , so let 's skip to the next idea . it 's very similar to the last one , except with less thrown in on both sides . ",
        "the lakers still get cousins to give them one of the best offensive centers in the nba right now . to help fill some roster spots , i also threw in dante cunningham . this solves the lakers ' problems in the post , gives them a legitimate superstar and a solid veteran small forward . in return , the pelicans get clarkson , randle , nance and zubac . there are no superstars in the bunch and it leaves them with a logjam at power forward , but the young assets are nice for a team likely headed back into rebuild mode . ",
        "with four quality players included in the deal , the lakers only send a 2018 second round pick instead of parting with their 2020 first round pick . when new orleans originally landed cousins , it parted with buddy hield , tyreke evans , langston galloway , a first round pick and a second round pick . realistically , this package is n't that far off . with the big man potentially bailing via free agency , the pelicans only have so much leverage as it is . i will make this point , as well . if cousins does actually want to play for the lakers , other suitors will be informed that he wo n't re-sign . ",
        "that could force the pelicans to pull the trigger on the best deal los angeles has to offer . photo by rocky widner/nbae via getty imagestrade no . 1realistically , the first two trades were wishful thinking . as much as lakers fans would like to believe the pelicans would take a package of young , slightly above-average players , that 's unlikely . chances are other teams would offer more , making the lakers ' offer irrelevant . if los angeles really wants cousins , it 's going to have to part with a rising star to get him . ",
        "there were really only three options in this situation : brandon ingram , lonzo ball or kyle kuzma . i know they 're all considered `` untouchable , '' but the prospect of acquiring cousins could pry one of them from magic 's grasp . it was a tough choice , but in the end i went with ingram for a couple of reasons . the first was that they already have an exciting wing scorer in kuzma . the second was that ingram has n't shown as much consistency through his first two seasons as kuzma has through half of one . ",
        "obviously i was n't going to get rid of ball -- no way magic would ever make that move . so ingram it was . not an easy choice to make , but a potential free agent addition like paul george or lebron james could handle the small forward duties . luring one of them to los angeles would also be much easier with a lineup that consisted of ball , kuzma and cousins . kentavious caldwell-pope is thrown in to make the financials work . especially with his recent struggles in the shooting department , losing him for the second half of the 2017-18 season is a bearable burden . ",
        "if anything , the lakers would be glad to stop paying him so much money to be such an inefficient go-to threat . it 's not easy making blockbuster deals , especially with a lack of same-year draft picks . however , if parting with ingram gets the lakers one of the best centers in the game , they need to at least consider it . more from hoops habit chicago bulls : 5 most memorable moments from 201712m ago fanduel nba daily : fantasy basketball lineup for december 3134m ago new orleans pelicans : evaluating anthony davis ' season so far23h ago milwaukee bucks : next 3 weeks could define season23h ago oklahoma city thunder : paul george reached out to gordon hayward following injury23h ago if the los angeles lakers are serious about making a deal for demarcus cousins before the 2018 trade deadline , they could end up offering one of these packages .
