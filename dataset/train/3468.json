        "this was an eagles win that left us all miserable -- a road victory that clinched a playoff bye but foreshadowed doom . never before did beating eli manning seem so empty . yes , the good guys defeated the giants , 34-29 sunday . they climbed to 12-2 and are now one victory from guaranteeing all home games until the super bowl . `` we found a way to win , '' defensive tackle fletcher cox said afterward . `` that 's really all that matters . '' not really . most eagles fans woke sunday fretting how nick foles would step in for injured mvp carson wentz . ",
        "as it turned out , foles was fine , throwing four touchdown passes . instead , it was the defense that had us chewing our fingernails to the nub . cox and his mates allowed 504 yards to the nfl 's 29th-ranked offense . they sacked manning just once in 54 attempts . eli passed for 434 yards -- the second-highest total ever against the eagles in 85 seasons . the giants cruised 75 yards for a td on their first series . then they did it again . and again . `` what has happened to the eagles defense ? '' ",
        "merrill reese pleaded on the radio . `` they 're asleep ! '' and they would n't wake . manning torched the eagles when they blitzed early . he continued to torch them when they laid back . indeed , with less than four minutes to go in a five-point game , the giants marched 74 yards to the eagles six , before tackle bobby hart killed his own team 's drive by jumping pre-snap . it was raucous noise made by visiting eagles fans that rattled the giants lineman . give those fans a game ball . the confounding thing is the giants succeeded with a predictable , one-dimensional offense sunday . ",
        "time and again , manning completed 10-yard pick plays where eagles cornerbacks got lost in the wash . it was death by 1,000 slant patterns . corners jaylen mills and ronald darby incurred four penalties . tackling was sloppy at all levels . manning barely felt pressure from one of the nfl 's most-lauded pass rushes . one poor game can be an aberration , but this is now three in a row . perhaps there 's no shame in getting picked apart by russell wilson , or giving up points to a skilled , fast rams offense . but the giants ? ",
        "they were a carcass of an offense heading into yesterday . now , the eagles defensive slump has become a trend . and so it begs the question : is this the porous secondary we all feared when the season started ? or , is this still one of the nfl 's top five defenses -- as it showed through november -- merely encountering turbulence in this long , glorious flight of a season ? i do n't know . you do n't know . we can only hope that defensive coordinator jim schwartz does and can stabilize everything over the next two weeks against oakland and dallas . ",
        "while we all respect eli manning 's career , the quarterbacks the eagles might face in the playoffs are named drew brees , cam newton and matt ryan , along with another potential look at wilson or jared goff . wentz 's brilliance helped the eagles cover for occasional lapses . no matter how many points the opponent scored , he was always one touchdown better . foles , capable as he was sunday , is not in that stratosphere . he ca n't carry this defense . now it has to carry itself .
