        "the white house had three of its judicial nominees withdraw this month -- and it was n't because they wanted to spend more time with their families . two were bloggers whose inflammatory and discriminatory posts caught up with them . the third was humiliated on national television when he could n't answer basic questions about the law and had to concede that he had no trial experience , generally a prerequisite for a lifetime appointment on the u. s. district court for the district of columbia . how these three unqualified men got as far as they did says something about the arrogance of the narrow republican majority in the senate , and leader mitch mcconnell 's ruthlessness in rapidly reshaping the judiciary along ideological lines . ",
        "holding a supreme court seat open for a year , denying president obama his rightful choice , was just the beginning . democrat chris ***** , who sits on the judiciary committee , calls it `` the rocket docket . '' the republican senate last month confirmed four circuit court judges in one week -- one more than president obama got in his entire first year when democrats controlled the senate . in all , trump has confirmed a record 19 federal judges so far , including 12 circuit court judges and supreme court justice merrick garland . that compares to the 11 new federal judges in obama 's first year , including one to the supreme court , and three circuit court judges . ",
        "at the conclusion of his two terms , obama left behind almost 150 court vacancies -- including a supreme court seat -- not out of choice , but because he and other democrats played by the rules and respected the senate 's 100-year-old `` blue slip '' tradition , which had given home state senators a real say in judicial nominees . republicans used the blue slip to keep open critical judgeships they wanted for themselves , an abuse of power that while it 's not illegal or unconstitutional eroded what comity had been left in a body like the senate , which has always prided itself on being a club where personal relationships grease the legislative wheels . ",
        "but now that they control the white house as well as the senate , republicans had been so confident they could just wave anybody through that a nominee like matthew petersen showed up woefully unprepared for the questioning he got from a republican senator , john kennedy of louisiana . both men are graduates of the university of virginia law school , and kennedy was evidently offended by the dilatory nature of petersen 's answers . kennedy said in a television interview that petersen is `` really smart '' and a `` decent guy ... but just because you 've seen my cousin vinny does n't qualify you to be a federal judge . '' ",
        "kennedy cast the first republican vote against any trump judge , `` and he deserves credit , '' says ***** . democrat sheldon whitehouse from rhode island , who also sits on the judiciary committee , told the daily beast earlier this year that the republicans have `` no gag reflex whatsoever '' when it comes to trump 's judges . `` they just wave them through . '' in past administrations , when confirmation was not a certainty , nominees spent days prepping , going before murder boards to make sure they can handle the questions senators would lob at them . ",
        "the republicans solved that in part by stacking the hearings with three or four nominees at a time so senators only get one round of five minutes to ask questions . `` this rushed process means we are missing red flags , '' ***** said in a conference call early this month organized by the american constitution society , a progressive legal group . of the 60 judges that trump has nominated so far , there has been just one african american , one hispanic , and one asian american . nineteen percent are women , the lowest share since the reagan administration and less than half the 42 percent women that obama nominated . ",
        "this is the ultimate revenge of trump 's base : the whiter , the maler , the better . and trump has maintained his support on the right , which has always put a premium on gaining ground in the courts , by offering picks who are uniformly far to the right on social and cultural issues , and also on what can be termed corporate personhood . `` there 's very little democrats can do with the numbers we have and the rules that are in place , '' ***** said at the end of his call with the acs . ",
        "the only chance of changing the rules may be to change the numbers . if democrats regain the majority next year , it may be time for them do unto others as they have had done unto them .   "
