        "photo and video crews were stymied in their attempts to film president trump on a golf course wednesday , an apparent response to cnn 's recent footage of the commander-in-chief on the links . as the president completed another round at trump international golf club in west palm beach , florida , a large white truck obscured nearby journalists -- who were positioned on public property -- from getting a shot of trump on their cameras . when cnn 's photojournalist moved his camera , the truck likewise moved , blocking the picture . on tuesday , cnn recorded a shot of the president on the course in west palm beach . ",
        "the network did the same on saturday and sunday , shooting the footage through a gap in the hedges while positioned on a public sidewalk . on wednesday , crews from cnn attempted to record the president on the course -- only to be blocked by the vehicle . cameras for abc and cbs were also present . cathy milhoan , a spokeswoman for the secret service , said the agency was not responsible for the truck . `` the usss is in the business of protection and investigations not in commissioning vehicles to block the media 's view of the president 's golf swing , '' milhoan said . ",
        "teri barbera , a spokeswoman for the palm beach county sheriff 's office , said the department also `` did not order a box truck to block any views of the president . '' a white house spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment , but the truck can likely be seen as the latest -- and perhaps most literal -- attempt by this administration to limit the media 's access to trump . it may also be interpreted it as a sign of how sensitive the white house is about the president 's love of golf . ",
        "for years , trump ridiculed former president barack obama for golfing . on the campaign trail , trump said emphatically that he did n't have time for the sport . wednesday 's outing marked the 87th day trump has spent at one of his golf properties since taking office . -- cnn 's noah gray , dan merica and ken tuohey contributed to this report . cnnmoney first published december 27 , 2017 : 6:02 pm et .
