        "cincinnati , oh -- october 21 : courtland sutton # 16 of the southern methodist mustangs runs the ball after reception as chris murphy # 30 of the cincinnati bearcats reaches for the tackle at nippert stadium on october 21 , 2017 in cincinnati , ohio . the san francisco 49ers , having wrapped up their 2017 regular season , are now shifting focus to the new year and adding to the current team . one position is wide receiver , and the nfl draft will be an area the team will look at to address that . one of the largest advantages the san francisco 49ers have heading into 2018 is a sense of a direction . ",
        "for the first time in four years , there is no search for a new coach for the franchise . this allows for san francisco to truly start building one coherent team with pieces that compliment one another . and with quarterback jimmy garoppolo -- a vital component to the construction of the squad -- the 49ers have a centerpiece to their foundation . the needs of garoppolo will be taken into account when it comes to how the front office decides to approach its roster . that being said , one of those needs is wide receiver . while it is not certainly at the top of the list of priorities , as pierre gar√ßon , marquise goodwin and trent taylor are no slouches themselves , this past season showed the team lacks a true scoring threat at the position . ",
        "if the team decides to opt the wide receiver route in the nfl draft , there are a wealth of options to chose from . here are five names to keep an eye out as potential fits for san francisco . next : no . 5 : james washington stillwater , ok -- october 14 : wide receiver james washington # 28 of the oklahoma state cowboys makes a reception against the baylor bears at boone pickens stadium on october 14 , 2017 in stillwater , oklahoma . oklahoma state defeated baylor 59-16 . no . 5 : james washington , oklahoma state . ",
        "it was quite the prolific season for oklahoma state 's james washington , who posted 1,549 receiving yards and 13 touchdowns on 74 catches while en route to winning the fred biletnikoff award , college football 's top honor for wide receivers . that marked washington 's three consecutive 1,000-yard receiving season , making him the school leader in the category . time and time again , his big-play ability was put on display . standing six feet tall and weighing 205 pounds , washington is by no means scrawny . he possesses dangerous speed , often using it to outrun opponents . ",
        "but it does not mean washington is one-dimensional . damond tabolt , of nfl draft diamond , wrote this in part of his breakdown of washington : has great body adjustment and good body control . very athletic receiver who goes up for the football . makes acrobatic catches . can win in 50/50 balls . plays like a true wr1 and is the teams go to guy . washington is currently ranked as bleacher report matt miller 's no . 9 wide receiver , and is being projected as a round 1-3 selection . with the 49ers picking at no . ",
        "9 or no . 10 overall , the first round is out of the question for washington . the second round is a far more likely spot . next : no . 4 : christian kirk college station , tx -- october 07 : christian kirk # 3 of the texas a&m aggies has a pass go off his fingertips in the first quarter against the alabama crimson tide at kyle field on october 7 , 2017 in college station , texas . no . 4 : christian kirk , texas a&m . at 20 years old , texas a&m 's christian kirk is one of the younger wide receivers in the nfl draft . ",
        "kirk , who was an early enrollee at texas a&m , immediately made an impact , recording 80 receptions for 1,009 yards and seven touchdowns as a freshman . the junior finished his career as one of the best aggie receivers ever , ranking in school history near the top for numerous categories : second in receptions , third in receiving yards , third in receiving touchdowns and third in all-purpose yards . kirk never did top 1,000 receiving yards in his final two seasons -- reaching 928 yards in 2016 and 919 yards in 2017 -- but there was no shortage of elite playmaking . ",
        "he was a threat in special teams , holding the school for most punt return touchdowns with six . kirk is currently ranked as matt miller 's no . 3 wide receiver , with the expectation he will go in the round 1-2 range . at six feet tall and 205 pounds , kirk is not quite the big receiver the team lacks . but his ability to stretch the field and contribute even when not on offense should pique the 49ers interests . next : no . 3 : deon cain new orleans , la -- january 01 : deon cain # 8 of the clemson tigers runs with the ball as tony brown # 2 of the alabama crimson tide and anthony averett # 28 defend in the first half of the allstate sugar bowl at the mercedes-benz superdome on january 1 , 2018 in new orleans , louisiana . ",
        "no . 3 : deon cain , clemson . just declared recently , clemson 's deon cain is another name that should interest san francisco at wide receiver . cain , who led clemson in receiving yards and touchdowns , has the hands necessary to compete at the next level . at six-feet-one-inch , cain also has favorable size . length is what the team needs to acquire at the position , and cain fits that criteria . but there is also the ability to make plays after the catch cain possesses . cain is currently ranked as matt miller 's no . ",
        "4 wide receiver . projections have him in the round 1-3 range , so the second round will be a likely target spot for the 49ers . next : no . 2 : calvin ridley atlanta , ga -- january 08 : calvin ridley # 3 of the alabama crimson tide makes a catch for a seven yard touchdown during the fourth quarter against the georgia bulldogs in the cfp national championship presented by at&t at mercedes-benz stadium on january 8 , 2018 in atlanta , georgia . no . 2 : calvin ridley , alabama . for many scouts , alabama 's calvin ridley is the year 's top wide receiver prospect . ",
        "ridley 's route-running is regarded as top-tier , as you can see in the clips provided . the junior finished his career with 224 receptions for 2,781 yards and 19 touchdowns . those certainly are not eye-catching numbers , but alabama 's run-heavy offense tends to limit wide receivers in terms of production . route-running is a skill that is difficult to come by , and it plays a huge part in determining a wide receiver 's success . of course size and speed are important , but if you can not get open , none of that matters . ",
        "with ridley 's routes , which are noticeably crisp , you can see the separation created with his quick feet . that is a threat to blow off the top of defenses , which would allow for the 49ers to be able to diversify their offense . ridley will be 24 years old when he suits up as a rookie , which could be viewed both positively and negatively . no matter what though , the chances of ridley being the first receiver selected are high . he is currently ranked as matt miller 's no . 1 wide receiver . ",
        "the first round is the only realistic slot to get ridley , so it depends on just how highly head coach kyle shanahan values the need for a true top wide receiver . next : no . 1 : courtland sutton dallas , tx -- september 9 : courtland sutton # 16 of the smu mustangs breaks free for a touchdown reception against the north texas mean green during the first half at gerald j. ford stadium on september 9 , 2017 in dallas , texas . no . 1 : courtland sutton , smu . it is not every day you come across a six-foot-four-inch skill player weighing in at 214 pounds -- and that is exactly what smu 's courtland sutton is . ",
        "a giant at wide receiver , sutton is a converted defensive back turned playmaker . in three seasons at wide receiver for smu , sutton had 193 receptions for 3,193 yards and 31 touchdowns . he had consecutive seasons of 1,000 + receiving yards and 10 or more touchdowns , capping off a strong college career . that huge frame is what has scouts the most excited . very rarely are there cornerbacks who are above six-feet-two-inches , making the height advantage a massive tool , especially in the red zone . more from niner noise nfl playoffs : niner noise predictions for the divisional round4h ago 49ers do n't have to use first-round pick in 2018 nfl draft on an offensive lineman15h ago falcons and saints keep super bowl hopes alive after wild card wins18h ago 49ers could add rb le'veon bell in nfl free agency ... but would they ?

        "22h ago 2018 nfl draft : who are the experts tabbing to the 49ers in their latest mocks ? 1 d ago if the 49ers truly feel the need to go wide receiver in the first round , then i believe this is the player to target . size is needed , and sutton has more than enough . but sutton also owns a set of wheels ; not many players his height can take a screen pass and bounce to the other side of the field as sutton did in the clip provided above . sutton is currently ranked as matt miller 's no . ",
        "2 wide receiver overall , and i do not expect the smu product to make it out of the top 20 . at no . 9 or no . 10 , san francisco will have a decision to make on sutton . next : 49ers do n't have to use first-round pick in 2018 nfl draft on an offensive linemanfrom james washington to christian kirk to courtland sutton , the 2018 wide receiver class is stacking up to be a solid one . the san francisco 49ers , having wrapped up their 2017 regular season , are now shifting focus to the new year and adding to the current team .
