        "last year , on the bright , shining morning of january 1 , waking up in a comfy , warm bed in the north carolina mountains , with the renewed sense of power and hope that comes on new year 's day , i declared my resolution for 2017 : `` this is the year . this is the year i will draw every single day . '' it 's now the beginning of 2018 , and * spoiler alert * i did n't fulfill that resolution . i did n't draw every day of 2017 . there were about 10 days i did n't draw , so i drew somewhere around 355 days last year . ",
        "another failed resolution . another hopeless year , another waste , right ? actually , i believe my 2017 resolution was far from a failure . i believe it was a huge success . i drew 355 days ! that 's more than i 've ever drawn in a single year . i filled up 3 entire sketchbooks . that 's more sketchbooks than i 've ever filled up before ! i tried out new tools and mediums , and evolved my artistic style into something that feels even more like me than before , even when i thought i had already figured it out ! ",
        "so yeah , if you wan na get all technical and nitpicky , i did n't achieve my goal . fine , whatever , another new year 's resolution in the graveyard . but here 's the important part : that failed resolution led me to draw more than i ever have before . i succeeded in the long run by improving my creative life and growing my artistic practice . and now at the start of this fresh new year , i 'm reflecting back , trying to figure out why i was more successful in 2017 than 2016 . ",
        "and that 's when i discovered the one thing that helped me draw * almost * every day last year . commit to a drawing series publiclydrawing * almost * every day for a year is a long time . we 'll start out strong for sure , full of ideas and brimming with motivation . but how do we keep the momentum going ? the most common thing i hear from people who do n't draw consistently is that they just do n't know what to draw each day . they sit down with the intention of drawing , but they open up their sketchbook and the blank page just stares at them . ",
        "so open , so white , so blank . what to possibly fill it with ? here 's my secret weapon to combating this problem : committing publicly to drawing projects and series . this came in many forms for me , but most often was some sort of drawing challenge or theme on instagram . i started or participated in a total of 12 drawing series last year . some were personal series i started myself , like my travel journals , and some were drawing challenges started by other artists and joined in by thousands of other creatives . ",
        "here are the drawing projects i committed to publicly last year : #mightcouldinnyc : 7 drawings #mightcouldinindia : 19 drawings #inktober2017 / / #mightcoulddrawclothes : 30 drawings #mightcouldinhyrule : 4 drawings #mightcouldroadtrip : 19 drawings #mightcouldinvietnam : 13 drawings #mightcouldinseattle : 11 drawings #wikillo : 3 drawings #marchmeetthemaker : 3 drawings #meettheartist : 1 drawing #mightcouldcopic : 34 drawings #lillifecomic : 39 drawingsi stuck with some of these series from beginning to end , like my travel journals and inktober . others , i started with high energy , but soon the excitement wore off and i lost interest and got bored . ",
        "so i stopped that series . but that does n't mean that series was a waste of time ! it was still worth it to start the series , even if you only did it a couple times . it got you drawing that day and that 's what counts . we want to enjoy the process of drawing , so do n't keep drawing a series if you start to hate it . turn the page , and start a new series ! in total , these 12 series produced 185 total drawings . that 's almost half the year , right there ! ",
        "all because of a bunch of random drawing series i decided to commit to and see where they went . some of these drawing series went somewhere interesting , and some did n't . but they all got me drawing . why does this work ? so why does committing publicly to drawing series work ? why not just draw something different each day ? why not keep your drawing series secret ? this concept works for three reasons : 1 . you 've given yourself constraintsnow when you sit down to draw , you wo n't be as confused or overwhelmed about what to draw . ",
        "you 'll have a set of limitations to work within and a direction to follow . these guidelines help to jumpstart new ideas by narrowing down the options , rather than sitting down to a blank page with limitless possibilities . 2 . you 've made it public and held yourself accountablewhen you make your drawing series public you 've declared your intentions to the whole world . now if you do n't draw , you wo n't be the only one who knows it . this boost of accountability will be an extra layer of motivation for you to draw each day . ",
        "3 . you 've opened yourself up for feedback and joined a creative communitywhenever you push something out into the world , you 're opening yourself up for feedback . this may be a scary at first , and i ca n't promise no one will say something negative about your work . but in my experience , the internet environment i 've shaped and molded for myself has been very nurturing , inspiring , and supportive . you can create that environment too by choosing which groups you join and who you follow . join a positive and open creative community , and their feedback and encouragement will help keep you motivated . ",
        "bonus lesson : do n't let slip ups bring you downok , so we made the resolution to draw every day with all the determination we could muster and all the good intentions in the world . we committed to a bunch of drawing series publicly . we gave ourselves constraints , held ourselves accountable , and joined a creative community . but here we are on january 9th , and we 've already missed a day . curses ! here 's the real secret to drawing consistently : who cares ? ! you did n't draw yesterday , you missed one day . ",
        "ok , so what ? that was yesterday , and today is today . we ca n't let one slip up bring this whole thing crashing down . it 's pretty much guaranteed that you will slip up . i already have ! for real . i forgot to draw on january 6th . oops . it 's ok . no one is perfect . we all make mistakes . consistency is what we 're really aiming for , and we can keep it up by forgetting the tiny missteps and focusing on the big picture . yes , we forgot to draw yesterday . ",
        "we ca n't go back , and we ca n't change that . but today is a new day with fresh promise and the opportunity to rebound . we can still draw today .   "
