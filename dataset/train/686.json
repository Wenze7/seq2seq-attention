        "one question , 7 top supercross racers ' answers . the most anticipated supercross race of the year is a1 , and when we , the press , show up the day before we get a small window to ask a few questions of the riders who 've been invited to press day . as our introductory question we figured asking what 's different for 2018 might elicit a few more unique answers than would the typical , `` how 's training ? how 's the bike ? how 's the team ? '' questions . we grabbed monster energy/knich/yamaha factory racing 's justin barcia and cooper webb , cr22 racing 's chad reed , red bull ktm 's marvin musquin , autotrader/yoshimura/suzuki factory racing 's westin peick , monster energy kawasaki 's josh grant , and team honda hrc 's ken roczen . ",
        "some have a lot of changes to their 2018 program , whereas some do n't have very many at all . reed 's team is another self-supported owner-racer program on husqvarnas , while barcia is back on a yamaha that is all new for 2018 . other than missing a teammate marvin 's program seems to be the least changed . enjoy !
