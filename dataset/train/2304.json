        "the oakland a 's teams of the late 1980s and early 1990s were known for bashing home runs during the baseball season , but during the holiday season the players traded cleats for ballet slippers to help out a good cause . tony la russa was just getting started as the a 's manager when he persuaded some of his players to dance in the oakland ballet 's `` nutcracker '' holiday performance in 1986 to benefit the arts organization , and photos recently found in the chronicle 's archive show ace dave stewart , slugger mark mcgwire and others getting into the christmas spirit . ",
        "for the oakland ballet 's artistic director , ronn guidi , working with athletes instead of dancers proved to be a big change . `` i suddenly feel very small , '' he said , standing around such professional ballplayers as carney lansford , bill krueger , mike davis and dwayne murphy , who were tasked with fighting off giant mice in the performance . `` we 'll get some ribbing from the guys , '' lansford told the chronicle . `` that 's all right . we just do n't want to make fools of ourselves , so we 're taking this seriously . '' ",
        "the a 's players were there to help , but they had some learning to do , too . `` ronn is a very good coach -- helpful but not critical , '' krueger said . `` we 're all used to performing , really . we just want to do a professional job . '' the a 's players were game and wore the standard `` nutcracker '' toy soldier costumes -- tan knickers , white frilly shirts , blue cutaway george washington coats -- but their 2-foot-tall black hats were emblazoned with the a 's green-and-gold logo . ",
        "the 1986 performance was a grand success , and the teaming of ballplayers and ballerinas carried on for about 15 years in oakland . la russa joined the players onstage in 1987 and continued to help out the ballet , even after he left the a 's and started managing the st. louis cardinals . the hall of fame manager and animal rescue foundation founder summed up the team 's no . 1 offseason mission : `` the goal every year is do n't fall down . '' within a few years , players from other bay area teams , local sports announcers and journalists got on their tiptoes and joined the fun . ",
        "la russa even talked chronicle sporting green columnist scott ostler into putting on his dancing shoes in 1998 . ostler wrote : `` i wo n't say i 'm a wooden dancer , but i play the yule log . '' bill van niekerken is the library director of the san francisco chronicle , where he has worked since 1985 . in his weekly column , from the archive , he explores the depths of the chronicle 's vast photography archive in search of interesting historical tales related to the city by the bay .
