        "chicago -- the united soccer league has been sanctioned as a second division league for 2018 by the u. s. soccer federation , which says the circuit has been given a two-year path to full compliance with the governing body 's standards . the usl had been given provisional second-tier status in 2017 . it began its professional competition in 2011 and held third-tier status before 2017 . it reached an agreement with mls , the only first division u. s. men 's league , in 2013 to integrate the reserve teams of the top tier . the ussf board approved the decision last weekend during a meeting in new york . ",
        "the federation said tuesday in a statement that the `` usl has demonstrated substantial progress toward reaching full compliance since being granted provisional division ii sanctioning . `` the north american soccer league held second-tier status from 2011 through last year . when its status was not renewed , it filed an antitrust suit against the ussf . the nasl 's application for a preliminary injunction against the ussf was denied in november , and it took the case to the 2nd u. s. circuit court of appeals , which has not ruled . the usl said last week it plans to have 33 teams this season , which starts march 16-18 . ",
        "in addition , the national women 's soccer league 's first-division status was sanctioned for this year . the ussf said the nwsl and usl must apply for re-sanctioning annually and work toward full compliance by 2020 .   "
