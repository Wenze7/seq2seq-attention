        "puerto maldonado - pope francis sounded a stark warning about the future of the amazon and its peoples during a visit to the region on friday , saying they had `` never been so threatened . `` in a speech to thousands of tribe members on the edge of the rainforest in peru , he said the amazon and its peoples bore `` deep wounds . '' francis lamented `` the pressure being exerted by great business interests that want to lay hands on its petroleum , gas , lumber , gold '' and industrial scale farming . he later highlighted the `` endless violence '' endured by the region 's women . ",
        "bare-chested tribesmen , their bodies painted and their heads crowned with colorful feathers , danced and sang for the pope when he arrived in the peruvian city of puerto maldonado . thousands of indigenous people had traveled to meet the pontiff from throughout the amazon basin region of peru , brazil and bolivia . `` we ask you to defend us , '' said yesica patiachi , a representative of the harakbut people -- one of 23 indigenous peoples specifically mentioned in the pope 's greeting at the start of the meeting . `` if they take away our land , we can disappear . '' ",
        "- ` our land was beautiful ' - `` i 'm 67 , i remember that our land was beautiful , with abundant plants and fish , '' said luzmila bermejo of the awajun people . `` the oil , forestry and mining groups came ... all of this polluted and weakened us . `` members of one of the tribes presented the leader of the world 's 1.2 billion catholics with a bow and arrow in a symbolic gesture aimed at urging him to help defend their land rights . `` the native amazonian peoples have probably never been so threatened on their own lands as they are at present , '' said the pope , who appeared visibly moved by the reception . ",
        "`` amazonia is being disputed on various fronts , '' he said . `` the problems strangle her peoples and provoke the migration of the young due to the lack of local alternatives . `` we have to break with the historical paradigm that views amazonia as an inexhaustible source of supplies for other countries without concern for its inhabitants . `` the amazon region will be the focal point of a world bishops ' meeting , or synod , to take place in october 2019 . local tribal leaders and conservationists are increasingly concerned about rampant illegal gold mining and logging that have devastated ancestral lands . ",
        "the pope later received a raucous welcome when he visited a shelter for vulnerable children and adolescents , victims of physical , sexual or psychological abuse . `` the world needs you , young men and women of the first peoples , and it needs you as you are , '' he told them . francis encouraged them to study , so as not to be `` content to be the last car on the train of society , letting yourselves be pulled along and eventually disconnected . we need you to be the engine , always pressing forward . ",
        "`` returning to lima in the afternoon , the argentine pontiff hit out against corruption in a speech to dignitaries at government headquarters , where his audience included president pedro pablo kuczynsky . `` how much evil is done to our latin american people and the democracies of this continent by this social ` virus ' , a phenomenon that infects everything , with the greatest harm being done to the poor and mother earth , '' said francis . on saturday he is scheduled to visit the northern city of trujillo , where floods killed more than 130 people , and speak about climate change . ",
        "he will fly back to rome on sunday after mass at an air base . - protests in chile - the pontiff , 81 , arrived thursday afternoon in peru , the second and last leg of a week-long south american visit . during the first part of his visit , in chile , francis highlighted the plight of vulnerable immigrants , offered an apology to victims of sexual abuse by catholic priests , prayed with survivors of augusto pinochet 's brutal dictatorship , and called for protection of chile 's persecuted indigenous communities . before his visit to chile , the us-based ngo bishop accountability said that almost 80 members of the roman catholic clergy had been accused of sexually abusing children in chile since 2000 . ",
        "at the pope 's first public mass in santiago on tuesday , he faced protests over the church 's handling of decades of sexual abuse . scuffles broke out between riot police and demonstrators near o'higgins park , and police used water cannons on protesters . more than 50 people were arrested , authorities said . at the end of his visit , he robustly defended a chilean bishop , juan barros , who is accused of covering up the sexual abuse of minors by another priest . by katell abiven , catherine marciano .
