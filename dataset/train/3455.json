        "on january 11 , liz sly retweeted a video featuring a man with a microphone cowering in front a camera in the middle of an airstrike , purportedly shot near the northern syrian city of idlib , a current focal point of fighting between the opposition and government forces . `` this syrian journalist , standing in an open field while bombs explode all around him , is very lucky to be alive . no flak jacket or helmet . you can barely hear him above the explosions . he and his colleagues are very brave , '' wrote sly , who is responsible for the newspaper 's syria and iraq coverage . ",
        "`` this syrian journalist 's name is tahir al-umar and he is with free syrian tv , '' she added in a later post . sly 's description was immediately challenged by other commenters , including several journalists , who noted that the protagonist of the footage , also known as abu omar , is not the posterboy of journalistic veracity she makes him out to be -- but an islamist cheerleader . omar does not conceal his allegiance , with many of the posts on his twitter account praising the `` sacrifices '' of the `` mujahideen '' -- the noble jihadists -- and gloating over the enemy losses inflicted by islamic state and other radical groups . ",
        "`` the shia militias have been turned into mincemeat on the syrian-iranian border . five islamic state bomb trucks exploded , 60 dead and dozens wounded , '' writes omar , accompanying the message with two laughing emojis in a typical tweet from august 8 , 2017 . `` we beg allah to unite the ranks of the mujahideen and the other fighters ! '' omar wrote on august 4 last year . at least at some point in 2016 , omar was embedded with the salafist jihadist group jund al-aqsa , part of a wider jihadist alliance led by saudi cleric abdullah al-muhaysini , who is considered a terrorist by the united states . ",
        "omar and al-muhaysini are pictured embracing warmly as they posed for the cameras in an undated photo , while multiple reports call the movement 's fighters `` heroes . '' the fragmented political landscape in syria makes it easy to accidentally endorse unsavory characters , even if you are a top foreign correspondent for a renowned media outlet , though one wonders if the washington post would have been so careless in advertising the work of a pro-government reporter . in any case , sly told rt she has nothing to apologize for , as she was commending the jihadist supporter 's `` bravery , '' while the supposed journalist 's pro-is views are irrelevant here . ",
        "`` i dispute that i gave ` praise ' to the journalist or his journalism . i pointed out that standing up in a field and continuing to talk while explosions are going off all around you is brave , '' sly told rt. .   "
