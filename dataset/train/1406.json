        "q&a : a funding round made all the difference for ernit in 2017 . ceo søren nielsen tells us about ernit 's development the past year . by anders holmgaard , communications manager , #cphftw2017 marked a shift for #cphftw member ernit . a dkk 5m investment from spar nord and seed capital in the beginning of the year `` is the reason why we 're here today , '' says ceo søren nielsen as we called him up between skype calls on a busy friday morning . since 2015 he and two co-founders have been working on creating the world 's first smart piggy bank -- teaching children how to save up their money in a world where physical coins are in decline . ",
        "søren shared with us how the investment has impacted ernit the past 12 months . describe ernit 's development through the years . when i look at our development through the years i think about our time in new york city in 2016 . as a young startup , we got accepted at the techstars accelerator . excited about the program , we had brought our families to new york city . we stuffed 10 people into a 90 square meter apartment . every morning we went down manhattan by bike . but in 2017 i feel like ernit has shifted gears . ",
        "we 're still biking , but it 's going faster and faster . and hopefully in 2018 , we 're able to motorize our vehicle . how did you run your business before you got the 5m investment ? we spent as little money as possible . we had rented a cheap office space at one of our friends ' and did n't receive any salary . every penny literally went down the piggy bank . but nevertheless , we managed to produce an app and a prototype of our product . in the end of 2016 we started negotiating with seed capital and spar nord . ",
        "the work with the lawyers took ages but in january 2017 we sealed the deal . it was a big relief to sign the papers . it took me quite long to find the right pen to do it with . but finally we popped the champagne . how did the investment change ernit in 2017 ? the investment enabled us to integrate our back-end into that of spar nord . this makes it possible for our users to fix an account to their ernit . this was crucial for the development of our product . kids need to know that there is real money involved when they save their pocket money . ",
        "along the way , however , we had to come to terms with the fact that it was impossible to reach the deadline in time . we are still counting on launching the partnership before christmas though . in 2017 we were also finally able to pay ourselves a salary . a small salary -- but still a salary . now , we 're six people in denmark and five in ukraine . we changed offices to singularityu in copenhagen and for the first time we have a feeling of being a real company -- not just some guys in a garage . ",
        "but an investment also means more work for me as the ceo . i have to make reports on our kpi 's every month and make sure the numbers are right . we have become more professionalized and structured due to the money flow , but the pressure has also increased . once a month i have to prepare and hold a board meeting . it feels like an exam every time . it can be frustrating with all the requirements from the board and it has changed my daily life , but then again i learn so much . ",
        "i have gained amazing insights as to what investors are looking for and our board members have helped me understand how the big banks think -- that 's extremely valuable when i do pitches . what were the highlights of 2017 ? one of the biggest highlights of the year was pitching ernit at singapore fintech festival in front of 2000 people and ten judges from the biggest banks in the world . i was nervous , but it went well and we have benefitted a lot from it . 2017 was also the year we produced our finished product . ",
        "before , we only had a 3d printed prototype with an arduino board . so i shed a tear as i packed our very first factory-made piggy bank at our manufacturer in denmark and sent it out the door . 2017 has been a wild ride . but that 's life in the startup world . if you ca n't deal with that , you do n't belong here . what are your expectations for 2018 ? in 2018 we are on the hunt for more funding . we need to scale outside of denmark . we 're already in talks with big banks like barclays and standard chartered and i 've just sent piggy banks to greece and malaysia . ",
        "after three years we have finally figured out how our product has to work but it 's safe to say that 2018 will see even more changes to ernit . simply because the happiness of our users is what needs to drive us -- not the money at hand . ___________________________________________________________________ interested in more updates from the danish startup community ? the ernit team ! ceo at ernit , søren nielsen .
