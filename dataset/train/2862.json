        "try saying that 5 times fast ... fa la la la la la la la la ! -- hah . with winter fastly approaching , i wanted to reminisce on some of my favorite looks from my favorite season ! i can never get enough of fall . there 's a different smell in the air whenever it 's around and it 's just so intoxicating . the sound of crunching crisp leaves beneath your feet . the smell of cider donuts and fresh apple pie . i could go on , but lets cut right to the chase ! ",
        "my fave fall outfits -- aaaaand , go ! * links are provided just for the store page as some of these clothing pieces are no longer listed on the site * vest-cardigan : forever 21 ; bodysuit : american apparel ; jeans : levi casually cracking up as i remember the time it was like 80 and sunny in october ! dang mother nature , you scary sometimes -- but in a good way ! üòé i was not complaining ! it helped me transition my summer wardrobe to fall . i was dressing light , but introducing more dark tones at the same time -- pretty cool ! ",
        "jean cardigan : marshalls ; knit tank top : brandy melville ; bralette : forever 21 ; jeans : gypsy warrior ; loafers : white mountaineven nearing november , i was somehow still getting away with a loose knit tank top ? ! i usually always stick to neutral tones and these loafers were the perfect addition to my fall wardrobe . nothing quite says fall like burnt sienna ! that and a psl , but those suck ! üòù coat : forever 21 ; sweater : american apparel ; jeans : levi ; shoes : steve madden -- purchased at tj maxx ; clutch/wallet : michael korsseriously , how cute is this coat ? ",
        "i have been dying for a cute long fall/winter coat that would n't be too boxy on me . i have a small frame , so coats almost always fit me awkwardly . buying this coat online was a huge risk , but what the heck , let 's give it a shot ! the model kinda looks like my size , and it does n't look like a potato sack on her ! it ca n't be terrible looking on me . this is my thought process with any online purchase ! when i tried it on , it was such a great feeling . ",
        "that putting just the right amount of butter on your popcorn at the movies feeling it fit wonderfully . of course , a photoshoot was necessary ! okay , bring it in lisa . enough about the damn coat ! this whole look is casual , comfy , and chic ! the pop of color in the sweater really ties everything together -- hey ! that rhymes ! this look right here . if i had to pick an outfit to wear everyday , look no further my friends . i get pure joy out of outfits like these . ",
        "simple , but so put together . neutral tones again with a pop of color here and there ! this was the perfect look for the friendsgiving a. j. and i hosted this year ! and with that , onward to winter ! afterall , it 's the most wonderful time of the year !   "
