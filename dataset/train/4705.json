        "perhaps the most underrated team in all of sports right now might be the toronto raptors . at 28-10 , the raptors post the third best record in all of the nba . while they 've been led by demar derozan , who 's been red-hot of late , they have a fantastic cast around him , including star point guard kyle lowry . however , toronto might have to learn how to win without lowry in the near future , as he suffered a back injury last night against the brooklyn nets . this did n't look good at all for lowry , who 's been averaging 16.2 points and 7.0 assists per game for toronto . ",
        "as scary as the fall looked , it was announced by the raptors that he only suffered back spasms . without a doubt , this is a huge break for toronto . in the midst of a five-game winning streak , they 'll need all hands on deck . if lowry only misses a week of action it wo n't hurt them in the eastern conference . even though there 's not timetable yet , it 's great to hear that lowry did n't sustain a major injury .
