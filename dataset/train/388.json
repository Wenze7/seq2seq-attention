        "by : heather bauer , rd , cndnew year , new you . it 's time to take back control of your body 's health by cutting out some of the toxins you are feeding it , especially sugar . over three-quarters of packaged food in grocery stores today comes with copious amounts of added sweeteners , making it easy to overindulge , even if you pass on dessert . most americans eat over 82 grams of sugar daily , which is triple the amount recommended by the american heart association . over one year , that equals 150 pounds of added sugars per person . ",
        "feeling gross yet ? top five dangers of added sugarit 's time to resolve to cut your sugar consumption levels down this year . below are five health risks of overeating sugar and sugar substitutes , and the damage that they wreak on your body . driving force behind type 2 diabetesthe results are in ; eating too much sweet stuff raises your risk of developing type 2 diabetes . according to the cdc , an estimated 100 million americans have the disease , and millions more are at risk . insulin resistance is the trigger for diabetes , and foods filled with fat and sugar reduce your sensitivity to insulin , meaning your blood-sugar levels go unchecked . ",
        "sugary drinks tend to be the most dangerous . when the british medical journal conducted an analysis of fruit juice and soda , they found that even eight daily ounces raised diabetes risk by 13 percent . likewise , research published on plos one shows that every extra 150 calories of sugar every day increased diabetes risk by one percent , compared to just 0.1 percent for non-sugar calories . now , new evidence from the journal of diabetes science and technology shows that sugar-filled diets might increase the risk of developing alzheimer 's disease . in fact , the link between insulin resistance and alzheimer 's is so strong that some scientists are considering renaming the disease as ` type 3 diabetes ' . ",
        "2 . promotes addiction and brain fogeight times more addictive than cocaine . that 's what research from princeton is reporting about the sinister side of sugar . your body craves this sweet substance like it 's a drug because , well , it is . and like many other drugs , sugar only hurts your body in the process . the taste of sugar triggers signals in your brain that light up its reward pathway and create a surge of feel-good hormones . too much stimulation reduces their effectiveness , meaning you start needing larger amounts of sugar to feel the same way . ",
        "likewise , sugar-induced insulin resistance weakens the synaptic connections between brain cells , leading to impaired cognition , higher depression rates , and emotional mood swings that leave you depleted . 3 . develops into dangerous belly fateating refined sugar overloads your liver with fructose , and anything you do n't immediately burn is turned into fat - predominately around your belly . not only does this leave you looking bloated , but it also leads to lingering health challenges . in fact , reports from harvard reveals that abdominal fat can raise your risk of high blood pressure , heart disease , strokes , and premature death . ",
        "4 . triggers premature agingwrinkly , saggy skin is hardly the fresh start you want this year . yet , sugary snacks might make it a reality . a study conducted at dartmouth medical school states that overindulging on sugar leads to glycation , a process where excess sugar molecules attach to collagen fibers , causing them to lose flexibility and strength . as a result , your skin loses elasticity and becomes more vulnerable to skin damage and sagging . a high-sugar diet also deactivates your body 's natural antioxidant enzymes , which leaves you more susceptible to sun damage and skin cancers . ",
        "5 . zaps the ` good ' bacteria in your gutyour digestive system is a zoo of beneficial bacteria that keep things functioning as they should . research funded by the american cancer society show that sugar alters gut bacteria in ways that affect mental performance and potentially raise toxin levels in your bloodstream . because most sugars are digested without microbial help , these hungry bugs turn to nibbling on your intestinal lining instead . permeating this barrier allows food particles into the rest of your body , which can cause inflammation and fungal growth like candida . further research from tel aviv university also shows that artificial sugar might promote the growth of harmful gut bacteria , which can lead to irritation , allergies and skin conditions , as well as digestive distress . ",
        "this year , cut out sugar for better healththe facts do n't lie . sugar is terrible for your health , and cutting it out only does your body a favor . so , commit this year to eat less sugar , and you 'll experience profound benefits in the process .   "
