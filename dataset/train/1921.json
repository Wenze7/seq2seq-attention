        "i am an outsider . a freak . not normal . how many people can relate to that statement ? i am a piece of shit . a nobody . a loser . a loner . how many feel that one ? it 's amazing the stories we tell ourselves . who am i ? what is it like to be alan ? i sometimes stop and think . when i consider the inner voice , that part of me which , when alone , is shouting at me to do something , i feel a bit intimidated . it 's like my mind is running the show . ",
        "so am i more than just my mind ? when i was a kid i convinced myself that i was not worthy -- not worthy of love , of friendships , of relationships and of success and i approached every situation from that standpoint . they ` re ok , but i 'm not . they can have normal , healthy relationships and success but i ca n't . and how i hated them ... . and myself ... and then them again . . d'oh ! i am still dealing with the consequences of that choice ; gradually becoming aware of my own needs , rather than believing everyone else to be more important . ",
        "so , what happened to me to make me that way ? i do n't actually know and here 's why it does n't matter . as long as i acknowledge that part of me which suffers i can find relief . so i talk to myself . dealing with an overactive , underproductive imagination has been my ` problem ' for a long time . so i 'm writing spontaneously . what 's going to emerge when i put myself in this space ? am i learning through writing , through sharing that writing or through the feedback i get ? ",
        "or all three ? do i have any idea where this piece is going ? right now the answer is ` no . ' and do i actually care about putting this out into the world even though it is apparently pointless ? also a ` no . ' that 's not normal . am i now worthy ?   "
