        "moscow -- russia 's culture ministry banned a satirical film about soviet leader josef stalin 's death from movie theaters tuesday following criticism from communists and others that the british-french production made a mockery of russia 's history . the culture ministry declared it was rescinding the permit that would have allowed scottish writer-director armando iannucci 's `` the death of stalin '' to be shown in russian theaters . the film premiered in britain in october and was scheduled to open in russia thursday . the ministry 's move reflects an admiration many in russia still have for stalin despite the dictator 's brutal purges that killed millions , as well as the government 's nervousness about the country 's history . ",
        "the ban came after some russian lawmakers and other public figures watched the movie and urged the ministry to keep it out of from theaters . `` this is a vicious and absolutely inappropriate ` comedy ' that smears the memory of our people who defeated nazism , '' a group of russian cultural figures said in a letter to the culture ministry that was carried by russian news agencies . `` the release of the film on the eve of celebrations marking the 75th anniversary of the battle of stalingrad is a spit in the face of all those who died there . ",
        "`` communist lawmaker elena drapeko denounced the film as a `` provocation , an attempt to convince us that our country is horrible , people are idiots and our rulers are fools . `` vladislav kononov , the executive director of the russian military-historical society called the movie `` disgusting . '' `` it 's an abomination and filth , '' kononov told state-funded rt television . `` all the characters are portrayed as idiots . they could have been tyrants , but they were n't idiots . it 's how the west sees our people . `` opinion polls show that stalin , who led the soviet union from 1924 until his death in 1953 , remains widely revered in russia , where many credit him with leading the country to victory in world war ii and making it a nuclear superpower . ",
        "president vladimir putin , a former kgb officer , has taken a cautious stance on stalin 's role in russia 's history , denouncing the purges but also emphasizing soviet-era achievements . many russians have been dismayed in recent years by government-sponsored school textbooks that painted stalin in a largely positive light . old soviet national anthem lyrics praising stalin were restored during a moscow subway station 's reconstruction . last fall , the russian military-historical society , an organization founded by putin and led by his culture minister , unveiled a bust of stalin as part of an `` alley of rulers '' in a park outside its moscow offices . ",
        "kremlin critics have denounced such actions as attempts to whitewash stalin 's image and part of putin 's rollback on democracy .   "
