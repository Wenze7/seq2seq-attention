        "from the diary of ann margaretwednesday , july 2 , 2014i was down at the beach , going for a morning swim , when a big wave knocked me down . the cold water engulfed my body and ran shivers up my spine . it 's so unlike florida , where i used to vacation with my family every summer . we would get a house in the keys , and my sisters and i would snorkel every day , swimming with the fishes in the warm clear water . i was just thinking about how that felt like paradise and dewey was so much worse when i felt strong arms pull me up . ",
        "oh , mel . -- you look like you need a hand , he said , as he held me in his arms . i felt my body melt , and i did n't want the moment to end . his body felt so warm and strong pressed against mine . i wanted him to hold me for the rest of the day . i looked at him and wanted to say something , but the words did n't come out . i felt like a schoolgirl struck dumb by shock and unable to speak , doing everything i could to savor the moment . ",
        "mel is so much more attractive during the light of day ; in fact , he 's the most handsome man i 've ever met . he has dreamy , piercing eyes that stare deep into my soul . i can tell that he takes such good care of his body . he looks like he was chiseled from marble , a statue from antiquity that people would travel from far and wide to see . and to touch . he 's so muscular , but not overly so . he 's strong enough to effortlessly carry me , but i 'm still able to wrap my arms all the way around him . ",
        "he carried me out to where the water was deeper , and i floated in his arms . then he suddenly tossed me into the air . as i watched the sun glisten off his wet muscles , my stomach leaped into my chest . i did n't know if i was more scared or excited when i splashed down into his arms . we stared into each other 's eyes , and for a brief moment , i knew that his feelings for me were as strong as mine were for him . he smiled at me with those cute dimples and i felt a warm emotion creep over my entire being when a big wave came and knocked us both over . ",
        "mel laughed and helped me up again , but then he swam away . it was a brief moment , but it was a memorable one . if he enjoyed that moment as much as i did , we 'll make beautiful babies together . i 'm sure he 'll be a good dad . he 'll throw our kids into the air and catch them and teach them how to build sand castles and always make time for them . he would n't miss his daughter playing tennis in the state championship game because he had to work on the weekend . ",
        "mel would be there . he 's such a good man . in the afternoon , we all went back to the house to grill . all of our friends were around . desmond was flipping burgers . julia was making ceviche from scratch . daniela was playing bartender , blending tropical drinks for ray , hank , and olive . mel brought his guitar and sang some songs . the others were n't paying attention , they were mainly chatting with one another . maybe they heard him sing too many times . but he had my full , undivided attention . ",
        "i felt like i was receiving a solo concert . i do n't normally like reggae , but there 's something about his voice that captivates me -- it 's strong and soothing , and it wrapped me in a cocoon of warmth . i had no idea mel was so talented ; he sounds like he could be on the radio . one song was very catchy . i do n't remember the whole thing , but one part i remember clearly : take my hand , take my whole life too , but i ca n't help falling in love with you . ",
        "* i feel a connection with mel , and i 'm enjoying our time together . i do n't want this week to end . maybe delaware is paradise after all . even though mel and i have enjoyed a few moments together , i 'm worried we are n't moving fast enough . before i know it , the week will be over and he might be gone from my life forever . i know how much he likes to look at the stars in the sky , so i have a plan . i 'm going to surprise mel by waking him up early in the morning so that we can see venus and then watch the sunrise together . ",
        "it will be so romantic . i ca n't wait to feel him hold me in his arms and kiss me as the sun rises . * editor 's note : anne does n't seem to recognize the lyrics to `` ca n't help falling in love '' by elvis presley and then covered by ub40.the july 3 , 2014 , entry will be published next week .
