        "tax season 2018 is around the corner and there are key items professionals and small business should be aware of . one of the best tips that i can offer someone who is looking to reduce their stress levels around tax time and concerning their tax return is to try to get more organized for the coming year . the better organized you are , the more prepared you will fill . tax time comes around once a year , but for business professionals it might feel like decades . below are tips we share with clients to help reduce the stress and time spent on tax , and financial documentation in general . ",
        "determine whether to itemize or not to itemizeas an individual , you basically have two options , itemized deductions or a standard deduction , with how you want to file your individual 1040 , and making that decision now will help your figure out what you need to save and keep track of during the year . it 's easier to take the standard deduction , but you may save a bundle if you itemize , especially if you are self-employed , own a home or live in a high-tax area . it 's worth the bother when your qualified expenses add up to more than the 2017 standard deduction of $ 6,350 for singles and $ 12,700 for married couples filing jointly . ",
        "many deductions are well known , such as those for mortgage interest and charitable donations . however , taxpayers sometimes overlook miscellaneous expenses , which are deductible if the combined amount adds up to more than 2 % of your adjusted gross income . these deductions include tax-preparation fees , job-hunting expenses , business car expenses and professional dues . one thing to keep in mind is that not every dollar you spend will be deductible -- for the 2017 tax years , the expenses you are seeking to itemize must exceed 10 percent of your adjusted gross income . ",
        "another thing to remember is that everyone , whatever your filing status , is eligible for a standard deduction . for single filer taxpayers , the standard deduction is $ 6,300 -- it is important to work with your cpa such like our firm so you receive the maximum deduction . if you choose to itemize your deductions you will , in general , have to keep track of more documentation during the year . some of the most common itemized tax deductions include , but are not limited to medical expenses , charitable contributions , state and local taxes , foreign taxes , mortgage interest deductions , mortgage points , health insurance if you are self employed , and losses related to natural disasters . ",
        "there are many more options out there , so be sure to work with your tax adviser to stay current . keep detailed business expensesif you are running a small business or startup , and are trying to claim certain items as business expenses during the year , you are going to have to justify these expenses to the irs . we recommend to always saving , or track , any items you think you might even want to claim as a business expense . one of my favorite methods of saving business expenses is to send everything electronically so i can save the emails for tax time , or have it come through the app . ",
        "always make sure to keep a back up of your documents . track your donations and duesif you donate to different charitable organizations and groups , or even pay dues for professional organizations , which can range from animal rights groups to dues paid for for realtors and even cpas , you might be able to take that contribution , or a portion of it , as a tax deduction . you will either receive an email at the end of the year letting you know how much you had donated , or will receive a receipt explaining how much of your payment or contribution is tax deductible . ",
        "in my experience these organizations are very good at providing this documentation , but if you have not received your documentation by the end of january i would follow with an email or phone call . know the tax due datesapril is well known as tax month , but there are several other dates that are important during the year . quarterly taxes for your business , for example , are due the 15th of april , june , september , and january , so make sure to file and pay if you need to . lastly , you should have received all of your tax documents , including w-2 's and any 1099 's , by january 31st . ",
        "if you find yourself missing documentation be sure to reach out to keep yourself from falling behind . your outreach efforts might include your ira program manager , former employers , or companies you did some consulting for during the year . again , most organizations in my experience are very good at getting these documents out the door , but it is important to keep an eye on where these documents are . if you ca n't finish your return on time , make sure you file form 4868 by april 17 , 2018 . form 4868 gives you a six-month extension of the filing deadline until october 15 , 2018 . ",
        "on the form , you need to make a reasonable estimate of your tax liability for 2017 and pay any balance due with your request . requesting an extension in a timely manner is especially important if you end up owing tax to the irs . if you file and pay late , the irs can slap you with a late-filing penalty of 4.5 percent per month of the tax owed and a late-payment penalty of 0.5 percent a month of the tax due . the maximum late filing penalty is 22.5 percent and the late-payment penalty tops out at 25 percent . ",
        "by filing form 4868 , you stop the clock running on the costly late-filing penalty . be aware of potential deductionsthe tax code is very complex and there are numerous tax deductions to consider .   ",
