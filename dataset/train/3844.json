        "it started after my big move . after living in europe for a year and half , i realized i needed to come home to the united states , take a break from traveling , save money , and focus on my writing over everything else for at least six months . at first , i was ecstatic about moving . finally , i would get to see my family again after an entire year apart . i would get to walk my dog and binge watch tv shows with my sisters and hang out at my grandma 's house . ",
        "i would get to sleep in my own bed instead of a hostel full of snoring strangers . i was sure that i would be so comfortable back in my hometown , surrounded by my loved ones , that the transition would be seamless . and if it had been , i would n't be writing this piece . i 've always been an over thinker . even as a little kid , i would often stay up late , reading and writing , unable to sleep . as i got older , i realized that i was probably dealing with some mild anxiety , but it never really interfered with my daily life and responsibilities -- my negative thoughts were more like white noise in the back of my head , a humming sound i could tune out most of the time . ",
        "but about a month ago , the volume turned up . a few days after i returned home , i found myself laying in bed for up to 14 hours a day , my heart racing , trying to breath deeply and calm down . i was too scared to drive myself anywhere , so i texted my mom and asked her to bring me to urgent care so i could get my vitals checked . to my surprise , everything was fine . a couple days later , i went to my primary care doctor for blood work -- my vitamin d was low , which accounted for the fatigue , but he recognized that my other symptoms were most likely linked to anxiety brought on by my move and accompanying lifestyle changes . ",
        "he was on the right track -- but i think the source of my current anxiety is much bigger than that . i know that some people would rather dismiss millennials ' struggles with mental health as a bunch of sensitive snowflakes whining about nothing , but our problems are not `` all in our heads . '' the world seems like it 's on the brink of a major tipping point , and we 're all just hoping it will tip in our favor . beyond my own personal struggles , i find myself getting most worried when my mind turns to problems that affect humanity on a global scale . ",
        "i do n't just worry about my career path or making enough money as a freelancer or where i should move to next . i worry about being able to afford basic healthcare in a couple years . about being able to pay the rent on just a small studio apartment with my boyfriend . about whether or not we will ever be able to afford a home of our own . i wonder if i will ever get to enjoy a break from working as i grow older -- will i be able to retire ? or will i be grinding away until i 'm six feet under ? ",
        "what will the world even look like by the time i 'm in my 60s or 70s ? will my little hometown on a barrier island exist ? or will it be swamped by rising sea levels ? i know we 're not the first generation to live in a time of global anxiety and fear -- after all , our grandparents lived through world war ii . our parents grew up during the cold war . i certainly do n't have it the worst of all my ancestors , but my fears are n't exactly unwarranted -- which makes it difficult to convince myself to stop worrying . ",
        "so much of the advice i 've read about dealing with anxiety suggests that i should learn to identify irrational thoughts . but what do i do if my concerns are real ? what if my mind is n't just going haywire and creating hypothetical problems -- what if the things i 'm scared of are very likely to happen ? maybe the answer lies with mindfulness and living in the present . or maybe unplugging and going off the grid for a bit will help . maybe i just need to accept that the future really might go to shit , i 'll never have total control , and my only job is to make the best of it while i 'm here . ",
        "it 's such an easy sentence to write down , and such a difficult philosophy to actually live by . for me , anxiety seems like nothing more than the rational response to the current state of our political system and society . perhaps if i find a way to channel all of that anxious energy into positive efforts for change , i 'll feel at peace again .
