        "the raiders seem primed to make jon gruden an offer he ca n't refuse . a day after firing coach jack del rio , the raiders reportedly have plans in place to hire gruden away from his analyst job at espn with a list of incentives that could include ownership stake in the team . while gruden has flirted with potential coaching opportunities since 2009 but chosen to stay on the `` monday night football '' broadcast instead , the oakland job has appeal for him beyond another chance in the nfl . he would be returning to the team he coached from 1998-2001 , when he led then-owner al davis ' squad from the bottom of the division to the playoffs in his last two years . ",
        "this time around , gruden would get the chance to work with franchise quarterback derek carr , whom he likes , and work under davis ' son , mark davis , who has `` an affinity for him , '' a source told espn . additionally , when the raiders move to their new stadium in las vegas in 2020 , gruden would not have to pay state income tax on what is likely to be a hefty contract . in order for davis to hold true on his reported ownership-stake offer , however , the owners of all 32 teams would have to sign off on gruden 's contract , which some may not be willing to do in fear of establishing a precedent they do n't want , according to espn . ",
        "gruden , who also coached the buccaneers from 2002-08 and won a super bowl in his first season after the raiders traded him away in a rare coach transfer , only went so far as to say he has had conversations about potential jobs . `` i do n't want to sit here and speculate . ... there is no news to report , '' gruden said saturday . `` i ca n't say i have n't taken any phone calls . i take a lot every year from coaches , some others . ... yeah , sometimes owners . ",
        "guys want to bounce ideas off me . i 'm here to help people . '' gruden , 54 , has toyed with the idea of returning to the nfl before , but many believe the raiders deal could be the one to lure him out of the broadcast booth . though he has forged a second career at espn and is said to be the network 's highest-paid talent , with a reported salary of about $ 6.5 million per year , he has hinted that he 'd return to the sideline one day .
