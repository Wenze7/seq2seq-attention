        "it is better to attach oneself to greater entities , even as an insignificant follower , then to be in a leadership position with lowly entities . the recent spectacular events at the united nations with us ambassador to the un nikki haley and the state of israel were not just political drama . at another level , there has been a wildlife drama playing out . in 1755 , voltaire attacked the authenticity of scripture , referring to the account of samson capturing 300 foxes , tying them to fire-brands and setting them to the crops of the philistines . ",
        "voltaire mocked the story , noting that it is impossible to find 300 foxes at any one time . foxes are solitary creatures ; if one finds a fox , there will not be another anywhere nearby . but voltaire was making a fundamental mistake . the creatures that samson captured were not foxes . the hebrew word `` shu'al '' does not refer to the fox . instead , it refers to an animal in the same family : the jackal . whereas foxes are solitary animals , jackals band together in large groups . the reason for the mistranslation was that biblical scholarship had moved away from the land of israel and into europe , where there were no jackals and people were unfamiliar with them . ",
        "the animals of the bible are the animals of the land of israel . translators and readers of the bible always interpret its animal life in terms of the animals with which they are familiar ; but if they are living in the united states or europe , then the animals with which they are familiar are not necessarily going to be the right animals . it was not foxes that samson captured , but rather a pack of jackals . in 1981 , then-democratic senator daniel p. moynihan , a former us ambassador to the un , wrote an article entitled `` joining the jackals , '' in which he sharply criticized the carter administration for supporting an anti-israel resolution in the un . ",
        "the title was borrowed from an earlier washington post editorial of the same title , which described the un as a pack of jackals that shamelessly hounds israel . moynihan observed that the carter administration 's downfall was brought about by a failed approach to the un , which was in denial of the innate hostility of the un toward both the us and israel , and which failed to stand up for true moral standards . three thousand years ago , jerusalem became the capital of the jewish nation of israel , housing the temple . throughout the exile and dispersion , the jewish people prayed for the rebuilding of this city , which finally happened with the modern state of israel . ",
        "the emblem of the city of jerusalem is the lion , which appears in last week 's torah portion as the symbol of the tribe of judah . judah was the tribe from which the kings of israel arose , and was therefore symbolized by the lion , king of beasts . the kings of israel reigned from the capital city of jerusalem , which the prophet isaiah called ariel , `` lion of god . '' when the united states -- first congress in 1995 , and then president donald trump and ambassador haley last week -- acknowledged jerusalem as being the capital of israel , they took on the lion 's cause . ",
        "and , when they stood against the condemnations of the world , they took on the lion 's courage . proverbs 30:30 declares that `` the lion is the mightiest of animals , and does not turn away before anyone . '' the original hebrew of this verse , `` velo yashuv mipnei kol , '' can perhaps more accurately be translated as saying that the lion does not turn away even before everyone . it is not just any individual animal of which the lion is unafraid ; it is not even afraid of masses of animals together . ",
        "not even a huge pack of jackals . the us has adopted the lion 's cause , and , like the lion , has stood unafraid of the jackals . the mishnah states , in its common translation , `` be a tail to lions and not a head to foxes . '' yet as with samson , the animals being mentioned here are not foxes , but rather jackals . be a tail to lions , and not a head to jackals -- it is better to attach oneself to greater entities , even as an insignificant follower , then to be in a leadership position with lowly entities . ",
        "guatemala , in stating that it will follow america 's lead and move its embassy to jerusalem , has recognized this , and several other countries are poised to follow suit . let us hope that other nations will recognize the wisdom and morality in following the leadership of the lion rather than joining the jackals . the author is the founder and director of the biblical museum of natural history in beit shemesh , www . biblicalnaturalhistory . org .
