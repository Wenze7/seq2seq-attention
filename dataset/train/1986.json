        "as much of the hype nowadays is how to create good and healthy routines , and how nearly all of this starts with a good morning routine , i thought i would chip in with how i make sure i get out of bed the minute my alarm rings , every morning . it is very simple , i have an alarm next to the bed which goes off at , let 's say 05:59 , and then i have another which goes off at 06:00 in the kitchen . the alarm next to the bed makes a nice and soft sound , whereas the one in the kitchen goes off like the fog horn on a cruise ship that will wake up the entire block . ",
        "that 'll get you up in the mornings ! and when you are there , you might as well get on with your day , for example by doing 75 kettlebell swings before anything else . if you can do that you have already won the morning , and through that , the day . if you want to know what to do after your swings , then a few good examples could be to journal , make and eat a good and nutritious breakfast , thank an old friend or colleague for an impact they have had on your life or plan out the rest of your day . ",
        "i also do a few other things to make the mornings as easy and pleasant as possible : making sure my smart coffee machine grinds the beans 7 minutes before the alarm goes off , so the fresh coffee is ready as i walk in to the kitchen . have my smart light in the bedroom turn on with low brightness in a blue colour 30 minutes before the alarms goes off . go to bed on time and according to a more or less consistent pattern every day . i always go for 8 hours , because that is what i believe makes me feel best . ",
        "there are tons of studies saying anywhere from 3 -- 9 hours per night is the optimum but for me 8 works . yeah , but you have probably always found it easy to get upabsolutely not , nothing could be further from the truth . i always struggle in the mornings , and if i am left to sleep without an alarm clock set , i will easily sleep for 10 -- 12 hours straight . i can however get out of bed if i `` have to '' , and once i am there i can easily get on with something instead of going back to bed .
