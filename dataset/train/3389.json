        "a few modular smartphone projects may have come and gone , but motorola is holding strong with the snappable moto mods on its moto z smartphone family . there 's a good collection of motorola handsets that support these mods -- from the midrange moto z2 play to the flagship moto z2 force smartphones -- and two new moto mods announced at ces 2018 mean there are now more than 15 mods available . the latest additions are vital inc. 's vital moto mod , which measures five metrics including heart rate , blood pressure , and core body temperature ; and livermorium 's keyboard mod , which adds a physical keyboard to the attached moto z phone . ",
        "in our vital moto mod and livermorium keyboard moto mod hands-on review , we see if it 's worth swapping to the moto z family to try these mods out . vital moto modjulian chokkattu/digital trendsthe vital moto mod is a glimpse of a future that 's much closer than you may realize . it 's a health-focused device that does n't really need to be a moto mod , but it 's easier for vital usa inc. . to bring the product to market with the help of lenovo and motorola . the moto mod tracks five vitals : heart rate ; pulse oximetry , or the amount of oxygen in the blood ; respiratory rate , or the number of breaths you take per minute ; core body temperature ; and blood pressure . ",
        "the reason why it stands alone as its own product is because it connects to a moto z phone via bluetooth -- most mods usually secure a connection through pogo pins . you can still slap the vital moto mod to the back of a moto z smartphone and it will connect magnetically , but it also works when it 's off the phone . naturally , the vital moto mod works exclusively with moto z phones , but you can imagine -- and vital inc. . confirmed this -- that a product down the line would be available for just about any smartphone on the market . ",
        "vital inc. . said the data is incredibly accurate , but the mod does n't replace your doctor . the mod is ridiculously chunky , but it 's not a problem because it does n't need to be attached to your phone all the time . to track all your vitals , simply insert your left index finger through the blood pressure monitor on the back , and hold your hand and the mod up close to your chest . the hole your finger is in contracts just like a normal blood pressure monitor on your arm . you have to keep still for about 110 seconds to let it track several things , and when you 're done , you can lift the mod up to your forehead and stay still for a few seconds just to get your core body temperature . ",
        "the process is dead simple , and largely involves just a few minutes of your time -- like a visit to the doctor . it worked without a hitch for me , and my vitals are surprisingly in a healthy range . vital inc. . said the data is incredibly accurate , but the mod does n't replace your doctor . it 's meant more to help keep track of your health , and see when your vitals change based on the level of your daily activity -- you can even share this data with your physician . in the app , you can see the readings as well as graphs that show you if your health is above or below average . ",
        "there 's room for improvement here , though , as we think the app could benefit from a coach or more tools to help you understand what some of these numbers mean . the data stored by vital is compliant with the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 , which means you 're in charge of who has access to your medical information . the ability to track all these vitals within a matter of minutes , and store this data for historical record , is impressive . we ca n't wait for this device to work with various smartphones , as it provides a real benefit . ",
        "the vital moto mod is expected to launch early this year , and price has n't been confirmed , but it 's likely to cost somewhere in the $ 300 to $ 400 range . livermorium moto modthe livermorium moto mod spawned from motorola 's `` transform the smartphone '' indiegogo campaign that challenged people to come up with unique and useful moto mods . livermorium raised the most funds for its keyboard moto mod . it does exactly what the name suggests -- add a keyboard to your moto z smartphone . if you 're longing for phones like the t-mobile sidekick , then this is a mod for you . ",
        "magnetically attach the mod to the back of a compatible moto z phone , and simply slide out the back to reveal a full , backlit qwerty keyboard . you can angle the keyboard toward you so it 's more comfortable to hold , and you can easily turn off the backlight . it felt comfortable to use , with satisfying buttons and enough room between the keys -- it did n't feel cramped . you 'll find android navigation keys on the keyboard itself , and while it could activate the native android split-screen mode , it did not activate google assistant -- you 'll have to use the touchscreen or your voice . ",
        "the indiegogo campaign model featured a battery in the mod to add even more value , but it looks like the first batches the company is shipping do not have a battery . that 's a shame , because the mod is already incredibly thick . that 's the biggest downside of the keyboard moto mod , because it feels like you 're holding a brick when it 's attached to a phone . die-hard physical keyboard fans will certainly be interested , but considering the mod costs $ 100 and the fact that moto z phones are n't exactly cheap , we recommend finding a phone with an embedded physical keyboard .
