        "bloomberg via getty imagesthe republican lawmakers have sold the corporate portion of their tax cuts with the claim that it is actually about helping workers . their argument is that the corporate tax cut will lead to so much growth that the increase in wages will actually be considerably larger than the tax cut itself . the gop 's story is that lower corporate taxes inevitably mean more investment , which means higher wages for more workers , as well as increased imports and greater productivity . the vast majority of economists have questioned this basic logic , because in the past , investment has not been highly responsive to after-tax rates of profit . ",
        "but that did n't stop the republican-controlled congress from passing the tax bill . and now , in an effort to build public support for the corporate tax cut , several major corporations have been announcing bonuses and pay raises for workers . at&t announced that it would give a one-time bonus of $ 1,000 to 200,000 workers . its rival comcast also promised a $ 1,000 bonus for 100,000 workers . fifth third bancorp promised a $ 1,000 bonus for 13,500 employees , while raising its minimum wage to $ 15 an hour . wells fargo said it would raise its minimum wage to $ 15 an hour , too . ",
        "boeing announced a $ 300 million fund to be spent on training workers , upgrading facilities and matching workers ' charitable contributions . while the employees getting these increases will undoubtedly be pleased , there are a few caveats that must be kept in mind . first , many of these announcements refer to one-time bonuses , not permanent pay hikes . this is not what the gop promised . the corporate tax cuts were made permanent on the grounds that companies needed the expectation of higher future after-tax profits in order to justify greater investment today . if the economy is following the course predicted by the republicans , all these pay increases should be permanent , too . ",
        "the second caveat is that some of the increases may have little to do with the tax cut . they can be attributed instead to the tightening labor market , along with higher minimum wage laws . this is especially true of wells fargo , which is based in california . the state has already passed into law a $ 15 minimum wage , which is scheduled to be fully phased in by 2022 . wells fargo will be getting there a bit more quickly if it adopts its $ 15 minimum in 2018 . it will also be applying that hike in parts of the country where the federal minimum wage of $ 7.25 an hour still sets the standard , but even in these other areas , a tightening labor market is putting upward pressure on wages . ",
        "last summer , target announced that it would get to a minimum wage of $ 15 an hour by 2020 . that announcement had no obvious connection to any expectation of a corporate tax cut . third , but perhaps most significantly , these pay hikes are not especially large relative to the size of the corporate tax cut . take the example of at&t : in 2016 , the company reported operating income , net of interest , of $ 19.4 billion . it paid $ 6.5 billion in taxes , which means an effective tax rate of 33.5 percent . ",
        "if it had instead paid the 21 percent tax rate in the new bill , at&t 's savings would be $ 2.4 billion . the promised bonus for 200,000 employees comes to $ 200 million , or less than one-tenth the size of the tax cut . this is very much in line with the expectations of tax bill critics , who predicted that the overwhelming majority of the money that corporations now get to keep will end up as higher profits paid out to shareholders , not as permanently higher wages for workers . but the real question is not the immediate split between wages and payouts to shareholders . ",
        "the republican story of tax cut blessings rests on a great surge in investment . we should begin to know if that is going to happen very soon . after all , companies were obviously following the tax cut debate over the last two months and presumably began to make plans as to what they would do if the bill passed . so if there is going to be the huge upsurge in investment predicted by tax cut supporters , it should be showing up in the data on orders for capital goods almost immediately . and it should be a very large upturn , not just the normal increase to be expected in an economy that has been strengthening for the last eight years . ",
        "until we get those data , we have little basis to judge whether the tax cut will deliver the economic growth and pay increases the republicans said would happen . this display of corporate beneficence to workers and communities is nice , but it has to be understood as part of a public relations campaign . it tells us nothing about whether the tax cut will ultimately deliver to workers the gains promised by its proponents . more : republican politicsrepublican partymicroeconomicsaccountingeconomy .
