        "defining what you want to do for a living is not an easy task , and certainly not for a recently graduated 16-year-old girl . at that time , my mindset was : `` i want to do something technology-related , so engineering will be . but which engineering path ? let 's see , i like mobile technologies and communication . so , telecommunication engineering , here i come ! '' i loved my field of study . but , what i loved the most was the fact that every technical project we had needed a written report . ",
        "so , i had good time writing project reports and explaining all their technical details . i was having a ball ! to be honest , and i realize that it might be narcissistic of me to say , not everyone in the class was having the same good time as i was . slowly , more and more of my college mates started asking me to write papers for them . and that 's how , without knowing it , i learnt the most valuable thing about being a technical writer : people are willing to tell you all related to their projects and products , as long as they do n't have to write ! ",
        "they want somebody else to explain the details to the world . simply put , they want you to be their perfect translation buddy ! and here is a good part : they are willing to pay for that . and best of all : you are constantly learning new things ! by the end of college , my passion was defined and my pocket was happy . so , i wanted to continue doing this . but how would i find this dream job without even knowing what it was called in the real world ? i browsed a jobs portal and entered the magic words : `` engineering '' , `` writer '' , `` documents '' , and ta-da ! ",
        "the openings for technical writers appeared . after applying to some technical writer positions , i got the opportunity to work for a software development company . there , i found a group of smart developers and technical specialists who would rather write a piece of code than a presentation that explains how the code added value to the product . my formal documentation journey had started . i created a list of drafts and a set of questions i needed to ask to get all the product information . after initial mistakes and errors , i understood that unless i truly used and worked with a product , i would n't get to know it . ",
        "i learned another lesson : if a technical writer does not fully understand their product , they wo n't ever be able to explain it to others . it is like you are giving directions to someone in a city you have been living for just one day . this was five years ago . now i can tell you for sure that being a technical writer challenges you and teaches you everyday . it forces you to develop a set of hard - and soft-skills you did n't know you had , like assertive communication , accepting feedback , critical thinking , empathy towards the user , and so on . ",
        "the future is bright . from here , the career is like a long-branched tree where the main trunk is the perfect technical and communication mix .   "
