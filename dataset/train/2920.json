        "charlotte , n. c. -- jimmie johnson strolled into the charlotte convention center and did a double-take when he saw fernando alonso hanging out in a hallway . `` what 's he doing here ? '' nascar 's seven-time champion wondered . alonso made the trip to north carolina to make an appearance at nascar 's annual preseason media tour . no , a ride in nascar is not imminent , but the two-time formula one champion is about to embark on his first major sports car race . alonso will race this weekend in the rolex 24 hours at daytona for united autosports , the sports car team owned by his mclaren f1 boss , zak brown . ",
        "it was brown who paved the way for alonso to compete in last year 's indianapolis 500 , and he is helping the spaniard knock prestigious races off his wish list . alonso spent about 10 minutes chatting with johnson , and the duo was eventually joined by sports car aces scott pruett and joey hand , who were brought to the nascar event by imsa to help promote the rolex , and then cup champion kevin harvick . the meet-and-greet with alonso was a thrill for johnson . alonso was equally impressed . `` the first time i heard his name it was probably 2003 on the nascar video game , '' alonso said tuesday . ",
        "`` i used to choose him , not knowing him , just because of the car . i remember playing with another friend of mine , he likes a chocolate company i will not name now , and he was choosing that car and i was choosing jimmie 's car . `` but that was the first time i heard of him , and obviously the success that he has in the years in motor racing , he became a legend of our sport , and massive respect . `` johnson said he 's always been a fan of alonso 's and spent some time telling alonso how well he ran in the indianapolis 500 last may . ",
        "alonso led 27 laps and seemed to be in contention for the win until his engine expired 21 laps from the finish . `` he handled himself so well , really did a great job , and i think brought a lot to the table , '' johnson said . `` he brought worldwide attention to motorsports and it was really good for us here stateside . `` while in nascar country , alonso was asked about potentially trying a stock car someday . it 's not something that could happen soon , he said , but it is something he 'd like to at least attempt . ",
        "`` right now , it looks quite far . the driving technique and the experience all those guys have , it 's difficult for me to achieve that level , '' alonso said . `` i will never know until i try , so i would like one day to test a car and after that , driving the car , i will know how enjoyable it will be in racing . `` outside , the races are great because they are all in a group , it is not predictable at all and until the last lap , you do n't know what is going to happen . ",
        "we love watching from the outside , but i do n't know from the inside . `` alonso has so far only had three days of testing at daytona in the sports car to adjust to a closed cockpit , as well as driving at night and in traffic . trying different series has been a thrill for him , and he 's still eyeing a way to get le mans on his schedule . `` it 's one thing that i would like to do , i would like to compete in the best races in the world , and le mans and is one of the top races , '' he said . ",
        "`` if that day will be this year or not is still to be discussed , but maybe yes . ''   "
