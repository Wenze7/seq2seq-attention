        "when it comes to making an olympic team , the first cut is not the deepest -- the last one is . while 555 athletes made the 2014 u. s. team for sochi , hundreds of talented men and women stayed home . the difference might have been a fraction of a second , a judge 's point of view or a `` coaches ' discretion '' clause in the qualifying criteria . had fate shifted slightly four years ago , mirai nagasu might have earned an olympic medal or two if the u. s. selection committee had taken the top three at nationals , as expected , rather than skaters who finished first , second and fourth . ",
        "similarly , alex rigsby might have been one of the three u. s. goalies to claim a silver medal in hockey , and annie o'shea might have found the podium in skeleton . all three athletes are hoping to compete at the 2018 games . nagasu 's moment of truth will begin wednesday in san jose , california , at the u. s. figure skating championships , where the olympic team will be named after the event concludes . o'shea will have to wait for the u. s. skeleton team announcement on jan. . 15 . rigsby has already secured a berth on the u. s. olympic hockey team , whose roster was announced on jan. . ",
        "1 . in separate interviews , the three athletes explained how they swept up their shattered dreams in 2014 and started aiming for gold in february . all went through shock , made major changes and came up with new ways to approach pyeongchang . none of it was easy , but their stories offer instructive coping strategies for anyone facing similar setbacks . absorbing the shockwhen nagasu was passed over for sochi , she said , `` i wanted to wash my hands of figure skating . i was so unhappy and so unsatisfied that that one decision could make me feel so , so sad and depressed . '' ",
        "she had placed fourth at the 2010 vancouver games , and no one else on the 2014 women 's olympic figure skating team had olympic experience . `` yes , u. s. figure skating wants who may be best suited for the team , but do i completely agree with the decision to jump me ? '' she said four years later . `` i do n't know . but it was n't my decision . sometimes i get speeding tickets , and i do n't think i deserve it , but you just have to pay the ticket . ",
        "skating is the same way . `` rigsby , the goalie , was devastated when she did n't hear her name on the olympic roster -- not only because she thought she had put up a good performance but also because she had grown up playing with and against a lot of the women who made the team , such as forward hilary knight and captain meghan duggan . `` all these lifelong friends , '' rigsby said , `` so it was tough for both sides -- to see them make it and me get cut . `` making necessary changesto cope , nagasu , who was 20 at the time , decided to change her life completely . ",
        "in april 2014 , she moved from california to colorado , changed coaches and enrolled in classes at the university of colorado-colorado springs . `` i needed to leave the nest and make decisions on my own , '' she said . `` honestly , it was the best thing i could have done . in colorado , we have the ice all day , and i can take breaks . it 's much better for my mental health . `` working with coach tom zakrajsek felt better , too . `` humans make mistakes , and tom will understand that . ",
        "frank was very meticulous , and he always wanted me to be ` on . ' i could n't always deliver that , '' she said of her current and former coaches . in addition , becoming independent made nagasu realize that if `` i want this for myself , i have to motivate myself . it 's not my parents pushing me anymore . `` o'shea , the skeleton athlete , also made changes , but she directed most of them inward . during a trip home , her friend 's father recognized her deep dismay and recommended she hire a life coach . ",
        "o'shea was skeptical . `` i was like , ` ok , maybe . it 's probably not for me . ' `` yet she decided to buy a new sled , even though it seemed extravagant . `` eventually , i decided to spend the money and invest everything in myself . if it works , awesome . if it does n't , then i know i tried everything . that sled worked . my new mindset worked . and i did get a life coach . `` o'shea 's life coach , she said , taught her to `` stop over-trying . ",
        "stop trying to be perfect . walk away every day really happy with what i accomplished . '' but it was tough . despite being a self-described `` control freak , '' o'shea had to be ok with failing . instead of trying to force the feeling of effortlessness down the track , she let things happen . the result ? `` i felt like a different person on the sled , '' she said . `` i was not careless . i was carefree . '' and it led to two medals in the 2015-2016 season -- including her first gold in a world cup race -- and a fifth place at the world championships . ",
        "`` the year was just effortless , '' she said . rigsby also kept trying to improve . she returned to the university of wisconsin for her senior year and helped the badgers reach the ncaa semifinals . `` the next year , i decided that i was n't ready to give up my dream , '' she said . one of the u. s. goalies in sochi , jessie vetter , became rigsby 's training buddy and mentor , and that helped as well . `` i was so fortunate to be able to learn from her , '' rigsby said . ",
        "in pyeongchang , the u. s. will have three new olympic goalies , and rigsby will be the oldest . creating a new approach for 2018once again , as the olympic clock counts down the days to the opening ceremony , athletes will either make the cut or stay home . o'shea has a different mindset this time . `` last year , i kind of went backwards and expected to do well because i had done well . i forgot everything i 'd worked on . when last year ended , i said , ` i 'm going to spend all my time with family this summer and be really happy in life . ' ",
        "now i really like who i am . i really like where i 'm headed . i 'm just gon na let it happen and see what happens . `` meanwhile , nagasu is fired up to prove to the u. s. selection committee that she ca n't be ignored in 2018 . `` i 'm making myself a résumé that they ca n't say no to , '' she said . in september , nagasu landed a triple axel , making her one of just three american women to land the jump in competition . . in november , nagasu placed fourth at the nhk trophy in osaka , japan . ",
        "meanwhile , her closest american competitors have struggled . gracie gold , the fourth-place finisher in sochi , has been sitting out this season to address depression , anxiety and an eating disorder . ashley wagner , who placed seventh in sochi , recently struggled with an ankle infection that caused her to stop mid-routine in the free skate at skate america . polina edmunds finished 10th in her only grand prix assignment this season . regardless of what her competition does , nagasu will be ready to fight when she performs her short program on wednesday and long program on friday . ",
        "because if there 's one thing she learned from the massive disappointment of 2014 , she says it 's that `` failure is inevitable -- and it 's the people that keep trying who become successful . ''   "
