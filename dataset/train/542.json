        "this site may earn affiliate commissions from the links on this page . terms of use . electric vehicle buyers get cold feet when it comes to outright buying new evs and plug-in hybrids . instead , they hedge their bets and lease . eighty percent are currently leased versus about 30 percent of all other vehicles , according to bloomberg intelligence . for contrarians and possible risk-takers , there 's a strong argument in favor of buying evs used . at three years of age , some sell for as little as 25 percent of their initial price and there are fewer wear parts , other than the battery . ",
        "most combustion-engine cars retain 35-55 percent of their value at three years of life . electric vehicle lease rates are about 80 % , led by bmw i3 . all other vehicles are about 30 % . chart shows lease rates since december 2014 . lease when you suspect residual is lowevs and plug-ins only have a few years of sales data and residual values that can be tracked . bloomberg quotes the black book auto data analytics group as saying a 2014 ev , now four years old in model-year years , has a residual value of 23 percent of the original list price . ",
        "combustion-engine cars from the same year retain 41 percent of their value , or a whopping 78 percent more . kelly blue says three-year-old car residuals range from 54-57 percent for full-size and mid-size pickups ; with sports cars , vans , and most suvs in the 40s ; and sedans of all sizes , subcompact suvs , and minivans in the 30s . evs are at 27 percent , and comparable combustion engine subcompact and compact cars are at 28 percent and 36 percent , respectively . plus , some automakers , such as nissan and bmw , have been offering lease rates as low as $ 100 per month in some areas , in conjunction with power companies that need to show reduced overall emissions in their regions . ",
        "knowing that , and knowing automakers promote dazzling lease offers from time to time , it 's hard not to consider an ev lease . bmw i3 lease rate is often above 90 % . some months is approaches 100 % . buy when you know used is a good deala three-year-old ev for ten to twelve grand is not a bad deal , especially if the battery is warranted for at least five more years , either via the original warranty or an extended warranty if the car is offered through a dealer certified used-car program . outside of the battery , there are fewer parts to age and wear out : no engine , no fuel pump , no muffler , and no catalytic converter . ",
        "bloomberg found a cream puff 2015 nissan leaf for $ 12,000 on cars . com with just 5,500 miles and a battery warranted until 2023 . its range when new was rated at 84 miles , but the current 2018 leaf is rated at 150 miles , and within 24 months there 'll be a 200-miles-plus leaf . that used example was an outlier because of its low mileage , but there were many in the same range with 20,000-40,000 miles . while the price falloff seems high , remember many evs were sold with $ 7,500 federal tax credits and some state rebates of several thousand dollars . ",
        "so a four-year-old $ 40,000 ev that cost $ 32,500 after the tax credit has an actual residual of 30 percent relative to the selling price . a three-year-old nissan leaf ev may sell for $ 12,000 , one-third its original price . the battery ? it 's warranted until the early 2020s . contrarian thinking works for gasoline cars , toowhile we 're at it , conventional wisdom can be turned on its head dealing with mainstream cars . to wit : leasing a new car works best when it has a very high residual value . the lease amount is actually on the loan on the difference in value between the car when new and 24 or 36 months later . ",
        "according to kbb , in the 10 vehicles for model year 2017 holding their value best were pickups , suvs , and a subaru , retaining 72-55 percent of value after three years , and 58-47 percent after five years : toyota tacoma toyota 4runnerchevrolet silveradojeep wranglertoyota tundrachevrolet coloradohonda ridgelinegmc sierragmc canyonsubaru wrxfor comparison , the best ev for resale value was the 2017 chevrolet bolt ev . but its 36-month residual is just 30 percent , and the five-year residual 18 percent . to make the new car lease a good deal , the automaker may use market development funds to subvent some of the lease cost . ",
        "separately , if you 're looking at a used car , look for ones whose residuals are well below the norm , but with good reliability records . also look for ugly ducklings , sedans in general , and cars from companies that oversold into the rental market . there are lot of rentals and lease cars coming back in 2018 . tech features generally command lower residuals than the rest of the car , so you 'll do well looking at vehicles with lane departure warning , blind spot detection , and adaptive cruise control .
