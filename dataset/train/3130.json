        "bela and martha karolyi , the driving forces behind the u. s. women 's gymnastics team for the past 20 years , were named thursday in a lawsuit filed by a former elite gymnast , who accuses a former usa gymnastics doctor of sexual abuse and says the karolyis were aware of the abuse and failed to stop it while engaging in abusive practices against gymnasts in their own right . the suit , filed in california superior court in los angeles , is the latest in an ongoing series of allegations involving dr. larry nassar , 53 , a former team doctor and trainer for the federation from 1986 through 2015 who has been accused by more than 30 individuals , including a 2000 olympic medalist , of sexual abuse . ",
        "he was fired by usa gymnastics in 2015 . but the suit filed by the former elite gymnast , identified in the lawsuit as jane lm doe , is the first to cite the karolyis , who were the longtime owners of the usa gymnastics women 's national training center in the sam houston national forest in addition to serving as national team coordinators in five olympic games - one for bela karolyi and four for martha karolyi - as defendants . martha , 74 , retired after this summer 's olympics ; bela , 74 , has not had an official role since 2000 . ",
        "according to the lawsuit , the karolyis created a `` toxic environment where was given opportunity to perpetrate and continue his systematic sexual abuse of minor children . `` the suit claims the karolyis also struck and scratched gymnasts , encouraged parents to strike their children , deprived gymnasts of water , searched their rooms to confiscate food , screamed obscenities at minors and cut them off from communications with their parents and forced them to train when they were ill . in combination , the lawsuit claims , the karolyis `` turned a blind eye to sexual abuse of children '' in return for nassar 's `` silence and willful blindness to their regime of fear , intimidation and physical and emotional abuse of minor child gymnasts . ",
        "`` a call for comment to the karolyi ranch was not returned . usa gymnastics denied the allegations against it , emphasizing the organization forwarded athletes ' complaints about nassar to the fbi and severed any connections with him . `` still , the allegations that have been made are troubling , '' usa gymnastics said in a statement . `` due to the pending litigation and ongoing investigation , however , we are unable to comment further . `` the suit , whose defendants include usa gymnastics , former federation president bob colarossi , current federation president steve penny and the california gym where the unidentified gymnast once trained , claims usa gymnastics concealed multiple reports of sexual abuse by nassar and others in an effort to protect its image . ",
        "nassar is accused in the suit , in similar fashion to other complaints against him , of sexually assaulting young women under the guise of medical treatment and being allowed to treat young athletes without chaperones or supervisors present . more than 30 people have accused nassar of sexual abuse since an indianapolis star report in september detailed allegations against him . other specific charges in the latest suit include sexual battery and gender violence against nassar , sexual harassment , unfair business practices , fraud , negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress by all defendants . nassar is the focus of the california lawsuit , but the karolyis have been criticized by some for their coaching methods in their native romania and in the united states , where they moved in the early 1980s and enjoyed immediate success training a group of gymnasts that included olympic and world championship gold medalists mary lou retton , dominique moceanu , kim zmeskal and kerri strug . ",
        "in a 2008 interview with a romania newspaper regarding their coaching careers in romania , where their students included gold medalist nadia comaneci , bela karolyi said : `` some of the girls have bad memories . perhaps others say it was the best time of their lives . `` in the u. s. , moceanu has been the most vocal critic of the karolyis ' training regimen , citing diet restrictions , criticism about her weight in front of her teammates and training requirements that led to multiple injuries . strug , meanwhile , said in 2008 in response to moceanu 's descriptions that `` our perspectives are very different . '' ",
        "she said developing as a world-class gymnast `` will take things that are n't necessarily pleasant '' but added , `` if i had it to do over , i would do the same thing . ''   "
