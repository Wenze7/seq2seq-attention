        "in yesterday 's article , i shared my 1 -- 2 -- 3 goal-setting formula with you . hopefully , you 've already had a chance to dig in and start mapping out your own path to 2018 success . but listen , planning and preparation does n't stop there . i want to take this one step deeper ; let me set the stage by sharing a story . i read an amazing book over 15 years ago that changed my life . it was called `` eat that frog , '' written by brian tracy , a legend in the field of personal development . ",
        "now you might be wondering , what does eating a frog have to do with goal setting ? do n't worry -- brian is n't actually suggesting that you eat a frog . what he means is that you should start your work day focusing on doing the hardest task of the day first . too many people avoid this and they end up in perverse forms of procrastination -- hours of meditation , gratitude journaling , yoga , and watching motivational videos on youtube . this makes them think they are sticking to some type of amazing morning routine , when most of it is unnecessary . ",
        "if you want to be successful , you really need to attack the hardest things first . i 've worked on this very thing for years . every morning , seven days a week , my alarm goes off at 3:59 a. m.i get up without hitting snooze , and get to work on my number-one priority . most days , it 's writing 1,500 words for my newsletters , video scripts , or next book . on sundays , it 's a long meditation session . `` eating that frog '' is one of the important habits in my life , and one you should take up as well -- if you are n't already doing it . ",
        "accountability is key and i can never , ever abandon it . neither should you . this circles back to the 1 -- 2 -- 3 goal-setting formula i shared with you previously . because , you see , having goals is good . having a 90-day deadline is great . but it 's still something that feels far enough away that you can let procrastination take hold today . so what 's the solution ? eating that frog . when i work with clients , we do n't stop at setting three process goals for 90 days . we dig deeper and go to the next level . ",
        "i demand they come up with one big action step to take in the next 24 hours that will move them ahead to their 90-day outcome goal . so stop and ask yourself right now : what is the most important action you can take in the next 24 hours to move you ahead in life and help you accomplish your 90-day goal ? what 's the frog you need to eat ? i do n't care if you need to get some ketchup , sriracha , chimichurri , or truffle oil to get it down . just get out there and eat that frog ! ",
        "it does n't stop there , though -- there 's more you need to do . you still need to connect the action steps for each day so you hit your 90-day deadline . so ask yourself this : what big action step can you take to get results and move ahead in the next 72 hours ? the next seven days ? two weeks ? month ? yes , i know this gets a little repetitive -- but that 's okay ! some steps for success need to be repeated . there 's just one last icing-on-the-cake success secret that you absolutely need . ",
        "it 's found in the second pillar of success from my book , `` the perfect day formula . '' earlier , i mentioned that a deadline can have the biggest initial impact on your success . but it 's accountability that keeps it going . after all , you can have all the greatest advice in the world , but if you do n't have accountability , you 'll fall off the wagon . can i let you in on a little secret ? everything that you want to learn is readily available -- most of it online . ",
        "it does n't matter whether you want to lose weight or learn to build a phone app . it 's all there . so why are n't more people successful ? they do n't have a solid system of accountability . for years , i have benefitted from the wisdom , advice , and accountability of a professional coach . these are the people who have helped me to become a better coach , a better writer , and a better sales person -- all while transforming millions of lives . accountability is key and i can never , ever abandon it . ",
        "neither should you . if coaching is good enough for jeff bezos , larry page , usain bolt , venus williams , and sara blakely , then it 's good enough for us , too . so listen , there 's no excuse for not achieving your goals this year . you now have the tools you need -- my 1 -- 2 -- 3 goal-setting formula , `` eat the frog '' empowerment , and the smarts to set up some serious accountability . if you need more guidance , or want to explore the possibilities of taking your life to the next level , visit perfectlifeworkshop .
