        "it 's championship sunday in the nfl . and the doubleheader begins in foxboro -- where the defending champion new england patriots look to punch their return ticket to the super bowl and try to get past the jacksonville jaguars . all eyes will be on the great tom brady sunday afternoon . the future hall of fame quarterback cut his throwing hand in practice on wednesday . the wound , according to espn , required stitches , and may force him to wear a glove during sunday 's game . a fluke injury seems to be about the only thing which could truly stop the new england offense -- which steamrolled tennessee in the divisional round once it got going . ",
        "brady 's injury is a wild card , but the reigning champs still figure to be very tough to beat . jacksonville , however , just might have the personnel on defense to at least make the patriots work for their points . it 's been an outstanding unit throughout the year , but they do enter having yielded 42 points to pittsburgh last week . the jaguars survived , though , thanks to a rare strong game from their offense . they 'll probably need to score a bunch again on sunday in order to have a shot against new england in foxboro . ",
        "kickoff is at 3:00 p. m. et . the game will be broadcast on cbs . jim nantz and tony romo have the call . the game can be streamed via cbs all access , which is a pay subscription service . however , users can sign up for a one-week free trial via this link .   "
