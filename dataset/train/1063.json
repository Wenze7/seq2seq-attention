        "playing scrabble for over 10 years sure has its advantages . you start by being appreciative of words that you discover . but soon , when you start to play competitively , you 'll see that the game changes the way you approach things : you become strategic , efficient , and ready to pounce on opportunities . and most importantly , it helped me become a better writer . here are the 8 insights from scrabble that helped me improve my writing : throw away a bad rackone of the many beauties of playing scrabble is that you can swap all of your tiles or just the tiles you do n't want . ",
        "yes , you 'll lose a turn . but it 's better than being stuck with a bad set of letters that will slowly kill your chances of winning . it 's the same way with writing . if you 're looking at a bad sentence or a bad paragraph , do n't be afraid to chuck it . sticking with a bad sentence or bad paragraph means you have to adjust a lot of times . you 'll waste time and energy . chuck it . your words determine their next movethe words you 'll place on the board will determine your opponent 's next move . ",
        "if the tiles you placed is open for exploitation , it will get exploited . action = reactionwhether you 're a fiction writer , a content writer , a journalist , or a copywriter , your words should always generate action . your words should move the reader from headline to the first sentence until the reader has reached the end of your work . if the words you used are open for exploitation , it will get exploited . do n't force a bingothere are times when your tiles seem like it has a bingo hidden in it . ",
        "it just waits for you to be discovered . your rack feels like it 's trying to provoke you . you know you 're close . getting all those 7 tiles on the board is a different high . so you decided to pass . and pass . and pass . most of the time , you wo n't get the bingo . and by the time you successfully forced a bingo , you 'll find that your opponent is now light years ahead of you . you know this happens to most writers . do n't let the possibility get the better of you . ",
        "make the most of what you have in the moment . when you force a topic or a plot , words tend to dry up . it will lack the flair and the flavor that makes writing an art . worst of all , your readers will notice . bad move . instead of forcing it , continue to do your work . let the thought simmer . by the time the possibility came back and you 're ready , it will be yours for the taking . unless it 's at least 30 points , do n't use itin scrabble there are 2 killer tiles that get wasted by novices : the blank tile and the letter ` s ' . ",
        "these novices waste these tiles just by merely completing a low-score word . just to show off that they know the word . but you see , there 's no sense in playing the blank tile or ` s ' if it 's not at scoring at least 30 points . otherwise , you 're just wasting a precious tile . we all see writers who try to sound smart by using foreign terms and legal jargons that are irrelevant and unnecessary to the sentence or the overall theme . do n't be that kind of writer . reading a lot is an incredible advantageit 's a battle of words . ",
        "a wider vocabulary means more weapons at your disposal . i always surprise myself that i actually knew words i do n't know the meaning of . it felt like i 've read them over and over again and somehow managed to seep into my subconscious , ready to deploy when i 'm playing scrabble . it 's the same when writing . reading a lot gives you a lot of advantages . you have more words that would give impact , color , or flavor to your sentences and paragraphs . reading a lot exposes you to a lot of writing styles and techniques that gives you an eerie sense of natural flow when writing . ",
        "if you read a lot , you 'll understand . mastering the fundamentals is the only way to progressyou wo n't be a competitive scrabble player if you do n't know all of the two-letter words and the majority of the three-letter words for starters . it 's the same way with writing . you start with the fundamentals : punctuations , tenses , prepositions , and what not . you 'll need these before you can build your way up towards grammar , style , and composition -- the point where you can finally resonate with your readers , compel them to take action and change their lives . ",
        "your performance depends on the dictionary usedi 've played a lot of scrabble games that use different dictionaries : twl , sowpods , merriam-webster , and the official scrabble dictionary . now , there are certain words that are available in one dictionary and is n't available in another . the word ` zo ' is available on the official scrabble dictionary , but you ca n't play it on twl . what i 'm trying to say is that you should know the field you 're playing in . more information means fewer surprises . there are a lot of rules in writing that you can throw away depending on your audience and your goal . ",
        "copywriting is all about harnessing and channeling emotions towards a certain goal , that kind of approach wo n't work in technical writing . the beauty of poetry can be found in calculated vagueness , but you will have a hard time winning people over if you do it in your essay . always know your playing field . more information = fewer surprises . in a tight competition , the one with the better end game winsknowing how to finish the game is crucial especially in scrabble . when you 've used up all your tiles before your opponent , the total value of your opponent 's tiles will be deducted from his score and added to your score . ",
        "a complete game-changer . knowing how to force your opponents ' hands , avoiding potential pitfalls , and opening up spaces will play a decisive role in your scrabble win/loss ratio -- if you care that much about your scrabble performances . in the world of writing , the way you ended your work will dictate how your writing will be treated . for copywriters , their call to action will determine whether the reader will sign up , buy , or walk away . for authors , the ending will determine if everything their readers went through was worth it . ",
        "for essay writers and bloggers , their conclusion will determine if their readers will get takeaways from their post . end strong . are you now a better writer or a better scrabble player ?   "
