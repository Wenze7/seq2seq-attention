        "december 24 , 2017 17:53 . 1 minute read . long empty hospital corridor . policemen are stationed in six general hospital emergency rooms to reduce violence against the medical staff , and more will be added to nine more medical centers very soon . in april 2017 , the committee for the elimination and treatment of violence in the health system was established under the chairmanship of prof. shlomo mor yosef , who previously was director-general of the hadassah medical organization and the national insurance institute . the committee formulated a plan of action and recommendations for fighting violence in the health system but has not yet completed its work . ",
        "as part of the deliberations , a website was opened to hear public proposals and positions . in 2015 , a pilot program stationing police in emergency rooms began to operate in six general hospitals . as expected , their placement caused an increase in complaints against violent patients , visitors and family members in the hospitals in which they were placed . last year , the effect of the police presence was already felt by a reduced number of violent incidents . other hospitals that did not get policemen also took stronger measures against violence , according to the health ministry . ",
        "the program is moving from being a pilot to a permanent one , with the israel police in charge of running it . at present , the policemen are on duty at western galilee medical center in nahariya ; rambam medical center in haifa ; hillel jaffe in hadera ; tel aviv sourasky medical center ; sheba medical center at tel hashomer ; wolfson medical center in holon and assaf harofeh medical center in tzrifin .
