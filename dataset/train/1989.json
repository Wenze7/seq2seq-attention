        "if you 're following my blogs , you 'll appreciate that i 'm questioning myself about the future of our industry . i 'm not trying to predict what 's going to happen , but i explore all possible scenarios . and today 's scenario is about insurance companies and connected houses . there are a lot of cases where the insurance companies set mandatory policy to have a maintenance contract to cover your home . it depends a lot on the local rules and legislation of your state or country . in france for example , if your gas water heater does not have a yearly maintenance by a certified pro , you 're not covered if it explodes . ",
        "if your chimney pipe is not swept once a year by an authorized chimney sweep , your insurance will not cover you in the event of a fire . insurance companies work that way : they are giving you an insurance on a `` calculated risk '' and share some of those responsibilities with certified professionals . in fact , every time where life can be in danger or lots of reimbursement might be involved , your insurance will ask for a certified professional to install it and/or a maintenance contract . you just ca n't build your house as you want and expect any insurance company to cover your workmanship . ",
        "this said , let 's make a parallel with our audio/video and home automation industry . did you realize that we do not install just entertainment anymore ? tv and distributed av can not cause any damages to someone or to the house . but now that our industry is also handling lighting , shading , hvac , security , door locks -- we literally turn houses alive ! and more than ever , any workmanship can put people or the house in danger . today 's houses can literally turn against the people that are living there . what if someone hacks your wi-fi because the firmware of the access point is not up to date . ",
        "they will be able to take control of the house , turn off the security system , open the doors while you are sleeping . or they can also lock you in a totally dark house with the air conditioner to the maximum until you freeze . this looks like a bad scenario for a cheap movie , but it 's totally plausible and it might just happen ! i 'm quite sure that in a few years , and probably sooner than we think , insurance companies will ask all home owners to have a maintenance contract for a pro to come once or twice a year to update all firmware , check if all devices are still secure enough , change wi-fi passwords and give you the latest advice in order to get your house as secure as possible . ",
        "as you can see , i believe our industry has a great future by being a full service provider .   "
