        "france 's top cyclist romain bardet said sunday that chris froome 's adverse drugs test at the vuelta a espana had damaged the credibility of the sport . bardet , second to froome at the tour de france in 2016 and third in 2017 , was speaking on the fringes of a world cup biathlon event in his home region . `` this is not good news for cycling , '' said bardet , who will again be amongst the favourites for the 2018 tour . `` pretty much everyone gets hit by something like this , cycling 's credibility first and foremost . ",
        "`` we really could have done without it . it 's not something anyone can rejoice about , '' he said . `` let 's hope that a swift and objective probe can clarify the facts and leave no doubts about what happened , '' said the 27-year-old ag2r team leader . froome , a four time tour de france winner had twice the permissible amount of asthma medication salbutamol in his system on september 7 , following the 18th stage of the grand tour race he won for the first time . cycling 's governing body uci has asked the team sky rider to provide more information but in line with world anti-doping agency guidelines has not suspended him . ",
        "if froome fails to provide a satisfactory answer , the uci could proceed with an anti-doping rule violation case -- he could even be stripped of his vuelta victory and miss a large chunk of next season .   "
