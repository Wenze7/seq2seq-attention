        "by yeganeh torbatiwashington - a u. s. judge ordered the government on tuesday to either release iraqi immigrants it arrested last year or grant them bond hearings , in the latest judicial curb on the trump administration 's efforts to tighten u. s. immigration . last year the federal government detained hundreds of iraqi immigrants who had been ordered deported years ago due to criminal convictions . iraq until recently had refused to take them back , but struck a deal with the united states in march to repatriate its citizens , sparking the immigration sweeps . the iraqis and civil rights groups representing them sued the federal government . ",
        "u. s. district judge mark goldsmith , in detroit , had previously halted the deportation of the iraqis , many of whom are christian , who argued they would face persecution if they were sent back to iraq . in his ruling on tuesday , goldsmith said that any of the iraqis held for six months or longer must either be released or granted a bond hearing before an immigration judge within 30 days . `` our legal tradition rejects warehousing human beings while their legal rights are being determined , '' wrote goldsmith . the trump administration has tried to deport the iraqis as part of its push to increase immigration enforcement and make countries , which have resisted in the past , take back nationals ordered deported from the united states . ",
        "since june , immigration enforcement officers have detained approximately 300 iraqi nationals with final deportation orders , according to information provided to the court by the iraqis ' lawyers . there are approximately 1,400 iraqis in the united states with final deportation orders . the u. s. government said in march that iraq had agreed to repatriate iraqi nationals ordered deported from the united states . but goldsmith noted in his order that the united states has `` no written agreement '' with iraq regarding its cooperation , and that it is therefore unclear whether iraq had agreed to take back all its nationals , and if so , under what conditions . ",
        "goldsmith said his ruling would apply to iraqi detainees in similar circumstances nationwide , even if they are not involved in the litigation . '' just really reaffirmed the principle that indefinite detention in this country is not acceptable , '' said kary moss , executive director of the american civil liberties union of michigan , which is representing the iraqis . the department of justice , which is arguing on behalf of the government , did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
