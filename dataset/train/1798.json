        "congress needs to pass a new funding bill by friday 's end , or else the government will shut down . president trump made that task significantly harder last week , when he rejected a bipartisan proposal to grant legal status to daca recipients . with 700,000 dreamers just weeks away from losing the right to live in the country they call home , democrats are under immense pressure to vote against any spending bill that fails to address their plight . if paul ryan 's caucus were united in support of keeping the government open , this would n't be a problem in the house . ",
        "but the freedom caucus is anxious to take food and medical assistance from poor people , while the house 's defense hawks believe that the pentagon 's paltry $ 600 billion budget must be increased immediately lest america forfeit its `` military readiness . '' and both contingents refuse to accept that the filibuster exists , and thus , that any spending bill will need to be amenable to at least nine democrats in the upper chamber . all this makes ryan 's path to 218 votes on a temporary-funding bill unclear . but the speaker has a plan , according to politico . ",
        "ryan hopes to win over a critical mass of democrats by restoring funding for children 's health care , while winning over conservatives with tax cuts for medical devices : leaders will pitch a delay of the medical device tax , a loathed obamacare levy on equipment such as defibrillators and surgical tools . the tax has been delayed for two years but went back into effect on jan. . 1 . they 'll also discuss again delaying the law 's health insurance tax , which is now going into effect after a one-year delay . a third tax potentially in the cross-hairs : the so-called cadillac tax on high-cost health insurance plans favored by labor unions . ",
        "... facing gop resistance , republican leaders are also expected to also discuss another option : adding six years of funding for the children 's health insurance program designed to draw democratic votes . chip is a bipartisan program that provides health insurance to 9 million children . republicans allowed funding for the program to expire last year , while they were frantically trying to repeal obamacare , and pass unpopular , deficit-financed tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations . subsequently , they refused to renew chip , unless it was funded dollar for dollar with cuts to health care for low-income adults . ",
        "now , for complicated reasons related to the rising costs of obamacare , it may actually save the government money to extend chip . so ryan 's offer to democrats boils down to : i will agree to stop needlessly withholding health insurance from vulnerable children out of spite , if you help me keep 700,000 dreamers in fear for another few weeks . given the gop 's ruthlessness -- and the grave harm that 's already being done to chip -- this may be an offer many democrats ca n't refuse . whether conservatives will be satisfied with delaying obamacare taxes that obama himself perpetually agreed to delay remains unclear . ",
        "that said , it seems doubtful that there are any democratic senators who would vote for spending bill that did n't address daca , but would would n't vote for one that delayed the medical-device tax . if ryan were willing to settle for a very temporary spending bill -- one that allowed democrats to keep up the pressure on daca , while pocketing a victory on chip -- he could probably keep the government open on the strength of democratic and moderate republican support . but then , there are a lot of things ryan could do if he were willing to spurn the right flank of his caucus -- like , for example , pass a dream act .
