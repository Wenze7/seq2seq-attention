        "jamie carragher believes that liverpool 's new signing virgil van dijk can be worth the reported £ 75million fee and claimed he must follow a similar path to former manchester united defender rio ferdinand . the reds confirmed the signing of the the 26-year-old on wednesday afternoon and the deal is set to official go through when the transfer window re-opens on 1 january . sky sports report his move from southampton is set to be worth £ 75million , which will make him the most expensive defender of all time . that record once belonged to ferdinand when he joined man united in 2002 from leeds for £ 30million . ",
        "carragher has insisted that van dijk 's reported transfer sum can turn out to be worth it if he enjoys the same sort of longevity as former centre-back ferdinand . `` if he performs well and does his job he will be worth it , '' carragher told tv programme sky sports news . `` i think the one player i remember as a centre-back when the transfer felt so huge at the time was probably 15 years ago when rio ferdinand went to manchester united for just over £ 30million , but he repaid that . '' `` he was manchester united 's top centre-back , won trophies , and was there for 10 years . ",
        "that 's what van dijk has to do , take liverpool to trophies and be livepool 's main number one centre-back for the next decade or so . '' opinion .   "
