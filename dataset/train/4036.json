        "west ham boss david moyes looks set to drop joe hart from his starting line-up for saturday 's match against chelsea , putting the england goalkeeper 's world cup ambitions in serious jeopardy . adrian is in contention to feature after impressing against manchester city last weekend , stepping in when hart was ineligible to face his parent club . with hart also under pressure for his england number one spot from jordan pickford and jack butland , losing his club place could leave his russia 2018 hopes in tatters . `` i 'll keep my team until tomorrow , '' said moyes . ",
        "`` but i have made a decision in my own mind . `` as for whether he had discussed that decision with hart , moyes added : `` i would always try to speak to the players . there are some occasions you should speak to them and others there is no need to . `` it is a good problem for west ham . i do n't know if it is a good problem going into the world cup . i would like those problems in a few other positions . i am happy having the two of them . ",
        "`` west ham skipper mark noble is another casualty of moyes 's arrival at the london stadium . the long-serving midfielder was a favourite of previous manager slaven bilic but has not made an appearance since the scot took charge and was not even in the squad at city . `` mark is really influential , he 's great around the club , '' said moyes . `` but he is not guaranteed . no one is guaranteed . we have to find a way of winning . i want to pick the players who are in form . `` champions chelsea make the trip from west to east london lying in third and looking to move level on points with manchester united , who face leaders city on sunday . ",
        "`` i 'm not a chelsea expert but how they played last year was fantastic , '' said moyes . `` a slow start to the season might have caught them out a little bit but on their day they are a match for anyone . ''   "
