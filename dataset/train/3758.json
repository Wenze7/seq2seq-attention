        "treating and preventing hivmore than 70 million people have been diagnosed with hiv since the early 1980s , and the virus has claimed the lives of more than 35 million people . some may argue that the worst is behind us , but hiv is still a death sentence for many people across the globe . until we find a cure or , at the very least , better treatment and prevention options for the disease , it will continue to claim lives . now , two new studies launching in africa -- where hiv/aids was once the leading cause of death -- just might yield the breakthrough we need . ",
        "johnson & johnson has collaborated with the u. s. national institutes of health and the bill & melinda gates foundation on a two-vaccine combination that it will trial in 2,600 women in southern africa over the course of the next three years . the first dose of their hiv vaccine primes the immune system , while the second boosts the body 's response . the vaccine combines proteins from various hiv strains to create a `` mosaic '' that will , hopefully , be able to prevent infection from any strain of hiv . `` we 're making progress , '' paul stoffels , chief scientific officer at j&j , told reuters , before explaining he hopes their hiv vaccine can achieve effectiveness above 50 percent . ",
        "`` that is the goal , '' said stoffels . `` hopefully , we get much higher . `` in november 2016 , a trial of another hiv vaccine , hvtn 702 , launched in south africa , and according to reuters , this is the first time in over a decade that two big hiv vaccines are being tested simultaneously . in addition to j&j 's vaccine study , a viiv healthcare trial also just launched in sub-saharan africa . that study will involve 3,200 women , who will be given injections of viiv 's experimental hiv drug cabotegravir every two months to test its ability to treat hiv . ",
        "the viiv initiative is also receiving funding from the nih and the gates foundation , and it is expected to conclude in may 2022 . promising developmentsscientists and researchers have been making steady progress in hiv treatments , with 2017 showing potentially the most promise so far . this year , scientists from the scripps research institute discovered a `` functional cure '' that was successfully tested on mice , while the nih conducted a study on an antibody that can kill 99 percent of hiv strains . a drug used to fight cancer could become a new hiv treatment , and crispr gene-editing has been used to boost hiv resistances in animals . ",
        "kristin lanphear , manager in community health initiatives at trillium health , told futurism that these two new african studies are significant because `` an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure . '' every successful attempt to prevent hiv infection or slow down its progress could result in millions of people living somewhat normal , healthy lives . `` both of these developments are super exciting potential new tools in the prevention toolbox , '' said lanphear . `` while a cure is still a possibility , prevention is an achievable way to actually end the hiv epidemic . ",
        "the more tools we have to use , the faster we can reach that goal . '' hiv is unpredictable -- the virus does n't affect everyone in the same way , it can become resistant to previously effective drugs , and what works against one strain might not work against another . additionally , many existing treatments must be used continuously to be effective . fortunately , lanphear foresees the potential for the j&j vaccine and viiv drug to avoid some of those issues . `` no one tool is going to be enough to do the job , because every tool does n't work the same for every person or every country , '' said lanphear . ",
        "`` both of these developments take some variability out of the equation - they rely less on continued action and allow for one-time or episodic commitment to a health behavior . '' both the hiv vaccine trial and the treatment trial are just kicking off , so we wo n't know for some time just how viable they are . still , they 'll be worth the wait if they can effectively treat or prevent hiv .
