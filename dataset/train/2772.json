        "her tired body lies crumpled on the sofa , legs bent , head twisted above a rising urine stench brought about by another vodka binge . she , once proud , now lays reduced by her consuming vice , one so baleful it 's unhinged her dreams , and erstwhile pride . this scene , marked by a grotesque overtone , and oddly accompanied by a hint of twisted beauty , sees my wife at her lowest , nevertheless , her soul remains . even as she mumbles through intoxicated breath , i see beauty , and above all , love in her pale , time-worn face . ",
        "in that moment , as i 'm overtaken by all that is about me i can not react outwardly , however , inwardly my heart breaks as a piece of my spirit sinks even lower than her physical state . and amid this toxicity i absorb her pain and experience my own , but feel selfish for reeling as i stand sober above her . yes , i can care for her needs , provide companionship , and even slow her spiral , but i can not restore dreams , or even offer a solution to cure what pains grip us . ",
        "i 've never known an alcoholic before ; though the woman i love has introduced me well to the disease . and it is a disease worth fighting , especially with her , but it is also exhausting . many times , by day 's end , i feel hollow and burdened beyond anything i could 've imagined . though , i 'll be damned if i surrender in the face of addiction . my thoughts of support reach out to those who battle this , and similar , crisis .
