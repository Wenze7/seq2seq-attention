        "the discovery of a mixtape featuring the inception star spitting rhymes positions him next to other unlikely hollywood mcsstuart heritagegrant tom hardy any wish and you suspect it 'd involve destroying the internet . every couple of months , without fail , some weird little alleyway of his past will surface online and chip away at his well-honed reputation . there were his surprisingly candid interviews about drug use and sexuality . there were those revealing myspace selfies . and now , inevitably , there 's his career as a rapper . related : when celebrities used myspace : the profiles a-listers try to forgetexcept , hang on , it turns out that tom hardy is n't a bad rapper at all . ",
        "the discovery of a mixtape entitled falling on your arse in 1999 by tommy no 1 and eddie too tall has shocked people for how little it sucks . musically it leans hard on alan hawkshaw and barry white samples and , while hardy ca n't quite settle on a signature flow -- sometimes he 's channelling method man , other times he verges on house of pain -- you 'd struggle to find anyone who 'd admit that he did n't have talent . the discovery of this mixtape shoots tom hardy close to the top of the list of actors who 've dabbled with rap . ",
        "here is that list , from best to worst . mahershala aliif tom hardy is method man , then the oscar winner mahershala ali -- who released an album called curb side seven under the moniker prince ali in 2007 -- is gza . look at his verses in the path ; he 's measured and authoritative , bordering on profound at points . this is surprising , given that he spends some of the accompanying video walking up and down a big piano like tom hanks in big . vin dieselnow we must deviate from our imagined alternative wu-tang lineup , because vin diesel 's attempted rap career predates the clan by seven full years . ",
        "a soundcloud file appeared six years ago charting a failed hip-hop collaboration between the avant garde composer arthur russell and a boy known then as mark sinclair . true , diesel spends his time aping license to ill-era ad-rock as closely as possible , but there were moments of promise nonetheless . abbie cornishby day , abbie cornish acts in well-received films like three billboards outside ebbing , missouri and candy . but by night , she is a rapper named dusk . and despite everything you 're definitely thinking right now , she 's good . displaying neither the nerves nor the misplaced overconfidence of other actor-rappers , she 's aggressive and tight on tracks like 2014 's evolve . ",
        "and she supported nas in concert , too , which does n't just happen to anyone . joaquin phoenixyes , the mockumentary i 'm still here was all a big ruse that threatened to derail phoenix 's career once and for all . yes , his aborted rap career was ultimately played for laughs . but in the three minutes that he actually spent rapping -- before the performance dissolved into a staged fight with the crowd -- joaquin phoenix was good . a bit lazy , perhaps , but it worked for him . if it was on spotify , i 'd be listening to i 'm still here right now . ",
        "but it is n't , so i 'm not . tom hanksthere exists an alternative universe where tom hanks is n't mortified by city of crime , the single he released to help promote 1987 's dragnet , and he continues to release a rap single for every new film he puts out . in that universe , river crashin ' has been no 1 around the world since 2016 . instead , this one outing -- in which he successfully mimics most white rap of the 1980s by just shouting really loudly -- is all we 've got . ",
        "for shame , hanks . the olsen twinsanyone who ever owned a vhs copy of the adventures of mary-kate & ashley will be familiar with the rap career of the olsen twins . the highlight of this quickly aborted career was b-u-t-t out , in which the twins told their sister elizabeth in no uncertain terms what an unwanted burden she was to their family . to her face . it is a supreme diss track , and you pray for elizabeth 's sake that they never record a follow-up about how she 's the worst avenger . tina feyso , a complicated one .

        "donald glover is a comedian . but childish gambino is the name of his non-comedy hip-hop persona . real estate is a serious track recorded by childish gambino . but it has tina fey spitting lines at the end . tina fey is a comedian . does that make her a rapper , or is her appearance just a novelty white-girl bookend ? we may never know . rodney dangerfieldrappin ' rodney was a 1983 12-inch single recorded by rodney dangerfield , in which dangerfield lists all the different ways he fails to receive the respect he feels he deserves . ",
        "although he was 62 when the single came out , it nevertheless received heavy rotation on mtv and was ultimately nominated for a grammy . all of this actually happened . joe pesciyou already know this , but vincent laguardia gambini sings just for you was a 1998 album recorded by joe pesci under the guise of the character he played in the 1992 movie my cousin vinny . no , really . and while the album is n't a complete write-off -- the big band number take your love and shove it up your big fat ass has a certain undeniable charm -- its low point is the blondie-sampling wise guy . ",
        "`` do n't do blow and i do n't sell crack , '' it goes , `` stay alert , i got someone to whack . '' it is a bad song . hulk hoganand then there 's hulk hogan , who in 1995 released an album called hulk rules containing songs like hulkster 's in the house , hulkster 's back , hulk 's the one and hulkster in heaven . however , he raps in the song beach patrol and it 'd be the worst thing ever done by anyone had hulk hogan also not opened a hulk-themed pasta concession stand in a shopping mall that same year .
