        "there are many well established companies providing remote learning experience like coursera , khan academy , edx , codecademy , futurelearn , xuetangx , udacity and others . these companies run platforms to provide access to content , assess student knowledge , enable student to mentor communication . each company has its take on how to cover its running expenses , for example : by being supported by consortium of universities , providing paid course or paid assessment , providing company and product branding . by being pioneers in the new field , those companies burned through huge amounts of investments to learn about things that does work together and things that does not fit well . ",
        "sadly , after becoming very popular , they become too big to risk introducing radically new ideas to get funded , introducing new forms of training material , or experimenting with new communication patterns . the current success of these companies is staggering and allows to measure the size of market we are about to enter . top 10 of these companies have in excess of 110 million cumulative registered users with some companies showing revenue in excess of 60m usd . we are coming late to the market . coming late to the market allows us to study history and attempts of each company to test ideas , techniques and to create user centric focused workflows . ",
        "being small allows us to rapidly test new ideas and ways we respond to the needs of our students , sponsors and contributors . we studied most of well-established remote education providers by enrolling to courses and learned best practices used but also experienced many difficulties . we analyzed availability and price of certification , availability of scholarship , value provided to scholarship sponsors and a level of gamification employed in educational process . although gamification techniques are well tested and proven to help motivate consumers in other fields it is still seldom used by existing competitors , who stick to more old style , tried and true academic approaches . ",
        "we will assemble the current best practices of providing free access to teaching material and augment it with learning process gamification , human mentorship , free and verifiable assessment , financial incentives to students and employer-student matching capabilities . non of our competitors employs all of these features . we are not a big threat to existing market players as the education market is expanding wildly and can accommodate additional players . each player brings exclusive features meant to attract customers , but strategic partnerships are common in the exchange of training material . however , with time we believe our gamification and incentives based model will show its benefits and lead to capturing a significant share of the remote education market . ",
        "the market potential of bitdegreeit is easy for everyone to observe the rapid expansion of the remote education and e-learning markets . we believe that with the new incentivized learning model , bitdegree brings the next wave of e-learning adoption , which will spur the growth of the user base . we estimate the user base to double every two years . . by aligning the interests of potential employers and students using the education platform we enter the talent sourcing market as well . there is a growing demand for digital professionals , which in the eu alone is expected to reach 9 million by 2020 , while globally this figure is expected to be 3 -- 5 million higher . ",
        "this huge demand and short supply is the reason why in the us , it costs on average 4000 usd to fill a vacancy . figure 13 . rise of the demand for digital professionals in the eu . figure 14 . digital staffing gaps . in fact , we expect a severe shortfall in digital talent around the world by 2020 , when according to a gartner study , 30 % of tech jobs will be unfilled , due to digital talent shortfalls . we believe that these trends warrant and confirm bitdegree 's business model and that there is clear demand for our value proposition .
