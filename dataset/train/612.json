        "environmental pollution from industry abuse and human negligence feels like it 's part of another era -- especially if you live in america . for many of us , it all feels like something that happens elsewhere and not in our own backyards . while we have made great strides in fighting against industrial pollution since president nixon founded the epa , there have been numerous regressions and disasters along the way . sometimes , it 's right under our noses . brothers sam and gary bencheghib have taken matters into their own hands . when they moved to brooklyn , they were shocked to find several of the country 's most polluted waterways were n't a country away but , literally , in their own backyards . ",
        "for the earth-loving duo , it was a call to action . the brothers -- along with millions of residents in queens and brooklyn -- live within a stone 's throw of three superfund sites . those are the places the epa deems so polluted , toxic , or destroyed by a natural disaster that a fund has to be set up to clean up the area as quickly as possible . among these , newtown creek is considered one of the most polluted spots in all of the united states . this is thanks to over a century of industrial waste being spewed into the river , raw sewage still being pumped into the waterway every day , and a semi-continual oil spill that 's seen 30 million gallons spilled into the water . ",
        "add in the usual plastic waste that 's clogging our waterways and you have an american river that 's bafflingly poisoned . the gowan canal is similarly toxic . the freshwater stream has been used for shipping of waster and toxic materials for so long that if you were to fall into the water , you 'd have to be rushed to a hospital for decontamination procedures . drinking the water would risk dysentery , arsenic poisoning , and , eventually , cancer . the bencheghib brothers know they can not clean this up all by themselves . their task is to bring awareness to the sites through their work with make a change world . ",
        "the group aims to directly involve the average person is cleaning up the messes we 're making around the world -- through an overuse of plastics and the under-regulated waste from industry . currently , `` the bros '' are focusing on their own backyard in brooklyn , by highlighting the superfund sites of newtown creek and gowan canal . these two sites are both earmarked for clean up operations to begin , but the process is slow and faces hurdles . meanwhile , the current white house leadership plans to cut $ 327 million out of the epa 's superfund budget and has forbidden the epa from speaking with citizens . ",
        "luckily , the administration 's disinterest in the environment wo n't have drastic effects on the clean up of newtown creek and gowan canal , as those sites have responsible parties who have been tasked with funding the lion 's share of the cleanup costs . wnyc reported back in november that the six major polluters of newtown creek were identified along with the 30 polluters of gowan canal . this means , hopefully , the cleanups will go forward unhindered . just down the street from newtown and gowan is a site called wolff-alport . this was the site of an earth metals extraction facility that shuttered in the 1950s . ",
        "one of their extractions was the radioactive element thorium . that process has made the wolf-alport site the most radioactive spot in new york city . since the company responsible for the radioactive pollution went out of business over 70 years ago , there 's no one to fine and , thereby , collect the funds to clean up the site . the whole tab falls on the shoulders of the epa 's superfund budget . wnyc talked to the epa and they have an estimated cost of $ 39.9 million to clean up this radioactive site . currently , there 's $ 650,000 in the account designated for that job . ",
        "the acting deputy regional administrator for epa said bluntly of the site that `` what we do know is that people are actually being exposed . `` it would seem to reason that radioactive exposure to the citizens of new york would be a little higher on the list of sites the epa and local , state , and the federal government would be rushing to clean up . that 's where make a change world comes in . 75 years is too long to wait for a radioactive , oil-soaked , or just plain toxic site to be cleaned up . ",
        "like the bencheghib brothers , it 's time to take action in our backyards , in the voting booths , and in how we live our lives .   "
