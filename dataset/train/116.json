        "these days , etiquette training can feel like a vestige of another era , conjuring a mental reel of genteel young ladies balancing books on their heads and learning to identify fish forks . but many might be surprised to learn that old-fashioned social graces are making a comeback , reimagined for the thoroughly modern millennial . as an admittedly rough-around-the-edges young person myself , i thought i might benefit from a little polishing . that 's why i reached out to myka meier and her staff at beaumont etiquette -- a consultancy and manners tutelage that 's been selling out since meier , its founder , launched in the u. s. in 2014 . ",
        "it 's an interesting time for a revival of etiquette training . american political leaders have largely abandoned decorum while their constituents delight in a wedding engagement to the same monarchy we once overthrew millennials also have a reputation for killing off everything older generations hold dear . so you 'd think manners would be on their way out , no ? the answer : not quite . about 85 % of meier 's clients are millennials with an almost 50-50 breakdown of those identifying as male or female . she credits the generation 's competitiveness . so , enter me , a twenty-something who hopes to go from prat to prim over the course of a two-hour lunch , via meier 's social and dining course . ",
        "courtesy of beaumont etiquette . table mannerswhen i meet meier at the plaza palm court , where beaumont etiquette runs a finishing program , she 's wearing a white pussy-bow blouse billowing with frills and ruffles . on anyone else , the top might seem fussy , but meier looks charming and confident . meier is n't your grandmother 's etiquette teacher . she may have trained a client to meet the queen , but she 's also danced with prince harry on a nightclub floor . she was n't born part of the one percent . rather , she grew up in a middle-class american household and began taking etiquette courses around the world after working abroad in communications , where she met her mentor -- a former kensington palace employee . ",
        "after some chit-chat , she gets to the crux of the matter : `` have you ever taken any sort of etiquette class before ? '' mmmm , no . i 'm the product of a small coal region hometown and public education . i was a feral , poor-postured child and , while often threatened with finishing school , my father was not an aristocrat , but a former truck driver . i had , however , watched the princess diaries many times . unlike anne hathaway 's training , nobody at the plaza swoops in with an herm√®s scarf to bind me to my chair . ",
        "a portly , be-suited waiter instead takes our afternoon tea order with , of course , those little crust-less cucumber sandwiches . then , meier and i set off racing . `` i first just want to teach you how to hold a knife and fork , '' meier says . adeline ramos of you look lovely photography . great news : my current cutlery technique resembles spearfishing . using silverware is one of the biggest struggles of beaumont 's clients , alongside other table errors , like wolfing down food . to help you folks at home , here 's a few tips to get us all started : your pinkie does n't go out when you hold a cup of tea . ",
        "instead , pinch your thumb and index finger within the loop , then support the handle with your middle finger . stir drinks 12-to-6 . no creating whirlpools with your spoon . meals are n't sprints . `` you take four bites maximum , and then you break . '' wrap your index , thumb and middle finger around the stem of a wineglass . the lower you go , the more sophisticated the hold . but back to the lesson . per meier 's instruction , i place the handles on my index fingers , and `` wrap and twist '' my fingers onto the handles . ",
        "i 'm to remember there are four letters in fork and left , five letters in knife and right . `` elbows in , and elbows stay in , '' meier instructs me , the girl who looks like a bird flapping its wings across the table . i already feel like edward scissorhands , but , for perspective , meier tells me meghan markle must learn the british way of eating : stacking and balancing food on the top of her fork , instead of stabbing it like her fellow americans . i wonder briefly who in my life will appreciate my new dining skills . ",
        "my colleagues when i eat my sad desk salad ? the bodega guy who gives me my chicken sandwich ? at this point , i 'm still thinking manners are like fine pieces of jewelry -- you must create occasions to show them off . no slouching allowedafter dining , it 's on to posture training . `` imagine about an egg 's width from your tailbone to the back of the chair , '' meier says . i 'm also to position myself about two hands away from the table , and i make a bridge out of my hands for reference and look up at her for affirmation . ",
        "`` you just want to move in a little bit . then , you never want to lean back into your chair . '' i begin to grumble , and meier tells me people 's back muscles sometimes hurt after her training , so i try to pretend i 'm at pure barre . we move onto sitting positions , and i 'm to imagine i have a little rubber band around my knees and ankles . acceptable sitting positions for refined folk include the `` cambridge cross , '' a term coined by meier and a position favored by the duchess of cambridge kate middleton . ",
        "to mimic , cross your legs at the ankles with your heels planted on the floor . if you 're afraid of falling out of your chair like princess mia , this is a safe position for you . there 's also the `` duchess slant . '' with knees and ankles together and heels on the floor , slant your calves to create a zig-zag shape with your legs to protect your modesty . my idols growing up were lindsay lohan and paris hilton , so modesty protection is all very new to me . our food arrives on a tiered tray with scones on the bottom , sandwiches in the middle , and pastries at the top . ",
        "you only cut bread if it is served on your plate with your food -- like toast with eggs -- so meier and i start with the scones and break bread together . etiquette is about respectas she segues into holiday party tips , i want to tell her i already have a great strategy for not embarrassing myself at such events , but i pull out a different downer question instead : `` if you are at a holiday party and someone makes an untoward sexual advance , or if someone is being rude in that manner , what is a polite way to remove yourself from that situation ? '' ",
        "we are all creatures of assumptions , and i expect meier to balk or pass at the heavy question i just placed beside the fine china . as women , we 're often taught to not talk about such things , and i might not know how to hold a fork , but i know sexual assault is n't what you discuss at afternoon tea . instead , meier shows me why people pay hundreds of dollars for her courses , why tv shows and corporate companies fly her internationally for talks , and why etiquette is simply about respect . ",
        "`` i would n't just ignore it and walk away , which is what i think people used to do . i would let them know that the advance was not welcome , '' meier says . `` i 'm a bit of a feminist in that way of being vocal and not accepting it . usually follows the one before it , so that 's why it 's really important to stop the cycle . '' to think etiquette and feminism ca n't coexist is to cling to an outdated understanding of manners , and i 'm suddenly ready to sign up for the multitudes of other courses beaumont offers . ",
        "`` people always say , ` is n't it ladies first ? ' but ` ladies first ' is one of the worst things you can say now with modern etiquette , '' per meier . just say ` please , after you '' if you are opening a door for someone who is a lady . she explains , `` you do n't point out her gender because it 's just not relevant anymore . '' searching gor balanceat this point , anne chertoff , coo of the plaza finishing program , finds us still on the scone course after 45 minutes of nonstop talking . ",
        "somewhat a foil to meier , chertoff knows the etiquette but does n't practice it . `` i 'm just a very comfortable person , '' she says , leaning back into her chair . if not for work , `` i would be in yoga pants with emojis right now and my mickey mouse sweatshirt . '' she says that , but still fixes my silverware when i deposit it incorrectly on the table to head to my final lesson of the day : the curtsy . a proper english one like markle will learn -- not the `` texas dip '' you 'd recognize from disney movies . ",
        "the curtsy is a series of three : the foot goes back and the head lowers in three counts , you bend at the knee in three counts , then you come back to standing straight in three counts . the lower you go does n't mean the higher the level of respect . it all sounds simple , but i wobble in my ankle booties and fall out of it . i let out a four-letter curse word as i do so , but chertoff and meier politely pretend not to notice . after two hours with meier , i 'm ready to embrace proper etiquette and modern social graces . ",
        "but the curtsy -- i 'll leave that to the royals . for a full list of beaumont etiquette 's course , visit beaumontetiquette . com .   "
