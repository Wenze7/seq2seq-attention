        "if there is one aspect of my life that i have had the hardest time accepting , it is my vulnerability . i am a fan of `` fake it till you make it '' so i thought if i fake being tough , i might actually become tough . maybe in other aspects of life , this motto could work , but when it comes to vulnerability and human emotions , it works exactly the opposite . the more i faked it , the more i became weaker because the denial hurt me more than the pain itself . ",
        "it took me years to understand that refusing to acknowledge pain means refusing help , and i realized , i wanted help . so i had to come to terms with the fact that i was unhappy . it was very hard to do it but i am glad i did it . being in a relationship where we ca n't express ourselves towards each other is unhealthy in the long run . this is also true for the relationship we have with ourselves . by hiding our vulnerability , we 're not being honest or dare i say , respectful towards each other . ",
        "no matter how much we put icings on a cake , it wo n't change the taste of the cake . it does n't matter how much we have everything else in a relationship , if we ca n't open up to each other , the relationship will be `` tasteless . '' being emotionally vulnerable takes more courage than being emotionally guarded . the ability to open up and say , ` hey , i am hurt . can someone help me ? ' takes more strength than pretending to be fine . every relationship that we genuinely care about will need us to be vulnerable , and as with any good things in life , this will not be easy , but it will be worth it .
