        "the water regulator has hit suppliers with the industry 's toughest price control regime since privatisation in a bid to force household bills lower amid the rumbling threat of renationalisation . ofwat will shave at least £ 15 to £ 25 a year from the average water bill in the first half of the next decade by tightening the screws on water companies , whose revenues rely on the regulator 's approval . ofwat 's outgoing chief executive , cathryn ross , said the blueprint would push water companies to deliver more for customers through to 2025 . `` we 've said many times already that this will be a tough price review for companies . ",
        "we will cut the financing costs they can recover from customers and , with this lower guaranteed return , they will need to be more efficient and innovative than ever before , '' she said . ofwat 's revenue squeeze is underpinned by its decision on where to set the weighted cost of capital for the industry , and the record low rate could also prompt other utility regulators to follow suit . the industry was braced for the cost of capital to fall below 3pc from 3.4 pc today , but ofwat has set the bar at the lower end of expectations , at 2.4 pc . ",
        "this metric will play a crucial part in calculating new rates of return that could effectively wipe close to £ 700m in value from the industry in a single stroke , and prompt investors to rethink their interest in the sector . interactive : uk water companieslisted water companies severn trent and united utilities lost value this morning , both slipping by almost 1pc to £ 20.97 and £ 8.18 respectively . the record crackdown will be particularly bleak for water suppliers that are not able to meet ofwat 's stringent performance targets , warned richard khaldi from pa consulting . ",
        "water companies are able to claw back revenue allowances by exceeding performance targets , but mr khaldi said the tougher benchmarks and prescriptive requirements for each company will make this far more difficult to achieve . `` companies are very unlikely to be able to offset lower returns overall with operational outperformance rewards unless they are already at or near the upper quartile , '' he said . but for the top performing companies that do pass ofwat 's stricter tests there will be loser limits on the potential financial rewards to help incentivise excellence while cracking down on sub-par suppliers . ",
        "ofwat has kept the issue of leakage and flooding firmly in its sites by setting a minimum target to reduce leaks by 15pc and tougher targets to create ` resilient ' water systems . ms ross will exit the regulator to take up a senior role at bt , leaving the role of taskmaster to ofgem veteran rachel fletcher . ms fletcher , who joins ofwat in early january , said her predecessor had set `` a high ambition '' for the water sector , `` and meeting this challenge is what makes the role so exciting '' . `` with the upcoming price review , new business retail market and ongoing requirement for the sector to secure the trust and confidence of customers - there is lots to do , '' she added .
