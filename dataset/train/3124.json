        "kim kardashian west is ensuring her home is safe by keeping her expensive possessions elsewhere , a source tells people . `` ever since the paris robbery , kim has made many changes in her life . she is much more careful about being flashy , '' the source says . kardashian west has previously spoken out about being a `` different person '' since masked men held her at gunpoint at her apartment during paris fashion week in october 2016 and took about $ 10 million worth of jewelry , including a $ 4 million ring . now , that change extends to her new home with husband kanye west and children north and saint , the insider says . ",
        "`` it 's a new year , with a new house and more changes , '' the source says . `` kim loves her new house . she wants to create the safest , best house for the kids . along with their security team , kim and kanye have made plans to keep intruders out . their new property is huge and requires even more 24/7 security staff . to keep the house safer , kim does n't want expensive possessions like jewelry at the house . '' continues the source , `` she does n't wear expensive jewelry every day , so it makes no sense to keep it at the house . ",
        "kim is trying to eliminate as many concerns as possible . after they bring the new baby home , kim just wants to enjoy her family . '' the wests recently moved into their new hidden hills , california , home . `` the new house is not completely finished , but it 's safe for the kids , '' a source told people in december . `` the plan all along was to move in before the new baby arrives . kim seems happy . she has help getting everything ready in the new house for all the kids . '' ",
        "the couple are currently expecting their third child together via surrogate . kardashian west retreated from the spotlight for several months after the robbery but has since been candid about the horrifying experience . during an appearance on the ellen degeneres show in april , the 37-year-old got emotional as she said , `` i know this sounds crazy , but i know that was meant to happen to me . '' `` i do n't want to start crying , but ... i 'm such a different person i really feel like things happen in your life to teach you things . '' ",
        "she continued , `` it was probably no secret , you see it on the show me being flashy , but i was definitely materialistic before . not that there 's anything bad about having things and working hard to get those things -- and i 'm really proud of everyone that 's around me that 's successful . but i 'm so happy that my kids get this me . and that this is who is raising my kids . because i just do n't care about that stuff anymore , i really do n't .
