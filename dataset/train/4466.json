        "for two months now , as accusations of sexual misconduct have piled up against harvey weinstein , the disgraced mogul has responded over and over again : `` any allegations of nonconsensual sex are unequivocally denied . `` consent is a concept central to law on sexual assault , and will likely be an issue in potential legal cases against weinstein , who is under investigation by police in four cities , and others accused in the current so-called `` reckoning . `` but the definition is a matter of intense debate : is it a definite `` yes , '' or the mere absence of `` no '' ? ",
        "can it be revoked ? do power dynamics come into play ? and legally , the definition varies state by state . `` half the states do n't even have a definition of consent , '' says erin murphy , a professor at new york university school of law who 's involved in a project to rewrite a model penal code on sex assault . `` one person 's idea of consent is that no one is screaming or crying . another person 's idea of consent is someone saying , ` yes , i want to do this . ' ",
        "and in between , of course , is an enormous spectrum of behavior , both verbal and nonverbal , that people engage in to communicate desire or lack of desire . '' `` it 's pretty telling , '' murphy adds , `` that the critical thing most people look to understand the nature of a sexual encounter -- this idea of consent -- is one that we do n't even have a consensus definition of in our society . `` many victim advocates argue that a power imbalance plays a role . in nearly every instance , the allegations in recent weeks came from accusers who were in far less powerful positions than those they accused -- as in , for example , the rape allegations that have surfaced against music mogul russell simmons , which he denies . ",
        "`` you have to look at the power dynamics , the coercion , the manipulation , '' says jeanie kurka reimer , a longtime advocate in the area of sexual assault . `` the threatening and grooming that perpetrators use to create confusion and compliance and fear in the minds of the victims . just going along with something does not mean consent . `` many weinstein accusers have spoken about that uneven dynamic . for years weinstein was one of the most powerful men in hollywood , and most of his alleged victims were women in their 20s , looking for their first big break . ",
        "a number have indicated that his power -- and fear of his retribution , both professional and physical -- blunted their ability to resist his advances . actress paz de la huerta , who has accused weinstein of rape , said in a tv interview : `` i just froze in fear . i guess that would be considered rape , because i did n't want to do it . `` one woman who did manage to escape weinstein 's advances in a 2014 hotel-room encounter addressed the power imbalance in a recent essay . the very word `` consent , '' actress and writer brit marling wrote in the atlantic , `` can not fully capture the complexity of the encounter . ",
        "because consent is a function of power . you have to have a modicum of power to give it . `` the anti-sexual violence organization rainn tracks the various state definitions of consent . the differences make for a situation that is `` confusing as hell , '' says rebecca o'connor , the group 's vice president of public policy . for many years , o'connor points out , `` we had this he said-she said mentality , where you went into court and if you could n't prove that you did n't consent , the activity was deemed consensual . '' ",
        "also , most states required that the accuser show force was used , to show lack of consent . `` of course , our thinking and understanding of these cases has evolved tremendously , and so states have acted in response to that , '' she says . `` what we 're finding is especially at moments like this -- when it 's impossible to ignore the conversation -- they are ... re-evaluating the factors that play into the definition of consent and how it can be expressed . `` for example , o'connor says , north carolina is looking at its law that does n't allow consent to be revoked once it 's been given -- which means that if an encounter turns violent , as in a recent reported case , the accused can not be charged with rape because the woman consented at the beginning . ",
        "and several states have passed laws requiring affirmative consent -- going further than the usual `` no means no '' standard to require an actual `` yes , '' though not necessarily verbal . among those states : wisconsin , california and florida . in florida , consent is defined as `` intelligent , knowing , and voluntary consent and does not include coerced submission . '' `` we 're not there yet , '' o'connor says , `` but a lot of states are starting to move the wheels on this . `` the varying definitions of consent can lead to confusion among the people who most need to understand them . ",
        "reimer , the victims ' advocate , recalls a wisconsin case in which a woman had experienced a violent sexual experience with a boyfriend she was trying to break up with . she had consented to sex at other times in their relationship , but was no longer interested . this time , she said no at first , but then stopped resisting as he became more agitated and her children slept nearby . `` she thought she had consented , because she had consented before , '' reimer says . `` i told her that just because you consent once , it 's not a blanket consent . ",
        "then she got it -- that this time it was rape -- and she got angry . `` murphy , at nyu , says that when the american law institute began a project several years ago to rewrite sex assault laws in its 1962 model penal code , consent was the first thing it tried to define . the institute -- an elite body of judges , lawyers and academics -- issues model laws that are often adopted by state legislatures . the project is aimed at updating the laws and dropping some particularly outdated notions , like the idea that rape can not occur within a marriage . ",
        "`` it 's been a laborious process , '' notes murphy . it took about five years to achieve the current consent definition , which recognizes that the essence of consent is willingness -- but that how willingness is expressed depends on context . murphy says it remains to be seen whether the huge attention now being paid to sexual misconduct will accelerate the process of rewriting laws , or -- as in the recent roiling debate over college campuses -- make it more complicated . at rainn , o'connor says she is hopeful that state lawmakers will pick up the pace of updating their laws with new understandings of concepts like consent . ",
        "`` we 'll see how all this plays out , because when you train the national spotlight on it , suddenly action is born , '' o'connor says . also unclear is how eager prosecutors will be to bring cases where new , expanded definitions of consent come into play , notes attorney gloria allred , who represents a number of weinstein victims and has been handling such cases for a good 40 years . she 's not so sure . `` a prosecutor is going to need to hear that the woman said ` no , ' '' allred says . ",
        "`` that 's maybe not going to be stated in the law . but i 'm dealing with real life . we could argue all day long if it 's right or wrong , but that 's the reality . ''   "
