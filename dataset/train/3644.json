        "gone are the days when district collectors and other government officials were inaccessible . today 's generation of administrators are not only accessible but also media savvy and aware of the work before them . one such ias officer is inderjeet singh , who is currently posted in chittorgarh as the collector . we , at the better india , spoke to inderjeet singh , to understand some of the programmes that he has implemented in his district . inderjeet singhinderjeet is an engineer by qualification , who worked in an mnc for two years before quitting in 2008 . ",
        "he joined the civil services in 2010 and belongs to the rajasthan cadre . `` working in the private sector was good as it gave me a different perspective of how things can be done . having this experience allows me to view things differently . working towards a goal is something that has been instilled in me by the private sector , '' he said . over the last few months , chittorgarh has been in the news because of the movie ` padmavat ' . however , another reason why it has been in the news is for the wonderful work that the district administration has been doing to educate girl children in the region . ",
        "in january 2017 , the administration launched ` udaan ' -- a campaign to ensure that all girls in the district are enrolled in schools by june 2018 . `` under the campaign , a door-to-door survey of girls in the district was conducted at the village level , and a database was prepared to connect them with education , '' said inderjeet . door-to-door data collection `` for any scheme to work it is essential to take into confidence the people whom it will impact . while the centre can set aside money for projects , the onus of making them work lies on us as administrators , '' he says . ",
        "with udaan , inderjeet speaks of the challenges they faced to get the girls to school . `` it is not enough to just have a school , proper infrastructure and sanitation are equally important . '' providing quality educationmany girls stop coming to school at the onset of puberty . those are the kind of challenges we had to work with . providing the girls with a safe and secure environment to study was the topmost priority for us . '' `` while the primary objective of udaan is to provide quality education it is so much more than that . ",
        "with this we are empowering girls with the ability to take decisions on their own , creating awareness about the world around them , and instilling confidence in them , '' says inderjeet . the four entry point activities that udaan works on are : 1 . real functional toiletstoiletsmany of girls drop out because the schools do not have proper toilets . inderjeet and his team worked on ensuring that every toilet in the district has functional toilets that are well-maintained . 2 . clean and well-maintained school buildingschool interiorone of the first things that we notice about a school is the building . ",
        "it was important for the team working on this project to ensure that school walls were whitewashed once every six months , and maintained in a clean manner , thus attracting students to come and spend time in them . 3 . welcome signs outside schoolswelcome boardswhile this sounds like a small thing , it gave students a sense of ownership towards the school . each school was given a signage board on which a welcome note was written for the students . 4 . installed full-length body mirrors in all schoolsinnovative ideawhat this full-length mirror did for the students is remarkable . ",
        "it created in them a desire to groom themselves and view themselves in a completely different light . `` we can give these students many lectures on personal hygiene and sanitation . however , with some of them never even having looked into a mirror , it was difficult to set a point of reference . seeing some of the others well turned out pushed them as well , '' says inderjeet . `` these four activities helped us set the tone for what we wish to achieve with these children . it has also been heartening to see some of these being implemented in other rajasthan districts , '' says inderjeet . ",
        "recognising the villagers as important stakeholders in this programme , the administration holds ` shiksha chopal ' at the gram panchayat level , wherein those students who have done exceedingly well come and motivate the others . almost 100 such chopals have been organised so far . shiksha chopal `` at these chopals , we hold education fairs and highlight speeches by meritorious girls . seeing how education can change a life through these activities , the villagers have started donating funds , which we use to upgrade the infrastructure of government schools . till date rs 8 crore have been collected from the people , of which we have spent rs 3.5 crore already , '' said inderjeet . ",
        "`` the support has been overwhelming , we have had an octogenarian who came forward and donated rs 35,000 , which he withdrew from a fixed deposit just because he believed in this programme and wanted to do his bit , '' says inderjeet . we wish this programme many more success and hope that other districts also follow suit . photo source : facebookyou may also like : when ` snakes and ladders ' stops being just a game , young lives are transformedlike this story ? or have something to share ? write to us : contact@thebetterindia .
