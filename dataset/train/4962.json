        "chelsea boss antonio conte has admitted chelsea have as much of a chance as arsenal to progress to the carabao cup final , despite the fact that his side wasted their home advantage in the 0-0 draw between the teams on wednesday night . both teams missed chances to take an advantage ahead of the second leg at the emirates in a couple of weeks time , with the winner of the tie gearing up to face manchester city or bristol city at the end of february . conte admitted his side needed to do more to take their chances in the final third , but remained optimistic ahead of the return against their london rivals . ",
        "speaking after the match , via football london , conte said : `` we have the same possibilities to go through to the final . not to concede could be very important for the second leg . `` to play at the emirates is not easy or simple . we deserved to be in the semi-final and be very happy to do this . `` chelsea dominated possession , especially in the second half , but failed to score despite having 21 shots on goal . he added : '' for sure i think it would be better to win the game , also 1-0 . ",
        "the positive things were that we did n't concede and when you play a semi-final with two legs and not concede at home can be important . `` we tried to win , shot 20 times , created chances but could n't take them . `` speaking on his side 's lack of conversion , conte said his side needed to train harder to pick up the slack : `` in the last period we must be more clinical , if you do n't score the game can finish in a draw . after norwich , it is the second 0-0 in a row . ",
        "we have to improve on the training pitch in this situation . `` the speech is not for the strikers , christensen had two fantastic chances to score . it is not just the strikers , who have to take chances . `` conte also gave his two cents on the var incidents in the match , where both chelsea and arsenal had penalty appeals that were deliberated over by the additional referees , taking a decent chunk out of play . `` i am sure the referee checked the situation . about var i am positive . because if there is a big doubt then it is important to check the video . ",
        "everyone wants less mistakes during the game . var technology - are we ready for it in the premier league ? yes - the refs are terrible and need all they help they can get ! no - it 's not been tested enough and right now it will ruin the beautiful game '' data-viewability = '' '' > var technology - are we ready for it in the premier league ? yes - the refs are terrible and need all they help they can get ! no - it 's not been tested enough and right now it will ruin the beautiful game `` you have to understand that when you start to use var , you have to add more time and extra time . ",
        "when there are doubts three times during the game , the extra time is 7,8,9 minutes . ''   "
