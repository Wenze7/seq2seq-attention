        "us figure skating champion bradie tennell , mirai nagasu and karen chen are headed to the pyeongchang olympics selectors said saturday as world silver medallist ashley wagner failed to make the team . usa figure skating 's selection committee announced the three women that would compete at next month 's winter games on saturday morning in the wake of their one-two-three finish at the national championships in san jose , california , on friday night . wagner , who finished fourth , was named as an alternate . tennell , 19 , has enjoyed a meteoric rise this season and earned her first olympic berth with a near-flawless free skate on friday . ",
        "`` i knew it was an olympic year , and i knew that somebody has to go , so i just kind of kept it in the back of my mind all season , '' said tennell , whose past two seasons were disrupted by back injuries . nagasu is returning to the olympics eight years after a fourth-placed finish in vancouver . she failed to make the 2014 team , despite finishing third at the national championship that year but wagner , who finished fourth then , got the nod thanks to a stronger overall performance that season . ",
        "`` i 'm aware that i 'm the oldest here tonight , but i really feel like the comeback kid , '' nagasu said on friday . chen , 18 , gained the bronze by just 2.4 points over wagner . the 2017 us champion and fourth-placed finisher at last year 's world championships , made the podium and the olympic team despite battling illness this week . three-time us champion wagner , the only us woman to win an individual olympic or world medal in the last decade , said she was `` furious '' on friday with the marks her free skate to `` la la land '' received . ",
        "she was more conciliatory on her twitter feed on saturday . `` as a senior competitor with over 10 years of experience , i 'm allowed to question things , '' she wrote . `` at the end of the day , i laid out my best and i 'm going home proud ! congrats to the lovely ladies of the team , you 've got me in your cheering squad now !
