        "fighting between rival libyan militias near tripoli 's international airport left at least 16 people dead and grounded flights , further exposing the un-backed government 's fragile hold on the capital . at least 38 others were wounded , according to abdul-daim al-rabti , head of tripoli 's field hospital . prime minister fayez al-sarraj said the attackers sought the release of al-qaeda and islamic state prisoners held at a major jail in the airport facility . two cargo planes were hit in the fighting and a nearby highway was shut . the assault was led by the tripoli-based al-burga militia , while the airport is guarded and operated by the special deterrence force , a salafi-oriented militia allied with sarraj 's government . ",
        "among the militants and political detainees held at the prison is the brother of the suicide bomber who attacked a concert in the u. k. city of manchester in may . more than six years after the ouster and killing of longtime leader moammar qaddafi , oil-rich libya is a divided nation mired in civil and economic strife . un-mediated peace efforts have so far failed to bridge the divide between the sarraj administration and a rival legislature based in the east that 's dominated by khalifa haftar , who heads the country 's most powerful force . -- with assistance by saleh sarrar .
