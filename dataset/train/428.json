        "netflix stock climbed in premarket trading on tuesday after an analyst upgraded it as part of a broader realignment of his strategy on media stocks . the new strategy favors subscription-based media businesses over ad-focused firms due to the growing trend of ad avoidance among consumers . before that upgrade , another analyst suggested there 's a relatively high probability we will see apple buying netflix . jgryntysz / pixabaynetflix stock upgraded to outperformin a note on tuesday , macquarie analyst tim nollen said he has upgraded netflix stock from neutral to outperform and set his price target at $ 220 per share . ",
        "in addition to a subscription focus , he also favors firms with `` scaled distribution with an international presence . '' nollen believes that netflix `` changed the way people watch tv and notes that it is pushing even further into the film industry . he explained that consumers are taking steps to avoid advertising more and more , and this habit is causing them to shift to over-the-top streaming services . how netflix is driving improved revenue , earnings qualityadditionally , he likes the `` improving quality '' of the streaming firm 's revenues and earnings . he believes that the streaming firm is looking beyond what he describes as `` the market 's obsession '' with subscriber numbers by trying to improve its earnings and revenue quality . ",
        "he explained that the next round of subscription price increases is now beginning , which should improve the firm 's revenue quality . further , he said the firm is expanding its distribution relationships with global cable tv providers and telcos and pushing international growth via local content . he also pointed out that netflix is trying to reduce password sharing , which could increase its subscriber count even further . he argued that the streaming firm is `` actually being more judicious '' about how much it spends on original content , contrary to the many headlines reporting that it 's willing to spend $ 20 million per original tv episode . ",
        "nollen believes netflix can save money by spending less on licensed content . one continuing risk for netflix stock is its negative free cash flow , which is why so many analysts are concerned about original content spending . however , nollen also pointed out that investors do n't seem to care about this , based on the runaway value of netflix stock . the net neutrality repeal could also be a risk if telecom firms decide to take advantage of their new ability to begin charging the streaming firm for internet fast lanes for its customers . no threat from disney + fox comboin his upgrade report on netflix stock , nollen also described netflix as being `` miles ahead of peers , '' noting that walt disney 's `` eventual '' streaming service is still a couple years away . ",
        "many analysts who cover disney praised the acquisition of fox 's entertainment assets and stake in hulu because the fox deal positions disney to become a more formidable opponent to netflix and amazon prime instant video . however , nollen does n't expect disney to threaten netflix at all because netflix continues to hold a strong domestic subscriber base and is also `` establishing passion brand status in many international markets . '' apple buying netflix ? same suggestion , new yearnetflix stock also may have been supported by another report from citi analysts . according to business insider and numerous other media outlets , citi analyst jim suva argued this week that there is a 40 % probability of apple buying netflix , thanks in part to president trump 's corporate tax cut . ",
        "the iphone maker 's domestic cash pile is expected to become much larger because of that tax cut and a one-time tax repatriation holiday . suva and team analyzed several potential acquisition targets for apple , and of the options , they gave the possibility of apple buying netflix the highest probability . bi states that the note was actually written before the disney-fox deal was announced officially , and at the time , they gave a 20 % to 30 % probability of apple buying disney . this is n't the first time we 're hearing an analyst suggest we could see apple buying netflix , and the argument remains standard : apple wants original content and a strong presence in streaming . ",
        "citi analysts argued the same thing in may 2017 , and several others suggested the same thing even before that . in fact , suggestions about apple buying netflix stretch back years to at least may 2016 . according to suva 's latest report , if we do see apple buying netflix , the iphone maker would only need about one-third of the expected $ 220 billion in cash it 's expected to have after it repatriates its cash . netflix stock surged by as much as 3.28 % to $ 198.25 in early trading on tuesday . the post apple buying netflix rumors are back again appeared first on valuewalk .
