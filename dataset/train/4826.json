        "iowa city , iowa -- next week 's pinstripe bowl in new york could be iowa junior cornerback josh jackson 's last game as a hawkeye . jackson said tuesday that he is `` 50-50 '' on whether he will come back for his senior season , adding that he will likely announce his plans for 2018 after the hawkeyes face boston college on dec. . 27 at yankee stadium . `` i 've definitely thought about it ... i 've talked with coach a little bit about it , '' said jackson , who redshirted his first season and is set to graduate in may . ",
        "`` i 've thought both ways , both perspectives . `` if jackson leaves , he will be remembered for a college career that was brief but brilliant . after sitting out his first year , jackson spent the next two seasons as a reserve . iowa had an opening at cornerback after thorpe award winner desmond king graduated , and jackson won a fierce battle to claim his spot . no one could foresee just how good jackson would be in 2017 in his first season as a starter . he tied for the national lead with seven interceptions , returned two of those for touchdowns against wisconsin and joined linebacker josey jewell as a first-team all-america pick .

        "jackson 's numbers , along with his 6-foot-1 , 195-pound frame and his abundance of physical gifts , have left many nfl draft pundits pegging him as a possible first-round pick in 2018 . king was in a similar spot and chose to stay for his senior season . if jackson follows suit , the hawkeyes could enter 2018 with one of the best defenses in the country . `` we joke about it , '' defensive coordinator phil parker said . `` it 's a decision he is going to have to make with his family and what 's best for him ... if he chooses to go , i am happy for him and wish him the best of luck . ",
        "if he stays , he 'll be our best recruit in the . `` the hawkeyes have lost their last five bowl games , and their 21-14 defeat to lsu in the 2013 outback bowl was the only game in that skid that was particularly close . the meeting next week will be the first between iowa and boston college . the eagles , like the hawkeyes , have evolved into a program intent on playing strong defense and running the ball . boston college rushed for 224 yards per game in the regular season and gave up just 22.5 points per outing . ",
        "`` both schematically and their attitude , the way they approach playing offense is very similar to iowa . it 's something that excites us . we get to see that every day in practice so we feel that we match up well , '' iowa defensive lineman parker hesse said . more college football : and .
