        "cpi growth ` could reach 3 % in february ' china 's consumer inflation increased by 1.6 percent last year , lower than the yearly control target of 3 percent . analysts said it will moderately rise by over 2 percent this year , but will not trigger any major monetary policy adjustment . the consumer price index accelerated to 1.8 percent in december , the national bureau of statistics announced on its website . weakening food prices are a major contributor to the fall in cpi inflation last month , sheng guoqing , a senior statistician of the nbs , said in a statement . ",
        "non-food price rises are the main cause of the overall growth , he said . whole-year cpi growth came in at 2 percent in 2016 , according to the nbs . china set the control target of 3 percent last year . looking ahead , the consumer inflation rate could surge in february , in which the spring festival falls , analysts said . the seven-day holiday for the festival generally boosts consumption and consumer prices . zhu jianfang , chief economist at citic securities , said cpi growth could reach 3 percent in february and the whole-year reading could rise to 2.5 percent this year . ",
        "huatai securities forecast in a research note that average cpi growth could be around 2.5 percent this year . if international oil prices rose to about $ 75 a barrel , china 's inflation could reach 3 percent , it said . `` the expected high cpi reading in february could have a short-term impact on monetary policymaking and the financial market , '' zhu said . but for the whole year , moderate cpi growth will not have a major bearing on the current monetary policy stance , said yan ling , analyst with china merchants securities . yan forecast whole-year cpi growth of 2.3 percent . ",
        "monetary policy will become neutral this year , analysts said . `` this year 's regulatory focus will be on prevention of risks and cutting leverage , '' according to a haitong securities research note . china 's producer price index , which gauges factory-gate prices and is a major indicator of business health , rose 4.9 percent from a year earlier in december , compared with 5.8 percent in november . it is the slowest growth in 13 months . the ppi decline is attributable to the weakening price growth in such sectors as oil and gas exploration , ferrous and non-ferrous metals , and coal mining and washing , which had bolstered the strong growth of ppi in previous months . ",
        "for the whole of 2017 , ppi rose by 6.3 percent , compared with a drop of 1.4 percent for 2016 , reversing the trend of continual ppi decline since 2012 . wang yanfei contributed to this story .   "
