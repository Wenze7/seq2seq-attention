        "how do i prove to the assam nrc that my wife is an indian ? this is a question i have been unsuccessfully seeking an answer to for the last year-and-a-half -- at least ever since i submitted the application for enrolment of my family into the national register of citizens . the aim of the nrc is to identify foreigners , particularly people from bangladesh , who have illegally entered assam after 25 march 1971 , and separate these illegal immigrants from genuine indian citizens . but even for those who were in assam before 25 march 1971 or whose ancestors were living in the state before that date , the process to enrol into the nrc is not simple . ",
        "the one basic rule that the nrc has adopted is tracing one 's legacy . one has to show that he/she is linked to a family member whose name was there in the nrc of 1951 or to any of assam 's electoral rolls prepared till 1971 . such legacy data was uploaded on the nrc website sometime in 2015 . the legacy data from the nrc website shows the author 's father 's name in the 1966 voters ' list . assam elections -- `` i am a muslim and i am not a bangladeshi '' coming back to my story , we are a family of four -- my mother , daughter ruhaani , and wife sudipa and i -- but only three of us could provide our legacy record -- my mother , my daughter , and i . ",
        "we could not trace sudipa 's legacy data . it 's almost certain than her name wo n't be there when the first draft of the nrc is published on 31 december 2017 . sudipa 's case is similar to lakhs of married women in assam who have found it extremely tough to prove their legacy . it is estimated that only 40 percent names out of 2.38 crore applicants will feature in the first draft . the nrc acknowledgement slip states that sudipa mandal 's nrc is not verified . amendments to citizenship act in assam is bjp 's political ploysudipa was born in shillong , the capital of meghalaya . ",
        "she holds an indian passport , has a voter id card , and an aadhaar number . but since she was born well after 1971 , merely having these documents are not enough to enroll her name into the nrc . what 's more important is that her father 's name figures in one of the following documents which were issued before the midnight of 25 march 1971 . these documents would prove his residence in assam before that date . 1951 nrcelectoral roll up to 24 march 1971 land and tenancy records orpassportlicbank/post office accounts orbirth certificateboard/university educational certificatethis maze of documentation has made the nrc process very complicated for sudipa . ",
        "her father lives in meghalaya , which was previously part of assam but became a separate state on 21 january 1972 . due to some unfortunate circumstances , he could n't find any pre-1971 document , so this puts sudipa 's nrc enrolment into jeopardy . for now , the nrc has given us some time to prove sudipa 's citizenship . just like sudipa , millions in assam are going through this dilemma , those whose nrc enrolment is stuck because of lack of documentation or delay in verification of documents by other states or education boards which are outside assam . ",
        "over 50 lakh documents were sent for verification , of which only 1.5 lakh have been verified by other states . unlike assam , for other states , the nrc is certainly not top priority . so , they are taking their own sweet time . as for sudipa , now it is up to us if we can dig out some pre-1971 document which will prove her dad 's legacy in assam . till then , the question will linger -- how do i prove to the nrc that my wife is an indian ? and what happens if i am unable to do so ?
