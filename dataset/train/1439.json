        "the measure of a man , according to plato , is what he does with his power . wall street 's bill miller has taken the adage to heart , donating $ 75 million to philosophy -- a branch of study that has been critical , he says , to decisions he has made in his career . miller , an investor famous for beating the standard and poor 's 500 index for 15 years in a row , was a graduate student for three years in johns hopkins university 's phd program . his gift to the school , announced yesterday , will nearly double the size of its philosophy department -- bumping the full-time faculty from 13 to 22 professors , and creating new courses and scholarships for graduate students . ",
        "it 's the largest gift to any college 's philosophy department ever recorded . philosophy `` has made a huge difference both to my life outside business , in terms of adding a great degree of richness and knowledge , and to the actual decisions i 've made in investing , '' miller , 67 , told the new york times . and he told bloomberg that `` the habits of analysis that philosophy teaches -- rigorous analytical techniques -- are something that 's essential to investing . '' while investors often bandy about the word `` philosophy '' to describe their personal strategies in money management , very few have credited their work back to ancient philosophers themselves , the two most notable exceptions being george soros and carl icahn , the former being an open admirer of austrian thinker karl popper , and the latter majoring in philosophy at princeton . ",
        "johns hopkins president ronald daniels called miller 's gift `` so wonderfully contrarian , '' adding that it is `` spectacular '' for a leader in a quantitative field to draw attention to a discipline as old as philosophy . other departments in the humanities , many of which are feared to be dying out these days as jobs get more specified , are no doubt perking up in hope . unfortunately , literature and art history majors who scored big on wall street are few and far between .
