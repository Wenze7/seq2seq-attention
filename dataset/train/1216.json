",
        "councillor brown said the timing of right lane filters at the mill street/croftfoot road/blairbeth road junction left many drivers frustrated . he added : `` i must have had complaints from pretty much every significant road that goes across rutherglen and cambuslang . `` the new road takes some of that away but it will not take away all of it . what we need to do is encourage more people to use the new road . '' jim neil agreed , and said the council had to `` try and keep traffic on the roads that are designed to take it . '' ",
        "the reformer has previously reported on residents ' concerns about burnside roads being used as ` rat runs ' . brian shields , from broomieknowe road , once again spoke at the meeting on the issues facing him and his neighbours . meanwhile , pedestrians have been reassured they do have enough time to cross the relief road at the lights . some complaints had been raised about the length of time the green man was on . but community council secretary alison black told the meeting she had received a response from south lanarkshire council which said the traffic lights are fitted with sensors and would not turn from red until no-one was on the road .
