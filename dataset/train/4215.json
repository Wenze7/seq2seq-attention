        "2017 has been an insane year , my nomadic 2017 as i called it ! so much has happened , split over 4 continents , including some 61,000 km of travel and it 's just the beginning . to say i 've been bitten by the nomadic lifestyle bug would be an understatement . after the brutality that brexit caused my business in 2016 , i had an uphill struggle that lasted for about 6 months . during those months , grafting , working and killing myself trying to bring my business back from the abyss , i decided that 2017 was going to be different . ",
        "you can read about that here ; why i plan to leave it all behind me in 2017 ! i wanted to take a minute to look back over the year , which has seen me travel to south east asia , cross the atlantic on a cruise ship and travel almost the whole of central america . it really has been a ridiculous year for travel , work , new experiences and new friendships . for the last couple of days , i 've been trying to pull some of my favourite moments from the nomadic 2017 year and the truth is , it 's been really hard picking out what moments have left the strongest feelings . ",
        "i 'm going to give it a go anyways . here are the top 5 that stick out in my mind : 1 . sunrise in angkor wotyes , it 's super `` touristy '' , but what the hell . it was an incredible experience , to be stood in the dark and watch these huge temples appear out of nowhere as the sun came up . sharing the experience with about 3,000 people at the same time , all armed with selfie sticks and cameras is n't ideal , but nonetheless , this had been on my unofficial `` bucket list '' since i was 17 and saw the tomb raider film . ",
        "2 . getting padi open water certifiedafter having probably 20 dives times around the world over the years , i finally got my first qualification for diving . this allows me to start exploring more of the underwater world and i ca n't wait . in fact , i 'm going for my advanced very soon , so will be updating the blog about the diving spots . also snuck in a dive in a volcanic lagoon , laguna apoyo in nicaragua . 3 . canyoning in uvita , costa ricawith new friends and old friends , we managed to find a canyon to descend in uvita , costa rica . ",
        "it was incredible . i rocked up with a massive hangover , which i really do n't recommend . having said that , by the time i was crossing under the second of five waterfalls , i had well and truly sobered up and felt great . 4 . sunset at the conrad in koh samuithe conrad hotel in koh samui is situated on top of a cliff , facing west over the water . it 's incredible . worth the long drive up windy hills to get there . especially when you then find out cocktails are two-for-one . ",
        "sat there watching the sunset go down was one of the most peaceful experiences this year , truly enjoyed it . 5 . crossing the atlantic ocean on the nomad cruisethe cruise across the atlantic had mixed emotions for me . for one thing , i now know that cruises are n't really for me . the best part though was the people i met . some incredibly inspiring individuals , either trying to break out of the corporate world or already killing it in their own nomadic style . there was something about being in the atlantic for days on end , only seeing water and the sun go up and down . ",
        "plus open bar , which made it more fun . too many to write about ! the truth is , these are just a few , but this list could easily have 30 or 40 items on it . everything from finding a secret bar in cambodia , visiting ha long bay with new friends in vietnam , partying for a night in dubai , diving in a volcanic lake in nicaragua , spending thanksgiving with americans in costa rica , rooftop restaurants in bangkok , songkran in chiang mai , tacos in san juan del sur , walking to a waterfall in koh samui , kayaking through the mangroves near krabi , helping baby turtles in to the sea , the list goes on and on and on . ",
        "it really was a nomadic 2017 , travelling as much as i could ! i guess this article is really just about looking at how my lifestyle developed and the design that i made for myself . it 's not a finished article , it 's a work in progress , but i 've spent more than 18 months building the life that i really want . now i get to live it and that 's the best part . nomadic 2017 : a work in progress ! but it 's not all good . as i said , it 's definitely a work in progress and recently a friend i met on the nomad cruise posted something that inspired me for this next section . ",
        "tomas laurinavicius posted a review of his 2017 . you can find it here ; life designed â„– 74 . the bit that really got me was things he could do better and it made me think about it . instead of spending time writing some rubbish set of resolutions for the new year , that will probably all get broken , i figure i would simply write down 10 things that i feel i could have done better last year . so here we go : journaling -- not leaving weeks at a time between entries . diet -- paying a little more attention to what i eat on a daily basis . ",
        "reading -- i 've probably only read 7 books this year and listened to another 12 or so on audible . meditation -- the headspace app on my phone has only been used about 10 times all year . podcasts -- i used to live off podcasts , listening to interesting interviews , then suddenly stopped altogether . side projects -- i 've set up and built new projects , but not finished and launched them yet . not good enough ! keeping in touch with friends and family -- i try my best , but i 'm pretty bad and can go weeks without talking to the important people in my life . ",
        "taking advantage of experiences -- being in new countries and having the chance to do new things . relationships -- i 'm in a relationship with someone i truly care about and know i need to work harder on the relationship . walking -- i only walked on average 121 km per month . this should be at least 150 km a month . truth is there is a lot i could improve on , but starting the new year with these in mind , i feel like i have a realistic and achievable list i can work on going forward . ",
        "coming back to this article every now and again , to make sure i 'm not repeating the same mistakes this year . looking forward to 2018 ! 2018 wo n't be too different to this past nomadic 2017 year . i 'm still in central america as i write this and i 'm not done in terms of travel . so far i 've visited some 38 countries across the globe and this year i have a lot more to go to hit my goal of having visited 50 % of all countries in the world by the end of this year .
