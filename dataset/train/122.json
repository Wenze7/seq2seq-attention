        "economics : forget what economic `` experts '' or pollsters say about the republican economic agenda ; the people are moving to more conservative states that impose fewer taxes and less regulation . the latest bit of evidence comes from north american moving services , which annually reports where people are moving to , and from , within the u. s.its findings show that between 2011 and 2017 , 10 states saw a net influx of people from other states in one or more of those years , while 9 suffered losses . the rest of the states saw no net change in any of those years . ",
        "south carolina , arizona , florida and north carolina were net winners in most of those years . new jersey , illinois , connecticut , pennsylvania and michigan were consistent losers . what do these states have in common ? gainers consistently show up in lists of states with low taxes , less regulation , and a more business friendly economic climate . losers are consistently high-tax , high regulation , union-friendly states . seven of the states that gained population , for example , rank in the top 10 on business friendliness , according to ceo magazine . of the nine states that lost population , five are the least business-friendly . ",
        "no hidden agenda : get news from a pro-free market , pro-growth perspectiveof the states that gained population in one of those years , the average tax burden as a share of state income was 8.8 % . the average for losing states : 10.8 % . what 's more , as economist mark perry notes , the states with net inflows of people are doing better economically than those with net outflows -- they had stronger gdp growth , higher employment growth and lower unemployment rates . the problem is compounded by the fact that as people leave those high-tax states , they take their tax revenues with them . ",
        "yet , some people still try to make the case that there 's no real economic benefit to cutting taxes and regulations . president obama during his eight years in office repeatedly stated that cutting taxes and regulations `` never worked . `` a recent usa today op-ed tries to make the case for big-government , but comes up short . the only evidence cited is the fact that high-tech firms are centered in blue states like california , and a dubious wallethub survey of the most `` innovative states '' that ranks washington , d. c. , no . ",
        "1 and maryland no . 2 . those are thin reeds indeed . the piece also claims that high-tax states are better places to live because median incomes are higher . `` alaska is the only red state in the top 10 , '' the author notes , pointing to census data . but that does n't take into account the differences in cost of living . a $ 50,000 income will go a lot farther in alabama than in connecticut . once you account for that , all but four of the top 10 are in red states . ",
        "thankfully , the republican leadership in washington is following the model of economically successful states , and not those that are seeing residents flee in search of jobs and opportunities . related : best-run states are low-tax republican , worst-run are high-tax democratic , study findsnew york , california are rock bottom on economic freedom -- againincome inequality is greatest in the most liberal statesclick here for more commentary and opinion from investor 's business daily . want to make more money in the stock market ? start with ibd university .
