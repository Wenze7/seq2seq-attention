        "nigella lawson has hit back at an australian tv host 's suggestion she deliberately uses innuendo during her cooking shows . the celebrity chef became visibly frustrated after presenter hamish macdonald read out quotes from her shows in an apparent attempt to insinuate her presenting style has sexual undertones . `` i 've been intrigued to read you 've been rejecting all of the analysis of your cooking shows ... all this kind of innuendo , '' macdonald said on channel ten 's the project show . `` you 're saying : ` i do n't do it on purpose , it 's not part of the plan ' . ",
        "but i 've got some quotes . `` quoting lawson , he added : `` my empty vessels are ready to be loaded , i adore the way it comes bulging up over the rim '' . noticeably irritated , the chef , who is estimated to have sold more than 3 million cookery books worldwide , insisted his suggestion she deliberately uses innuendo was wrong . appearing lost for words , she replied : `` yes but why , tell me this -- it 's an empty vessel ... when i say it ... `` macdonald interjected and again appeared to imply the use of language was intentional . ",
        "`` you have this way of saying things , '' he insisted . hitting back , lawson replied : `` i have this way of people projecting things on me . i 'm so not . i do n't get it . i need you to explain to me . `` viewers criticised macdonald 's questioning and accused him of sexism on social media . `` disrespectful way to end an otherwise good interview . i hope hamish has apologised to nigella , '' said twitter user , gareth hallaran . `` honestly hamish , she 's said she does n't intend the double entendres on her show . ",
        "how disrespectful to ask further . have you learned nothing from the #metoo #timesup movement ? your behaviour was inappropriate . pull your head in . and good on ya @nigella_lawson for pushing back , '' added another . a third added : `` hope you ask gordon ramsay that same question you asked nigella lawson . '' over christmas , lawson wooed viewers on an episode of nigella : at my table by coining a new word `` quackling '' -- a reference to the crispy skin on a roast duck .   "
