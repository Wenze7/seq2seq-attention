        "for the first time since the nfl playoffs expanded to 12 teams , a no . 1 seed is a betting underdog to a no . 6 team . for the now-underdog philadelphia eagles , that 's a statement about how valuable second-year quarterback carson wentz has been . for the atlanta falcons , it 's a testament to how dangerous last year 's nfc champions can be in the postseason . the two teams meet saturday with a spot in the conference championship game on the line . kickoff is set for 4:35 p. m. et and will be broadcast on nbc . ",
        "philadelphia has plenty to prove despite a 13-3 season . the eagles lost mvp candidate wentz to a torn acl in week 14 , handing an explosive offense over to nick foles . the former pro bowler has n't been especially bad as a short-notice starter , but he has n't been wentz . philly scored 31 points per game with its young gun behind center . under foles , that number has dropped to 17.7 -- although one of those games was a shutout in a meaningless week 17 tilt vs. the cowboys . the falcons are trending in a different direction . ",
        "the franchise has faced elimination games in each of the past two weeks -- a win-and-in week 17 contest against the panthers and last week 's wild card game with the rams . while matt ryan and julio jones are the team 's headliners , an opportunistic defense has been the catalyst behind atlanta 's recent run ; the falcons have forced five turnovers in their two must-win games . time , tv channel , and streaming infotime : 4:35 p. m. etlocation : lincoln financial field , philadelphiatv : nbcstreaming : nbc sports live , fubotv | yahoo! sportsodds : atlanta is favored by 3 points . ",
        "falcons at eagles news : philadelphia is 2-1 since foles took over as starter , but he has n't fulfilled expectations in bettors ' eyes : the eagles emerged as clear super bowl contenders with carson wentz under center going 11-2 su and 10-3 ats through their first 13 games . but when wentz tore his acl against the los angeles rams in week 14 , the air of invincibility around this team quickly diminished . nick foles is a serviceable backup but is n't viewed as the type of player who can win quarterback duels and carry a team deep into the postseason . ",
        "philadelphia is 0-3 ats over its last three games since foles took over as starter . these 2018 falcons refuse to be defined by the game that ended last year 's playoff run . you know the one : `` well , we 're not supposed to talk about it , but i will say that we as a team , as a brotherhood , know all there is to know about taking care of today for today , about not getting ahead of ourselves and how doing that can put you in a bind , '' falcons linebacker sean weatherspoon said . ",
        "`` when you talk about the dos and do n'ts of winning , we 've learned some lessons there in the hardest way . and through it all , we 've leaned on each other . `` with wentz in the fold , the 2017 eagles looked a lot like the 2016 cowboys -- which may not bode well for their playoff hopes : the parallels between the year-separated division rivals are clear . there 's a young , emerging quarterback behind center directing traffic and earning mvp consideration . there 's a lengthy winning streak propelling them to the top of the nfc east . ",
        "a high-powered offense and an above-average defense have been the engine between each franchise 's sudden rise . but the eagles are doing what last year 's cowboys did , but better -- at least through 11 games . saturday 's game will be matt ryan 's first opportunity to face his hometown team in the playoffs : matt ryan went to boston college , but he 's a philadelphia native . that 's where he started playing football , that 's where he became a highly sought-after quarterback prospect , and that 's where he 'll return on saturday to face his hometown philadelphia eagles . ",
        "since foles has been relegated to backup status in recent seasons , it 's easy to forget he was briefly one of the league 's best quarterbacks . his 2013 sophomore season featured a then-record 27:2 touchdown-to-interception ratio and earned him a pro bowl nod ; he 's been chasing that kind of production ever since . while he may not be able to return to those heights , he 's been a perfectly serviceable passer in the interim . a solid defense and cache of offense weapons helped him post a 5-1 record in games where he threw at least 10 passes over the past two seasons . ",
        "his last playoff performance was a modest 195-yard , two-touchdown showing back in ` 13 . if he can just be similarly successful on saturday , he 'll have a shot to push the eagles to the nfc title game . falcons at eagles prediction : five of our seven human experts took atlanta in their divisional round picks . oddsshark 's computer did , as well . subscribe to rise and grind rise 'n grind with us .
