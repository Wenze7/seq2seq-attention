        "although the 2017 season was downright awful , there were a few glimmers of hope . this new york giants season has seen more travesty than the city of troy did when the greeks waltzed in their magnificent horse . and like the trojans , the giants ' power has been relinquished due to their own ineptitude . teams have come into their home and made a mockery of them . both the head coach and general manager were run out of town . a once highly touted cornerback in eli apple has shown signs of complete lack of maturity . ",
        "their stoic run defense has allowed the second most rushing yards in the nfl . but perhaps the most embarrassing fact of them all , they have still yet to pick up a conference win . despite the heaps of embarrassment bestowed upon the team and fanbase , all hope is not lost for the giants empire . they still , believe it or not , have some bright spots on their roster . a fourth-round running back has picked up the slack in a lackluster backfield . rookie leaderboards have been occupied by their strong interior defensive lineman . ",
        "the nfc 's strong safety slot will be occupied by their very own in the upcoming pro bowl . a revolutionary tight end has led them in receiving yards . and amidst a wounded receiving corps , an unsung hero has risen to the occasion . the giants may be hurt , disappointed , and in complete chaos , but the future still has hope thanks to these five players . # 5 -- rb wayne gallmandenver , co -- october 15 : running back wayne gallman # 22 of the new york giants fights for a yard as he rushes against the denver broncos in the third quarter of a game at sports authority field at mile high on october 15 , 2017 in denver , colorado . ",
        "the giants backfield has been nothing to gawk over , with just 5 combined rushing touchdowns on the year . however , the fourth-round draft pick out of clemson has been pretty good when given the opportunity . despite orleans darkwa getting the starts , it has been gallman who has been leading big blue 's backs in just about every category recently . per new york 's team website , in the past two games , gallman leads the other backs in rushing yards , attempts , receptions , and receiving yards . he has a modest 4.3 yards per attempt on the season , and a receiving touchdown . ",
        "behind a poor offensive line , gallman has shown the ability to evolve into a solid pass-catching tailback . # 4 -- dt dalvin tomlinsonlandover , md -- november 23 : defensive tackle dalvin tomlinson # 94 of the new york giants sits on the bench in the closing moments of the giants 20-10 loss to the washington redskins at fedexfield on november 23 , 2017 in landover , maryland . last year the giants had one of the most feared rush defenses in the entire league . it was arguably their main asset that led them to the playoffs . ",
        "this year has been a different story . they have allowed the second most rush yards in the nfl . but the numbers may not be as bad as they appear . they still rank top ten in rushing touchdowns allowed , as well as scoring percentage . a reason their defense has not been a complete mockery can be due to their young stud , dalvin tomlinson . pro football focus has consistently ranked tomlinson as the top rookie interior defender in the league over the course of the season . he has a grade of 82.8 , which is by far the best for rookies at his position . ",
        "an incredible stat they pointed out following week 14 was that out of 125 interior defenders who qualify , tomlinson is just one out of six who have 20 or more run stops without missing a tackle . if tomlinson can build on this incredible rookie season as a reliable run plugging threat , he can evolve into one of the best interior defensive linemen in the game . # 3 -- ss landon collinslandover , md -- january 01 : strong safety landon collins # 21 of the new york giants reacts after sacking quarterback kirk cousins # 8 of the washington redskins in the first quarter at fedexfield on january 1 , 2017 in landover , maryland . ",
        "the giants ' lone pro bowler has done an excellent job building on to his sophomore success . the only reason collins is n't no . 1 on this list is because he did n't live up to his expectations in 2017 . collins took the league by storm last year with five interceptions , four sacks , and 100 tackles . although the third-year man out of alabama has taken a bit of a step backward from a statistical standpoint , it 's hard to blame him considering the team has crumbled around him . nonetheless , collins leads the team in tackles and has tried to hold his other young teammates accountable . ",
        "at just 24 years old , collins should remain the fixture of the giants defense for years to come . # 2 -- te evan engrameast rutherford , nj -- september 18 : evan engram # 88 of the new york giants scores an 18 yard touchdown in the second quarter against the detroit lions during their game at metlife stadium on september 18 , 2017 in east rutherford , new jersey . if you 're like me , you were probably completely confused when the giants decided to surpass taking an offensive lineman in the first-round of the 2017 draft . ",
        "and despite the complete failure of the team , you are probably thanking whatever sort of higher power you believe in that evan engram is wearing blue . engram leads the giants with 710 receiving yards and six touchdowns on the year . he has proven to be a matchup nightmare for opposing defenses . many big blue fans are excited to see how defenses handle him when the g-men have all of their weapons . he 's had some bad drops on the season , but those can be chalked up as typical rookie blunders . # 1 -- wr sterling shepard santa clara , ca -- november 12 : sterling shepard # 87 of the new york giants reacts after a play against the san francisco 49ers during their nfl game at levi 's stadium on november 12 , 2017 in santa clara , california . ",
        "with the injuries to obj , brandon marshall , and dwayne harris , shepard handled being the outside threat for the giants pretty well . in just nine starts , shepard has put up 686 yards and two touchdowns on the year . despite battling injuries , he has found a way to put up numerous big plays . the reason shepard is no . 1 on this list is because before the season , everyone was talking about obj and marshall and how dominant new york 's passing attack would be . things did not go as planned . ",
        "however , shepard battled through all of the muck and distractions to lead this offense . i for one , can not wait to see the future this man has with the team when he and all of his counterparts are healthy . more from gmen hq why new york giants should shut down landon collins1 d ago new york giants : 3 reasons for , against eli manning 's return2d ago new york giants : special teams were anything but ... 2d ago eli manning unable to lift new york giants to win over eagles3d ago new york giants vs. eagles : my top 3 memories in the series4d ago although the 2017 season was downright awful , there were a few glimmers of hope .
