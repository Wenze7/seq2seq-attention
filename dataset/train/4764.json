        "liverpool supporters have been somewhat subdued in the transfer tavern in recent times after seeing their side only manage a 0-0 draw at home to struggling west brom in the premier league on wednesday night , a result which instigated their fall to fifth place in the division . jurgen klopp 's men went into their clash with the baggies off the back of conceding a late leveller to only draw 1-1 at home to everton in the merseyside derby on sunday , thus seriously frustrating our resident liverpudlians following a run of three straight wins in all competitions . ",
        "and they were n't able to get back to winning ways on wednesday night either , as alan pardew 's side produced an excellent defensive performance to deservedly take a point from the encounter , in turn becoming just the third side , after the manchester duo , to prevent liverpool scoring in a premier league game this season . consequently , there have been many downbeat reds fans in the tavern in recent times , several of whom are eagerly anticipating the january transfer window , and thus who their team could look to sign in a bid for a more successful second half of the season . ",
        "and one man they have been linked with in recent times is roma defender emerson palmieri , whom the reds reportedly wanted to sign during the summer before injury to the 23-year-old thwarted their chances . and although the former brazil youth international has managed just 15 minutes of action this term due to injury , klopp 's men are reportedly seeking to reignite their interest in the left-back in january , in a move which would plunge andrew robertson 's liverpool future into huge doubt . ultimately , the scotland international was brought in over the summer as a replacement for the struggling alberto moreno , who endured a torrid campaign last time out and was subsequently dropped in favour of midfielder james milner . ",
        "yet it has n't quite happened for robertson , who has made just five premier league starts so far what with moreno 's form having somewhat improved in the early phase of the campaign . but for klopp to reportedly still retain an interest in palmieri suggests that the german remains unsatisfied with his current left-back options , and with moreno seemingly ahead of robertson in the pecking order , that does n't spell good news for the 23-year-old scotsmen . and with palmieri also 23 years of age , it would n't be a short-term fix either , which itself plunges robertson 's long-term future at the club into doubt as well , as he 'd be battling with the roma ace for a place in klopp 's starting eleven . ",
        "ultimately , the left-back department is an area of the pitch which has n't been particularly strong for liverpool in recent years , but for klopp to still seek a move for palmieri , just months after landing robertson , does n't say great things about the scotsman . as such , if palmieri does indeed make the move to the merseyside giants in january , the liverpool star 's future would be plunged into even greater doubt . liverpool fans ... what do you think ? let us know !
