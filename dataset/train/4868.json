        "four out of five families made homeless in the grenfell tower tragedy are facing christmas without a proper home . almost six months on from the deadly blaze , in which 71 died and hundreds were made homeless , 103 households from the block remain in hotel rooms . pa : press association . a further 11 are in serviced apartments and four are staying with loved ones , meaning 118 remain in emergency accommodation . the local authority was accused of making `` one broken promise after another '' , having previously expressed confidence every survivor would be out of emergency rooms by christmas . ",
        "at a meeting last night council leader elizabeth campbell pledged that all survivors of the tragedy would have new homes by june . she said : `` all of us sympathise with those who are still living in hotels with their children , especially at christmas . `` i have always said we can only move at the pace at which victims and survivors feel comfortable : no-one should be rushed into making such an important decision about where they are going to live . `` however , i do accept , as we have heard tonight and last night at scrutiny , for some the pace is painfully slow . '' ",
        "survivors have expressed frustration at how regularly the rehousing deadline has shifted , stretching back to the immediate aftermath of the june 14 inferno . days after the fire theresa may initially appeared to pledge that everyone left destitute would be in temporary new homes within three weeks . so far only 42 families have moved into permanent addresses , meaning the remaining 166 , including 48 temporary places , could spend the festive period without a new home , survivors say . currently 29 of the families still in hotels have children , meaning many youngsters will likely wake up in hotel rooms on christmas morning . ",
        "there were 209 families in need of rehousing following the disaster , according to updated council figures released on wednesday . shahin sadafi , chairman of grenfell united , an elected body set up by survivors and bereaved relatives , said : `` first it was three weeks , then six months now they are saying a year . `` for the survivors and affected families it seems like one broken promise after another . `` at this rate it could take the council almost two years to re-home people . `` we are talking about people who have been through the traumatic events and have lost so much , stuck in hotel rooms and make-do accommodation . ",
        "`` no one can even start to rebuild their lives until they are in a place they can call home . `` it 's been six months and we 're now just a fortnight away from christmas . it 's not too late to put this right but it needs urgent action now . '' the grenfell tower estate is to have Â£ 30 million invested in it after a cash injection from central government was matched by the council . explaining the delay , council leader campbell added : `` i have always said we can only move at the pace at which victims and survivors feel comfortable . ",
        "however , i do accept , for some the pace is too slow . `` there are many reasons for this , as everyone here knows it takes time to buy a house , to exchange , to complete , to paint , to furnish . it also takes time to buy a range of homes that will suit each individual and families differing needs . `` this is why we have also made offers of temporary , privately rented homes to those still in hotels . `` but , in the coming months , i expect many more households will move into their new homes .
