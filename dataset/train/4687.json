        "texas a&m has hired notre dame defensive coordinator mike elko to coach jimbo fisher 's defense . texas a&m announced the hiring on thursday , a few hours after fighting irish coach brian kelly posted on twitter that elko had accepted an offer to be the aggies ' defensive coordinator . elko was at notre dame for one season and the fighting irish defense took a big step forward , from 5.40 yards per play allowed to 5.05 . he spent the previous three seasons at wake forest . `` i 'm excited to bring one of the top defensive minds in the nation onto our staff here at texas a&m , '' fisher said in a statement `` no matter where mike has worked , he has consistently produced defenses that have been among the nation 's best . ",
        "`` texas a&m tried to hire dave aranda away from lsu , but he chose to stay with the tigers and signed a four-year deal worth $ 10 million on wednesday night . aranda is the first fbs assistant to make more than $ 2 million per year . elko , 40 , spent three seasons at wake forest before being hired by kelly as part of a major overhaul to notre dame 's staff . the irish went 4-8 last season , but rebounded to 10-3 this year , including a 21-17 victory against lsu in the citrus bowl . ",
        "at wake forest , elko 's defenses ranked in the top 40 nationally in yards per play twice , even while playing with offenses that provided little support . the new jersey native played at penn and won an ivy league championship in 1998 . he started his coaching at his alma mater and did stints at fcs schools fordham , richmond and hofstra before becoming defensive coordinator at bowling green for dave clawson in 2009 . the falcons led the mid-american conference in total defense and scoring defense in each of his elko 's last two seasons . he had previously worked for clawson at fordham and then followed the head coach to wake forest in 2014 . ",
        "with the demon deacons , elko developed attacking defenses that created negative plays without a lot of highly recruited players . fisher took over at texas a&m last month after eight seasons at florida state . fisher took neither of his coordinators from florida state with him to college station , hiring darrell dickey away from memphis to be offensive coordinator and now elko to lead the defense . joining fisher from florida state are tight ends coach tim brewster , running backs coach jay graham and receivers coach dameyune craig . fisher also retained a&m offensive line coach jim turner .
