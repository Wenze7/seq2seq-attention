        "antonio conte confirmed brazilian youngster kenedy will be allowed to join newcastle united on loan , as the chelsea coach looks forward to the close of the transfer window . chelsea have been linked with a host of players since the transfer window opened , with strikers said to be of particular interest . but most of the forwards linked have been surprising options , with peter crouch , ashley barnes and andy carroll touted as targets . roma 's edin dzeko appears to have emerged as their first choice in the wake of carroll picking up an ankle injury , while his team-mate emerson palmieri is also said to have attracted interest from chelsea . ",
        "but conte refused to address those rumours and is looking forward to the window closing . `` i do n't know , as you know very well , if there is news the club will inform you , '' conte told reporters on tuesday in his pre-match news conference ahead of the efl cup semi-final second leg with arsenal . `` i think there is this window for sure , in 31 days it 's not simple to be faced with this situation , particularly as in every team there are players who feel they can change a team . ",
        "`` it 's not simple , but i must work with my players because every day they show me great personality . `` we must be ready , but i 'm very happy . it will be better not only for chelsea , but every team . '' and conte confirmed that 21-year-old kenedy -- who is yet to play in the premier league this season -- is set for a loan spell with newcastle . `` i think he is going on loan to newcastle , '' conte said . `` for sure , we 're talking about a young player with potential and at this point he needs to play with regularity . ",
        "conte says he thinks kenedy is going on loan to newcastle . he adds that the player is young with good potential and needs this challenge at this stage of his career . -- chelsea fc january 23 , 2018 . `` it is a great challenge to go to newcastle for him . it 's a good move for the club , we use the same way for christensen and now he is a chelsea player and is nearly always in the starting xi . `` it 's a good opportunity for him , but he must know he needs to fight to play for newcastle , because do n't forget he struggled a lot on loan at watford . ",
        "now he 's more ready , he played with us many games and i think now he can show his potential on loan . ''   "
