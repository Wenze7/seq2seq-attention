        "i spent a tragically long time surrounded by negativity . the people around me were negative to the point they became toxic . i allowed such toxicity in my life because i stood for it . i reacted to it irrationally , which only contributed to it . it became familiar and what 's familiar becomes comfortable . eventually it resulted in a negative outlook being my default , pessimism and anger became all i knew . a negative state of mind is one of the most detrimental things to living a happy life . what we think and how we think about it plays such a vital role in determining the quality of our lives . ",
        "because it is our outlook and perspective that essentially determines what kind of lives we live . the exact same thing can happen to two different people , one can use it as an excuse for why they did n't accomplish something , while the other cites it as motivation for accomplishing something beyond their wildest dreams . it is n't what happens to us , it 's how we perceive it and respond to it . you 'll never create a positive outcome in life when you surround yourself with negative people and spend all your time in negative places . ",
        "who you spend your time with , as well as how you spend it and where you spend it at ends up being the equation that determines the kind of life you live . i spent years in relationships with people whose negativity literally sucked the life and energy out of me . misery loves company . unhappy people do n't want you to be happy . we all have these people in our lives . if you ca n't weed them out completely , start by paying them little to no mind . their perspectives are not yours . ",
        "your state of mind shapes the events around you . it has a way of bringing like minded people and places into your life . what you think about often enough , tends to surface in your life . people will dispute such a statement by saying `` but i think about money all the time , how come i 'm still broke ? '' not realizing when they focus on money , they 're focusing on their lack of it as opposed to concentrating on a means to make more of it . look , i am not claiming there is a magic genie waiting to grant you three wishes , there is n't . ",
        "what i am saying is negativity is a waste of your energy . nobody ever made things better for themselves by complaining or focusing on what 's wrong in their life . if you insist on focusing on the things in your life you do n't like , let it at least be diagnostically . meaning you 're only pinpointing things your unhappy with in life to try and figure out a way to fix them . live a solution based life rather than one where you concentrate on life 's problems just for the sake of complaining . because i assure you , even the people that love you are tired of it . ",
        "it 's exhausting and they have better shit to do .   "
