        "washington - the scourge of the opioid crisis in the united states kills 90 americans every day , but beyond the human toll it also handicaps the us economy , taking millions of people out of the workforce , economists warn . president donald trump has declared the epidemic a national emergency , as 2.4 million americans are estimated to be addicted to opiates , the narcotics that include prescription painkillers such as morphine , as well as heroin . trump 's council of economic advisers estimates that in 2015 the opioid crisis cost the us economy $ 504 billion , or 2.8 percent of gross domestic product , in increased healthcare costs and lost wages , far higher than previously estimated .

        "more than 50,000 americans died from a drug overdose in 2015 , more than half of which were due to opiates , the cea said in a report published november 20 . `` the problem is worsening at an alarming pace , with opioid-involved deaths doubling in the past 10 years and quadrupling in the past 16 . `` and as businesses struggle to find workers to fill open positions -- with the us unemployment rate down to 4.1 percent -- large numbers of potential workers are being excluded from consideration or are not able to work . - lost workers - `` the opioid epidemic affects the us economy by disabling adult workers in their most economically productive years , '' said thomas bollyky , an expert on health and economics at the council on foreign relations , an influential think-tank . ",
        "federal reserve chair janet yellen said last week the epidemic is contributing to declining labor-force participation among `` prime-age workers , '' especially men aged 25-54 . and jerome powell , who will succeed yellen in february , echoed that analysis . the labor force participation rate has been below 63 percent for more than three years , down from 67 percent in the 1990s and into 2000 , according to government data . some of that decline is due to the aging population , but the rate for adult men in the workforce has fallen below 72 percent from 77 percent in 2000 . ",
        "alan krueger , economist at princeton university , estimated that the increase in opioid prescriptions from 1999 to 2015 `` could account for about 20 percent of the observed decline in men 's labor force participation during that same period , and 25 percent of the observed decline in women 's labor force participation . `` he said the decline is most notable in areas where opiates are most prescribed . `` many factors are at work , but i think the driving force has been the us medical system and pharmaceutical companies , '' krueger said . `` with good intentions of relieving pain , too many doctors have been overprescribing opioid medications . ",
        "`` bollyky agreed the crisis has its origins in over-prescription of the drugs , noting that in 20 years , prescriptions have soared by 300 percent . `` in 2015 , the amount of opioids prescribed was enough for every american to be medicated around the clock for three weeks . `` but drug companies also played a role , with `` aggressive and arguably deceptive marketing '' on these painkillers , bollyky said . for example , laboratories delivered 780 million tablets in six years to west virginia , a state of 1.8 million people whose opioid overdose death rate jumped by 17 percent in 2015 . ",
        "- insurance policies - beyond the impact on the labor market , the entire economy suffers from the epidemic of addiction . without jobs , addicts have no income and can not consume in a country where household spending is the main driver of growth . many employers require drug tests , and will not hire workers with a criminal record , which many opioid addicts have , making them unemployable . one surprising finding is the role us insurance policies have played in contributing to overuse of opioids , since they offer more generous coverage for these drugs to treat things such as chronic back pain , than for less addictive alternatives , such as chiropractic treatments . ",
        "and those without health insurance coverage may turn to these more affordable substances , instead of more expensive procedures such as knee surgery or wisdom teeth extractions that would cost thousands of dollars . by delphine touitou .   "
