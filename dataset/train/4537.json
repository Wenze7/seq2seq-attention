        "los angeles -- a security guard who was arrested after a prostitute fell out of his car is suspected of raping more than a dozen women or girls as young as 15 at gunpoint in los angeles county , police said wednesday . ferdinand ervin flowers , 35 , of long beach , pleaded not guilty wednesday with kidnapping to commit rape , robbery and assault , prosecutors said . he was being held on more than $ 1 million bail . it was n't immediately clear whether he had an attorney . flowers , a security guard , is believed to be the man who in 2014 and 2017 `` cajoled '' sex workers into his car , then pulled a gun , drove them to an industrial area and robbed and sexually assaulted them before letting them go , said capt. william hays , commanding officer of the los angeles police department robbery-homicide division . ",
        "dna evidence from three victims has n't yet been linked to flowers but a white honda civic and a black dodge ram truck registered to flowers match the description of vehicles used in attacks , police said . `` we believe we have the right predator off the streets who committed these horrible crimes , '' justin eisenberg , lapd chief of detectives , said at a news conference . flowers is suspected of attacking 14 girls and women , ranging in age from 15 to 35 , in los angeles and surrounding communities . thirteen of them were raped but the last victim fought off her attacker and escaped from his car , police said . ",
        "all were black women working in the sex trade and probably were chosen `` because they were vulnerable , '' hays said . four attacks took place in 2014 and the others from april of last year to jan. . 12 , when flowers was arrested . no victims have come forward who were attacked in 2015 or 2016 but authorities urged anyone who may have been attacked to come forward . `` it would seem that the behavior would n't just cease like that , '' hays said . detectives began to suspect there was a serial rapist on the loose in may after dna from a sexual assault investigation matched dna that was on file from a los angeles county sheriff 's department case in december 2014 . ",
        "as they began investigating , they soon found a unique pattern and began linking other cases . detectives found that many of the women were attacked and released in rancho dominguez , an unincorporated county area near carson and compton , just south of los angeles . detectives narrowed down the days and times when many assaults took place and began surveillance of the area , hays said . around 1:30 a. m. on jan. . 12 , detectives saw a woman fall out of a white honda civic who said she had been kidnapped , robbed and attacked , police said . ",
        "she had been picked up in neighboring lynwood , robbed at gunpoint and driven to the area where her attacker tried to force her to commit a sex act but she fought him off and managed to escape from the car , according to a police statement . flowers was arrested in the car . police seized a . 40-caliber handgun that was registered to flowers , who is licensed as an armed guard and a security guard , hays said . ___ associated press writer robert jablon contributed to this report . ___ follow michael balsamo on twitter at .
