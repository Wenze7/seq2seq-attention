        "a bolshoi theatre ballet based on the life of russian dance legend rudolf nureyev that was abruptly pulled in the summer will premiere saturday , despite its director remaining under house arrest . in a move unprecedented in the theatre 's modern history , the bolshoi cancelled in july the world premiere of `` nureyev '' just three days before opening night , after director kirill serebrennikov was questioned in a high-profile criminal inquiry . management cited an under-rehearsed cast , but many suspected it had been pulled because of its frank treatment of nureyev 's homosexuality , among other issues . ",
        "serebrennikov was placed under house arrest in august in a fraud case that has shocked the moscow arts community . in september , the bolshoi said a premier was scheduled for the end of the year . `` sadly our request to the investigative committee that kirill serebrennikov be allowed to take part in rehearsals was not answered , '' the bolshoi 's general director vladimir urin said at a news conference ahead of a final run-through on friday . `` everything possokhov did was with the agreement of kirill serebrennikov and it 's important to understand the situation in that way , '' he said of rehearsals that began in mid-november . ",
        "urin and members of the cast insisted there had been no major changes to the production in the new rehearsals . `` all of us -- artists , creators and everyone involved in this show -- found it very difficult what happened . we dreamed that this show would be performed and it will be , '' said principal dancer vladislav lantratov . `` i know kirill has overseen the course of rehearsals and as far as i know he is still making comments , so he has n't left the process , '' the dancer said . serebrennikov , who heads moscow 's innovative gogol centre theatre and whose work has previously been shown at the bolshoi , has been accused of defrauding the state of over $ 1 million in arts funding . ",
        "he has denounced the charges as `` absurd '' and his supporters have said the case is part of a politically motivated crackdown on russia 's arts community ahead of presidential elections next year . dozens of prominent figures in russia and international stars including cate blanchett and ian mckellen have called for serebrennikov 's release without charge . the ballet charts the life of the superstar dancer who defected from the soviet union and found new fame in the west before dying from an aids-related illness in 1993 . although homosexuality was decriminalised in russia in 1993 , prejudice is common and human rights activists allege widespread harassment and abuse . ",
        "in 2013 , russia passed a law banning `` gay propaganda '' that has been denounced by the european court of human rights .   "
