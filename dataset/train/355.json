        "by bruce levine -- . -- back in 1987 , cubs chairman tom ricketts was a regular member of the right-field bleacher fan base at wrigley field who watched as his favorite player won the national league mvp award . nowadays , ricketts has seized the moment to bring that icon back into the fold . ricketts and the cubs have reached an agreement to hire hall of fame outfielder andre dawson as an ambassador for the organization . news of that first surfaced in november , shortly after a marlins ownership change forced him out of miami , and while it 's not official , dawson confirmed it in an interview on inside the clubhouse on saturday . ",
        "dawson is happy to represent the team he played for from 1987 - ' 92 . `` it is all but official , '' dawson said . `` it is highly likely i will join the organization at some point . there is a proposal being made to get out to me going forward . the proposal will depict what my job will entail . that is something i am looking forward to . this has been a long time coming . i am excited about the opportunity and looking forward to it . '' dawson 's connection with the team will be like fellow hall of famer and former cubs second baseman ryne sandberg , sources said . ",
        "they will help with the marketing arm of the organization , which is completely separate from the baseball operations department . participating in sponsorship and charity functions will be part of dawson 's role . dawson , 63 , had long served as a representative for the marlins since retiring in 1996 . as the marlins sold to an ownership group led by derek jeter , dawson and his role was cast aside as a purge of miami 's executives and some employees was botched by the new ownership crew . dawson , jeff conine , jack mckeon and tony perez were all informed of their firings via text message . ",
        "he was a native of miami , having been born and raised there . `` in that regard , i think it was handled a little unprofessionally , '' dawson said of his firing and lack of a personal contact from jeter after 20 years in the organization . `` i have no qualms about it . it is their ball club . they paid the money and spend it as they feel fit too . going forward , we could have addressed it a little better as to what their concerns were . just the general direction they wanted to go . ",
        "what got lost in all of this was the community relations aspect of it . it was their idea to move forward . they are going in a different direction , and it was a business decision for them . i respect that . this is what happens in the game . '' dawson has been a strong advocate for cleaning up the steroid era and not letting players with the tainted performance-enhancing backgrounds in . `` what we are trying to express from our perspective is to adhere to what the rules are , '' dawson said about the parameters set forth by the hall of fame in the area of character . ",
        "`` remember the integrity and character issue when you do place your vote . this is the best hall of fame that exists in sports . we just want to keep it that way . '' this weekend , the organization will welcome back dawson at the cubs convention . he 's looking forward to reconnecting with the fan base . `` i am looking forward to this very much , '' dawson said . `` maybe not the single-digit temperatures , but this is the big event of the offseason and it should be exciting . it should be a fun-filled weekend and i am excited about it . '' ",
