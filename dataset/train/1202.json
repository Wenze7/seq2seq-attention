        "november 24 , 2017 by lauren o'nealthe real estate market is always changing , and what appeals to a buyer as they pull up to look at a potential home changes over time . this means that successfully staging the exterior of a property `` curb appeal '' requires flexibility . in addition , the real estate market is local and is fragmented . this means that what works in one area may not work in another , and that what appeals to one buyer may not work with another . successful real estate investors know this , and are able to identify what adds to the curb appeal of any specific residential real estate property . ",
        "they also understand that the time of year strongly influences both which buyers are most likely to look at a home and know how to appeal to that buyer without alienating the atypical buyer . seasonal curb appeal adjustments to considerseasonal adjustments are part of the job of economists analyzing the real estate market , but they are part of the job for anyone looking to sell a home in the fall . the first basic fact that needs to be recognized is that buyers with children are less likely to move during the school year . this means that fall and winter staging can be directed at empty-nesters and other potential buyers without children . ",
        "well maintained exteriors are a good example of this approach . while they are always a good idea , they have particular value to empty-nesters who want to fill their lives with something other than household chores . lowering storm windows in northern climates and doing all the gardening necessary will add to the look that a house is ready for the coming season . that season includes upcoming holidays , and small but colorful decorations can add a festive , welcoming air that translates into curb appeal . naturally , sensitivity is critical here , and secular decorations are less likely to offend than those which touch on the religious nature of a holiday . ",
        "it 's important to remember that small touches go a long way . not every empty nester is glad the children are grown and gone , and overdone holiday decorations can bring a touch of sadness by evoking memories . color trends of 2018the official color of 2018 has been announced by the sherman williams company . this serves as a great reminder that painting the front door is the most time-tested method of increasing curb appeal . using an up-to-date color can increase the effectiveness of this idea . be certain that the deep hue chosen for 2018 does not clash with the other colors of the house visible from the curb . ",
        "while most backyards are not visible from the curb , setting out weather-appropriate chairs around a fire pit is an excellent idea . it is a great way to showcase a patio or deck , particularly for empty nesters that do not have to contend with homework or bedtimes . most home improvement stores have self-contained patio fireplaces that comply with building codes . remember to add a small stack of firewood to complete the picture . none of these ideas makes a house any less desirable for a buyer with children who has to move during the school year . ",
        "this is the definition of good curb appeal . by understanding the tastes and goals of all potential buyers it is possible to stage for one without ignoring another .   "
