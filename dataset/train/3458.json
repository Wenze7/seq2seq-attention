        "john lamparski/getty imagestom brady 's entire identity centers around the game of football . he 's admitted himself that he does n't have many hobbies outside of the game , and if there 's anything he 's been transparent about , it 's that he wants to play until he 's 106 . `` i 'm not a musician , not an artist , '' brady said in 2015 when pressed on his hobbies outside of football . `` what am i going to do , go scuba diving ? '' he goes to sleep at 8:30 p. m . ",
        "he rarely drinks , telling espn in 2013 , `` you could n't pay me to go out after the game . '' he diets year-round . when brady is finally forced into retirement , kicking and screaming , i can imagine him transitioning into the real world like brooks did when getting released from shawshank . just no idea how the outside world works . no concept of being a real human being with all the time in world on his hands . i mean , this is n't how humans dance . id = `` wpcom-iframe-96ee83e212caa2c0e743508df4b780de-5a67af0c341a8 `` frameborder = `` 0 `` scrolling = `` no `` width = `` 480 '' height = `` 270 '' webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen class = `` wpcom-protected-iframe giphy-embed `` i think i 'll feel sad for him . ",
        "well , as sad as i can for the greatest quarterback of all-time who 's married to the most successful supermodel of all-time . speaking of gisele , she 's been trying to convince her hubby to hang up the cleats for at least a year now . following brady 's fifth super bowl victory last year , he told jim miller on his sirius xm : `` if it was up to my wife , she would have me retire today . she told me that last night three times . and i said , ` too bad , babe , i 'm having too much fun right now . ' '' ",
        "i wonder how gisele feels now , witnessing her husband put up an mvp-caliber season at 40 . last spring brady and his family vacationed with retired kicker jay feely , a close friend from their college days at michigan . feely told greg bishop of sports illustrated that gisele was trying to convince him to get in brady 's ear about retiring . via sports illustrated : gisele b√ºndchen , spent time on that trip `` trying to get me to convince to stop playing . '' and , feely adds , `` she was dead serious . '' ",
        "feely says he looked at his friend and told him , `` play as long as you can . '' brady smiled back and winked . `` for years he wanted to prove he belonged in this league , '' feely says . `` he won three super bowls and still used perceived slights to motivate himself . and he 's still finding ways to motivate himself . '' after five super bowl wins and possibly a sixth , tom brady still finds ways to motivate himself . i pay my phone bill and i take the rest of the week off . "
