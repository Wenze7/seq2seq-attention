        "the lakers knew coming into the 2017 nba draft that selecting lonzo ball with the second overall pick was going to come with some baggage . la was n't just getting lonzo , they were getting his outspoken father lavar as well , which , as predicted , has become somewhat of a headache for second-year lakers coach luke walton to have to deal with over the course of the season thus far . lavar 's voice does n't appear to be silencing and before coach walton even had the chance to get absolutely fed up with it and call out ball in the media , mavericks head coach rick carlisle decided to do it for him . ",
        "apparently carlisle has officially heard enough . rick carlisle is fed up . pic . twitter . com/pg7lmsgdmf -- sb nation january 7 , 2018 . if the lakers were carlisle 's team , clearly the waters would be much rougher out in los angeles . thus far , lonzo has indeed shown flashes of his otherworldly potential , but has also struggled mightily at points . ball is currently being outplayed by multiple other rookies across the league , and is n't even the best rookie on his own team . maybe it would be easier for all of us to put up with lavar if lonzo was having the kind of season that someone like donovan mitchell is having , but he 's not , which means lavar should be a bit less boisterous , right ? ",
        "that , however , does n't appear to be part of his character .   "
