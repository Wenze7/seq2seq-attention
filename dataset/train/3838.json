        "mobile phone access was partially restored in war-torn eastern ukraine on friday after it was lost more than a week ago , the last major ukrainian provider in the area said . almost two million people lost mobile connection in the devastated region after a vodafone ukraine fibre optic line was cut on january 11 as a result of fighting . the provider sought to restore service after its workers had received security assurances from the warring parties in a conflict that has claimed more than 10,000 lives in nearly four years . `` repair work on the restoration of communications ... is completed . ",
        "in the lugansk region , communication services are provided in full , '' vodafone ukraine said in its statement , referring to the smaller of two breakaway provinces . meanwhile , the insurgent-controlled parts of the bigger donetsk region still remain without a mobile connection . `` in the donetsk region , the network does not work for reasons unknown to us . there is a possibility that the equipment is out of order or there is no power supply , '' vodafone added . the separatist authorities of the self-proclaimed lugansk republic confirmed the restoration of mobile phone access as donetsk leaders declared no changes in the area under their control . ",
        "the outage all but severed communication between family members living on opposite sides of the frontline splitting eastern ukraine . russian-backed operator pheonix , now the sole provider in donetsk , only this week introduced a service that is theoretically able to place calls to kiev-controlled regions at international rates . the departure of ukraine 's kyivstar in 2015 and lifecell last year left vodafone as the only major provider in the region of some 3.5 million people . this has left phoenix filling the void in donetsk , but it has only 600,000 subscribers and is already operating at full capacity . ",
        "the self-declared `` communications minister '' of donetsk , viktor yashchenko , told the separatist dan news agency earlier this week that 80,000 people had joined phoenix since vodafone went down .   "
