        "the honeymoon for republicans in the state senate could be fleeting -- thanks to career ambitions and love . gop sen. art linares , newly wedded to house democrat caroline simmons , is forgoing re-election to run for state treasurer this fall . he said he expects to move to stamford , where simmons is in her second term . the couple was forced to postpone its honeymoon because of a 123-day state budget impasse , which ended in late october . this latest development could disrupt the delicate equilibrium in the senate , which is deadlocked for the first time in more than a century . ",
        "each party controls 18 seats , which gives republicans unprecedented committee leadership posts under a year-old power-sharing agreement . the lieutenant governor , democrat nancy wyman , holds the tie-breaking vote by virtue of serving as senate president . republicans expressed confidence that they will be able to hold onto linares ' 33rd district , which includes 12 towns near the mouth of the connecticut river . senate gop leader len fasano , of north haven , gave linares his blessing . `` he married up , '' fasano said facetiously , adding , `` so i think he 's got everything going for him and i think he 's going to be great . '' ",
        "the son of a cuban exile who interned for marco rubio , linares is serving his third term . although it is a part-time legislature , the 29-year-old has treated his senate post as full-time job after selling his shares in greenskies renewable energy , a middletown-based solar panel contractor . `` i think some of the biggest issues that we face in connecticut are debt and pension costs , '' said linares , who is from westbrook . `` we need leadership from the treasurer 's office to reform and solve those problems . '' democrat denise napper , who was first elected treasurer in 1998 , is not seeking re-election . ",
        "fasano said there is an opening for linares and he would never stand in the way of someone pursuing their dream , especially someone as qualified as his colleague . `` i do n't look at it as i need to force him to stay , '' fasano said . nvigdor@hearstmediact . com ; 203-625-4436 .   "
