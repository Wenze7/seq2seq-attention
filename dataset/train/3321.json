        "richard ratcliffe holds his phone with a drawing by his daughter gabriella . photograph : john stillwell/paon christmas day , ate roast chicken in prison and made a christmas pudding , explaining to her fellow prisoners that it is normally covered in brandy and set alight . her three-year-old daughter , gabriella , was invited to the home of the british ambassador to iran , where she was given a colouring book . richard ratcliffe spent the day without his wife and daughter , and marked the occasion in restrained fashion . he did not buy a christmas tree , because he had promised he would not do so until they could all decorate it together . ",
        "there had been a brief moment of optimism that nazanin , , might be released in time to decorate the tree this year . but she is still in tehran , where she is serving a five-year sentence over what her family has always insisted are ludicrous accusations . gabriella is stuck in , estranged from her father , because the authorities there confiscated her passport . in the run-up to christmas day , the only decoration in the family 's home was an untouched advent calendar intended for gabriella . richard prefers to think of it as postponing christmas this year ; the family 's second one apart . ",
        "he even carried out his family tradition of adding another christmas decoration to their collection this year - as much as a way of willing his wife 's release as anything else . but he will not touch the box until his wife and child are home . `` i promised her we 'd buy the tree . so , in my head , that 's when you decorate , '' he says , sitting in the family 's flat a few days before christmas . events in recent weeks first led the family to fear nazanin 's nightmare could be extended by another five years , then to hope that it might end at any moment . ",
        "the dual british-iranian national was detained in tehran 's imam khomeini airport in april 2016 as she sought to return from a holiday in the country of her birth . she had been visiting her parents with her young daughter but the iranian authorities accused her of plotting to topple the regime . she was sentenced to five years in prison and her family hoped she would soon be eligible for early release . but she was put in further jeopardy by comments made by the british foreign secretary , boris johnson , the person ultimately responsible for the diplomatic effort to free her . ",
        "johnson wrongly told parliament that nazanin was teaching journalists in iran . that was quickly seized upon by authorities in tehran , who sought to use the foreign secretary 's slip to imprison her for a further five years . she was , in fact , just a mother on holiday , johnson eventually publicly made clear . and , following his subsequent trip to iran in early december , there were hopes a breakthrough could be made . richard does not hold the uk government responsible for his wife 's incarceration but he is critical of the length of time it took to `` criticise her detention - how long it took for us to meet the foreign secretary '' . ",
        "that meeting came only after johnson 's professional fate became entwined with nazanin 's case late this year . even when the family is finally reunited , richard recognises it will be a long time before it is fully reconciled . he will need to rebuild his relationships with both his wife and his daughter , who has spent so much of her formative years separated from him - living with her grandparents in iran - that he says they no longer truly share a language . `` what daddy means to her now is quite different from what daddy meant 18 months ago . ",
        "now i 'm a bloke at the end of the phone who might be interesting and might not be , depending on what else is happening . i 'm always a poor second to a good cartoon . `` she 's young enough not to understand too much , not to worry about too much , so i 'm still sure we can pick it up again but it 'll take time and , obviously , she 's learned to rely on those around her . `` the home to which he hopes nazanin and gabriella will soon return bears some marks of what it was when they were last there as a family . ",
        "there are pictures of the couple together on the walls , as well as a child 's paintings on the fridge and children 's toys all packed neatly away . but richard admits he is not emotionally prepared for his family 's return to the uk , whenever that happens . there will be `` new bridges to cross '' , he says . `` if you spend 20 months apart from your partner , it takes time to rebuild on the basic levels , let alone the fact that there 's a profound gap between what she 's been through and what i 've been through . ",
        "`` i can be sympathetic , i can be empathetic . but the chances of me ever really understanding what been through , if she sits with someone who 's also been in that prison , they 'll have an innate understanding of each other 's experience that i could n't possibly have . so , that will always be a gap . `` then there is his own mental and emotional state . `` i typically do n't want to show feeling sad . i 've had my moments . i feel it creeps up on you , though . ",
        "sometimes , it can all just be a bit harder . `` there is the bit where it gets quiet enough and your feelings catch up . there 'll be an odd day when i plan to do stuff and the day just disappears kind of lying on the sofa , feeling sad and glum . `` still , he says , there are parts of the past two years that will have strengthened the couple . they have been `` profoundly stress-tested '' , richard says . such thoughts are , in one sense , optimistic - there may be some way yet to go . ",
        "with nazanin 's status so uncertain , richard is reluctant even to allow himself to seriously envisage the possibility that his family could be reunited one day soon . he is quite prepared for the possibility that january finds him renewing his campaign . he has been here before - last year - and he knows that allowing a plan for christmas , new year and his wife 's birthday to crystallise in his mind , not to mention buying a tree , means the disappointment will only be greater if his family can not be there .
