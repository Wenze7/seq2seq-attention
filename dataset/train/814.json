        "the short-term u. s. government funding bill passed by the senate monday contains a revision to wording tied to the national security act that some republicans and democrats fear could hinder congressional oversight of intelligence agencies and programs . senator richard burr , the north carolina republican who chairs the intelligence committee , said the change in language included in the funding legislation would make it harder to hold the intelligence community accountable for how they spend their appropriations . the `` problematic '' aspect of that change deals with funds appropriated by the department of defense missile defeat and defense enhancements appropriations act , according to a congressional memo obtained by bloomberg news . ",
        "the change , burr argues , would give the trump administration more flexibility to move money between programs in ways that previously required authorization from the senate and house intelligence committees unless tied to urgent circumstances . `` why would you take away the tools that we have to actually hold them accountable ? '' burr said on the senate floor after lawmakers approved the temporary spending bill . but senate majority whip john cornyn assured lawmakers later on monday that the wording flagged by burr and others will be fixed on feb. . 8 , when yet another , new spending bill will come due .
