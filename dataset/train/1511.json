        "erik johnson rips a breakaway goal with 9.9 seconds left in overtime to give the avalanche the dramatic win . the colorado avalanche are believers , and they are starting to back up that feeling with their play . a year after posting an nhl-worst 48 points and 22 wins , the avalanche could match the win total if they close out the homestand on a five-game winning streak . that would require winning the next three games against quality teams . first up are the winnipeg jets , who are battling for the central division with st. louis and nashville . ",
        "the jets are coming off a 5-0 win over edmonton on sunday night . winnipeg has won three straight and has 52 points , one more than the predators to lead the division . maybe the hottest player for the jets is goaltender connor hellebuyck , who was named the first star of the week by the nhl . hellebuyck went 3-0-0 with a 1.67 goals-against average , . 952 save percentage and one shutout leading winnipeg to a perfect week and the top of the central division standings . he made 22 saves in a 4-3 win over the edmonton oilers dec. . ",
        "27 , followed by 42 stops in a 4-2 victory against the new york islanders dec. . 29 . hellebuyck then made 35 saves to earn his ninth career shutout -- and third of the season -- in the win over the oilers on sunday . hellebuyck is third in the nhl among goalies with 21 wins . the streaking jets could get a boost if dustin byfuglien returns as expected after missing the past 10 games with a lower-body injury . `` i 'm over sitting here watching . it 's exciting to get back on the ice with the guys and being part of the team again , '' byfuglien told reporters in denver . ",
        "`` it 's tough to watch no matter how you 're doing or how the team 's doing . it 's never easy to sit but it 's one of those things that had to go and i 'm just looking forward to getting back . `` winnipeg is a test for colorado , which is trying to reach the postseason for the first time since 2014 . after last year 's implosion the avalanche have stayed above water , even surviving a 1-5-1 stretch in november and december that threatened to mirror the collapse of 2016-17 . instead they responded with a 5-2-1 stretch to stay within striking distance of a playoff spot . ",
        "after sunday 's 6-1 win over the new york islanders , players and coaches were talking optimistically -- and cautiously -- about the turnaround this season . `` there 's progress for sure , '' head coach jared bednar said . `` the things that our guys are saying on the bench , their leadership , guys chiming in with their puck decisions and talk on the bench and talk on the ice . these are positive signs that we 're trying to do the right things and play the right way all the time , not just in games that are tight . ",
        "`` colorado was already playing short-handed with injuries to defenseman tyson barrie and center j. t. compher , but appears to have caught a break with second-line forward sven andrighetto . he suffered a leg injury sliding into the boards in the third period against the islanders and did n't return . he 's considered day to day but bednar told reporters after monday 's practice he is probable for tuesday . the avalanche have dealt with injuries all season and they 're still in the playoff hunt , something that was out of reach by early january 2017 . ",
        "`` i think training camp was real good and we set the bar pretty high and that 's kind of translated into this season , '' captain gabriel landeskog said . `` we know there 's a lot of work to do still , but the first three months have been fun . i still think we have another couple of gears .
