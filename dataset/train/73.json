        "the colorado-based hip-hop group flobots is hopping mad at youtube celebrity logan paul for rewriting its 2008 hit `` handlebars '' into a tacky tune about objectifying women . the original song was conceived around `` the idea that we have so much incredible potential as human beings to be destructive or to be creative , '' group mc jamie laurie told mtv in 2008 . `` the lyrics came to me as i was riding a bike home from work with my hands in the air , '' he added . `` i had just learned how to do it -- and i felt triumphant , but at the same time , i knew there were people at that moment who were being bombed by our own country . ",
        "`` here 's the original , which hit no . 37 on the charts and obviously struck a chord with many people , including paul . paul 's version , `` no handlebars , '' is n't so high-minded . instead , it 's a tacky misogynistic ditty about how the 22-year-old youtube celebrity is able to `` ride your girl with no handlebars . `` it 's posted below in the interest of equal time . misogyny and all-around stupidity aside , paul 's video has racked up more than 26 million views since it was posted a month ago . ",
        "the dubious song has irked the members of flobots , who called out paul on twitter : so , um , @loganpaul , was `` i can ride your girl with no handlebars '' inspired before or after the #metoo campaign ? #notcoolbro #nohandlebars -- flobots november 24 , 2017they also sent out this advisory to other fans who might also be `` inspired '' to do their version of `` handlebars . `` reminder to fans - when paying homage to our music please try not to indulge in rampant misogyny and tone def douchebaggery #nohandlebars #loganpaullaurie went further , calling paul the face of `` douchebag entitlement '' in an interview with denver-based newspaper westword . ",
        "the band then went the extra step of calling out paul in tried-and-true hip-hop fashion by recording a diss track , called , fittingly enough , `` handle your bars . `` the song appears below , but lyrics include slams like this verse : now , why you got ta do it like that ? took a nice track and abused it like thatwith your stupid white rapfollow my music , my path but crashed into an ice patchstrong words , but laurie is n't expecting a response in kind . instead , he hopes paul takes action . ",
        "`` i 'd like him to take a little responsibility and use his platform to have a positive impact on things , '' laurie told westword . huffpost reached out to paul , who did not immediately respond . also on huffpostphoto gallerytop 30 most viewed videos on youtubereporter , huffpostsuggest a correctionmore : sexismrap and hip hop music misogyny in raplogan paulflobots .
