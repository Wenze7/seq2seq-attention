        "cummings issues statementwashington , d. c. -- today , rep. elijah e. cummings , the ranking member of the house committee on oversight and government reform , issued the following statement in response to the emergency interview republicans called this morning with andrew mccabe , the deputy director of the federal bureau of investigation , less than 48 hours after he appeared before the house permanent select committee on intelligence : republican conspiracy theories that the fbi threw the election in favor of hillary clinton are contradicted by basic reality . the fbi re-opened the clinton investigation just days before the election and announced it to the world despite the fact that they subsequently found nothing criminal . ",
        "at the same time , the fbi had an ongoing investigation of president trump , his campaign , and the russians , but they did not make this key fact known to the american people before the election . everyone knows exactly what the republicans are doing here . they are terrified that special counsel mueller is getting closer to the truth and that he already has guilty pleas in hand . they know michael flynn cut a deal and there could be more coming very soon . so they are desperately trying to protect president trump by attacking the credibility of special counsel mueller , the justice department , and the fbi . ",
        "we know how this works because this is exactly what the republicans did in benghazi . we now have three committees in the house investigating -- intelligence , judiciary , and oversight -- and that does n't even count the secret investigation being conducted by chairman nunes that was reported yesterday . the senate judiciary committee and the justice department inspector general are also investigating the same thing . so that 's five or six different entities investigating . does this sound familiar ? just like benghazi , we know the republican playbook . they admitted that their whole goal with benghazi was to bring down hillary clinton 's poll numbers . ",
        "here they are trying to undermine confidence in the special counsel 's investigation . but they wo n't lift a finger to actually investigate the real abuses . they wo n't request even a single scrap of paper from the white house about michael flynn , his security clearance , his foreign contacts , or his work with russia to build nuclear reactors in the middle east -- none of it . instead , chairman gowdy sent me a letter saying the oversight committee would not examine these abuses because it is not a `` prudent '' use of taxpayer dollars . ",
        "in today 's interview , republicans grilled deputy director mccabe in an all-day session for the second time in just three days . they demanded today 's emergency interview on tuesday night -- literally while chairman gowdy was in a room already questioning deputy director mccabe for hours as part of the intelligence committee 's investigation . i believe the republicans were completely surprised and taken aback when deputy director mccabe immediately agreed to their demands for yet another emergency interview this morning . i can not discuss the substance , but i can say that he showed everyone in that room today -- with his answers to question after question -- that he is a man of great patriotism , integrity , and honor . ",
        "like sally yates , robert mueller and many others , deputy director mccabe is a guardian of democracy , and we need more people like him in public service . the oath we take as members of congress is not to donald trump -- it is to the constitution of the united states . i believe the republicans in congress have either forgotten that vow , or they are forsaking it .
