        "minneapolis -- members of the minnesota house received more than $ 2 million in per diem and expense payments this year , despite state lawmakers getting a $ 14,000 raise last year . `` per diem '' payments are for daily expenses that lawmakers receive on top of their salaries . in 2017 , those expenses added up to millions of dollars . state lawmakers got their first pay hike in years , courtesy of minnesota voters . the salary for the state 's part-time lawmakers rose sharply -- from $ 31,141 a year , to $ 45,000 . but that does not include money they also receive for their daily expenses . ",
        "house members receive $ 66 dollars a day for expenses , on top of their salaries . that 's 7 days a week during the legislative session , no receipts required . in 2017 , representatives got an average of $ 8,812 in per diem , bringing total pay to almost $ 53,812 . state senators get even more in expense payments : $ 86 per day . they collected an average of nearly $ 6,861 extra cash in per diem payments , bringing their total , part-time pay to $ 51,861 a year . minnesota lawmakers have n't had a pay hike since 1999 , because they refused to vote for one . ",
        "that 's why there 's now an independent commission setting pay . that commission does not set any rules on per diem , and lawmakers accept it enthusiastically .   "
