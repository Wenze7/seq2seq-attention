        "since time immemorial , guys have been trying to figure out what to do about hair loss . and with good reason -- whether you wanted to express devotion to an unseen deity , convey wealth or fertility , or even just let people think `` this guy 's probably in a band , '' growing a full head of long and healthy hair has traditionally been a great way to do it . but as many guys have learned , nature tends to have other plans . namely , androgenetic alopecia , also known as male pattern baldness . ",
        "that 's where keeps , a new startup from ex-birchbox and starbucks execs , hopes to come in . up to two-thirds of men will experience some form of hair loss by the age of 35 , according to the american hair loss association . and while there 's no guaranteed way to grow that hair back , hair loss is actually easier to prevent , thanks to finasteride and minoxidil , two treatments proven by the fda to be 90-percent effective in stopping hair loss . keeps will send you both , giving you a good chance of keeping it on your head and out of the shower drain . ",
        "keeps also hopes to make it easier than a trip to the doctor : like hims , another male-focused wellness entry in the subscription box times we live in , all keeps requires is a short online questionnaire and a few photos -- their doctors handle the rest . when diagnosed , you get 90 days of product delivered to your door , a personalized treatment plan , and access to an online support network with their doctors , pharmacists , and care consultants . the bad news ? for the guys who already lost it -- you 're still out of luck . ",
        "for now . but if too many bare heads in family photos or loose follicles on the pillow have you stressed , there 's still hope . all without weird , unlabeled pills from your local bodega .   "
