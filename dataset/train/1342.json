        "an ideal world would function like the video game , metal gear solid , wherein one go into stealth mode , as and when required . not having such privileges in real life , i resort to the only other available option : ommm ... i take a few deep breaths , rev up the engine , and leave to face varied levels of bizarreness at school drop offs and pick ups . one month into lkg , when i went to drop my son , i noticed the teachers exchange a few looks . seconds later they were wishing each other , `` all the best ma'am ! '' ",
        ". and because i got caught up in the moment and relapsed into thinking i was still living life as an ordinary mortal , i blundered , opened my big mouth and asked , `` what 's special today ma'am ? '' nonchalantly but a tad nervously my son 's teacher replied , `` the three musketeers are all present today ma'am ! it 's going to be a busy day '' . way to go s ! you 're in a notorious gang in the first month of school ! one month down ; only the remaining academic year to go , i consoled myself , happily unaware of the threesome 's notoriety and the tales/complaints i would have to listen to over the rest of the year . ",
        "the threesome were a riot . had i been some other parent listening to the havoc these kids caused , i would 've laughed my lungs out . alas , as my luck would have it , i was stuck in the core and had to keep a straight face every time the teachers narrated what happened . once , at a pick up , the threesome were at the principal 's office . i was told they 'd ripped each others throats at class so the teacher sent them there . to kill time the principal had asked them to do a few squats . ",
        "as i walk in i see the kids still squatting , very enthusiastically : they were competing . `` amma look i 'm doing more squats , i 'm winning '' . sure s , win the punishment ! i kept an impassive face , the teachers were in splits . another time , i walk into school to find s standing on the bench meant for visitors , outside the principal 's office . before i got to ask him what he was doing there , s screams , proudly , `` mom do n't disturb me ! i did something , i 'm getting a time-out '' . ",
        "right s , let me know when you 're done . half way through school the threesome got a kick out of going to the principal 's office . i was told that when the teacher said , `` s stop doing that , do you want to go to the principal 's office ? '' s and the rest of the gang pounced at the opportunity screaming , i want to go ! no me ! i do ! once , i was told a member of the threesome was getting reprimanded . s could have not interfered but he did . ",
        "he had yelled back at the teacher defending his friend . yes , the two were later at the principal 's office . i get the heroism bit , s , but could we save all of it for after college ! by the end of the year , i had heard it all . to ease things for myself , i even managed to conjure up images of the kalahari bushmen in my head so the complaints came out in a steady stream of clicks .   ",
        "s carried his friend and plonked him on the seat for not paying attention ; s said he was writing in japanese and did n't want to write english letters ; s left class and went to principal 's office and told her he was bored at class ; s got offended the other two kids were at the principal 's office and he was n't ; s sat on his friend ; s pretended he was a t-rex through school scaring the other kids , now the whole class pretends to be dinosaurs ... and the list went on .",
        "on the last day of school , s was at , , the principal 's office . i mustered up all the courage i had to listen to one last complaint . i step into the room and ask , `` now what , s ? '' . `` nothing amma , i 'm here for the air-conditioner '' he said . i guess disbelief was written all over my face . the principal reassured me that he was indeed there only for the a/c . why of course the last day of school would be the day he chose to be at his best behaviour . ",
        "ps . on hindsight , i should have been ecstatic and celebrated on the last day of lkg . ukg has been no different ; fewer visits to the principal 's room but plenty of action packed stories regaling how he , the `` superhero '' , rescued the other kids from the `` bad guys '' . 1.5 years down and only 10.5 years to go !
