        "elon musk 's rocket company is about take another step toward making space flight cheaper . space exploration technologies corp. . on friday plans to double down on the concept of recycling spacecraft that the company has flown and landed back on earth . in a mission for nasa , spacex will reuse both a rocket and a capsule that it 's fired off before . making space missions work more like commercial airline flights dramatically reduces costs -- less money gets wasted discarding rockets and spacecraft after single launches . spacex 's success in this pursuit has made it one of the world 's most richly valued private companies . ",
        "it 's also won over customers including nasa , which president donald trump has directed to return to the moon and explore mars with the help of private industry . `` at this point , the notion of reuse of hardware is almost unremarkable , '' said ernie chung , an aerospace , defense and airline consultant at alixpartners llp . `` what is remarkable is that spacex appears to be continuing to lead the march down the cost curve for space access . '' trump 's directivetrump on monday issued a space directive that barely differs from a memo his predecessor issued in 2010 , changing only a paragraph in which barack obama had called for nasa to send humans to an asteroid by 2025 and to orbit mars by the mid-2030s . ",
        "trump scrapped the asteroid mission and revived ambitions to return to the moon , but set no time frame for going there or to mars . the white house did n't provide details about how nasa 's moon or mars missions would be funded . both spacex and boeing co. . have billion-dollar contracts to send american astronauts to the international space station , with the first key tests of the technology slated for 2018 . musk has announced plans to send paying tourists on flights around the moon next year . a falcon 9 rocketsource : spacexin the meantime , spacex has been carrying out a series of unmanned missions for nasa . ",
        "the company plans to ferry supplies to the space station using a pre-flown falcon 9 rocket and a refurbished dragon cargo capsule . the purpose of the mission , called crs-13 , will be to carry 4,800 pounds of research , crew supplies and hardware . while parts of the space shuttle boosters nasa flew for decades were refurbishable , no company has pulled off the `` rapid reusability '' spacex is targeting to bring down costs . spacex launched its first reused falcon 9 rocket booster in march and reused a dragon capsule on a space-station resupply mission in june . ",
        "florida comebackcrs-13 will be the first launch in more than a year from the florida launch pad that was significantly damaged when a falcon 9 rocket exploded there in september 2016 . spacex has delayed the mission twice this week to conduct additional checks , inspections and cleanings after it detected particles in one of its rocket 's fueling systems . spacex spent roughly $ 50 million to rebuild and upgrade space launch complex 40 after the accident last year , which destroyed the rocket and the satellite it was slated to carry into orbit . work to refurbish the damaged site began in earnest in february , with upgrades including an improved water system that will allow for longer `` static fires '' when a spacex rocket 's merlin engines are tested ahead of a launch . ",
        "the launch complex was originally built in the 1960s , john muratore , director of the launch complex for spacex , told reporters during a conference call friday . ` complete rebuild ' `` we found plumbing and wiring in places we did n't expect them to be , '' he said . `` we saw opportunities to really improve the pad and did a complete rebuild of the entire electrical system . '' while the site at cape canaveral air force station was out of commission , spacex moved its falcon 9 launches to pad 39a at nasa kennedy space center in florida . ",
        "now that the damaged site has been fixed , spacex can resume launching its smaller falcon 9 there while readying the kennedy space center pad for the maiden flight of its larger falcon heavy rocket , which is capable of carrying heavier payloads . spacex also uses a launch site at vandenberg air force base in california . the closely held company , based in hawthorne , california , has already flown 16 missions in 2017 . while that 's double its number in 2016 , spacex may fall short of a goal for at least 20 this year .
