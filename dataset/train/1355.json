        "a number of recent game releases have been marred by complaints about loot boxes and microtransactions . some of the biggest games -- like call of duty : wwii , destiny 2 , star wars : battlefront ii , and middle-earth : shadow of war -- sell in-game , randomized loot boxes even after you drop $ 60 on them . in fact , it 's difficult to advance in some titles , especially online , if you do n't spend more money . even with a few publishers walking these initiatives back very slightly , it 's depressingly easy to load up a game you just purchased and see a message telling you to spend more money . ",
        "it does n't have to be that way , though . while some big names have gotten covered in loot box gunk , 2017 has seen tons of releases without any microtransactions or sort-of gambling . these are aaa games , they 're excellent , and they offer a complete experience without inviting you to spend a few bucks every time you load them up . if dlc is available , it 's substantial enough to justify the purchase , and is n't necessary to actually play and finish the game in a reasonable amount of time . view as : 1horizon : zero dawn it 's been a good year for open world games , with horizon : zero dawn near the top of the list . ",
        "the game takes place so far in the future that human society has flipped right back over into prehistoric , and they have to hunt and fight robot animals to survive . it 's an epic adventure that pits bow and arrow against rampaging cyborg dinosaur . it also has no microtransactions or loot boxes , and the new the frozen wilds dlc has enough extra content to justify the single extra purchase . 2the legend of zelda : breath of the wild link 's latest adventure is easily his biggest . not only is breath of the wild one of the first games for the switch , but it 's the first truly open-world zelda game . ",
        "it 's an epic adventure across a massive hyrule filled with puzzles , secrets , and challenges . on its own , it can easily eat up hundreds of hours of your time , and the $ 20 expansion pass adds two hefty dlc packages , including a long challenge dungeon and a new adventure that helps expand on the game 's story . at3nier : automata nier : automata is a sequel to an esoteric rpg , which itself is a spin-off of a joke ending of an even more esoteric rpg . it 's also the most successful game in the series , thanks to platinum games ' mechanical polish . ",
        "more importantly , it 's one of the most memorable gaming experiences i had this year , full of genuinely interesting explorations about the nature of self . if you do n't care about artsy , philosophical stuff , you can just enjoy the sexy robots , satisfying combat , and one of the best video game soundtracks of the year . there 's a $ 14 dlc pack that 's primarily costumes and some very weird combat challenges , but beyond that there are no microtransactions or loot boxes in sight . 4nioh it 's like dark souls , but japanese . ",
        "that 's a really weird statement , because both nioh and dark souls were developed by japanese companies , but while dark souls retains a european fantasy aesthetic , nioh is explicitly all about feudal japan . you play william , an irish mercenary who ends up in a demon-infested sengoku-period japan on the eve of the creation of the tokugawa shogunate . it 's a long , challenging experience full of sword-swinging , spear-thrusting , flintlock-firing action across the war-and-demon-torn japanese countryside . its dlc packs have also been lengthy and satisfying , and you can pick them up with the base game in the $ 50 nioh : complete edition . ",
        "5persona 5 this is the best jrpg of the year ; it 's stylish , funky , engaging , and full of some of the best music in a video game . it 's also a 60-plus-hour game that does n't invite you to spend any extra money to collect every persona and explore every level of the metaverse to do it . there are some weird microtransactions for a baffling number of alternate costumes based on other shin megami tensei games , but they 're not advertised in the game itself and are completely optional and forgettable . 6resident evil 7 : biohazard nothing says `` horror '' like ramshackle houses in the middle of nowhere occupied by a murder cult family and the worst black mold infestation you 've ever seen . ",
        "resident evil 7 is a return to the series ' horror roots , pulling away from the action-centric gameplay of the previous two resident evil games in favor of a more tense survival horror challenge . because of that , it 's the best resident evil game in years . a handful of dlc packs add new stories and challenges , but they 're entirely optional , and more substantial than any loot box or microtransaction structure . 7splatoon 2 competitive multiplayer shooters seem riddled with loot boxes and microtransactions , with call of duty : wwii , star wars : battlefront ii , and playerunknown 's battlegrounds all inviting additional expenses after you purchase the game . ",
        "splatoon 2 has none of that . every new map and game type added after launch is available as a free update , and there are no cards or mods to juggle to keep up with everyone else . 8super mario odyssey super mario odyssey is the best mario game since at least super mario galaxy . it 's a wonder of responsive control and meticulous level design , with some of the most fun and quirky experiences we 've seen in the series to date . it 's also completely dlc-free , with every bit of content in the game available without spending more money . ",
        "you can unlock some extra costumes with amiibos , but even those costumes can be eventually purchased with in-game currency , without the need to buy a single piece of collectible plastic . 9wolfensten ii : the new colossus america has been taken over by nazis , and someone needs to fight back . this sequel to wolfenstein : the new order puts you back in b. j. blazcowicz 's boots in an alternate history united states where everything is really , really bad . fortunately , you have lots of heavy weapons and brutal murder techniques for plowing through the hordes of nazis between you and your objective . ",
        "there 's no multiplayer , but as a single-player experience it stands on its own , with no microtransactions . 10xenoblade chronicles 2 xenoblade chronicles 2 is both a quirky , niche jrpg and an epic , top-tier game for the nintendo switch . it 's huge and beautiful despite some texture pop-in and generically anime character designs , and it can keep you playing for dozens of hours . it also has a loot box system , but it 's not what you think . core crystals let you unlock blades of varying rarity , expanding your party with weapon-characters featuring different skills and attributes . ",
        "they also ca n't be bought with money . every spin of the core crystal wheel in xenoblade chronicles 2 is done purely in the game itself , with items you pick up while playing the game . no microtransactions to get more blades , just steady progression and random chance from in-game performance .
