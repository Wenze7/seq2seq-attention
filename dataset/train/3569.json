        "the pittsburgh steelers are looking to defeat the jacksonville jaguars this weekend in the afc playoffs . here are three key players who 'll help them advance . the pittsburgh steelers are looking to advance to their second-straight afc championship game by beating the jacksonville jaguars this weekend . no one ever thought a team like the jags would 've been this far into the postseason before the year started , but that 's exactly what makes the nfl so great . everyone loves parody and unpredictability , but if there 's one thing i know for sure , it 's that pittsburgh is ready for whatever jacksonville throws at them on sunday afternoon . ",
        "remember , these two squads met back in early-october , where the jags dominated the steelers 30-9 . seeing pittsburgh getting blown out , especially at home , is something we do n't see all that often . this franchise takes pride in their ability to defend their home turf , which wo n't bode well for the jags in the afc divisional round . unless your name is tom brady or peyton manning , you wo n't experience beating the steelers twice in one season . i admire the improvement from jacksonville this year , but i do n't see them winning at heinz field again . ",
        "with that said , take a look at three steelers who are the biggest keys to helping the black and gold make it back to their conference championship . next : no . 3 pittsburgh , pa -- december 17 : juju smith-schuster # 19 of the pittsburgh steelers runs with the ball against eric rowe # 25 of the new england patriots after a catch in the first half during the game at heinz field on december 17 , 2017 in pittsburgh , pennsylvania . 3 . juju smith-schusteri 'm a little surprised the national media does n't talk a lot about the rookie out of usc , but steelers fans know how talented smith-schuster truly is . ",
        "with an injured antonio brown attempting to play this weekend for the first time in about a month , pittsburgh needs smith-schuster to be a reliable target for ben roethlisberger . the steelers front-office knew they were getting a talented receiver when they drafted juju out of college , but little did they know he would have such a successful rookie campaign . he finished 2017 with 58 receptions for 917 receiving yards and seven touchdowns . that 's seriously amazing , especially on a team with a superstar such as antonio brown . in terms of this weekend against the jaguars , todd haley must find every way possible to get the football in smith-schuster 's hands . ",
        "we 've seen what he 's capable of against some of the best team 's in the nfl , so there are zero excuses for the steelers coaching staff to not have that in the gameplan for sunday afternoon . next : no . 2 pittsburgh , pa -- december 17 : tom brady # 12 of the new england patriots is sacked by cameron heyward # 97 of the pittsburgh steelers in the first half during the game at heinz field on december 17 , 2017 in pittsburgh , pennsylvania . 2 . cameron haywardthe steelers needed someone on their defensive line to lead a charge towards the playoffs this season , and as it turned out , cameron hayward was the man . ",
        "not only did he lead the team in tackles for loss , but he also recorded a team-leading 12 sacks . needless to say , pittsburgh needs hayward to show that same production this weekend against jacksonville . more from nfl spin zone chicago bears : mark helfrich hire ushers in a modern offense23m ago oakland raiders : predictions for potential cap casualties in 201854m ago jacksonville jaguars : how blake bortles compares to super bowl qbs1 h ago new york jets : time to focus on the offensive line in 20181 h ago new orleans saints : 3 mistakes team ca n't repeat vs. vikings2h ago while hayward is n't solely responsible for shutting down leonard fournette , he can make life hard for the jags offensive line . ",
        "we 've seen him bully right through the guards before , and mike tomlin would love to see that again this weekend . if hayward can get some interior pressure on the jags offensive line , it will not only make life hard for forunette , but it 'll make things extremely difficult for blake bortles . the jags ' quarterback is n't a player who excels with a collapsing pocket , and having hayward coming up the gut will give the steelers linebackers opportunities to get him on the edge . literally , hayward could cause pure chaos for bortles on sunday afternoon if he can win his one-on-one battles on the line of scrimmage . ",
        "if you 're looking for a potential defensive mvp this weekend , look no further than the steelers veteran defensive lineman . next : no . 1 pittsburgh , pa -- december 10 : le'veon bell # 26 of the pittsburgh steelers reacts after a 20 yard touchdown reception in the first quarter during the game against the baltimore ravens at heinz field on december 10 , 2017 in pittsburgh , pennsylvania . 1 . le'veon bellthis should n't come as a surprise to anyone , since the jaguars defense has struggled against the run all year long . not to mention , i truly believe the steelers are at their best when the offense goes through le'veon bell . ",
        "not only is bell the biggest x-factor for pittsburgh on sunday , but he could be the key for a deep postseason run . we saw how much ben roethlisbeger struggled against the jags secondary back in october , so it only makes sense the steelers would change-up their offensive gameplan . let 's be honest , roethlisbeger is one heck of a quarterback , but pittsburgh ca n't ride his arm to a victory this weekend . again , the weight and pressure of moving the chains has to be placed on bell . he 's easily one of the best running backs in the nfl , but at times , todd haley gets a little too pass-heavy with pittsburgh 's offense . ",
        "the steelers drafted bell for a reason , and it 's not to pass block for roethlisberger . next : nfl playoffs : 20 bold predictions for the divisional roundi believe the steelers will ultimately win this game against jacksonville , but that 'll only be if pittsburgh decides to put the football into the hands of their best player , le'veon bell . the pittsburgh steelers are looking to defeat the jacksonville jaguars this weekend in the afc playoffs . here are three key players who 'll help them advance . the pittsburgh steelers are looking to advance to their second-straight afc championship game by beating the jacksonville jaguars this w. .
