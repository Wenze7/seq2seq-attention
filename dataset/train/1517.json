        "the year is nearly over , but award season is now officially open , as the golden globe nominees have been announced . the golden globes take place right after the new year begins , and traditionally set the precedent and tone for the awards season to come . they often predict which films or stars will go on to win the coveted oscar at the academy awards show , usually held in mid-spring . and for the occasional surprise nominees -- an indie darling winning the award , an up-and-coming actor beating out an established legend -- a golden globe nod can cement their status and earn them considerable cred . ",
        "it 's certainly possible to base oscars predictions off the 2018 golden globe nominees . even just being nominated can boost a film 's profile ; if it was good enough to earn a nod , audiences who missed it the first time around will try and catch it before the oscars . this is just one of the reasons the golden globes are as important as the oscars . though they do n't often get as much credit , they really do confirm a movie 's importance and industry acknowledgement . and now that the gauntlet 's been thrown down , it 's time to dive into the 2018 golden globe nominees , and what they mean for the upcoming academy awards . ",
        "best actresssome of the expected oscar nominees , judging from the globes list , are total hollywood veterans . frances mcdormand is already a triple crown , having won an emmy , a tony , and an oscar . mcdormand is globe-nominated for the darkly comedic three billboards outside ebbing , missouri , whose small-town drama echoes her previous oscar win , but she 's up against some pretty hard hitters , including perennial winner meryl streep , who 's nominated for the post , a historical drama that 's getting plenty of awards attention . though the academy normally shies away from rewarding genre films , sally hawkins in the shape of water is the real competition in this category . ",
        "jessica chastain and michelle williams are awards darlings , but hawkins sells the romantic fish-man/human love story at the heart of her movie . and for that , she could surprise everyone and get the gold statuette come oscars . but it 's no guarantee . margot robie 's physical transformation into tonya harding for i , tonya took a globes spot , as did emma stone 's charming turn in battle of the sexes . helen mirren and dame judi dench are the most established actors to get nods , but odds are they may get scooped by beloved lady bird star saoirse ronan , for the oscar as well as the golden globe . ",
        "best actorwe all expect to see daniel-day lewis ' name come up any year he takes on a film , and given this is his last before retiring , there 's no way he would n't make the nominee list for his work in phantom thread . it also puts him on the short-list for oscar gold , despite going up against heavy-hitters like tom hanks , denzel washington , and especially gary oldman in darkest hour , who has that tastiest of oscar bait combos , history and heavy prosthetics . the golden globes are less conservative than the oscars , so while it 's an upset , it 's not completely out of line to see ansel elgort 's name come up for his electric performance in baby driver , and first-timer timothee chalamet for the steamy coming-of-age story call me by your name . ",
        "while james franco 's performance in the disaster artist earned him a nod , it 's unlikely the insider take on outsider-art movie the room will earn him an oscar . and while stars like hugh jackman or steve carell earned globe noms , they likely wo n't make it to the oscars . and daniel kaluuya absolutely deserved acknowledgement for get out , but for a comedy ? ! come on . best supporting actressthis category is chock-full of star talent that nearly outshone the leads in each of their films . laurie metcalf 's mom in the quirky , sweet coming-of-age story lady bird had to get a nomination , though she does n't have the heavy-hitting wattage of her competition . ",
        "allison janney and octavia spencer are the strongest contenders here , though the gravitas of janney in i , tonya puts her in top standing to nab that oscar . then there 's mary j. blige , who gave a strong performance in mudbound , and could sneak into the oscar race . hong chau , meanwhile , gave a memorable turn in downsizing , but the movie is n't landing with critics or audiences so do n't bet on oscar love , too . best supporting actorsam rockwell 's performances never feel supporting , so it 's no surprise to see him on the list for three billboards outside ebbing , missouri . ",
        "the same goes for willem dafoe 's sweeter turn in the florida project , which might put him in front running for the oscar . but despite rockwell and dafoe being fan and critical favorites in movies that touch on the political without getting too deep , it 's likely armie hammer will walk away with the golden globe , and perhaps the oscar , for call me by your name . and it 's a pleasant surprise to see richard jenkins get a nod for his role in the shape of water , though he 's unlikely to walk away with anything . ",
        "as for christopher plummer ? do n't bet on oscar love . best original song -- motion picturebeauty and the beast was snubbed for any globe noms , but do n't rule it out of the oscar categories just yet , especially with celine dion singing `` how does a moment last forever '' . still , `` remember me '' from pixar 's coco is strong competition . and if you make a musical , something 's going to make the nomination list , so it 's no shock to see `` this is me '' from the greatest showman on here , and probably the forthcoming oscar list , too . ",
        "but nick jonas for `` home '' from ferdinand ? ! that could provide some serious competition , as could mary j. blige and mariah carey for their respective tunes . best directorthough it did n't get much love elsewhere , christopher nolan 's dunkirk is frontrunner for the golden globe and oscar in this category . if guillermo del toro won for the shape of water it would be an amazing upset , as genre pictures usually do n't take home major prizes . it 's a surprise not to see luca guadagnino on the globes list for call me by your name or greta gerwig for lady bird , but they could still make it at the oscars , as could jordan peele for get out . ",
        "but we ca n't ignore the possibility of steven spielberg getting oscar love for nomination for the post -- even with competitors like ridley scott and martin mcdonagh , he 's always a major threat . best animated movieof course pixar 's coco makes the top of the list , and the likely winner of the oscar , especially in a year of bland big-studio sequels and smaller indie films that flew under the radar . loving vincent 's unique and labor-intensive technique - -- the first all-oil painting animated feature , will secure it a nomination , but not an oscar . ",
        "ferdinand is already winning critics and audiences with its comedy , but does n't have the prestige for a prize . and while the boss baby and the breadwinner may be getting some love from the golden globes , they 're highly unlikely to win anything at the oscars . best picturethis is it , the big one . dunkirk was such a large-scale war picture , this is almost the perfect category for it , as an overall phenomenon . it 's not a lock , but it 's definitely in the lead . lady bird , get out and call me by your name occupy the same `` niche '' for oscar categorization , but maybe previous years ' #oscarssowhite shaming has finally sunk in , and two , maybe even three of these films will get the nomination . ",
        "then there 's the shape of water , whichhas gotten too much positive critical reception to be ignored , though best picture rarely goes to `` horror '' . and golden son of hollywood spielberg 's period-drama the post is definitely up for a nod , and possibly even a win , though dunkirk 's looking like the film to beat . do n't count on i , tonya , the disaster artist , the greatest showman or three billboards getting oscar nods for best picture , although it 's not impossible . now that the nominees have been announced , the real race is on . ",
        "oscar season has officially begun , and it 'll be exciting to see who takes away a statuette .   "
