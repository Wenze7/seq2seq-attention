        "the mining industry these days resembles that old cartoon about a person torn between prudence and temptation . on one shoulder , a white-clad angel is whispering about the virtues of capital discipline , shareholder value and generous dividends . on the other sits glencore plc chief executive officer ivan glasenberg , clad in red and promising to buy or build everything in sight . the reason for that contrast was laid out clearly at the start of a glencore investor presentation tuesday . uniquely among its peers , glencore derives a substantial slice of its earnings from trading commodities , rather than producing them . ",
        "when mining is weak , marketing can take up the slack , and vice versa , as this company chart shows : another way of thinking about this is that whereas bhp billiton ltd. , rio tinto group and vale sa all saw a gap of more than $ 20 billion between their record-high and record-low earnings half-years over the past decade , just $ 3 billion separated glencore 's peak and trough . in an industry that 's been characterized by boom and bust since the first gold rush , trading has kept glasenberg 's income on a steady path . ",
        "everything in moderation . while its rivals have seen ebit surge and sink , glencore 's has remained stable for a decade . note : vale quarters have been run together to match the half-yearly reporting of the other companies . as any bond investor knows , consistency has its virtues . while other miners are still banished to the naughty step that shareholders sent them to after the vast destruction of value from the recent commodities boom , glasenberg is getting his toys out again . glencore capex , 2018 $ 4.8 billioncapital spending in 2018 will be $ 4.8 billion , the company said tuesday , as glencore works to more than double its production of cobalt , add about 40 percent to its crude oil output , and lift copper , zinc , nickel and lead by about 20 percent to 25 percent each . ",
        "that 's in marked contrast to rivals . forecast capex for rio tinto is 70 percent below former peaks , even though dividend payments have already exceeded previous records . anglo american plc and bhp are paying out dividends at about two-thirds of peak levels , but capex is again down 60 percent to 70 percent . only vale -- listed in the less-dividend-hungry u. s. and brazil , and with the heaviest debt burden among conventional miners -- matches glencore 's stinginess when it comes to rewarding shareholders , and its capex budget is just a quarter of its highest levels . ",
        "return to normalcy . glencore 's forecast capex next year is closer to its peak spending than any of its rivals , while its dividends per share are barely above crisis levels . note : peak capex years were fy13 , fy12 , fy11 . that contrast is particularly acute when it comes to takeovers . over the past 12 months glencore has been on an m&a binge , buying coal mines in australia , copper and zinc assets in the democratic republic of congo and peru , and petroleum in southern africa -- not to mention the elephants in the room , its quickly traded stake in rosneft oil co. . ",
        "and the potential $ 11.5 billion takeover of grains giant bunge ltd. . why should all this bother the rest of the mining industry ? surely it 's glencore 's business what it does with its money ? the problem is that the world 's miners operate in a sort of global version of the prisoner 's dilemma . collectively , their earnings tend to be best when supply is tight , spending slight , and prices high -- more or less the conditions they 've experienced over the past 18 months or so . out of pocket . glencore 's planned and potential m&a expenditure is dwarfing rivals . ",
        "note : based on deals proposed or announced since the start of 2016 . glencore has approached bunge about a deal but no formal offer has been made . rosneft valuation based on glencore 's 300 million euro commitment , although the stake has since been sold . the temptation for any individual company , though , is to ramp up supply in the face of higher prices and capture the largest possible market share . when everyone starts behaving like that , the resultant indiscipline tends to destroy profits for the whole industry . well , almost . every miner caught a glimpse of their own mortality at the end of 2015 , but the resilience of those trading earnings meant that glencore 's recovery has been quicker than most -- so no wonder its spending is on the rise , too . ",
        "rivals still nursing bruises from the crash should reflect on the unique qualities of glasenberg 's business before yielding to the temptation whispered in his spending plans . peter grauer , the chairman of bloomberg lp , is a senior independent non-executive director at glencore . the proportion varies . in 2012 , about 24 percent of adjusted ebit came from such marketing businesses , but in 2015 the share was 95 percent . to be sure , glasenberg is promising at least $ 2 billion for shareholders in 2018 -- but glencore 's ordinary dividend yields have tended to trail its rivals historically .
