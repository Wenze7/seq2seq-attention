        "the colorado avalanche players and team as a whole should make some new year 's resolutions to improve their play . the colorado avalanche have some bad habits . every team has bad habits , and the avalanche have a lot fewer than they did last year at this time . however , there are some things that the players and the team can improve on . well , new year 's day is the time for resolutions . in the nhl , it 's not exactly a start over . that comes in the fall , at the beginning of the season . ",
        "rather , new year 's tends to be when teams gear up for a playoff push -- no matter how far-fetched that may be for a team . it 's not as far-fetched for the avalanche to make the playoffs this season as it was at this time last year . at the conclusion of the 2016 calendar year , colorado had a 12-23-1 record . yeah , remember how good that did not feel ? well , colorado is already a lot better than that record -- 19-16-3 . the avalanche are a young team , plus they have several players who have seen too many losing seasons . ",
        "so , with this new calendar year , here are some resolutions for the players individually and for the team as a whole . restart the scoring touch , colin wilsoni think we all expected a little more out of colin wilson . last season he had 35 points in 70 games . this season , he 's managed just eight points in 28 games . he 's not a top scorer , but he needs to rekindle his scoring touch . get your first avalanche goal , sam girarddefenseman sam girard is a 19-year-old rookie with just 23 nhl games on his nhl resume . ",
        "i 'm not worried about his offensive talents coming through . however , i think we 'd all be happy -- most of all the kid himself -- if he got that first avalanche goal off his chest . he does have one nhl goal , but it 's with the nashville predators . get back to basics , tyson jostthe colorado avalanche signed tyson jost right after his college season ended , and the teenager came out like gangbusters . this season he 's shown flashes of that energy , but he 's also disappeared at times . it 's time for the rookie just to get back to the basics of his forecheck and his shot -- that will help him find his role on the team . ",
        "shoot more , alexander kerfootspeaking of shots , that 's something i 'd like to see everyone 's favorite harvard grad do . alexander kerfoot 's shooting percentage hovers around the ridiculous 30 % range , but he averages fewer than one shot per game . i know his shooting percentage would drop , but it would still be great to see him get more pucks on net . shoot on the power play , avalanchein that vein , i 'd like to see the colorado avalanche shoot more on the power play . they 've always been a team to try and set up the pretty play with the man-advantage . ",
        "they would do so much better if they 'd just keep throwing the puck at the goalie and swooping in to capture the rebound . play 60 minutes , avalanchei 'm sure every team goes through this at times , but the colorado avalanche have poor game management . it 's gotten to be a cliche with them . they come out soft , or they let teams off the ropes , or they go daft for several minutes in a row . hockey games last 60 minutes , and the avs need to find a way to consistently play all of those minutes . ",
        "keep doing you , nathan mackinnonnathan mackinnon has arrived . the way he 's played this season is reminiscent of his calder trophy rookie season , only as a franchise-player now . he 's just 22 years old , but he 's playing mature hockey -- superstar , mature hockey . the kind of hockey that not only elevates his linemates but also steals games . keep doing you , mack . happy new year 's , avs nation . we 've got some fun colorado avalanche hockey coming up . more from mile high sticking colorado avalanche hope to end 2017 on a high note with a home win14h ago colorado avalanche : all about jt compher 's overtime goal1 d ago colorado avalanche : joe sakic proves with his trades patience is a virtue1 d ago colorado avalanche must bounce back against toronto2d ago colorado avalanche : analysis of current playoff chances in 2017-20183d ago the colorado avalanche players and team as a whole should make some new year 's resolutions to improve their play .
