        "pope francis has called for a change of wording in christianity 's best-known prayer . the lord 's prayer is recited in english like this : `` our father in heaven , hallowed be your name . your kingdom come , your will be done , on earth as it is in heaven . give us this day our daily bread , and forgive us our debts , as we also have forgiven our debtors . and lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil . '' the pontiff told an italian catholic tv station last week that `` lead us not into temptation '' should instead be `` do not let us fall into temptation , '' according to a bbc report . ",
        "`` do not let me fall into temptation because it is i who fall , it is not god who throws me into temptation and then sees how i fell , '' he told tv2000 . `` a father does not do that , a father helps you to get up immediately . '' french catholics have already made a similar change . according to a report in the new york times , french churches recently began using a version of the prayer in which the line `` ne nous soumets pas Ã  la tentation '' was replaced with `` ne nous laisse pas entrer en tentation '' .
