        "lawyers for a british tourist held in egypt accused of smuggling painkillers have written to her trial judge appealing to correct her plea , after she misunderstood questions as her case opened and admitted importing the drugs . laura plummer sobbed in an egyption courtroom when she realised what had happened and tried to correct her plea on the first day of her trial in the red sea town of safaga . the 33-year-old shop worker from hull was arrested at hurghada airport after she was found to be carrying 290 tramadol tablets in her suitcase . she has insisted the tablets were for her egyptian partner omar abdel aziz , known as `` caboo '' , 31 , who suffers from chronic back pain . ",
        "she said she was unaware the drug , which is legal in the uk , was banned in egypt . standing before the judge in court , ms plummer was asked : `` you are accused of smuggling and possessing tramadol to egypt ? '' she meant that she is admitting that she had the tramadol , but not admitting being guiltydia al-bassalshe replied `` yes '' and the judge then instructed the session clerk to record that she `` confessed '' . but when the defence translator later explained the question , she denied that was guilty . `` she meant that she is admitting that she had the tramadol , but not admitting of being guilty . ",
        "the judge jumped to the conclusion that she confesses before clarifying that she understood the question and this is worrying , '' dia al-bassal , ms plummer 's lawyer told the telegraph . laura plummer pictured with her sisters rachel plummer and jayne synclaircredit : facebookms plummer broke down in tears during the session as her lawyers told her she should not have answered yes to the judge . her legal team entered a written submission from her explaining she had not admitted guilt , but had meant to say she carried the drug without knowing it was illegal and with no intention of selling it . ",
        "`` do n't be afraid be brave . pray and i will pray for you , '' mr bassal told laura during the break . `` it 's not fair , '' laura told her lawyer . the case was adjourned until tuesday when her lawyer are expected to begin her defence and submit documents showing omar abdel azim and his mother are being treated for illnesses that need tramadol . mr bassal said : `` in order for the drug crime elements to be complete , two conditions must be met . first advance knowledge that the substance is forbidden in the country of destination , and second it was brought for trading , '' mr bassal told the telegraph after the session . ",
        "`` both conditions are not available in laura 's case . the british foreign office has updated its travel instructions after laura 's case . the new instructions included tramadol in the drug list and mentioned laura 's case by name . '' ms plummer 's sister , rachel , said her sister was visibly nervous , upset and sleep deprived . she said : `` she 's answered some questions wrong because she 's not understanding them , she obviously ca n't think straight . `` you can imagine the pressure - this is her life . `` ms plummer is being kept in a 15ft-by-15ft cell with three other women in hurghada 's police station . ",
        "there is no women 's prison in the red sea governorate , so those awaiting trail are locked in a police cells . in a visit to her cell before the trial , the telegraph was told ms plummer has been locked up around the clock and has been sleeping on the floor without a bed . `` she is well-treated by the authorities in egypt to the extent that she receives distinguished treatment comparing to egyptian citizens , '' `` i did n't know that she will bring it , i will not send my wife to prison in my country , '' mr abdel aziz told the telegraph . ",
        "ms plummer met mr abdel aziz in 2014 in sharm el sheikh when he was working as a hotel lifeguard . the couple had what is known as an urfi marriage , which is a customary marriage contract that requires witnesses but is not legally recognised by the state . ms plummer has since visited him two or three time a year . her last visit was scheduled to last for two weeks according to mr abdel aziz .
