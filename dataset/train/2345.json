        "israel is going gaga over president donald trump , largely for recognizing jerusalem as israel 's capital . more than 110 `` god bless trump '' signs dot the city ; there are plans to name a future rail station near the western wall after trump ; and the jerusalem friends of zion heritage center put up a four-story display thanking him . but , there are many reasons to reconsider the abundant praise . a major reason is that trump -- along with a majority of us republicans -- denies climate change , an existential threat to israel , the us and the world . ",
        "despite overwhelming consensus from climate experts and numerous , recent severe climate events in the us -- including three category 4 and 5 hurricanes , and massive wildfires in california -- trump remains the only world leader who denies climate change . he pulled the us out of the 2015 paris climate accord that was signed by 195 nations , including israel ; appointed climate deniers to head the us environmental protection agency and to many other important positions ; and he is doing everything possible to eliminate or weaken efforts to reduce greenhouse gases . israelis should be especially concerned . ",
        "because of climate change , the middle east is becoming hotter and drier . according to military experts , this increases the likelihood of violence , terrorism and war . if the rapid melting continues of polar icecaps and glaciers , the coastal plain that contains most of israel 's population and infrastructure will be inundated by a rising mediterranean sea . israel is already facing the effects of climate change : we are now in the fifth year of a severe drought ; the sea of galilee is at a century low ; much of the jordan river is a polluted trickle ; and the dead sea is shrinking rapidly . ",
        "water experts warn that if the sea of galilee continues to shrink , it could become like the dead sea , as underground springs release saline water into it . another important reason is that trump 's policies are contrary to basic jewish values of kindness and concern for the disadvantaged , the stranger , the hungry and the poor . rather than improving obama-care , which provided health insurance to tens of millions of americans , trump supported legislation that would have as many as 32 million americans lose their insurance and make others pay higher premiums . rather than support efforts to rebuild the us 's crumbling infrastructure -- which was graded d + by the american society of civil engineers -- trump and republican legislators pushed through a tax bill that overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest americans and corporations . ",
        "this will increase the us national debt by up to $ 1.5 trillion , giving the republicans an excuse to carry out their long-time desires to cut social security , medicare , medicaid , environmental protection and healthcare . then there is the issue of trump 's character . as the new york times ' conservative columnist bret stephens , a former chief editor of the jerusalem post , wrote in a recent article , trump 's character involves `` lying , narcissism , bullying , bigotry , crassness , name-calling , ignorance , paranoia , incompetence and pettiness . '' ",
        "stephens continued : `` in place of the usual jousting between the administration and the press , we have a president who fantasizes on twitter about physically assaulting cnn . in place of a president who defends the honor and integrity of his own officers and agencies , we have one who humiliates his attorney-general , denigrates the fbi and compares our intelligence agencies to the gestapo . '' do we really want to honor such a person and make him a role model for our children and grandchildren ? lavishing praise on trump also adds to the current split between many american jews and israel . ",
        "almost 80 % of american jews disapprove of the job trump is doing , according to a september poll by the american jewish committee . so for many americans , when they see israel going overboard in glorifying trump , it increases their alienation over recent cabinet decisions on prayer at the western wall , conversion and other issues . this could reduce the moral , political and financial support israel receives from american jews . yes , but does n't trump still deserve praise for his strong support of israel ? somehow , some negative things about trump 's positions and statements on israel are being ignored . ",
        "for example : trump has not kept his pledge that there would be no space between the us and israel , as he has demanded several times that israel limit settlement construction ; his $ 110 billion arms sale to saudi arabia reduces israel 's qualitative military edge ; in his january 2016 holocaust remembrance day statement , trump omitted any mention of jews , which led deborah lipstadt to call it `` softcore holocaust denial '' ; trump appointed white supremacists to senior positions ; he retweeted neo-nazi propaganda on several occasions ; he failed to condemn antisemitism several times when it was called for before finally doing so ; he has left vacant the post of special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism since taking office ; he ended president obama 's tradition of hosting a white house seder ; by sharing top-secret information with russia , he compromised israeli intelligence ; since trump became president there has been a sharp increase in antisemitic incidents and other bigoted statements and acts .",
        "trump deserves to be praised for recognizing jerusalem as the capital of israel , but not to be lionized , for the reasons above and more . of course jerusalem is the capital of israel , always has been and always will be . but the nations of the world will only acknowledge that if it is part of a comprehensive , sustainable resolution of the israeli-palestinian conflict . while trump 's pronouncement about jerusalem is good for israeli morale , it did not change the overall situation . it did , however , cause much resentment among palestinians and other arabs . ",
        "in many nations it led to violence , and further evidence of widespread opposition to trump 's position on jerusalem was seen in the un security council and general assembly , resulting in further degradation in the potential for a peace agreement . trump also signed a waiver again so that the us embassy will not soon be moved to jerusalem . meanwhile , us secretary of state rex tillerson indicated it may not even be moved during trump 's current term . yes , the peace process has been basically dead for some time , and the palestinians certainly deserve much blame . ",
        "but israel needs to do everything possible to resolve the conflict in order to avert continued or increased violence and diplomatic criticism . israel must effectively respond to its economic , environmental and other domestic problems . and it must remain both a jewish and a democratic state . many israeli strategic and military experts agree with this assessment , including all the living former leaders of the shin bet . of course , israel 's security has to be paramount in any agreement . the writer is professor emeritus , college of staten island , the author of judaism and vegetarianism , judaism and global survival , mathematics and global survival , and who stole my religion ?
