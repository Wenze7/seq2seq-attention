        "the coffee giant wanted to build a cafe in the centre of the citycontroversial plans for a starbucks drive-thru in the centre of bangor have been rejected . the coffee giant submitted an application in december 2015 to build a drive-thru cafe on green space and shrub land on the junction with deiniol road and sackville road . the scheme faced considerable opposition locally , with bangor city council and the civic society coming out against the development , and the proposal by developer morbaine was withdrawn . it was re-submitted in 2016 but again faced strong opposition . ` too posh ' cafe blames poor footfall in ` dying ' bangor after announcing it will closeamong the concerns raised locally were the plans to fell several trees , which are currently protected by a preservation order .

",
        "`` this was an inappropriate proposal which would have added to the traffic woes in the city centre and stripped bangor of one of the few remaining city-centre green spaces . ` nightmare ' a55 cafe sign row has now been resolved `` the site itself would be better used as an amenity for local people and visitors and i hope the developer now recognises this as a final decision . `` according to starbucks , the development would have created around 15 full time jobs in the city . bangor civic society secretary don mathew , who spoke at the hearing , said : `` common sense has prevailed .
