        "trump repeats ` no collusion ' on russia probe 03:17 this is a real exchange that happened between president donald trump and fox news ' chief white house correspondent john roberts in a press conference with the norwegian prime minister on wednesday afternoon . roberts : `` are you open to meeting with ? would you be willing to meet with him without condition ? or would you demand that a strict set of parameters be placed around any encounter between you and the special counsel ? '' trump : `` well , again john , there has been no collusion between the trump campaign and russians or trump and russians . ",
        "no collusion . when i watch you interviewing all the people leaving their committees , i mean , the democrats are all running for office , trying to say this that -- but bottom line , they all say there 's no collusion . and there is no collusion . `` and when you talk about interviews , hillary clinton had an interview , where she was n't sworn in , she was n't given the oath , they did n't take notes , they did n't record and it was done on the 4th of july weekend . that 's perhaps ridiculous and a lot of people looked upon that as being a very serious breach and it really was . ",
        "`` but again i 'll speak to attorneys -- i can only say this , there was absolutely no collusion . everybody knows it . every committee -- i 've been in office now for 11 months . for 11 months , they 've had this phony cloud over this administration , over our government . and it has hurt our government . it does hurt our government . it 's a democrat hoax that was brought up as an excuse for losing an election that frankly the democrats should have won because they have such a tremendous advantage in the electoral college . ",
        "`` so it was brought up for that reason . but it has been determined that there is no collusion and by virtually everybody . so we 'll see what happens . we 'll see what happens . i mean certainly we 'll see what happens -- when they have no collusion and nobody 's found any collusion at any level it seems unlikely that you 'd even have an interview . `` so , um , yeah . in case you were n't counting -- and i was -- trump uses the exact phrase `` no collusion '' seven times in that answer . ",
        "he goes with the alternative `` nobody 's found any collusion '' once . let 's call it a soft eight . for trump , it 's virtually pavlovian . any mention of the russia investigation immediately elicits the phrase `` no collusion . '' why ? because he has absolutely convinced himself that there is no `` there '' there , and that `` everyone '' knows it . in his answer to roberts , he argues -- wrongly -- that a -rrb- `` they all say '' there is no collusion b -rrb- the whole investigation is a `` democrat hoax . ",
        "`` to be clear : on point a : both mueller 's special counsel investigation and the congressional investigations into russia 's attempted interference in the 2016 election are ongoing . while no collusion is alleged yet , it is incorrect to assert that those investigations have definitively concluded there was no collusion . on point b : the congressional committees looking into the russian matter are chaired by republicans . the justice department which chose the special counsel is run by trump 's attorney general , jeff sessions . mueller was appointed as fbi director by republican president george w. bush . ",
        "the point : trump is obsessed and irritated by the ongoing russia investigations and the questions he continues to get about them . he believes he is totally innocent of any wrongdoing but , in defending himself , he relies on a script built on inferences , questionable facts and outright falsehoods .
