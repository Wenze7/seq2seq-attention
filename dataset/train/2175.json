        "to be a successful growth stock investor , it 's important to look beyond the trendiest growth stocks that are constantly in the headlines . with that in mind , here 's why our investors believe bofi holding , irobot , and a. o. smith are three under-the-radar growth stocks that all long-term investors should take a closer look at . this nontraditional bank could have lots of room to grow . matt frankel : in many ways , bofi holding operates like a traditional savings and loan . the bulk of the company 's business involves taking in deposits in the form of checking accounts , savings accounts , and cds , and lending out money to qualified customers . ",
        "however , there 's one big difference between bofi and most other banks -- the bank has no physical branches whatsoever . this gives it a major cost advantage over its peers and allows bofi to run one of the most efficient banking operations in the business . bofi consistently earns fantastic returns on equity and assets and runs at an unheard-of efficiency ratio . over the past five years , bofi , which stands for `` bank of internet , '' has grown tremendously . assets , net interest income , and earnings have all more than tripled . ",
        "at the same time , the bank 's credit quality has improved and the bank has successfully transitioned from a cd-oriented institution to a more traditional checking and savings-based model . despite the tremendous growth , bofi could still have lots of room to grow . for one thing , with about $ 8.5 billion in assets , bofi is still rather small as far as banks go . for context , this is less than 0.5 % of the assets of the largest u. s. banks . plus , bofi has several untapped revenue streams it plans to capitalize on , such as auto lending and unsecured personal lending . ",
        "and with a valuation on par with institutions like jpmorgan chase and wells fargo , i think it 's fair to say that the market is n't pricing in the bank 's vast growth potential . growing into the future . sean o'reilly : one of the staples of any sci-fi story is robots . and the company helping make everyday robotics a reality , and managing to put up some substantial growth numbers while it does so , is irobot . the company is the current market leader in the emerging consumer robot industry . its roomba robotic vacuum is one of the most popular consumer robots on the planet . ",
        "irobot has a long history of robust growth . its third-quarter results , released oct. . 18 , were true to form . revenue for the quarter jumped 22 % year over year , not bad for a technology hardware manufacturer . the company is also diversified , selling its products in the u. s. , japan , and europe , the middle east , and africa . demand for its products continues to grow in the u. s. and emea regions . on the q3 conference call , management projected 40 % -45 % growth in the united states . ",
        "eps estimates for the full year were ratcheted up as well . management initially said it expected full-year 2017 eps to come in between $ 1.35 and $ 1.70 . that has been upped to a range of $ 1.65 - $ 2.00 . irobot 's growth is set to continue chugging along for years to come . as its ceo noted as part of the q3 release , robotic vacuum cleaners have penetrated less than 10 % of u. s. households . the figure is far lower abroad . and that 's to say nothing of its mopping and pool-cleaning robotic offerings . ",
        "with a long history of growth and profitability and a long runway of growth ahead , irobot is a must-consider growth stock . the next big growth engine . reuben gregg brewer : a. o. smith took advantage of the huge opportunity in china , getting an early start in this massive developing nation . sales in china grew at a compound annual rate of 22 % over the 10 years through 2016 . and the uptrend is n't over just yet . china makes up roughly 95 % of a. o. smith 's foreign business , which accounts for around 35 % of total revenue . ",
        "those growth numbers may surprise you , since the company 's main product is the lowly water heater . while you and i may take hot water for granted , it 's far less common in emerging markets . and as the people in these countries step up the socioeconomic ladder , they 're happy to spend the money needed to get this modern-world privilege into their homes . a. o. smith is there to help satisfy their demand . but the china story is old news ; the next big thing is india . the game plan is to take the lessons learned from china and apply them to the next big asian opportunity . ",
        "the company 's core markets are in north america , which are mature . but i expect continued expansion in china and an acceleration in india to keep a. o. smith on the growth path and allow it to continue raising its dividend , which has been increased for 24 years in a row at this point -- posting an annualized growth rate of 15 % over the past decade . successful investors look past the sexy headlines to find unique opportunities ; a. o. smith 's boring water heaters fit that bill .
