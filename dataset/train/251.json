        "i ca n't believe it 's taken this long to get a properly silly silver surfer dudebro joke into an ongoing marvel series , but thanks to unbeatable squirrel girl , one of the most delightful comics in the known cosmos , it 's finally here . image : marvel comics . unbeatable squirrel girl # 27 art by erica henderson and rico renzi , lettering by travis lanham . this week 's unbeatable squirrel girl # 27 , by ryan north , erica henderson , rico renzi and travis lanham , sees galactus , devourer of worlds , back on his bullshit - specifically the bullshit of , you know , devouring worlds . ",
        "ignoring the fact that galactus has been more of a heroic figure than a villain in the comics recently , this is more of a change in that he 'd at least been convinced to wander off away from eating earth , ever since squirrel girl fought with him near the start of unbeatable squirrel girl . what a tool indeed . art by erica henderson and rico renzi from unbeatable squirrel girl # 4 . but that just means galactus is off on other paths of destruction away from earth , and his latest interstellar buffet puts him in the path of the planet chitt-crrt , home to a race of green , highly intelligent squirrels . ",
        "but it is n't just galactus who 's back in the cosmic doom game , but the silver surfer too , who visits chitt-crrt to perform his heralding duties ... with his posse of bros ? because now , out of nowhere , the silver surfer is a hang-ten-ing , shaka-brah-spouting embodiment of surf culture , just on a galactic scale : i love it . unbeatable squirrel girl is rarely anything other than a delight , but i really hope we get more silver surfbro in the future . watch more : entertainment news .
