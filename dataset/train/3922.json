        "arsenal need to make things difficult for their complacency , and while henrikh mkhitaryan helps , it is n't solved without pierre-emerick aubameyang . arsenal have a problem with their mentality , in case you have n't noticed . a lot of players are n't under any pressure to succeed , so they do n't have that added motivation to constantly be at their best . it 's not exactly a direct fault , it 's just the way most humans are wired . the addition of henrikh mkhitaryan helps this situation . because with the current staff , that means that jack wilshere and aaron ramsey will likely flank granit xhaka , with mkhitaryan joining mesut ozil behind alexandre lacazette . ",
        "that 's pretty cool . related story : 5 things learned against crystal palacebut the fact remains that the next biggest competitors to this starting xi are alex iwobi and mohamed elneny , neither of whom is anywhere near challenging that list of names . so while mkhitaryan is certainly worth celebrating , true internal competition does not come unless aubameyang can be acquired . once he joins up , there will be a serious brawl for the remaining attacking positions . all of a sudden , there is no such thing as a `` must-start . `` you would assume that the first three names on the team sheet would be ozil , aubameyang and lacazette . ",
        "behind them , i would hope that aaron ramsey 's name is there . and we did n't buy mkhitaryan to sit , so throw him up there too . which leaves granit xhaka and jack wilshere . both of whom have been quality , the latter of which has been a major influence as of late .   ",

        "but a matter of `` i have so much , what benefits me the most . `` this is the kind of team , again , assuming everything goes through , that can compete on multiple levels across all competitions . best case scenario , we have three strikers , i wo n't go crazy , i 'll say two and a half world-class strikers . and we have two creators , one is for sure world class and one has shown glimpses . then behind that we have two midfielders , ramsey and wilshere , who also have the potential to be world class , with xhaka a bit behind them .

        "there is a lot there and it ca n't all fit into the same starting xi unless we legitimately decide that having a defense just is n't worth it . next : arsenal vs crystal palace player ratingsbut it all hinges on aubameyang . he is the signing that truly shakes things up . arsenal need to make things difficult for their complacency , and while henrikh mkhitaryan helps , it is n't solved without pierre-emerick aubameyang . arsenal have a problem with their mentality , in case you have n't noticed . a lot of players are n't under any pressure to succeed , so they ...
