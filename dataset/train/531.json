        "afp/file / jim watson former white house chief strategist stephen bannon has described a meeting between donald trump jr and a russian lawyer during the election campaign as ` treasonous ' -- earning quick scorn from the presidentus president donald trump unleashed a spectacular denunciation of one of his closest political allies wednesday , describing former white house chief strategist steve bannon as insane and irrelevant . after the release of explosive excerpts from a new book in which bannon reportedly described trump 's eldest son 's meeting with a kremlin-connected lawyer as `` treasonous '' and `` unpatriotic , '' trump wasted no time firing back . ",
        "the embattled republican president issued a response that was searing even by his combative standards . `` steve bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency . when he was fired , he not only lost his job , he lost his mind , '' trump said in a written statement . trump said bannon -- who engineered the new york real estate mogul 's link to the nationalist far right and helped create a pro-trump media ecosystem -- was `` only in it for himself . `` trump 's fury appeared to have been provoked by the publication of startling extracts from `` fire and fury : inside the trump white house '' by author michael wolff . ",
        "passages published by the guardian and new york magazine quoted bannon being highly critical of trump 's children donald junior and daughter ivanka . bannon , who left the white house in august , is also quoted as saying that the investigation by special counsel robert mueller into russian interference in the 2016 election will focus on money laundering . the investigation by mueller , a former fbi director , is looking into whether the trump campaign colluded with russia to get him elected -- a charge the president has repeatedly and vehemently denied . - ` you should have called the fbi ' - don jr took a meeting with russian lawyer natalia veselnitskaya in june 2016 after an intermediary promised material that would incriminate trump 's democratic rival hillary clinton .

        "getty images/afp/file / tasos katopodis donald trump jr. . has testified before congressional committees over his contacts with russians during his father 's election campaigntrump 's son-in-law jared kushner and then campaign chairman paul manafort also attended the meeting at trump tower in new york . `` the three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside trump tower in the conference room on the 25th floor -- with no lawyers , '' bannon was quoted as saying in the book . `` they did n't have any lawyers . ",
        "`` even if you thought that this was not treasonous , or unpatriotic , or bad shit , and i happen to think it 's all of that , you should have called the fbi immediately , '' he said . - ` little to do ' with election win - trump responded quickly and cuttingly to the reported comments by bannon , a former investment banker and the executive chairman of influential ultraconservative outlet breitbart news . afp/file / nicholas kamm us president donald trump and then top aide steve bannon -- shown boarding air force one in march -- are now in open war with each other `` now that he is on his own , steve is learning that winning is n't as easy as i make it look . ",
        "steve had very little to do with our historic victory , which was delivered by the forgotten men and women of this country , '' trump said . `` steve pretends to be at war with the media , which he calls the opposition party , yet he spent his time at the white house leaking false information to the media to make himself seem far more important than he was , '' he added . `` steve was rarely in a one-on-one meeting with me and only pretends to have had influence to fool a few people with no access and no clue , whom he helped write phony books . ",
        "`` wolff 's book -- which he says is based on interviews with trump , his senior aides and others -- also mentions that trump did not initially know who former house speaker john boehner was , and that he eats food from mcdonald 's because he believes it to be safe . `` this book is filled with false and misleading accounts from individuals who have no access or influence with the white house , '' said trump 's press secretary sarah sanders . stephanie grisham , a spokeswoman for first lady melania trump , denied allegations that she cried tears of sadness when her husband won . ",
        "`` the book is clearly going to be sold in the bargain fiction section . mrs. trump supported her husband 's decision to run for president and in fact , encouraged him to do so . she was confident he would win and was very happy when he did , '' grisham said in a statement . the feud between trump and bannon raises questions about whether the president 's victorious electoral coalition can stay intact ahead of legislative elections in november . if republicans fracture and democrats do well , regaining the house of representatives , trump could face impeachment .
