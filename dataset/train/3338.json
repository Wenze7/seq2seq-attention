        "i 've been out of academia for two years , having finished my phd in 2015 . i think i 'm finally on the road to healing . i often joke that leaving academia feels like the worst break up ever . * hahahahaha . that 's a good one ! except that i 'm not joking . giving up on something that you thought was your life 's calling hurts like hell . when you experience rejection from the entire institution of academia after devoting years of your life and thousands of dollars to become an academic , betrayal and rage sometimes become your only emotions for a good long while . ",
        "for me , the grief of leaving academia feels about the same as the loss and grief of the end of relationship . even when you know that the relationship was n't right for you , loss is loss . the loss of my academic dreams also triggered a whole avalanche of of old , deep losses that i 'm never going to really get over . we 've all got dreams that do n't work out , even when we really really really want them to , but academic grief hit me so much harder than the novels i want to write that wo n't get written or the places i want to travel that i know i 'll never visit . ",
        "in academia , your work becomes a part of you ; you become your work . losing the academic part of us feels like losing a limb , complete with phantom pain when it 's gone . loss often involves a lot of self-blame , shame , second-guessing and endless asking why and what 's wrong with us and why the fuck are we never good enough anyways . academia requires a life commitment . i devoted a total of seven years of my life to trying to understand a single thing . i was committed to my research in ways that were sometimes deeper than commitments i 've had to people . ",
        "i was fully prepared to spend the rest of my life focused on this one particular thing . some days i did n't like my research very much and found it hard and difficult and frustrating . nevertheless , i never for an instant wavered in my devotion to it . like in any relationship , academia and i went over rough patches . i thought about calling it quits several times , but did n't want to throw away something to which i 'd devoted so much time . i was not a quitter . i 'm now working in victim advocacy and now talk to people about grief , trauma , and loss every day . ",
        "i wish i 'd had someone like me to talk to about grief and loss after my phd . i wish someone had told me that they were sorry that i did n't get a job . that it was n't fair . that it was n't my fault that the market had collapsed and had n't recovered . that sometimes stuff just happens to people for no reason . sometimes the story does n't end the way that we want it to or expect it to . the grief i felt when i conceded defeat on the job market was the real deal . ",
        "i cycled through every one of the kubler ross model 's stages of grief several times . and as anyone who has been through the five stages of grief knows , they are not really stages at all , but rather suggestions . grief is a full body contact sport that involves cycling and recycling through the stages of grief , moving forward and backwards and sideways at the most inopportune moments until the heart and soul decide there 's nothing more to be done and they 've let go . there 's nothing rational about grief and no time table to `` get over it . '' ",
        "it 's insanely confusing and consumes massive amounts of emotional resources . grief is involuntary and wild and frightening . if you 're coming to the realization that you 're going to have to walk away from academia , let me hasten to tell you that your feelings are real and valid , whatever they may be . i believe you . nonetheless , you 're going to have to do some stuff to get through the emotional crap swamp . here are some suggestions . you 've lost a big chunk of your identity , both personal and professional . ",
        "grief is a normal reaction . you ai n't crazy . self care is key . emotional eating is okay for a little bit , but you 're eventually going to have to make real food . i know it 's hard . let yourself be very not okay for a while . it 's okay to be sad . it 's okay to be really really sad . healing is n't a matter of `` getting over it . '' it 's a matter of incorporating loss into your story and telling it in a new way . there 's no timetable . ",
        "anyone who thinks that you should be ready to move on according to any kind of timetable can shove it . take life one day at a time . know that healing is n't a destination ; it 's a journey and a process . you might think about investing in a good therapist . leaving academia is n't just a `` career change . '' it 's the worst breakup of your life and you might not even be able to see into next week , let alone imagine possibly being happy and okay again someday . be in grief for as long as you need to . ",
        "you 'll heal . eventually . you 'll have the scars to prove it . healing will happen so slowly that you might not even notice it . in one of the biggest cliches ever , i 've learned that healing is a process . you 're going to get through this . one day you realize that you have n't cried in a few days . then maybe you notice that you 're daydreaming about something you 've always wanted to do . some idea for interesting and engaging work crosses your mind . and then you might find yourself wondering if you could actually do that . ",
        "and then maybe you start thinking of how you might do that . and then you start talking to other people about how you might do that . and then you 're off and running again . you 're healing . * this may not be your experience at all . a lot of phds these days are actively planning not to become academics , so i suspect their sense of academic loss may be less . i do n't know . those of the tenure track or bust generation , from my conversations with other people about their experiences , seem to have taken academic loss pretty hard . ",
        "we did n't have backup parachutes ready ; we made up the post-ac life as we went . we 're still figuring it out . as always , ymmv .   "
