        "the doctor at the helm of a hong kong beauty clinic that administered a deadly experimental cancer therapy was jailed for 12 years on monday , reports said . patient chan yuen-lam , 46 , died a week after she received a blood infusion at the clinic in 2012 , an unprecedented medical blunder that has shed light on the city 's largely unregulated beauty industry . chan had signed up for the unproven therapy using cik cells , touted as an immunity boost by beauty chain dr group and sold at hk$ 59,500 per injection , local media reports said . ",
        "bacterial levels in chan 's blood before she died were comparable to those of terminally ill aids patients , according to a doctor who testified during the trial . beauty clinics in hong kong offer a wide range of treatments , many with little or no scientific backing , and often operate under little oversight . justice judianna barnes of the high court called stephen chow , the founder of dr group convicted of manslaughter , a `` money-hungry '' businessman before delivering the sentence on monday , the reports said . the sentence should reflect the `` abhorrence felt by society '' , barnes was cited as saying . ",
        "laboratory technician chan kwun-chung , who prepared the blood product for the victim , was also sentenced to 10 years in prison . other victims who received the botched treatments in 2012 included a woman who had to undergo amputations as a result . the jury last week failed to reach a majority verdict on a third defendant charged with manslaughter , a doctor who administered the treatment , who could face another trial as prosecutors are expected to seek a retrial in january .
