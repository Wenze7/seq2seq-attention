        "oprah winfrey has been changing lives ever since she first captivated the world on her talk show back in the '80s -- and even now , years later , that has n't changed a bit . this sunday at the golden globe awards , winfrey is being honored with the cecil b. demille award for -- as hollywood foreign press association president meher tatna says -- being `` one of the most influential women of our time . '' but she has n't just made an impressive impact on the entertainment industry by killing it with major #girlpower roles in films like the color purple and the upcoming a wrinkle in time ; she 's been using her platform for decades to promote healthier and happier ways of living , too . ",
        "here are 3 perils of wellness wisdom you probably learned from oprah first . 1 . therapy as self-care . winfrey was all about self-care before it even became a buzzword -- and therapy was a huge part of that conversation . she quickly became known for helping people deal with problems in their lives on her talk show , and in turn , it helped her out too . `` i had never gone to a therapist , ever , '' winfrey told people . `` but i had so many therapists sitting in the chair across from me that i just sort of took it in . ",
        "the oprah winfrey show was my greatest therapy . '' 2 . the power of gratitude . if anyone knows the power of gratitude , it 's winfrey . in fact , she 's been spreading the message for years . one way she 's mastered the art has been through journaling . `` i kept a gratitude journal for a full decade without fail -- and urged you all to do the same . then life got busy . my schedule overwhelmed me . i still opened my journal some nights , but my ritual of writing down five things i was grateful for every day started slipping away , '' she wrote on her website a few years back . ",
        "`` i 'm back to journaling -- electronically -- and whenever there 's a grateful moment , i note it . i know for sure that appreciating whatever shows up for you in life changes your personal vibration . you radiate and generate more goodness for yourself when you 're aware of all you have and not focusing on your have-nots . '' 3 . the importance of generosity . winfrey quickly became known for spoiling her guests , whether through the freebies given from her list of favorite things or through her book club . and , let 's be real , because of her generosity , you probably ca n't read `` you get a car ! '' ",
        "to this day without hearing it in her voice . but material objects are n't the only things she 's been generous about . the more oprah gave , the more powerful she became , which allowed her to make a difference in a huge way with the oprah winfrey leadership academy for girls , a girls-only boarding school in south africa that teaches young women leadership skills so that they too can make a difference in the world someday . yep , when it comes to wellness ogs , this lady is definitely one of them -- and she 'll for sure look killer at the globes , no matter what color dress she chooses .
