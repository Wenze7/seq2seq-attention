        "after a sluggish start resulting in a double-digit second half deficit , the texas tech basketball team put an end to its two-game losing streak by knocking off oklahoma state 75-70 tuesday night in lubbock . it was all slipping away from chris beard and his texas tech basketball team . riding a two-game skid that dropped the red raiders out of the top-10 in the national polls and put the team 's once bright big 12 title hopes on life support , texas tech looked lifeless and dead in the water again at home against oklahoma state on tuesday night . ",
        "the cowboys had dominated the game since the middle of the first half , building as much as a 15-point lead . and through the first six minutes of the second half , it seemed texas tech did not have the stomach for the fight . but down 50-38 with just 13:37 to play , the red raiders finally dug their heels in and got back to playing the kind of basketball that they 've become known for . over the next 2:57 of the game , texas tech held oklahoma state scoreless while cutting the deficit to just six points . ",
        "and the difference came not in the form of long-range three-point shots or high flying dunks . rather , the turnaround was born of floor burns , tough rebounds and a renewed commitment to defensive excellence . of course , the stars of the box score will be point guard keenan evans who shook out of a recent slump to score a game-high 26 points and freshman jarret culver who set a career-best with 25 points . and in fairness , texas tech would not have won without culver 's clutch shooting down the stretch and evans ' steady hand which nailed 7-8 free throws to ice the game in the final two minutes . ",
        "but what saved this game for the red raiders were the hustle plays . perhaps the team was inspired by another raucous crowd at united supermarkets arena or maybe the desperation of a season quickly slipping away finally hit home . but for whatever reason , the dogged determination and gritty physical type of basketball chris beard demands of his players finally showed up after a two-and-a-half game absence . forward norsene odiase shook off an uninspiring offensive performance that saw him go scoreless on the night to impact the game by blocking shots and hurling his 6-foot-8 , 245-pound body after lose balls with no regard for who might be in the way . ",
        "likewise , culver collected almost as many floor burns as he had points . meanwhile , brandone francis and niem stevenson played lock-down perimeter defense contesting almost every osu three-pointer while helping limit the pokes to just 20 points in the final 13:37 of the game . `` i thought that tonight our guys showed a lot of grit . you know , down 10 in the second half and gave us a chance to come back . '' beard said in his postgame press conference . on most nights , big 12 basketball often looks more like a street brawl than and artistic expression of athleticism . ",
        "so if a team is going to emerge victorious , it is going to have to get bruised , battered and bloodied . there is no other way . hopefully , tuesday night 's gut-check win was exactly what the texas tech basketball team needed ; a reminder that every game is an all-out battle and victory can not be gained by talent alone but through the grit and determination possessed only by `` fearless champions '' . more from wreck 'em red absence of zach smith proving to be huge19h ago texas tech basketball : keenan evans struggles causing offense to falter2d ago texas tech basketball has found its kryptonite4d ago texas tech football players earn all-big 12 second team honors7w ago texas tech wr keke coutee named semifinalist for earl campbell award8w ago after a sluggish start resulting in a double-digit second half deficit , the texas tech basketball team put an end to its two-game losing streak by knocking off oklahoma state 75-70 tuesday night in lubbock .
