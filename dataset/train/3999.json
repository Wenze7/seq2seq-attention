        "madrid - real madrid moved back into the top four of la liga by thumping lowly la coruna 7-1 at the santiago bernabeu on sunday , with cristiano ronaldo ending a miserable run of league form with a late double . ronaldo had only scored four league goals before sunday 's clash with third-from-bottom deportivo , but the portuguese added real 's fifth and sixth with a smart volley and a diving header as they moved back above villarreal and into the champions league places . villarreal had temporarily taken fourth with a 2-1 win over levante on saturday after beating real at the bernabeu for the first time ever last week . ",
        "gareth bale and nacho also bagged braces each side of half-time and luka modric curled home a 68th-minute beauty as real came back from a shock early deficit , a 23rd-minute tap-in from adrian , to romp to an emphatic victory and ease the pressure on coach zinedine zidane . the win leaves real five points behind valencia in third , after marcelino garcia toral 's side had two players sent off in a shock 2-1 loss at lowly las palmas on saturday . real are 16 points behind league leaders and arch-rivals barcelona , who can go 11 clear with a win at real betis later , and eight away from second-placed atletico madrid , who could only draw 1-1 with girona on saturday . ",
        "real had come into sunday 's match in crisis following some dismal performances that culminated in last week 's defeat to villarreal , and the mess seemed to have grown deeper when adrian tapped home lucas perez 's low cross . however the home side reacted immediately and by half-time were 2-1 up thanks to nacho 's neat first-time strike and a superb curling effort from bale , both of which came from crosses by marcelo . the floodgates opened in the second half , with bale adding his second 13 minutes after the break with a towering header and luka modric expertly whipping home real 's fourth ten minutes later from outside the area . ",
        "it looked like it would be another tough day for ronaldo when he shanked a shot wide in the 72nd minute , but five minutes later he met casemiro 's cross to make it five and then crashed home lucas vazquez 's cross with six minutes left , taking a boot in the face from fabian schar . as ronaldo was led off the pitch to have his bleeding head quickly patched up he asked to see the phone of one of real 's medical staff and , pointing the camera at himself , used it to check the damage to his face . ",
        "nacho completed the rout in the dying minutes , meeting raphael varane 's miscued header from a corner and turning smartly before lashing home the seventh . earlier , joseba zaldua scored a last-minute equaliser as leganes came back from two goals down to draw 2-2 at alaves , who had rodrigo ely sent off three minutes from time after munir el haddadi and alfonso pedraza had put the hosts 2-0 up .
