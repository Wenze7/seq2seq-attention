        "that 's why i figured i 'd let sleep calm me down just a bit . well ... it did n't . reading what non-thunder fans have to say about this team only verifies the excitement that we 're all experiencing . i 've provided only a couple of the plethora of positive posts surrounding this team . let 's get to it . win proves oklahoma city is legitwe start this exercise off with an incredibly profound statement from brad botkin of cbs sports . botkin notes that the thunder are n't ever going to have the hyper-efficient ball movement that we 've come to expect from the nba 's top offenses .

",
        "the thunder 's quick rise is a testament to them finally playing up to their potential . they have ample space to improve , but their quick progression after 30-something games of stagnant play gives me reason to believe this is only the start of something special . oklahoma city is actually playing defense now -- and sharing the ball -- which is just a beautiful thing . i never thought a team with post-nuggets carmelo anthony was capable of this . bye-bye kevin durant , hello russell westbrookand to end this wonderful celebration i give you this . the perfect ending to a wonderful christmas : russell westbrook passes kevin durant for most points scored in an okc jersey pic .
