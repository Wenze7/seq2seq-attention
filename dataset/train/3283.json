        "will any force ghosts appear in the last jedi ? if so , yoda is the definite front-runner . is this real life ? star wars : the last jedi drops tonight , in what 's felt like a 30-year wait in the process . many questions are looming . who are rey 's parents ? who is snoke ? and , will any force ghosts appear from the netherworld of the force ? the odds are high , with the likely candidate being the grand master jedi himself , yoda , with other 's , potentially showing up alongside him . ",
        "to our knowledge , we only have four possibilities of a force ghost , who could pop up in the last jedi : yoda obi-wan anakin skywalker qui-gon jinn qui-gon jinn photo credit : lucasfilmfor those who are wondering why qui-gon is on the list , well , it 's for a good reason . recently in the canon novel from a certain point of view , one story featuring qui-gon reveals much . for the first time , qui-gon physically manifests , only to give his former padawan obi-wan kenobi some guidance before taking on luke as an apprentice . ",
        "qui-gon even mentions how much it hurt him emotionally to stray away from the oneness of the force . so , his appearance as a force ghost in the last jedi is unlikely , especially with many people not as familiar with his character 's story arc as well . now , the other three are highly likely , ones that would rightfully fit the story . obi-wan kenobi photo credit : lucasfilmobi-wan is known for doing a `` pop in '' visit from time to time . with luke seemingly losing his way and needing answers once rey shows up , why not seek the sage of his former master ? ",
        "plus , obi-wan did appear in rey 's force-back vision . rey ? ! these are your first steps . with rumors of an obi-wan kenobi film in the works , lucasfilm/disney may want to pepper his presence in the saga films as much as possible . anakin skywalker photo credit : lucasfilmwith anakin having a connection both to his son , luke skywalker , and ben solo/kylo ren , we could get a double dose of the `` chosen one . `` kylo ren could be seeking the darkness , with his grandfather appearing to guide him back towards the light instead . ",
        "photo credit : lucasfilmin original concepts for the force awakens , anakin nearly made his return , playing a bit of a jekyll and hyde between him and vader . more from dork side of the force george lucas : the last jedi is a `` beautifully made '' film3h ago breaking down that massive the last jedi leaked spoiler22h ago the last jedi takes critics , rotten tomatoes by force1 d ago star wars : the last jedi spoiler-free review roundup2d ago the last jedi : disney promotes mark hamill , daisy ridley for oscars2d ago however , within george lucas ' vision and the new canon , only light side users can retain their identity after death , with dark side users falling into oblivion . ",
        "so , that idea was quickly scrapped . luke could also seek the guidance of his father , in training rey , as well as dealing with the fallen ben solo . seeing anakin and luke conversing onscreen together for the first time would be a moment for all-time . also , for the first time in over 15 years , hayden christiansen -- anakin skywalker -- dropped by at star wars celebration , one that stirred up the speculation of the return of the jedi , of sorts , in the process . yoda photo credit : lucasfilmthe highest probability is yoda showing up on ahch-to , appearing to luke and rey . ",
        "yoda is the one who was chosen by the force itself to retain his consciousness after death , making him the prime candidate . plus , yoda is the one who completed luke 's training . and , maybe there is more to this tweet , with the trickster always up to no good . would this be considered a spoiler ? #keepthesecretsofviii #shhhhhh ðŸ¤« ðŸ˜¶ -- @hamillhimself december 10 , 2017 . having a little fun , here are the odds of each showing up in the last jedi : yoda obi-wan kenobi -lrb- 5:3 more than one force ghost anakin skywalker more than one force ghost qui-gon jinn star wars : the last jedi drops tonight !
