        "a disabled british woman claims she was refused help at a london airport because she did n't `` look ill '' enough , reports said . nathalie allport-grantham , 23 , booked special assistance on her flight to nice out of stansted airport on new year 's eve because of her two chronic illnesses , the bbc reported . but when she showed up at the gate looking for help , she was told she would n't get any assistance during boarding and she was `` wasting time . '' `` she basically looked at me and said , ` i 'm here to help disabled people , i 'm not here to help you , ' '' the scorned woman told the bbc . ",
        "allport-grantham suffers from ehlers-danlos syndrome , which limits her movement and causes chronic pain , and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome , which quickens her heart rate , preventing her from walking long distances and leaving her prone to frequent fainting . `` the way she spoke to me and what she said was just awful , '' the young woman recounted . `` because you pre-book , she has a list of people she 's waiting for , so people ca n't just turn up and say , ` i need help . ' but she did n't ask my name . ",
        "if she 'd just looked at her list she would 've seen i was the person she was waiting for . '' allport-grantham sometimes uses a wheelchair but when she does n't , her disabilities are `` invisible , '' leaving people to doubt whether her ailments are legitimate . `` it 's something i and everyone with chronic illnesses is used to -- being judged and being called a liar , '' she said . `` i 've been told before , ` you look too pretty to be disabled . ' people have an idea that a disabled person has to look a certain way . '' ",
        "stansted airport apologized to the woman and said in a statement that it was `` disappointed '' to hear about her experience . `` we are speaking to the provider to find out more about the circumstances of the incident , '' the airport said in a statement .   "
