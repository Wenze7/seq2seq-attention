        "american women do n't earn as much as men do , a persistent phenomenon that ca n't be explained by disparities in education , opportunity or child-bearing . but a growing body of research points to a new and compelling cause : women make less because of the sexual harassment they face at work . the gender-pay gap has hovered under 80 percent for nearly two decades . most of the discrepancy is because men work in higher-paying jobs and in more lucrative fields , and most of the policy remedies have focused on encouraging women to pursue those same , high-paying opportunities . ",
        "months of revelations about sexual harassment and abuse of women across industries shed new light on why women do n't `` lean in '' to higher-paying jobs more often . whether they 're earning more because they 're in more lucrative fields or because they have more senior positions , big paycheck jobs also often pose higher risks of sexual harassment , says joni hersch , an economist at vanderbilt university . what 's more , women who experience sexual harassment at work are six-and-a-half times more likely to leave their jobs compared with women who do n't , according to research by amy blackstone , christopher uggen and heather mclaughlin . ",
        "in one of the only studies that looks at the effects of sexual harassment over time , the sociologists asked about 1,000 men and women if they had experienced unwanted touching , offensive jokes and other behaviors that could be considered workplace harassment . among the female respondents who said they experienced unwanted touching or at least two of the other , non-physical behaviors , 80 percent said they left their jobs within two years . when these women leave their jobs , blackstone said , they do n't tend to trade up . they land in less lucrative fields or positions , a negative economic impact on women that persists through the rest of their working years .

        "` it crushed me'not long ago , samantha ainsley was on the academic fast-track , pursuing a ph. d. in computer science at mit , imagining a future of research , consulting and maybe starting her own company . then she was assaulted by one of the leading professors in her field at a conference . when she rebuffed him , she says , he continued to try to grab her and accused her of sleeping with fellow students to advance her career . for ainsley , it was a life-changing event . `` all i could think about is , this guy is going to review all of my papers , '' she says . ",
        "`` it crushed me . '' a few months later , she left her program at mit to work as a software engineer at google , which she described as `` a much more modest career than i had aspired to originally . i had to , in a sense , start over . '' lower payunderstanding exactly how much harassment affects earning power is n't easy , said claudia goldin , a harvard professor who studies the gender-pay gap . abuse at work is notoriously under-reported , especially at professional and managerial levels . someone who experienced harassment may ultimately leave her job for an unrelated reason , which would n't show up in traditional economic analysis . ",
        "at the same time , jobs and fields that are dominated by women are considered `` safer , '' according to hersch 's research . they also usually pay less . kristian lum was working as a data scientist in academia when she was groped at a professional conference , an incident that , she says , prompted her to look for work in a new field . she now works at a nonprofit , in a job that pays less and offers less security than if she 'd stayed put . `` i was looking to get away , '' she said . ",
        "`` there was a general feeling of , ` i just do n't want to be around this . ' '' why women leavethere are many factors that influence a woman 's career path , but even having children -- that notorious career-killer -- may not prompt the same adverse consequences as harassment and its effects on job satisfaction and performance . of female engineers who quit or changed jobs over the five years ending in 2012 , only one-third left to take care of children , according to a 2014 study by nadya fouad , a distinguished professor of educational psychology at the university of wisconsin , milwaukee . ",
        "the majority left for better opportunities , broadly defined , in other fields or companies . similarly , a 2014 study of 25,000 harvard business school graduates found that only 11 percent of female baby boomers and gen xers had left the workforce to care for children -- and even among those women , the majority left primarily because they saw few prospects for advancement . hazard premiumwomen who persist in hostile environments do earn more . hersch , the vanderbilt professor , studies hazard pay -- the premium workers require to work in dangerous environments . traditionally , researchers have used on-the-job fatalities or physical injury to assess whether compensation accounts for physical risk . ",
        "hersch looked at complaints filed with the equal employment opportunity commission to determine whether companies facing sexual harassment allegations also had to pay workers more . in fact , they do . women earn on average an extra 25 cents an hour at such companies . men in jobs known to be hostile earn even more : an extra 50 cents an hour , according to hersch 's research . for many , a higher paycheck is n't worth the difficulties of staying in a hostile workplace . women who experience harassment can lose their drive or develop anxiety and depression , any of which can have an adverse impact on productivity or performance , according to lisa kath , a psychology professor at san diego state university who studies workplace harassment . ",
        "and when those things start to suffer , opportunities for professional advancement -- and higher earning power -- also decline .   "
