        "boasting a 4-10 record , the bears host the winless browns at solider field on sunday . and you know what that means ... the bears are actually favored . chicago is currently favored by 6.5 points by odds shark , but in the john fox era , that 's been anything but a good sign for the bears . in fact , it has portended something bad . in fox 's three years as head coach , the bears are 0-7 straight up when favorite , per odds shark . let 's pause for a moment for effect : the bears have yet to win a game , let alone cover a spread , in the fox era when they 've been favored . ",
        "beyond that , six of those seven games were at home , and chicago has lost the seven contests by an average of 9.1 points . the last time the bears won a game when they were favored to win was november 2014 , when marc trestman was coaching .   "
