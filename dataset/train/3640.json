        "of the making of lists of books , there shall be no end . nevertheless , here is one more . set out below are 13 works that every white-collar lawyer -- defense counsel , prosecutor or judge -- should read . why take on such a presumptuous project ? three good reasons . first , lists start conversations . although law is a `` learned profession , '' relatively few lawyers in my experience have read broadly or deeply since college . the press of work does not allow otherwise . our professional learning is utilitarian , narrow , cramped and quickly forgotten . ",
        "second , the proponent of such a list must review , reconsider or even reread works first encountered years or decades in the past . if the list does not help you , it may help me . third , the list makes us think why it is , exactly , we do what we do . the usual concepts -- justice , productivity , money , honor -- are not well-explored in the day-in , day-out of law practice . a few caveats are in order . first , this is a personal , idiosyncratic list . if you want a survey course , go to a community college . ",
        "second , i have made little effort to be `` fair , '' at least at that term is understood politically today . i have not tried to equally represent time periods , genres , genders or ethnicities . i realize that the list is populated with white males , most of whom are dead or will be soon . could someone make a list of 13 books written by others ? very much so , and more power to them . third , a great many books are not eligible by my own fiat for this list . how so ? ",
        "i have excluded all biographies and autobiographies of lawyers , even though there are some superb ones . two that come to mind , for example , are evan thomas 's the man to see and louis nizer 's my life in court . i have also excluded all how-to books , even though there are a number of excellent ones . my favorite is herbert j. stein and stephen a. saltzburg 's trying cases to win . there is a lot of dreck written about white-collar criminals and the white collar `` mind , '' and it was for the most part a pleasure to exclude that sub-genre . ",
        "nevertheless , there are some admirable works including , very recently , harvard business school professor eugene soltes 's why they do it and duke professor sam buell 's capital offenses . like the poet dante , you have been warned before you enter the gates . let us turn to 13 books that every white-collar lawyer should read . albert camus , the fall | best known for the stranger , french novelist albert camus careens in and out of literary fashion . admittedly , french existentialism is sometimes little more than navel-gazing with bad breath , but camus at his best is incandescent . ",
        "the fall is narrated by a disgraced lawyer sitting in a dutch bar . his insights into how we fall from grace and face daily judgment are dark but powerful . f. scott fitzgerald , the great gatsby | there is only a little bit of crime in the great gatsby : jay turns out to be in the `` numbers racket , '' and myrtle is the victim of vehicular homicide . the compelling white-collar aspect of this greatest of 20th-cntury american novels is its study of money and power , as the narrator , nick carraway , sets out in the opening : good vision . ",
        "when i came back from the east last autumn i felt that i wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever ; i wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart . only gatsby , the man who gives his name to this book , was exempt from my reaction -- gatsby , who represented everything for which i have an unaffected scorn . if personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures , then there was something gorgeous about him , some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life , as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away . ",
        "this responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the `` creative temperament . '' -- it was an extraordinary gift for hope , a romantic readiness such as i have never found in any other person and which it is not likely i shall ever find again . no -- gatsby turned out all right at the end ; it is what preyed on gatsby , what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men . ",
        "saint paul , letter to the romans | on the road to damascus , saul famously became paul . the most powerful of the pauline letters is the one he wrote to the new christians living in rome . even for the non-christian or the secular , his analysis of law and grace is unparalleled , especially in chapter 7 : witness statement . 15 for i do not understand my own actions . for i do not do what i want , but i do the very thing i hate . 16 now if i do what i do not want , i agree with the law , that it is good . ",
        "17 so now it is no longer i who do it , but sin that dwells within me . 18 for i know that nothing good dwells in me , that is , in my flesh . for i have the desire to do what is right , but not the ability to carry it out . 19 for i do not do the good i want , but the evil i do not want is what i keep on doing . 20 now if i do what i do not want , it is no longer i who do it , but sin that dwells within me . ",
        "21 so i find it to be a law that when i want to do right , evil lies close at hand . 22 for i delight in the law of god , in my inner being , 23 but i see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members . 24 wretched man that i am ! who will deliver me from this body of death ? 25 thanks be to god through jesus christ our lord ! so then , i myself serve the law of god with my mind , but with my flesh i serve the law of sin . ",
        "in our own law practices , we may ask of ourselves what we seek to understand about our clients : who do we serve with our mind , and who do we serve with our flesh ? scott turow , personal injuries | as a novelist of popular law-oriented contemporary fiction , turow towers over most others . his 1999 novel personal injuries is agonizing in its description of lawyer robbie feaver 's downfall . as publishers weekly noted at the time : unlike most of his fellow lawyer-novelists , turow has always been more interested in character than plot , and in robbie feaver , a lawyer on the make who ends up fighting for his life , he has created his richest and most time to do a deal . ",
        "compelling figure yet . for years , robbie has been paying off judges and squirreling away part of the riches he earns as a highly successful trial lawyer . when the irs happens upon the money trail , and a top prosecutor leans on him to turn state 's evidence and finger some of the corrupt justices , robbie calls on george mason , veteran kindle county lawyer , to represent him and win the best deal he can . a complicating element in the case is evon miller , mormon-born fbi agent in deep undercover , who is assigned to watch feaver and finds herself , against her better inclinations , drawn to him -- for feaver is a character of almost shakespearean contradictions . ",
        "a charming , brash womanizer who nevertheless shows superhuman reserves of love and patience to his dying wife at home , he is always several jumps ahead of the prosecutors , the fbi and the reader , winning sympathy , even admiration , where there should be none . read the full review here . william shakespeare , macbeth | there are lots of lawyers , law-language and legal proceedings in shakespeare 's work , but for the white-collar lawyer there is no match for macbeth . its themes of power , overreach , ambition and guilt form paging captain jean-luc picard . ",
        "part of the western consciousness andare timeless : will all great neptune 's ocean wash this blood clean from my hand ? no , this my hand will rather the multitudinous seas incarnadine , making the green one red . . fyodor dostoyevsky , crime and punishment | what , exactly , to say about crime and punishment ? as noted by translator david mcduff : few works of fiction have attracted so many widely divergent interpretations as crime and punishment . it has been seen as a detective novel , an attack on radical youth , a study in `` alienation '' and criminal psychopathology , a work of prophecy , an indictment of urban social conditions in 19th century russia , a religious epic and a proto -- nietzschean analysis of the `` will to power . '' ",
        "it is , of course , all these things -- but it is more . like all of us , raskolnikov -- the nihilist student who without any real reason kills an old woman -- is guilty of original sin and saved , so to speak , only by suffering . what are the things that bring home to .   "
