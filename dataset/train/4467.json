        "jacob heilbrunnpolitics , north americatrump not only took out bannon , but also seems to be morphing into a traditional republican . downfall : the demise of steve bannonwhen steve bannon left the white house last august , he declared , `` i 'm free . i 've got my hands back on my weapons . '' but his ouster at breitbart , where rebekah mercer is said to have insisted on his departure , means that he is deprived of them once more , this time perhaps permanently . it 's a stunning and rapid fall for the man hailed at the outset of trump 's presidency as his puppet-master -- and a welcome moment for senate majority leader mitch mcconnell , who was intent on the destruction of his nemesis . ",
        "the truth is that the trump revolution is devouring its own children . donald trump has not only engineered the very public defenestration of bannon . he also may sign a comprehensive immigration deal with the democrats and will attend the annual global elite meeting in davos . the republican establishment , left for dead , is now reviving , while the populist movement that bannon headed has been wrong-footed . bannon , a right-wing catholic who grew up in virginia , was suffused with resentment at what he saw as globalist elites intent on deracinating america . he ended up becoming an integral part of what sam tanenhaus , writing in the new york review of books , aptly called the `` new tabloid right that was forming on the internet . '' ",
        "trump himself came to refer to him as `` my steve . `` but at the white house , his steve also had loose lips , dialing robert kuttner , the editor of the american prospect , to dismiss the idea of war with north korea and dilating about his plans to blow up the republican party . his incaution led to his departure from the white house . next bannon plotted to sabotage mainstream gop candidates during the midterm elections . an early test case came in alabama where bannon staunchly supported the child molester roy moore in his run for the senate . ",
        "once more , bannon came up empty . the coup de grace , however , came with bannon 's remarks in michael wolff 's new book fire and fury : inside the trump white house about `` treasonous '' and `` unpatriotic '' behavior by the participants in the now-infamous june 2016 new york trump tower meeting between the russian lawyer natalia veselnitskaya and leading trump officials , including donald trump jr. , jared kushner and paul manafort . trump was enraged . he went on a twitter spree , including dubbing bannon `` sloppy steve , '' and in a white house statement disparaged his contributions to the campaign as minimal . ",
        "days later bannon issued an abject apology , though he did not include kushner 's name in it , in a desperate attempt to salvage his relationship with trump . it did n't work . where does this leave bannon ? he might seek to reinvent himself as a mainstream commentator on one of the major cable networks such as cnn . bannon would be a prize catch . whether bannon , who is known for his erratic work habits and hours , not to mention unusual dress , would be able to function as a regular commentator is an open question . ",
        "there is a long history of former white house advisers such as patrick j. buchanan shuttling back and forth between government and the media . the other avenue would be for bannon would be to keep the faith , as it were , with the populist movement he helped to create and train his weapons on trump , in the hopes of pushing him to the right . but it seems clear that loyalty to trump , and trump alone , is what animates the right and that bannon wildly overreached in attacking him and his family . for now , trump is sending signals that he 's moving away from his base and towards the wall street faction , led by kushner , gary cohn and steve mnuchin , that did battle with bannon and his allies over the past year . ",
        "add in the tax bill , which stiffed trump 's base and was a bonanza for corporate interests , and the trump presidency starts to look a lot more traditional . with the demise of bannon , a new trump , shorn of the influence of the populist wing and more receptive to the establishment wing of the gop , may be emerging . jacob heilbrunn is editor of the national interest . image : reuters .
