        "the 2017 campaign treated ole miss football pretty well , including a six win season and a win over in-state rival mississippi state to cap things off . ole miss football went through its first season with head coach matt luke at the helm in oxford . after signing on to being the full-time head coach with the rebels immediately following the regular season , luke is now the guy for ole miss. . it was an up and down season , to say the least , for the rebels in 2017 . star sophomore quarterback shea patterson got the ole miss offense off to a fast start this year , but started to tail off at the start of sec play . ",
        "a season-ending injury to patterson against the lsu tigers would then put juco transfer quarterback jordan ta'amu in the spotlight . ole miss also sported a very young team in 2017 . with the sanctions that came down following the regular season , limiting scholarships and extending the postseason ban for the rebels , it put the rebuilding phase timeline much longer than originally hoped for by ole miss fans . the rebels finished the regular season with a record of 6-6 . ole miss actually was not the last place team in the sec west in 2017 . the arkansas razorbacks finished in the basement in the sec west , and posted the second worst record in the conference altogether , only ahead of the tennessee volunteers . ",
        "arkansas and tennessee both fired its head coaches in 2017 . all things considered , it was a relatively positive season for this program . there 's something to build off of , despite the transfers of players like patterson and wide receiver van jefferson . here 's the 5 takeaways from the 2017 campaign for the ole miss rebels . lexington , ky -- november 04 : jordan ta'amu # 10 of the mississippi rebels throws a pass against the kentucky wildcats at commonwealth stadium on november 4 , 2017 in lexington , kentucky . 5 . the spotlight is fully on jordan ta'amunot only did the season-ending knee injury to patterson throw ta'amu into the fire , but a transfer will now keep him in the spotlight . ",
        "patterson announced his transfer to join the michigan wolverines this month , which was not too surprising . ta'amu performed well in patterson 's absence . he tossed 11 touchdowns and only four interceptions , while posting a higher quarterback rating and completion percentage than patterson . the stat line was something to marvel at considering the situation ta'amu was thrown into . moreover , ta'amu is a better rusher than patterson was . in limited action , ta'amu got in the end zone with his legs four times . he gives the ole miss offense a versatile aspect that it did not have under the direction of patterson . ",
        "it 'll be much needed for the rebels to have a quarterback that can defeat opponents in multiple ways with the departure of star senior running back jordan wilkins . ole miss 's weapons are going to be limited in 2017 , but they have a promising option behind center in ta'amu . starkville , ms -- november 23 : jordan wilkins # 22 of the mississippi rebels breaks through the mississippi state bulldogs line and carries in for a touchdown during the second half of an ncaa football game at davis wade stadium on november 23 , 2017 in starkville , mississippi . ",
        "4 . jordan wilkins finished his career in styleafter getting suspended for the entire 2016 campaign due to academic ineligibility , wilkins looked to respond in a big way this year . he did just that , with his first career 1,000 rushing yard season and 10 total touchdowns . the next best running back for the rebels was sophomore d'vaughn pennamon , who rushed for less than 250 yards on the season . moreover , pennamon also only has three career rushing touchdowns , but he should be the starter after wilkins ' departure . once ta'amu took over the offense , wilkins was really able to take off . ",
        "the dual threat ability of ta'amu allowed for more running room for wilkins . he had four games with at least 118 rushing yards while patterson was not in the lineup . furthermore , five of wilkins ' nine rushing touchdowns on the year came in those four outings where he rushed for at least 118 yards . his team around him just did not do enough for the rebels to muster many wins at the end of the season . yet , the egg bowl victory over the mississippi state bulldogs was huge for both wilkins and the rebels . ",
        "starkville , ms -- november 23 : a. j. brown # 1 of the mississippi rebels scores a touchdown as brandon bryant # 1 of the mississippi state bulldogs tries to defend during the second half of an ncaa football game at davis wade stadium on november 23 , 2017 in starkville , mississippi . 3 . a. j. brown is primed for massive college careerthe best sophomore wide receiver in the nation , hands down , lined up for ole miss on offense in 2017 . star receiver a. j. brown set a single-season receiving yards record for ole miss , with around 100 yards to spare . ",
        "brown has the speed and athleticism to become the best receiver in the nation before his career in oxford is all said and done . he led the team in receiving yards , catches , receiving touchdowns , and finished second in yards per catch . considering how good the ole miss receiving corps was in 2017 , brown 's stat line just looks that much better . he caught 75 passes for 1,252 yards and 11 touchdowns in 2017 . and , ole miss was held out of postseason play . he 'll likely still finish in the top 10 in the country in receiving yards . ",
        "brown is sure to be a name to watch for the biletnikoff award in 2018 . with receivers like oklahoma state 's james washington , smu 's courtland sutton , and memphis 's anthony miller all making the jump to the nfl after the season is over , brown could take a step into the national spotlight in 2018 . tuscaloosa , al -- september 30 : jalen hurts # 2 of the alabama crimson tide rushes away from marquis haynes # 38 of the mississippi rebels at bryant-denny stadium on september 30 , 2017 in tuscaloosa , alabama . ",
        "2 . marquis haynes , breeland speaks highlight underrated defensive linenot much attention was paid to the ole miss defense in 2017 . they did have some trouble stopping sec opponents this year . giving up 66 points to the alabama crimson tide was not the highlights of the ole miss football season in 2017 . however , there were also some very solid performances coming from the rebels , holding opponents under 30 points and letting the offense really go to work . the defense really came up big in wins over mississippi state and the kentucky wildcats . ",
        "possibly the two best players for the ole miss defense this year were senior defensive end marquis haynes and junior defensive tackle breeland speaks . ole miss 's pass rush was very good with haynes and speaks combining for 14.5 sacks , as the team leaders in that stat category . sophomore defensive tackle josiah coatney could help ole miss form quite the duo in the middle of the defensive line alongside speaks . if speaks returns for his senior year in oxford , that will bring back 10.0 sacks from the defensive tackle position alone . 1 . matt luke holds the future of this program in his handssigning luke to a full-time head coaching contract came as a shock to a lot of college football fans . ",
        "yet , what he was able to do with the rebels this year proved how good of a coach he can be . ole miss also finished the year winning three of the final four games . the rebels also nearly took down the texas a&m aggies . ole miss signed luke to a four-year contract , worth a minimum of $ 3 million each season . that $ 3 million figure will increase each year as well . by the stretch run of luke 's contract , ole miss 's sanctions will be gone and he 'll have an opportunity to get them back into contention again . ",
        "it was not too long ago that hugh freeze had the rebels contending among the best in the sec and winning the sugar bowl . yet , it 's going to take a lot to get the program back to that level . the rebuild starts with luke continuing the momentum he built at the end of the regular season . he has the pieces in place , between talents like ta'amu , brown , and speaks to get this program going in the right direction in 2018 . no matter what happens to this team , it will ride on the shoulders of luke as the tenured head coach .
