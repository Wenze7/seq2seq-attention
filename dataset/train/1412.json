        "romain saiss has hit out at former wolves manager paul lambert for the way he was treated at molineux last season . the morocco international missed a part of the season to go to the african cup of nations and lambert appeared reluctant to use the player upon his return . and , in some scathing comments when speaking to the guardian , saiss revealed that he confronted his manager about it in the summer before his sacking : `` it was important for me to ask the manager why he had left me out of the team for , strangely enough , basically the same amount of time that i had been away on international duty . ",
        "`` i knew the truth but wanted to hear it from him . but he could n't tell me , he hid behind other excuses , which was a pity . '' the 27-year old is now a regular under nuno espirito santo and has played a key role in wolves ' fantastic start to the season and is clearly enjoying his time in the black country . with his take on the situation now as follows : `` the relationship between manager and players is very important and is very close to us . and his style of play is ideal . '' ",
        "the verdictpaul lambert 's treatment of romain saiss was bizarre and confused a lot of wolves fans last year , it 's as though he was punishing him for going to play in a major competition for his national team just because it was in mid-season . clearly saiss feels the same and whilst he may have felt underappreciated then , it 's a different story now . the midfielder is a key element to this wolves team and has struck up a very effective partnership with ruben neves which is central to how santo 's side play . thoughts , wolves fans ?
