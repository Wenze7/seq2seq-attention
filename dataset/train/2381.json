        "from a distance , the lionfish looks majestic , beautiful even . it has long , flowy fins and intricately placed cream and reddish-brown vertical stripes . do n't get too close though -- their flowy spines are venomous and can cause an excruciatingly painful sting . these invasive fish are rapidly increasing throughout the coasts of florida and the caribbean . according to the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission , lionfish can spawn up to every four days in warmer climates . female lionfish release about 30,000 eggs per spawn , and produce about 2 million eggs per year ; however , not all of those eggs make it to adulthood . ",
        "many scientists believe that warming oceanic temperatures are directly related to the increase in these ubiquitous fish . `` lionfish in the gulf of mexico have the potential to reproduce every two and a half days , about 11 months out of the year , with spawning activity linked to water temperature , '' environmental science graduate student , emma deroy , said . miami shark research and conservation program intern , patricia albano , uses the word `` epidemic '' to describe the lionfish outbreak . `` increased temperatures set the perfect stage for an invasion to thrive , '' albano said . ",
        "warmer conditions allow lionfish to spend less time in pelagic larval stages , meaning they 're able to mature faster and reproduce sooner . another issue with lionfish is how other sea life is responding to their presence . according to the national ocean and atmospheric administration , , lionfish have few natural predators , and their 18 venomous spines contain neurotoxins , which kill off native reef fish by releasing toxins into the reef systems . areas like the atlantic coast of florida and the gulf of mexico are perfect for lionfish because of their warm waters and coral reefs . ",
        "they 're thriving in these waters , while simultaneously stripping the oceans of native fish and coral sites . lionfish could potentially have detrimental effects on marine ecosystems and the economy . `` they eat indiscriminately and they eat a lot . so , given their high consumption rates , they have the ability to extirpate species , '' deroy said . `` if lionfish consume large numbers of juvenile snappers and groupers , the economic implications can be quite large . '' as of right now , their only inhibitor is cooler oceanic temperatures . at about 10 degrees celsius , the lionfish begin to stop feeding . ",
        "at about 16 degrees celsius , they start to die off , according to a noaa marine ecology research team . this is a problem because , since the oceans are warming , there is nothing stopping lionfish invasions . since there are no known lionfish predators , florida wildlife control encourages fishermen and divers to safely remove lionfish if they are found to help control the invasions . some organizations such as the fgcu spearfishing club have competitions to kill lionfish since there is no bag limit on these fish . other lionfish anglers harvest them for food . ",
        "scientists are trying to figure out ways to mass-kill the lionfish . an organization called robots in service of the environment , has been working on robotic technology to solve the issue of lionfish invasions . while on a diving trip in bermuda , colin and erika angel noticed the destruction to the reefs caused by lionfish , and soon came up with the idea of rse and formed the non-profit organization . rse is a non-profit developing robots to solve large scale environmental problems . rse 's first ... rse is a non-profit developing robots to solve large scale environmental problems . ",
        "rse 's first robot will stun ... robotsise . comwhile spearfishing lionfish has proven to be somewhat effective , there are still many limitations . the lionfish sometimes swim to waters that are too deep for divers . `` if deeper waters along the west florida shelf begin warming , it provides lionfish with a refuge , '' emma said . `` what this means is that , while we might still spear a lot of lionfish in nearshore waters , we really are n't targeting the fish at the source -- if most of the population is hiding out in deeper waters , they can then keep reproducing and building their population in deep waters , with a subset of these individuals radiating inwards to nearshore waters . '' ",
        "there are also lionfish-specific traps being set up that capture the lionfish without trapping by-catch like snapper and grouper . the lionfish are thriving and finding new ways to continue expanding their colonies . increasing temperatures are only helping them reproduce and overtake native species . `` in the case of lionfish , we still do n't fully understand them as an invasive species and certainly , it 's difficult to solve a problem that you do n't fully comprehend , '' deroy said . a lionfish swims in an aquarium in vienna , austria . . this graph shows the increase in lionfish in florida , as a result of increasing temperatures .
