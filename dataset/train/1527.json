        "the browns are making some moves in their front office . executive vp sashi brown has been fired after leading cleveland 's personnel department for the past two years , according to a statement from owner jimmy haslam . `` today we informed sashi that we were going in a new direction . the 2018 draft and offseason is pivotal for our franchise , we need to ensure that we maximize our opportunity for success ; with our picks , free agency and building our roster , '' haslam said in the statement . `` hue jackson will remain our coach and will return for the 2018 season but we feel it is necessary to take significant steps to strengthen our personnel department . '' ",
        "this change comes at time where there have been many questionable moves from the front office . a botched trade of bengals quarterback aj mccarron and brown 's decision to trade down rather than draft franchise quarterbacks carson wentz and deshaun watson left questions as to what would happen next with the front office . the browns have been struggling for quite some time as they are sitting at the bottom of the afc north rankings with a 0-12 record so far this season , and cleveland was 1-27 with brown as gm . cleveland is expected to immediately begin its search for its ninth general manager since 1999 .
