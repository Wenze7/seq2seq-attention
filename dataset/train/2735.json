        "varmilo is known for its creativity in the mechanical keyboard space . just look at the variety of keyboards on display at computex last year , and you 'll see why the mechanical keyboard community loves the work they do . varmilo 's latest creation is a custom keyboard for player unknown 's battlegrounds fans that has two different layouts -- the varmilo va108m chicken dinner and the va105m chicken dinner . they offer a high-quality custom pbt keycap set with dye-sublimated lettering . in our opinion , you ca n't find keycaps much better than this . the font used is a clean sans-serif , and the pbt material wo n't feel slick , greasy , or thin . ",
        "the custom colorway is white and gray with yellow accents on the arrow keys , enter key , and esc key . most , importantly it includes custom icons for all of your pubg bindings . each icon has side-printed legends so you can still easily read the numbers , f-keys , and media keys . the classic winning phrase `` winner winner chicken dinner ! '' is printed on the custom spacebar , too . if you 've been using a mechanical keyboard from some of the bigger brands , chances are they 'll be using uv-coated abs keycaps . ",
        "although abs keycaps are not `` bad '' per se , they 're used on many mainstream gaming keyboards to reduce cost , but the general consensus is that the material negatively affects the typing feel . the only downfall of the dye-sub pbt keycaps is that the printing method does not allow the white backlighting to shine through the lettering . if you 're typing away in the dark , the backlighting will give you a nice underglow , but it 's not used as a practical way of lighting up the keycaps letters and icons . as seen on a few other keyboards from varmilo , these models have a faux wood finish for the case . ",
        "they use polycarbonate abs with a wood grain texture to get this effect . we 've seen it in person on other another keyboard of varmilo 's , and although such a design may sound tacky , it 's surprisingly practical . the faux wood finish deters any greasy shine that glossier , untextured plastic cases tend to have . depending on the lighting in your room , the faux texture can be more or less convincing . at a retail price of $ 149.99 , it 's not a bad price considering that custom keycap sets do n't come cheap . ",
        "there 's a variety of switch options from cherry , too ; mx red , silent red , blue , brown and silver are all available . we can attest to the build quality of varmilo keyboards . they have a steel plate and varmilo 's own stabilizers , and again , the keycaps are high quality . this makes for a solid , heavy keyboard . combine that with the pubg icons , and you have a. . . winner . varmilo `` chicken dinner '' keyboard 149.99 currency on varmilo technical specifications type full-size switch cherry mx red , brown , blue , silver , or silent red lighting white onboard storage unknown media keys x game mode unknown microcontroller unknown key rollover unknown polling rate unknown interface mini usb cable 60 inches additional ports unknown keycaps pbt , dye-sub construction steel and polycarbonate abs with wood grain texture accessories unknown software unknown dimensions unknown weight unknown warranty unknown see full article here .
