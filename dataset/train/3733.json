        "the bus was travelling along a road in the remote aktobe region that links the russian city of samara to shymkent , a city in southern kazakhstan close to the uzbek border . it was unclear in which direction the bus , a hungarian-made ikarus , had been travelling , but the route is widely used to transport uzbek workers to and from russia where they often take work on building sites . only five people managed to escape the burning vehicle , the interior ministry 's emergencies department said in a statement . the ministry said the apparent accident had happened at 10.30 a. m. , but provided no details about its cause . ",
        "a photograph posted online from the site showed the bus completely burnt out . video footage also posted on the web showed it positioned diagonally across a two-lane freeway in the middle of a snow-covered steppe , in flames and emitting heavy black smoke . uzbekistan 's foreign ministry said in a statement its embassy staff were en route to the area , roughly midway between the russian border and the aral sea . last october , another kazakh-operated bus carrying over 50 uzbeks was hit by a train in russia after getting stuck on the tracks ; 17 people died in that accident .
