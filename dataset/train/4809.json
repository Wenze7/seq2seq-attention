        "ross barkley was reported to be close to at £ 35m transfer last summer . but , it 's rumoured chelsea agreed with his agent to let his contract run down to january . saving chelsea £ 20m . conte is on a tight budget at chelsea and has struggled to make signings . causing a lack of squad depth and some worries at the start of the season . therefore a £ 20m saving and adding depth to a thin midfield is good business . but , conte 's side have had a strong first half of the season sitting in 3rd , a point behind 2nd . ",
        "however , the title has already been lost to guardiola 's unbeaten manchester city . ross barkley has been predicted a bright future for years . he debuted for england 's senior team aged 19 , after 34 caps for england 's youth teams . in 2011 , martin keown said 17 year old ross barkley would be ` one of the best players we 'll ever see in this country . ' tim cahill also said he was ` the most talented footballer he had worked with . ' he regularly received praise from pundits and ex-england stars when he started to play for everton . ",
        "often being compared to paul gascoigne . and he was included in roy hodgson 's 2014 world cup squad . barkley has n't played a premier league minute this season due to a hamstring injury . he has only missed 12 matches through injury before this season , in 2014 from two separate injuries . missing half a season of football at a young age that is important for development is frustrating . but , barkley already has over 10,000 premier league minutes to his name and has played some europa league football at everton . i am a big fan of this transfer because i want to see barkley succeed at a top club . ",
        "conte is a brilliant manager and hopefully barkley can grow under him to the player he was predicted to be . and star for england . at £ 15m this is relatively low risk for chelsea . there 's a good chance he will succeed and if not then he is a good squad player for the time being . if he were to not reach his potential and not be to chelsea 's standard then its a low fee for a player who is young , respected and has resale value . he certainly wo n't lose his value . ",
        "in my opinion he can really earn a spot at chelsea and perform well . he has had two strong seasons at everton recently which i feel went under the radar at times from non-evertonians . for the relatively low fee he is a great investment for chelsea and can earn a huge return on investment through his performances and value . chelsea legend , frank lampard has said it was a great signing , praising ross barkley 's ability and that in today 's market £ 15m for a relatively young english midfielder is good business . which i agree with .
