        "elizabeth , colo. . -- a clydesdale horse escaped injury friday after falling through ice and spending a frigid hour in a pond until rescuers freed it . the horse wandered onto the ice of a retention on private ranch property in the 40000 block of elbert county road 21 . members of the elizabeth fire department and elbert county sheriff 's office came together to pull the horse free , according to ecso spokesman chris dickey . when firefighters arrived , the horse was standing in six to eight feet of icy water . elizabeth fd firefighter rusty booth crawled along the ice and put a halter on the animal . ",
        "other firefighters then broke the six-inch-thick ice around the horse . dickey said a half dozen deputies and firefighters then pulled on a rope attached to the horse 's halter to turn it around and guide it toward the edge of the ice where it first fell through . the clydesdale raised up quickly on its front legs but struggled to pull its rear legs free . with monumental effort , it leaped from the water and stood precariously on all fours . but it did not fall . dickey , wearing a black cowboy hat , was the first to greet the tired creature . ",
        "`` it 's was a darn big horse when you 're standing next to it , '' he said . dickey said the owners of the ranch are in the process of building a fence around the retention pond to prevent just this kind of accident .   "
