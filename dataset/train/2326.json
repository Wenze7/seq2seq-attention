",
        "so preparation wise , all the boxes seem to be ticked at the moment . this attack is considered , by many pundits , as the most balanced that the indian team has ever had . subsequently , the expectations have also sky-rocketed , especially after their indomitable form in the recently concluded home season . data-ad-client = `` ca-pub-7785168419440214 `` data-ad-slot = `` 6042301080 '' > in a recent video uploaded by the board of control for cricket in india on twitter , the indian pacers can be seen warming up on a centre-wicket at newlands , during a practice session .
