        "co-authored by andrilisa readi used to be the most depressed person i knew and now i 'm the happiest . all people have different definitions for what a successful life experience is . the only reason i have desired any particular circumstance or material item is that at the core i believed it would make me feel happier . over time i realized that success is happiness . happiness became a personal art and learning it 's skill provided the most profound benefit out of any endeavor i undertook . these have been my discoveries along the way ... find the best feeling thoughti used to think my emotions were pointless , as if they did n't have any purpose . ",
        "i deeply pondered this question and after doing some intense soul searching i had an epiphany - that living for good feeling emotions is what life is really about . there 's nothing more important than happiness , so dedicating every waking moment to my personal joy became the best venture i could launch ! i decided that i deserved and wanted to be happy . at any moment , we have access to a wide variety of thoughts , some feel better , some feel worse . the goal for me was to keep choosing the best feeling one i could find . ",
        "like a ladder , i felt myself progressively climb into better feeling emotions on the spectrum . the more i actively chose these better feeling thoughts , the easier it became to maintain them . as i continued to do this those happier thoughts became prominent , natural and easy . uplift those around usi 'm always blown away by the impact we can have on people . giving love to people has an effect that is without words . i was at a take out restaurant , i had walked a solid mile to get there . after ordering all my food , i realized that i did n't have my wallet . ",
        "just as the realization of me having to go home empty handed started to set in , a complete stranger behind me decided to pay for my entire meal . `` pay it forward '' was all he said . that moment of compassion deeply influenced me to be more generous . i learned then that whether it be a compliment to the cashier or positive encouragement of a friend 's dreams or going out of my way to make someone feel special , it could make a world of a difference in someone 's day . i started to give something positive to every person i met with the hopes that they would give equal positive things to 10 more people , who would then pass it forward to 10 more ! ",
        "it 's like a butterfly effect of positivity . as a bonus , doing all this also made me feel great ! everyone is looking for love and affection , be one of the blessed few that shines that onto the world ! wake up happy -- set the day up for successi never used to focus on the beginning of the day . but then i started to notice that the days in which i woke up happy , were followed by a series of good experiences whereas the days in which i woke up not-so-happy would `` go to pot '' . ",
        "clearly there was a connection between those first few moments of the day and the trajectory of the rest of the day . the first few minutes of my day became the most important . it was during this unique time in which i could imprint my desires into the formless substance that makes up this world . this was the time to choose who i wanted to be . i could wake up tomorrow with a new life . if could become happy early in the day , the likelihood that i would sustain it throughout the day was huge once i got the hang of it . ",
        "this has the greatest effect to effort ratio out of any point of the day . this is because as the day unfolds , our thoughts will naturally stay on the track we start them on . by choosing happiness and doing anything to get ourselves into a powerful high and elated feeling , the effect on our life over time will be massive . bring in the newthere was a point in my life when i used to do the exact same thing every day . monotonous , repetitious living made me feel like i was withering away . ",
        "i wanted to feel more alive . i decided one of the easiest ways to feel better and to move my life forward was to engage in very different things than what i was used to . i started taking time during the day to do something completely unique every day . i tried a new food that i was n't accustomed to . i started doing yoga and meditation . i took a different route . how can we grow if we do n't change into something new ? growth is the actualization of new choices . have you noticed that a lot of times it 's doing something for the first time that we have the most fun ? ",
        "we need to make that part of our lives . we can change the habits of our minds by installing new ways of thinking . i began to see the world in a newfound light . the future is bright . let go of responsibilitiesgrowing up i had a mental list i always felt i needed to get done . an artificial stress would rule my day until i realized i did n't actually have to do hardly any of it . i was focusing so much on completing these inconsequential tasks that i lost sight of my personal freedom and joy in the moment . ",
        "if the laundry did n't get done , no catastrophes would happen . if the dishes did n't get done , things would be fine . if we ca n't make it to that obligation , our world will keep turning . i let go . work was fine without me for a few days . i took time to soothe myself . this whole life experience is here to thrill us and to make us happy . happiness has to be our number one priority . what we focus on , we get more of ! focus on the pleasure of life . ",
        "putting myself firstwe are the most important person in our universe . we are magnificence in human form . once i was able to let go , i found that i have a tremendous light to share with this world . so i began to treat myself that way . like they say before takeoff , `` secure your oxygen mask before assisting others . '' the more i gave to myself , the more i had to share with others . oprah can give everyone a car because she gave to herself enough to have that influence and wealth spill over to others . ",
        "when we love ourselves , we can let that love spill out onto every person we meet ! giving to ourselves will make us healthy , happy , and enthusiastic about our lives . that 's why you are the most important person to give to .   "
