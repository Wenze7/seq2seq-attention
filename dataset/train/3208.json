        "the miami marlins are seeing more and more interest for starting catcher , jt realmuto . realmuto is right at the start of what can be some of his best years in the big leagues . after hitting . 278 with 17 home runs and 65 rbi 's , he is starting to draw some attention from different teams . the texas rangers , who finished below . 500 last season , are looking to use 33-year-old catcher robinson chirinos as their starter . chirinos had a fabulous second half of the season after the rangers got rid of lucroy . ",
        "with that said , chirinos should not be the rangers starter in 2018 . realmuto has three years left on his contract before becoming eligible for free-agency . due to this , he will come with a bit more of a price tag on him . the rangers need to look to the future and start rebuilding for years further in the future than 2018 . realmuto gives them the opportunity to have a quality starter and quality backup in chirinos . being in the american league , if both bats come alive in 2018 , the rangers could still utilize both bats with the dh role and seriously improve their offense .
