        "comedian mike king has praised new plymouth high school headmaster for his forward-thinking approach to students ' mental welfare issues . king , who is a well-known voice on mental health , first congratulated new plymouth boys ' high school headmaster paul veric about five months ago following a speech in which he told students they are loved and should speak up about their emotions as part of an effort to tackle youth suicide . and during king 's latest tour around new plymouth , veric has again been given a special mention . `` paul is a leader in the new frontier , '' king said . ",
        "`` he speaks to the heart whereas old school teachers speak to the mind . but once you win the heart , you win the mind . '' read more : earlier this year veric spoke on suicide at a school assembly where he also discussed loving thy neighbour and breaking male stereotypes . he told his students : `` love is a word you need to understand . you need to get comfortable with it . if we have any chance of reversing the trend of young people feeling helpless , we have a greater chance of overcoming it by caring for each other . ",
        "`` love your parents . love your friends . love thy neighbour . equally importantly , accept the love from others . do n't reject it or push it away . soak it in like the warming rays of sun on your back on a summer 's day . '' the speech was then posted to the school 's facebook page and shared hundreds of times . king had visited npbhs before the speech but still warmed to see veric 's efforts . `` he 's not afraid to wear his heart on his sleeve and that 's important , '' king said . ",
        "`` when you walk through the hall , the boys just gravitate to him . '' king travels the country speaking on the importance of opening up , showing kindness , and setting better examples for children . his latest visit to taranaki saw him speak at devon intermediate , npbhs , highlands intermediate and waitara high schools . `` the kids are fantastic . i really enjoy the kids ' vulnerability and their trust that they put in you , '' king said . `` it 's like being invited into a world you never knew existed . '' ",
        "king also went to a number of organisations such worleyparsons new zealand , powerco and a combination of rotary clubs . while talks to students focussed on self-esteem , events with adults allowed for a more ` q&a ' format , he said . `` basically i become a mouthpiece for the kids because i 've been with speaking to them all day . `` my generation have to stop looking at excuses - stop blaming the computer screens , stop blaming the government , stop blaming social media . `` if 40 per cent of students have suicidal thoughts but 95 per cent of new zealanders have never had that conversation , than we need to be asking ourselves , ` why do n't the kids talk to us ? ' ",
        "`` for most of us , it 's just we have n't told them that they can .
