        "neo : currently in latin america we are living in an explosion about digital transformation and agile practices , and even in a lot of countries out of latin america , but specially in latin america financial systems , public sector and other industries not only software are moving to a digital transformation . it looks maybe like a chaotic moment because everything is changing quickly . what is your best advice for leaders , c-levels , project leaders or product leaders and entrepreneurs in latin america ? dave : digital transformation is very interesting but it is incomplete in human terms . ",
        "human beings see things very differently from the computers . so the digital transformation of the internet of things uses physical senses , but it does n't add human interpretation to that information . so to give an example of a project we are currently running , we have patients in a hospital who have physical senses like heart rate , blood pressure , temperature . in parallel with that we are getting patients to tell stories about their experience , because narrative is fundamental to human meaning . we are storytelling creatures , we tell stories . the stories that people tell about their health journey are very different from what the monitors say . ",
        "so we can measure human culture , human motivation which is very different from the way the artificial intelligence interprets the material . i 'll give another example . in wales , in finland and new zealand , we have children at the age of 17 going into their communities every month to gather stories of day to day experience , that allow us to look that how people exist on a day to day basis through the eyes of human observers , that are not dependant on social media . if we look at what happened with the election of donald trump , social media is too easy to manipulate . ",
        "anything an algorithm can interpret , and algorithm can create ; if we have a human sense of network then we are not susceptible to the manipulation of the russians or anybody else . in my view , the future is to empower citizens to understand their own condition through their own stories not through social media . neo : professor , about your last concept , maybe someone can say this is not the future , it is our past because we are introducing a digital way between one human and other . it is interesting to hear from you that you see in the future that we are going to come back to interact with each other directly . ",
        "dave : i think the question is , do we want the future ? if we live in social media then we are less than artificial intelligence , we are reduced to lose humanity . we need to limit the digital revolution , to be restricted , and we need to allow the natural stories of human beings to inform policy . the choice for latin america is to be a servant of america through its digital control of the environment , or to recognise that human values of the community-based society and allow computers to be tools , not to dominate the way we think .
