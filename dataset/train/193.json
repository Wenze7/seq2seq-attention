        "this story originally appeared on surfer . words by pete taras . right now , the entire east coast is witnessing history . a rare bomb cyclone , or `` bombogenesis , '' is pounding the northeast with wind , snow , and dangerously cold conditions . that did n't stop a crew in the outer banks and new jersey from taking a crack at the action . `` today was surreal , '' said oliver kurtz . `` it was my first time driving to the beach during a blizzard . it 's wild to see the beaches in cape hatteras covered in snow when just a couple months ago i was here wearing boardies . ",
        "the swell ended up being three times bigger than expected . we all struggled pretty hard because of the raw energy , strong winds and snow , but there were some pretty special moments to be had . all the boys had smiles from ear to ear . '' brett barley had this to say about paddling out on the outer banks : `` it was firing but the paddle out was so hard . we were all getting denied over and over . you 'd have to wait 20 minutes just for a break in the sets to try and get out . ",
        "i 've never seen the paddle out that hard on a day like this . maybe it was the way the sandbar is setup . the paddle out was just unusually difficult . scoring days like today here is tough ... the waves can be pumping and you 'll literally never find yourself in the spot for 'em . not one of us even got to be near the best waves coming in today . if someone was , the clip would be going viral right now . '' sam hammer added this : `` the conditions were crazy with the amount of snow and wind . ",
        "gusts were around 45 mph when i was surfing and temperatures were dropping into single digits with the wind chill , but the tubes and temptation was just too great . anytime you 're with friends getting good surf , it feels a whole lot warmer . '' between the outer banks and new jersey , only a handful of waves were successfully ridden on thursday . with conditions cleaning up , and local crews from new england to north carolina ready to suit up and give it another crack , we should see plenty of more tubes up and down the east coast . ",
        "stay tuned .   "
