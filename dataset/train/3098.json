        "united nations -- north korea 's leadership has cracked down further on human rights as tensions have escalated over its nuclear and missile tests , including beefing up restrictions on movements and making `` horrific '' prison conditions more severe , the u. n. rights chief said monday . zeid ra'ad al-hussein told the security council that the international security crisis sparked by north korean leader kim jong un 's military actions `` is inseparable from concerns about the human rights situation of the ordinary people in the country . `` a chronic lack of food , partly due to resources that are diverted to the military , has made humanitarian aid provided by the u. n. and others `` literally a lifeline for some 13 million acutely vulnerable individuals , '' he said . ",
        "zeid urged the council to assess the human rights impact of sanctions -- including controls over international banking transfers -- that have slowed aid deliveries and to minimize the humanitarian consequences . this was the fourth year the security council has discussed human rights in the democratic people 's republic of korea , or dprk , the country 's official name . as in previous years , the meeting went ahead only after a procedural vote in the 15-member council where at least nine nations are required to support having the session . on monday , the human rights meeting was approved by 10 members and opposed by russia and china , with egypt and ethiopia abstaining . ",
        "china 's deputy u. n. ambassador , wu haitao , whose country is north korea 's closest ally , said the meeting would be `` counterproductive '' at a time of heightened tensions . north korea 's latest ballistic missile test demonstrated that it can threaten the u. s. mainland , and there is growing concern that it will soon be able to put a nuclear warhead on its missiles . president donald trump has vowed to stop the north koreans from reaching such capability , increasing the possibility of conflict . `` indeed , the context of military tensions seems to have deepened the extremely serious human rights violations endured '' by the 25 million north koreans , the u. n. high commissioner for human rights said . ",
        "north korea 's u. n. mission strongly condemned the meeting -- as it has in the past -- calling it `` a desperate act of the hostile forces which lost the political and military confrontation with the dprk that has openly risen to the position of nuclear weapon state . '' it called the human rights issue in the country `` non-existent . '' `` if the u. s. and other hostile forces think of browbeating the dprk by the discussion of ` human rights issues ' in the security council , it is nothing else than a daydream that will not be realized ever , '' it said in a statement . ",
        "north korea has barred u. n. human rights officials from visiting the country , but zeid said people who have escaped from north korea have reported `` extremely widespread violations of rights in almost every aspect of people 's lives . '' `` in recent months , military tensions have led to more severe controls over freedom of movement and civil and political rights for the people of the dprk , '' he said . zeid pointed to new physical barriers being erected along north korea 's border and increased surveillance . he also criticized china for returning north koreans who escape from their country , saying they `` are routinely subjected to multiple forms of torture and ill-treatment , '' including women who are subjected `` to invasive body searches '' that may amount to rape under international law . ",
        "zeid said his office has received more than 70 reports of women , men and children who escaped again after being sent back by chinese authorities who decided they were `` economic migrants , '' disregarding `` the overwhelming human rights violations taking place in the country . `` he also cited horrific conditions in prisons and labor camps , and widespread torture in detention centers used to extract information or confessions about people planning to leave the country , illegally using foreign telecommunications networks to contact people abroad , or engaging in smuggling activities . detainees are forced to work in mines or on building projects , face beatings , `` and are being fed so little they barely survive , '' zeid said . ",
        "there are reportedly five secret political prison camps that instill fear and function as `` a powerful instrument of control , '' he said . u.s. ambassador nikki haley told the council that the systematic human rights violations against north korea 's people `` are a means to a single end : keeping the kim jong un regime in power . '' `` the regime is using that power to develop an unnecessary arsenal and support enormous conventional military forces that pose a grave risk to international peace and security , '' she said . `` their menacing march towards nuclear weapons begins with the oppression and exploitation of ordinary north korean people . ",
        "`` haley said an estimated 100,000 north koreans , including children , are in prisons , many because north korea practices `` guilt-by-association '' and allows up to three generations of a family to be imprisoned along with an accused family member . `` defectors have reported that all north koreans age 12 and older are required to attend public executions -- a graphic reminder of consequences of disobedience of the government , '' she added . haley said the majority of asylum seekers are women , many of them trafficked . if women are repatriated while pregnant , she said they are tortured and forced to have abortions . ",
        "if their baby is born alive , it is killed in an effort to maintain `` ethnic purity , '' she said .   "
