        "east rutherford , n. j. -- philip rivers and the los angeles chargers are still hanging around in the afc playoff hunt . they had to sweat out a 14-7 win against the new york jets on sunday , but they 've been playing with little room for error all season after an 0-4 start . they 'll go into next week 's showdown against oakland needing one more win -- and a little more help elsewhere . `` that 's all we can ask for at this point , starting 0-and-4 , digging the hole we dug , is to be alive in week 17 , '' rivers said . ",
        "`` all those games you are sick about at this point , but you 're excited to have a chance . `` rivers threw a touchdown pass to antonio gates , and melvin gordon ran for a score for the chargers , who entered the weekend needing to win both of their remaining games . rivers & co. . held up their end of things , but just barely . los angeles had a tough time getting much going consistently against a spirited effort by the defense of the jets , but did n't need much offense in this one . ",
        "rivers finished 22 of 40 for 290 yards . tennessee lost 27-23 to the rams , and buffalo fell to new england 37-16 -- each helping the chargers ' playoff hopes . the titans are home against jacksonville next week , while the bills are at miami . the chargers would be in the postseason if they win , baltimore beats cincinnati and tennessee loses . `` we 've put ourselves in a better position , even though we do n't control our own destiny , '' cornerback casey hayward said . `` we 're still in it . you 're never out until they say , ` you do n't have a chance . ' ",
        "`` gordon had 81 yards on 19 carries , but left late with an ankle injury . he remained standing on the sideline as the chargers tried to run out the clock , and coach anthony lynn was not immediately sure of the severity . bryce petty , making his second start this season in place of the injured josh mccown , struggled all game . he missed open receivers and repeatedly flexed his right hand , which he banged up early in the game . but he remained in and said his hand is fine , finishing 15 of 28 for 119 yards and an interception . ",
        "`` it 's frustrating , '' petty said . `` this team deserves better , this offense deserves better -- and i know i can make those plays . `` bilal powell was the bright spot for the jets ' offense , rushing for 145 yards , including a 57-yard td , on 19 carries . los angeles took a 7-0 lead with 8:55 left in the first half on gates ' 3-yard touchdown catch , capping a 12-play , 71-yard drive . the chargers had a chance to increase their advantage early in the third quarter , but nick rose , signed earlier this week , was wide right on a 47-yard attempt . ",
        "new york took advantage of the miss to tie it on powell 's long touchdown run . los angeles regained the lead quickly , however , on gordon 's 1-yard run . gordon hit the hole and pushed over the goal line with a strong second and third effort . the jets had a chance to tie in the closing minutes , getting a roughing-the-passer call on joey bosa to help extend their drive . but on fourth-and-7 from the chargers 17 , petty 's heave to robby anderson in the end zone with 3:07 left fell incomplete . `` we were off-key as an offense and in the passing game , '' jets coach todd bowles said . ",
        "`` we 'll go back and look at the film and build from there . we did n't make enough plays . `` good handschargers wide receiver keenan allen intercepted petty 's desperation toss to end the first half . it was the first career interception for allen , who was tackled by brandon shell . the jets right tackle suffered a concussion on the play and was replaced by brent qvale in the second half . `` we wanted to put a tall guy back there that can jump , and keenan showed why he 's back there , '' lynn said of the 6-foot-2 allen . ",
        "hold onlos angeles ' travis benjamin returned a punt 91 yards for a touchdown early in the fourth quarter -- but it was nullified by a holding penalty on nick dzubnar . instead , it went down as a 14-yard return for benjamin . no mojets defensive end muhammad wilkerson was inactive after being benched at new orleans last sunday for being late to a team meeting . wilkerson practiced with the team all week , and coach todd bowles insisted the veteran `` served his sentence '' when asked if further discipline might be used . bowles said it was `` a coach 's decision '' for wilkerson to not play . ",
        "the coach declined to say whether wilkerson 's contract situation played a role . his $ 16.75 million salary for next season is fully guaranteed against a serious injury . injurieschargers : safety adrian phillips re-injured an ankle . left tackle russell okung was inactive with a groin injury and replaced by rookie sam tevi . jets : defensive end leonard williams left in the second half with a back injury and did n't return . jonotthan harrison started at center for the jets in place of wesley johnson , who was active but dealt with a hip ailment all week . ",
        "right guard brian winters was out with an abdominal injury and dakota dozier started in his place . surprise startthe jets won the opening coin toss , but deferred -- and then pulled off a successful onside kick to start the game . new york became the second team this season to attempt an onside kick to open a game , joining tennessee . the jets are also the first team to successfully recover on onside kick in the first 30 seconds since philadelphia in week 17 of the 2012 season , according to nfl research . the jets came away without any points , though , as an offensive pass interference call on anderson and a sack by tenny palepoi short-circuited new york 's drive .
