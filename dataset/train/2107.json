        "2018 women 's march organizers ask women to take the next step fargo , n. d. -- a year on from the women 's march , organizers in north dakota are back and they want women to take the next step and get more involved in politics . after donald trump 's inauguration last year , more than 3,000 people showed up at the women 's march in fargo . the progressive , grassroots organization indivisible fm in the fargo-moorhead area is organizing this year 's march . nicole mattson is helping put together this year 's event . she says organizers are asking marchers to think about how they 've participated in the democratic process , and then consider how they could go one step further . ",
        "`` for example , if you 're a regular voter but that 's the extent of what you have done , maybe you could help someone else vote this year or maybe you could volunteer for a candidate , '' she says . `` if you 're a regular volunteer , maybe you should serve on a local board or commission , or maybe even now it 's time for you to run for office . `` mattson says the #metoo movement , along with the year in politics , is adding momentum to this year 's women 's march . ",
        "this year 's rally takes place at the fargo civic center at 1 p. m. saturday and includes speeches from hamida dakane , the 2018 fargo human relations award recipient , ruth buffalo of the north dakota human rights coalition , and local politicians . mattson says after the 2016 election , she started to feel like she was n't participating enough in politics , so she founded indivisible 's fargo-moorhead chapter . membership exploded from three on the day of the 2017 march to about 4,000 today . she hopes more women feel empowered to participate in the democratic process after saturday 's event . ",
        "`` you might be more qualified than the man who is positive he can do the job that you 're unsure of , '' says mattson . `` so , i just really want to help women push past that level of discomfort and understand that they deserve representation in our government and it 's not going to happen by magic . they need to go out and get it . `` marches also will take place across the country this weekend . the largest event is scheduled for las vegas , where the 2017 women 's march organizers are holding their `` power to the polls '' voter drive kickoff on sunday .
