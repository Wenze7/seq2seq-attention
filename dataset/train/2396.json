        "this morning , the metropolitan museum of art -- the greatest encyclopedic museum of art in the world -- willfully threw a piece of its greatness away . its longtime admissions policy of paying what you wish as long as you pay something , a singularly democratic , jeffersonian , and flexible economic and ethical comfort and gratification , will now be monetized . starting march 1 , the met will card visitors , asking where they live , in order to start charging the full admission of $ 25 to out-of-state visitors . the administration 's hope is to raise the proportion of income it takes in at the gate by a couple percent . ",
        "the new rules declare that new york state residents may still pay what they wish . so can students with ids from connecticut and new jersey , up through graduate school . children under 12 will still be admitted free . seniors not living in new york state will now be required to pay $ 17 . everyone else will have to pay $ 25 . i already envision the lengthening lines as people dig around and present various forms of identification -- real , made-up , borrowed , or tossed over the heads of guards to waiting friends . ",
        "i see others who did n't bring any identification that day , who were out for a walk from their hotel or home , having long arguments with gatekeepers . the policy instantly suggests a thousand loopholes , uncomfortable moments of forcing poorer visitors to dissemble , of trepidation felt by immigrants , undocumented workers , and others who will be forced to produce valid proof of their places of origin or dwelling . on every beautiful face waiting to maybe see something wonderful , i see some kind of pain . all this to raise around $ 8 million more a year for an institution whose current annual budget is more than $ 305 million . ",
        "the met is about access to history , imagination , world culture , creativity , visual literacy , inspiration , things that take us away from things that we need to be taken away from , things that heal us , that change lives . that changed mine . i understand that we live in a country that does n't much fund museums . despite regular wishes by the art world for more washington involvement , i actually like that the government and the arts are on separate tracks , and i want to keep it that way . imagine if republicans told the met to remove the balthus because it offends some of their constituents . ",
        "imagine if paul ryan got control of museum budgets . american museums have always found a way to rise above that bullshit , paving pathways to culture with largesse and the sweat of thousands of artists , curators , registrars , and countless others , most working for almost nothing , just to have lives lived in art . the met is a big operation . it does n't just present the miraculous cabinet of wonders of its permanent collection . it also stages more than 50 special exhibitions a year , and it does n't charge extra to see those . ",
        "this is n't the case at most museums . the brooklyn museum , the tate , the american museum of natural history , moma -- all add fees for special exhibitions . i often balk at having to shell out extra cash to visit a show i 'm not sure i really want to see . just yesterday i spent an hour in a tremendous one-room exhibition at the back of the met devoted to silver plates made in the renaissance commemorating a series of roman emperors . had i been required to pay an additional $ 15 to take a chance on this show , i doubt that i would have . ",
        "similarly , i saw crowds of people reveling in the wild color of david hockney , none of whom had to jump through extra hoops to do so . all this makes these special shows even more special . we should love the met for this , and we do . we all have imagined , at one time or another , that the pay-what-you-wish policy could eventually erode the museum 's finances , and indeed that `` eventually '' has now arrived . remember , after all , that the met also sponsors excavations and architectural repairs , and hires scholars from around the world , and maintains one of the greatest conservation labs on earth . ",
        "a lot of the objects you see in other museums have passed through the met to be researched , recorded , and breathed back into aesthetic life by this unsurpassed team . all that costs a fortune . anyone who 's spent any time in the museum will also know of the massive education programs , regular free lectures , and the fabulous giant groups of kids arriving daily , being taken through by loving overseers in hopes of changing lives , expanding horizons . i have n't even mentioned that the met now has three locations : the fifth avenue mother ship , the met breuer , and the glorious cloisters in fort tryon park . ",
        "the new admission fee is good for three days , so it will allow visits to all of them . i love the met , but i may be part of the problem here . i go more than 40 times a year . although i can show a press card that confers free admission , i pay a dollar each time . i 've never gone there without seeing a few artists or faces i recognize from the art world doing exactly what i am : changing our world a little . my wife and i have had scores of friday-night dates at the met . ",
        "all of us go to museums not just because they 're warehouses , places for local bragging rights and necessary selfies . museums are ecstasy machines , engines of humanity , wormholes to other dimensions , places where we stand , look at inanimate objects and experience rapture and the world changes . all this is almost free at the met , which only makes the place that much more miraculous . seven million people came through last year , a record . i do not begrudge the met for trying to do whatever it can to maintain its preeminence . ",
        "yet this first-time attempt to raise admission before its new director arrives -- intended to raise $ 6 million to $ 10 million annually -- does n't entirely pass the smell test . it has an air of expediency , nervousness , an idea drought , of managers rather than art being in charge . especially since the museum just spent more than $ 65 million on the space-eating , flow-disrupting , patron-inscribed fountains in the newly renamed koch plaza . this single act of philanthropy would have covered almost ten years of this iffy admissions policy . it would have spared the met an additional self-inflicted wound at a time when it can ill afford it , and the koch family could instead have had its name on the little admission stickers instead of yet another piece of new york city . ",
        "there may lie the real problem . the big cultural institutions ' boards of trustees are in a state of emergency , and they need to change . the met recently and messily lost its director -- after hiring him , seemingly tasking him with doing everything that he did , then kneecapping him in public , rightly or not . that points to dysfunction within the institution and things amiss with trustees . the new york city ballet and the metropolitan opera have just been rocked by serious allegations of longtime sexual harassment by their artistic leaders . their board members were likely tolerant of , or at least aware of , these festering situations . ",
        "that 's gross incompetence , both fiscal and moral . for too long boards like these have been passive , enabling questionable actions and behavior or overseeing economic mismanagement while conferring social cachet and connections on themesleves . this dereliction of responsibilities and neglect is a cancer that will kill institutions built on the backs of generations of creative souls . board members donate money ; that is as it should be . in america , having no such largesse means having no museums . but board membership ca n't only be about writing checks -- particularly when those members are neither donating enough nor raising enough elsewhere nor ensuring that those institutions are always best served by their leaders and best serving their public . ",
        "trustees ca n't keep passing the buck to attendance fees or banking on teams of expensive lawyers to shift blame from them when allegations of misconduct arise . i love the met and i always will . i trust it . i must . yet a wider structural cultural rot has reached the root of too many institutions , and it has to stop here . the ticket prices are the least of it .
