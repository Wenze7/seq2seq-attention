        "by the time you make it to the airport , check your bag , make it through the security line , and actually set foot on the airplane , you may not be in the mood for more than a polite hello to the flight attendant who welcomes you onboard . while you may not be able to manage more than a cursory glance and brief smile at the flight attendant while you struggle aboard with your bags , there 's a good chance that the flight attendant is taking a much closer look at you . according to a recent informal quora survey of flight attendants , they size up their passengers from the moment they enter the plane door . ",
        "they are looking for information about their passengers , ranging from potential risks to potential help and they do it all in a blink of an eye . flight attendant amar rama likes to keep an eye out for sick passengers , noting that while the passenger may want to travel , if a serious medical issue does arise , it 's far better to be on the ground than 30,000 feet in the air . `` flight attendants are all trained in cpr , automated external defibrillators , basic first aid emergencies , '' she wrote . `` but we can not diagnose you nor have the expertise , experience or treatment as doctor . '' ",
        "flight attendants are n't just looking for germs , though . according to sjaak schulteis , who worked for lufthansa for 30 years , flight attendants are also on the lookout for passengers who are impaired by drugs or alcohol . `` if a guest coming aboard is drunk or intoxicated by any drug , it can happen that he or she is not allowed to enter the plane , '' wrote schulteis . `` the first impression is often the right one , and we do refuse passengers who might be a danger for the safety of that flight . '' ",
        "if a problem passenger does make it onboard , the flight attendants might need back-up -- and they might turn to a passenger for assistance . when passengers board , the crew might be looking for someone who can help them in a pinch . `` if i see someone who is muscular , powerful , strong , physically fit , i memorize his/her face and make a mental note of where they are sitting , '' wrote janice bridger , a flight attendant of 27 years . `` i consider this person a resource for me . '' flight attendants also keep their eyes open for airline employees who may be off-the-clock , but can jump in to help in a pinch . ",
        "`` they know how to handle the situations as well as i , and are trained to become an instant ` team member , ' fitting right in immediately if needed , '' wrote bridger . if you 're thinking that this sounds like a lot of work for a flight attendant , you 're right . bridger wrote , `` when you consider that i have approximately 3-4 seconds to make that passenger feel welcomed and comfortable , and then also assess them for all of the potential that they bring with them onto the plane ... well , it can require a lot of focus . '' ",
        "all the more reason to be extra polite to your flight attendants when you travel .   "
