        "there 's no waiting in chicago , as the bears are in relentless pursuit of their next head coach . while they have n't narrowed down their list , they 've been on the prowl for offensive coordinators around the league . well , that theme wo n't stop now , as the bears will try to interview vikings ' offensive coordinator pat shurmur . bears have sent for permission to interview patriots oc josh mcdaniels and vikings oc pat shurmur for their hc job . -- albert breer january 2 , 2018 . although shurmur is n't as big of a name as josh mcdaniels , he 's done wonders with minnesota . ",
        "even after losing sam bradford and dalvin cook , shurmur has commanded a unit that is 10th in scoring and 11th in total yards . not only would he fit the mold for chicago , but he also has complete intel over the minnesota vikings . however , if the bears do want pat shurmur as their next head coach they might have to battle a division rival for him . the #lions have requested permission to interview pat shurmur for their head coach job , source said . -- tom pelissero january 1 , 2018 . with the progression of mitchell trubisky being the bears ' top priority , hiring an offensive genius would be huge for chicago . ",
        "considering all the success that case keenum has had with pat shurmur , perhaps he could do the same with trubisky . it looks like the coaching market is swirling in the windy city .   "
