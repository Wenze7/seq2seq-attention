        "over the course of my time here on earth , it would seem that my observations on myself and of others , when it comes to insecurities a lot of the time lead back to one tiny , but significant obstacle - comparison . now actually thinking about it , when was the last time you compared yourself to another person or even compared your life or circumstance to another 's ? if you 're truthful to yourself , the answer will probably be , not that long ago , and i mean who can blame you ! every single day we are bombarded with messages being sent directly to our brains on how we should look , think , act , what we should be wearing , the type of language we should be using , that it becomes near enough impossible for us to feel accepted or ` normal ' if you are n't following the latest trend , and in this day and age it would seem , that can be anything ! ",
        "there is a dark side to constant comparison , because sometimes there comes a time when we as people want more , and it 's so easy to feel secluded , left out and shunned if you step out of the box that 's been made for us all and wish for something different . it would seem that as time goes on , its not the fashion or trend to just be - yourself ! and it seems that it 's becoming easier to get labeled ` wrong ' if we choose another way . are we forgetting the importance of our own joy and path ? ",
        "are we missing the vital ingredients of the makeup of our whole existence ? are we teaching the next generation to come that the only choice left is to become a robot ? by us molding into one ourselves . 1 comparison kidknaps joy • when comparing , understand where it comes from and replace the fearful thought with a more empowered one . 2 just do you • become comfortable enough with yourself and focus on all the wonderful things that make you , as a person . 3 learn to look inward • try not to concentrate so hard on others . ",
        "learn to be able to take a compliment that is about who you really are inside , and give out more compliments helping others authentic glow flourish . look inside yourself and start to feel proud about flaunting your soul 's best assets , because no one can do you , better than you ! 4 catch the comparisons • when finding yourself comparing , learn to identify where the comparison is coming from and begin to identify any unhealthy patterns and find a new way of replacing those thoughts . a comparison is made up of fear , a fear that we are n't good enough , and that we cant meet the standards that society places on us . ",
        "by bowing down to what others think we should do , and live our lives , we should n't be bowing down to fear , we are so much more than that ! if only we stopped looking around so much , and looked within we would find so much more to be happy with , than what we need to change . thank you so much for reading , keep striving for greatness ! peace , love & light and a very happy new year , embracing the power of you ! ri x .
