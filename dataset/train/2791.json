        "hi , i 'm currently with an amazing person but we had a huge fight 3 days ago and i have n't talked to him since . i 'm in italy for an educational program , after a month i 'll go back home to la where my boyfriend is . now here 's the issue : he has a friend who is female which i 'm tottally okay with but they are really flirty around each other but i still trust him . so couple days ago i open snapchat and click on her story and see them both lying on his bed cuddling . ",
        "he does n't have a shirt on and she is wearing his clothes and they are in his bed and his head is on her shoulder with his eyes closed and she is smiling to the camera for the pic and she actually posted that . i do n't wan na judge but i think she posted it only to make me jealous . anyway i was furious so i called him the other day and we had a huge fight about it . he said that he was really sorry but did n't see this as any kind of cheating and he told me that he did n't even think he had done anything wrong but he still apologized saying that he is sorry for breaking my heart but i was so angry i was yelling at him and hang up on his face and rejected all his calls and texts since that fight . ",
        "note that he does love me , we have a very passionate relationship , the thing is he does n't even like cuddling , i do n't get it how he can do something that he hates and does n't do it with me even though i love it and does it with another girl , i think this is emotionally cheating although i never told him that i think it 's cheating . am i overreacting ? i truly love him and most of the time he is a very respectful , kind and lovely person . i do n't know what to do , i ca n't even imagine breaking up with him but i 'm just sooo mad and hurt it 's crazy , also note that he has severe adhd . ",
        "though i do n't know if that would make any difference in this situation . sorry for writing so long but please help ! thank you .   "
