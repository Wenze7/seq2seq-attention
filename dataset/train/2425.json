        "images from space show the differences in terrain from nov. . 23 , 2017 to jan. . 10 , 2018 . nasa has released a pair of images that show the scope of disaster from the thomas fire and tuesday 's mudslides in montecito , california . the animated image , seen above , shows the landscape before it was altered by the two disasters . in the first image , taken nov. . 23 , 2017 , the hills north of montecito have vegetation , and streams are flowing normally . but in the second image , captured wednesday after the mudslides swept homes off their foundations and killed more than a dozen people , the impacts of both the wildfire and the flooding can clearly be seen . ",
        "the hills are charred and brown , and the streams that carry water to the ocean are swollen . the thomas fire , sparked dec. . 4 in santa barbara county , scorched the land and burned away vegetation as it quickly grew to become the largest wildfire in modern california history . by the time it was fully contained earlier this week , it had destroyed more than 440 square miles of land and was responsible for the deaths of two people . with no vegetation to hold back the land , tuesday 's heavy rainfall triggered mudslides and debris flows that rushed into neighborhoods and overtook houses . ",
        "hundreds of homes were either damaged or destroyed and several people remain missing . the images used to compare the scene before and after the two disasters were captured by nasa 's operational land imager on landsat 8 , according to nasa .   "
