        "it has always been an unwritten courtesy to flash your lights when there is a traffic officer up ahead . but , should you do so ? now , the more contemporary way is to post it on social media . last year , 747 drivers were charged with being over the limit on auckland 's north shore . but this number does not include the drunk drivers on the road who were not caught . the ethics , or not , of using social media to alert others of where police stops are , was put to members of the beach haven and birkdale community facebook page . ",
        "in a heated comment thread , the score was 31 to 7 - in favour of `` unethical '' . read more : * road toll approaches 2016 total as more killed on nz roads `` if you need to dodge the cops at christmas time , you should n't be on the road and you deserve to be caught , '' said hera lynn donaldson . jodie murrell said she would rather see drivers get caught than have them on the road . `` i went through a police stop last week , breath testing . the guy in front of me blew over the limit got asked to pull over . ",
        "it was only 12.30 pm in browns bay . i do not want to be part of a statistic thanks . '' with the arrival of summer and the festive season , more police are on the road , and using social media to dodge the checkpoints is a rising trend . in fact , there are facebook groups dedicated entirely to that , describing police checkpoints as `` revenue gathering '' . one page has 18,000 followers . wade freeman agrees , saying the beach haven community gets `` picked on '' and most police stops are set up for wof and registration checks , which is revenue gathering . ",
        "inspector peter mckennie said police checkpoints are based on risk and are operated in a range of locations . there is a focus on detection `` anywhere , any time '' to remove drunk , drugged and dangerous drivers , mckennie said . `` anyone who encourages someone who may be drunk or drugged behind the wheel to avoid police detection needs to think long and hard about how they would feel if that person then went on to kill or maim someone in their family or one of their friends , '' he said . the message from the police is that there is a 100 per cent certain way of avoiding the negative consequences of a checkpoint : do n't drink and drive .
