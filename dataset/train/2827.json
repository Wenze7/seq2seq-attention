        "the first beta for metal gear survive starts tomorrow , but before it begins , more information on what to expect and tips for survival have been shared by konami . jan. . 18 marks the start of the beta that 'll last from then until jan. . 22 where players will have to build up their defenses and fend off zombie-like enemies in a bleak wasteland of an environment . you wo n't have to go it alone either since players will be able to join up with friends in some four-player co-op combat . the beta includes several missions and maps to play on with defending a wormhole digger from waves of enemies being one of the assignments players must complete . ",
        "before the beta begins and players are dropped into a completely new metal gear experience , konami published an article on the playstation blog that offers a few helpful tips to get you started . the first of which introduces what 's called the `` staging area , '' a pre-game environment where players can test weapons , craft items , and otherwise get a grasp on the game 's various mechanics before starting a match . once you begin the actual game , you 'll have a bit of free time at the beginning to utilize these skills you practiced in the staging area . ",
        "explore , gather resources , and get ready for the waves while carefully managing your resources . `` you 'll have some `` free '' time at the start and between waves , making these the ideal times to go looking for precious pieces of wood , iron , and other important bits , '' konami said . `` remember , break everything that can be broken and gather away . just keep an eye on your weight ! `` those that have played horde defense games will already know the importance of managing resources and building defenses in appropriate locations , and that skill is no different in metal gear survive . ",
        "helpful arrows will indicate where the enemies will attempt to make their way to your wormhole digger , so building appropriately can help block their paths . working with your buddies to complete all of these tasks will also make everything much easier , and if you ever find yourself with some downtime , refer back to tip no . 2 about exploring and gathering resources . the beta for metal gear survive begins on jan. . 18 , and the game is scheduled to release on feb. . 20 .
