        "melbourne , australia -- the last american man standing at the australian open is through to the quarterfinals . tennys sandgren , who had never won a grand slam match or beaten a top 10 player before the tournament started , upset no . 5-seeded dominic thiem on monday to top his second-round victory over 2014 champion stan wawrinka . the 26-year-old sandgren , who entered the season 's opening major ranked 97th , missed a match point in the fourth set but held on for a 6-2 , 4-6 , 7-6 , 6-7 , 6-3 win over thiem . ",
        "`` i 'm staying calm and not getting too upset , not getting too up , not getting too down , '' sandgren said when asked how a player with only two atp tour match victories kept believing he had what it takes to advance to a grand slam quarterfinal . `` i 've been able to keep my emotions under control , which is a big deal because i can be an emotional person . that does n't go well with tennis , especially with a three-out-of-five-set match . you do n't have energy to waste on emotions . ",
        "`` he is only the second man in the last 20 years to reach the quarterfinals in his australian open debut -- alexandr dolgopolov did it in 2011 . before that it was nicolas escude in 1998 . most of his sandgren 's other grand slam appearances have been forgettable -- first-round losses as a wild-card entry at last year 's french open and u. s. open . the tennessean failed to qualify for a major in 13 attempts , including from 2013 to 2016 at melbourne park . even his build-up for melbourne was brief : first-round losses in india and at auckland , new zealand . ",
        "so while seeded u. s. men such as no . 8 jack sock , no . 13 sam querrey and no . 16 john isner all went out in earlier rounds , sandgren is through to the final eight . after his match , he was asked at a news conference about the nature of some of his social media tweets , suggesting he follows some accounts or retweets items from controversial right-wing sources . `` look , who you follow on twitter i feel does n't matter even a little bit , '' sandgren said . `` i think it 's crazy to assume that . ",
        "to say , ` well , he 's following x person , so he believes all the things that this person believes . ' i think it 's ridiculous . `` he was asked if he supports any far-right movements . `` no , i do n't . i do n't , '' sandgren said . `` i find some of the content interesting . but no , i do n't , not at all . as a firm christian , i do n't support things like that , no . `` in the quarterfinals on wednesday he 'll play hyeon chung , who upset six-time australian open champion novak djokovic in straight sets . ",
        "sandgren lost to chung in auckland two weeks ago , and he credited his form in that loss -- 6-3 , 5-7 , 6-3 -- with forcing improvements in his game . `` i feel like we had a tight contest , '' sandgren said . `` i feel like i had to raise my game to even compete with him on the court . i think that helped me a lot going into this week , seeing i could play a good level . that made me feel like , ` ok , maybe i can do it in three-out-of-five sets , on a bigger stage , against other players , too . ",
        "`` thiem was full of praise for sandgren . `` i did n't play bad , it was one of these days where you have to give a lot of respect to your opponent , '' thiem said . `` he served very well . i had lots of problems to return his serve . then he did n't make too many unforced errors , it was very tough for me to finish the points . he did n't really drop for almost four hours . `` for the time being , sandgren is living the dream . seriously . ",
        "`` obviously the first three matches were more than i expected , '' sandgren said . `` this one was about as hard-fought as i 've ever had a match before . i definitely had a real pinch-me moment . if i wake up now , i 'm going to be real upset . ''   "
