        "rabbi yitzhak yosef , the sephardi chief rabbi of israel , spoke out against the proposed death-penalty legislation during a weekly lecture saturday night , channel 2 reported early sunday morning . `` there is no gain , '' the rabbi said during the question-and-answer section of a weekly lecture . `` we are not the sanhedrin . if there was a situation of a jewish terrorist , killing them would be against halakha . this has nothing to do with the right and the left , it has to do with judgment . '' the knesset approved a bill that would facilitate a military court 's ability to sentence terrorists to death by a 52-49 vote last week . ",
        "the bill , sponsored by yisrael beytenu and backed by defense minister avigdor liberman , enjoys the backing of prime minister benjamin netanyahu , who called the death penalty `` justice in extreme situations . `` he cited an explanation of security officials that the death penalty does not offer much `` benefit , '' reiterating his opposition had nothing to do with political inclinations , and feared the potential repercussions of instituting the death penalty . `` let 's say there was a terrorist ... who was sentenced to death , '' he posited . `` until the verdict was carried out , there would be a great uproar in the world and jews across the world would be in danger so there is no benefit . ",
        "`` yosef , the son of rabbi ovadia yosef , explained , `` only the sanhedrin can issue a death sentencing . `` the european union was quick to denounce the move , saying it is `` opposed to the death penalty under all circumstances '' on thursday . the bill has proved to be a rift between liberman 's yisrael beytenu and united torah judaism , as utj refused to support the death-penalty bill without it being approved by rabbinical authorities while yisrael beytenu refuses to support a utj bill that seeks to curb mini-markets operations on shabbat . ",
        "israel has twice carried out executions , first in 1948 when meir tobianski was subjected to a drumhead court martial and found guilty of espionage , a false claim for which he was posthumously exonerated . the second , more infamous , occurrence came after the knesset voted by-and-large to abolish the death penalty when adolf eichmann was hanged for nazi war crimes . yisrael beytenu introduced similar legislation in 2015 that was overwhelmingly rejected 94-6 at the time . all six votes in favor came from the six yisrael beytenu members of knesset at the time . `` you want to sentence someone to death ? ",
        "only by the hands of heaven . we are not a sanhedrin , '' yosef concluded . lahav harkov and reuters contributed to this report .   "
