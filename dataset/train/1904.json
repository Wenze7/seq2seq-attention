        "china on friday rejected accusations that it has helped pyongyang skirt sanctions after us president donald trump claimed beijing had permitted a transfer of oil to north korea . `` caught red handed - very disappointed that china is allowing oil to go into north korea , '' trump tweeted on thursday . `` there will never be a friendly solution to the north korea problem if this continues to happen ! `` the us president later told the new york times that he saw a report on the situation on fox news that morning . `` the recent series of reports on this situation do not conform with the facts '' , chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying said , adding that beijing did not allow its `` citizens or companies to engage in any activities that violate '' un resolutions . ",
        "the united nations and washington have imposed a series of sanctions against north korea over its nuclear and missile programme in recent months . hua said china had looked into the report of a chinese ship transferring oil to a north korean vessel and found it to be inaccurate . `` there is no record of the vessel visiting a chinese port '' since august , hua said . `` i think making pointless hype through the media is not conducive to enhancing mutual trust and cooperation .
