        "enforcement of the city 's pooper scooper law is pretty crappy . the number of violations issued to dog owners who fail to pick up after their pooches has plummeted . the nypd issued 360 violations in 2016 , down 45 percent from 2012 . and only 137 violations were doled out in the first half of 2017 . meanwhile , the sanitation department , despite sending out undercover investigators , slapped only eight manhattan dog walkers with summonses for `` failure to remove canine waste '' in the 2017 fiscal year , according to sanitation department statistics . citywide , the total number of sanitation violations hit 159 in 2017 , up from 99 issued a year earlier , which was a five-year low . ",
        "but the larger number was thanks mostly to the 124 summonses issued in the bronx . the violation comes with a $ 250 fine . despite the paltry pile of poop tickets , new yorkers complained by the thousands last year about dogs fouling their sidewalks . the city 's 311 hotline received 2,472 complaints , up from 2,442 a year earlier . the most complaints -- 697 -- came from the bronx . mayor de blasio has admitted there is a canine crime spree . `` there 's too many people who do n't clean up after their dogs . ",
        "it 's really insensitive and unfair to other new yorkers , '' de blasio said in response to a caller griping about lax oversight on wnyc radio in may . new york became a national model when state lawmakers passed the pooper-scooper law , which took effect in 1978 . the $ 100 fine was considered a hefty sum at the time . when the first sign warning dog owners to clean up was erected on 68th street and central park west , it attracted worldwide media attention . concerns about the law 's enforcement were raised even before the first pet owners stooped to scoop . ",
        "mayor ed koch was said to have wanted the law to include a provision that dog walkers carry a clean-up device with them . instead , dog owners became used to carrying plastic bags . and the city department of transportation decided a few years ago that the pooper-scooper signs had passed their prime and removed more than 1,000 from city streets . but law-breaking dog owners still abound . `` ed koch has got to be rolling in his grave , which will likely be covered soon with you-know-what , '' an upper west side resident commented last month on the west side rag blog . ",
        "`` we are as aggressive as we can be given the millions of dogs that there are in the city of new york , '' said vito turso , a sanitation department spokesman .   "
