        "jan 04 -- sergio aguero will not be allowed to run down the remaining two years of his contract , according to manchester city insiders . the argentina international stated earlier this week he wishes to remain at the etihad despite a growing feeling in his camp that he is not fully-appreciated by boss pep guardiola . aguero notched his 13th goal of the campaign in tuesday night 's 3-1 home victory over watford and is presently the citizens ' only fit striker , with gabriel jesus ' medial knee ligament injury set to keep him sidelined for up to six weeks . ",
        "that situation may change if city now cede to guardiola 's wishes and launch a renewed bid this month for arsenal forward alexis sanchez , thought to be another issue of consideration for aguero . the 29-year-old is contracted until 2020 and city know the player dreams of returning at the end of it to play once again for his boyhood team independiente . one issue for the manchester giants , however , is the south american outfit can only help him realise that ambition if he is able to run down the final two years of his agreement - which means something might now have to give this summer . ",
        "` kun ' long ago attained legendary city status and earlier this term also became the club 's all-time record goalscorer but the executives are n't prepared to write off his present market value , which they put at around Â£ 60m .   "
