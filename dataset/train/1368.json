        "another day in london has left me feeling like i never left , that i have n't changed . everyday , i will attempt to create a professional , articulate , hilarious and modern take on my day of thought or action . inspired by casey neistat who created a vlog everyday for 450 straight days . i will call it : 365methoughtsto find the acronyms that are at the top , go to my instagram page everyday and see what the images are and see if you can figure it out ... pennyboarding in austin , txsomething is wrong .

        "i miss austin , everyday . but , i feel like i have n't left the great british capital . i visited london for the second time this week . i used the same railway stations , visited the same sights and acted as the same londoner i had always been . today 's trip to the city exemplified this very paradox . it 's interesting because i have a tendency to want to be very busy . in my mind , if i 'm busy -- i 'm active . if my mind is active and healthy , it has the best possibility to create ideas and practices that can benefit the world . ",
        "i had a busy day ahead . one meeting and then i met some old aquaintances . the meeting was a success and saw me take in the vistas of south west london . later i travelled to qmul campus in mile end . i ca n't say that i missed mile end as a place but the vibe of dixie 's chicken and mile end road brought some memories of the previous year to the forefront . i think the reason for today 's post being on the topic presented is because i got to see my old friends again . ",
        "i left them at ut in austin three weeks ago with the knowledge that they would be studying abroad at my university in london . today was the day i met them again . leah and zeke were amazing to me in austin , they helped with transport and local directional information as well as being great friends too . to see them today made me miss austin a lot . this is where i 'm at an impasse , because i missed austin but while the memories have been pushed to the back of my memory -- london seems like it has been the home i 've always known . ",
        "this sense of place and belonging i think might stem from an afterthought about study abroad . it 's intriguing to have these thoughts because they are solely unique to my experience . i also met and dined with some of my closest friends from qmul . what makes them so amazing is that , even after 5 months and in inaz 's case since june 2017 , they still are there to talk to . they still are my friends . the two people pictured above maintained conversation across many timezones whilst i was away . it was quite extraordinary to have a piece of home in my pocket .
