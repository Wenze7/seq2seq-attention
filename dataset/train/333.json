        "by : dustin webber , cto , critical stackit 's been a big month for us over at critical stack . you may know a little bit about who we are , and perhaps you 've even taken advantage of our intel marketplace to access critical intelligence for the bro security monitoring platform . with this marketplace , we have helped thousands of organizations in more than 60 countries detect network abusers and intruders in real-time . but you want to know a secret ? we were just starting to have fun . we 're real nerds for security , to the point where we like to create products and put them out into the world , just to see what people think . ",
        "but we are n't just playing around over here . behind the scenes , over the last three years , we 've been cooking up something big . we 'll be sharing more details about this in the coming months , but in the meantime , we wanted to peel back the curtain and give you a peek . who we areso , who is behind critical stack ? the team here has been hand-picked for a very specific mission . we 're super-proud of the people here , many of whom are world experts on their particular areas of interest . ",
        "most of us have spent our entire careers in reactive security , and this is a project we 're all beyond excited to unveil . you can learn more about our team here , and we 'll be sharing some team member spotlights in the coming months so you can get to know us a little better . the origin storyso how exactly did critical stack come into being ? it all started back in the summer of 2014 , when liam randall and i co-founded critical stack with one goal in mind : to securely orchestrate network security stacks . ",
        "first , we launched the intel marketplace as a free source of threat intelligence , parsed and delivered by the critical stack team , crafted around the bro network security monitoring platform . alongside the intel marketplace , liam and i began consulting with a wide variety of organizations on deploying bro sensors . as we worked with more and more organizations , the repetitive steps involved sparked an idea . what if it were possible to completely automate enterprise infrastructure deployments in a more secure manner ? while the intel marketplace took off in its own right , the critical stack team began to approach the challenge of enterprise infrastructure automation . ",
        "as our work proceeded , we began to pitch the concept to large organizations , including a bank you might recognize : capital one . when we first pitched critical stack to capital one , we posed this question : `` why ca n't a bank use containers -- as long as they 're secure ? '' capital one was already making the move to standardize on microservices and containerization in the cloud , so it was a natural fit . critical stack + capital one : a match made in container heavenas you may know , capital one is not just any bank . ",
        "they have taken a global leadership role when it comes to technology . we at critical stack saw them as a perfect company to model the benefits of secure infrastructure automation . capital one was intrigued , but not just by the idea of using critical stack 's technology for themselves . they saw an opportunity to invest in what we are building at critical stack and help us bring it to a wider audience . in fact , they decided to purchase us , and we joined the capital one family in 2016 and in november of this year announced the launch of critical stack to beta . ",
        "why critical stack ? why now ? it 's no secret that organizations big and small are making the leap to cloud infrastructure today . many are all-in , and those who are n't are scrambling to keep up because of all the benefits it offers , from scalability and flexibility to dramatic cost savings and increased speed of deployment . but many enterprises , especially those in regulated industries , have significant security and compliance considerations as they look to scale in the cloud . today , it 's possible to scale your infrastructure at the click of a button -- but if it 's not secure , what 's the point ? ",
        "this is exactly why critical stack is poised to transform the cloud infrastructure market , especially for large enterprises . our goal ? help enterprises automate infrastructure deployments in the cloud , without sacrificing security , compliance , or simplicity . resilience is our keyword . if you ca n't compromise assets upstream , then there is far less work to do downstream . so much of what we see happening in security today looks like sloppy farming . the cows are already out of the barn , and folks are scrambling to catch them . we want to build a more secure barn and make sure the cows do n't get out in the first place . ",
        "sound exciting ? we want to share this journey with you . you can follow along here , on our blog , or you can sign up for our newsletter . we wo n't send you daily or even weekly emails , but we 'll ping you with : ● fresh news and company updates ● actionable tips you can apply to your organization ● questions about what your needs look like and how we can better serve youit 's our goal to transform how enterprises think about infrastructure , and we 'd love for you to join us on the journey .
