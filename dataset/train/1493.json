        "mike blake / reutersmaroney after winning silver in the women 's vault during the london 2012 olympic games on august 5 , 2012 . usa gymnastics said wednesday it will not seek to penalize olympic gymnast mckayla maroney for breaking a confidentiality agreement to speak out against former team doctor larry nassar , an admitted sexual predator whose sentencing hearing began this week . the organization `` will not seek any money '' from maroney if she speaks in court during nassar 's hearing , usa gymnastics spokeswoman leslie king told huffpost in a statement wednesday . a 2016 confidentiality agreement with usa gymnastics exposes maroney to fines if she publicly speaks about nassar 's abuse . ",
        "`` usa gymnastics has not sought and will not seek any money from mckayla maroney for her brave statements made in describing her victimization and abuse by larry nassar , nor for any victim impact statements she wants to make to larry nassar at this hearing or at any subsequent hearings related to his sentencing , '' king said . `` this has been her right and usa gymnastics encourages mckayla and anyone who has been abused to speak out . usa gymnastics remains focused on our highest priority -- the safety , health and well-being of our athletes and creating a culture that empowers and supports them . ",
        "`` maroney tweeted in october that nassar began abusing her when she was 13 under the guise of medical treatment . more than 140 women have now accused nassar of serial sexual abuse , including olympians gabby douglas , aly raisman and , this week , simone biles . a sentencing hearing for nassar began this week on 10 counts of first-degree sexual misconduct . the hearing is set to feature impact statements from 98 victims and family members . nassar is already serving a 60-year sentence on child pornography charges . maroney signed a confidentiality agreement with usa gymnastics in december 2016 as part of a $ 1.25 million settlement that requires her to keep her allegations against nassar quiet . ",
        "her tweet , as well as an impact statement at nassar 's sentencing , potentially violate the agreement . model chrissy teigen stepped forward on tuesday , tweeting that she would be `` absolutely honored '' to pay any fines maroney faces for speaking out against nassar . maroney , in a statement through her attorneys , said she was overwhelmed by the offer . `` i 'm shocked by your generosity , and i just want you to know how much hope your words bring to all of us ! '' maroney said . `` i just ca n't get over the fact that someone i do n't personally know is sticking up for me , let alone a strong woman that i 've looked up to for years . ",
