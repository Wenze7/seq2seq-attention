        "tonya harding got into a heated discussion with piers morgan in the monday , january 8 episode of `` good morning britain '' , to the point the former olympic figure skater threatened to leave the interview . it all came down after the host accused tonya of playing the victim when the real victim was nancy kerrigan . the interview got intense when tonya felt that piers kept interrupting her . `` you were n't letting me finish ! '' she said . `` i respect you for trying to ask these question . i 'm here to talk about the future and what it means . '' ",
        "`` my movie is going to help so many people , that it is ok to ask for help , '' she continued . `` so , that 's why i 'm here . '' `` maybe it suits you to play the victim , '' said piers . `` but i think the victim in all of this was n't you . it was nancy kerrigan who had her olympic dream shattered quite literally in her legs . '' tonya , who has been doing several interviews following the release of `` i , tonya '' movie , responded , `` thank you so much . ",
        "i appreciate being on your show , but i think i 'm going to have to say have a good night . '' when asked about why she wanted to end the interview , tonya said , `` i think that many people are the victims of abuse every single day and ca n't stand up for themselves . people need to be able to understand that we need to stand united and that abuse should not be happening anymore . we all know this . '' when piers said it was nancy who suffered the abuse , tonya agreed . ",
        "she shared , `` yes , she was . '' however , tonya insisted that `` you also have to realize that there 's a lot of things going on . people do n't seem to understand what i was going through , so that 's why i decided to do this movie . '' piers seemingly did n't want to let tonya get away without giving a straight answer as he asked if tonya knew anything about the attack on nancy back in 1994 at the u. s. figure skating championships in detroit . `` no , i did not ! '' ",
        "tonya yelled . `` you did n't have any knowledge at all , it was pure coincidence ? '' piers continued . tonya responded , `` no , i did not know anything prior . i did find out after the fact . '' tonya , however , revealed to `` good morning america '' that she did overhear her ex-husband jeff gillooly and his accomplice shawn eckhart 's plan to attack someone . `` i did , however , overhear them talking about stuff where , ` well , maybe we should take somebody out so we can make sure she gets on the team , ' '' harding told amy robach in a sneak peek of the interview which was released on tuesday , january 9 . ",
        "tonya went on saying , `` and i remember telling them , ` what the hell are you talking about ? i can skate . ' ''   "
