        "lando norris believes he can race for mclaren in f1 next season if the team need him after being promoted to reserve driver . the british driver has been named mclaren 's third and reserve driver for 2018 following jenson button 's departure , and he will now provide support to first choice pair fernando alonso and stoffel vandoorne . norris has been testing in an f1 car for the first time in hungary and abu dhabi recently and , while he knows he has much to learn , the 18-year-old believes he has already proved he can handle the step up and would be able to race if necessary for mclaren next year . ",
        "`` i really enjoyed the hungary test , it was the first time i 've got to drive a formula 1 car , '' he said . `` it was a big step up from formula 3 , of course , so it took me a bit of time to get used to . but the adrenaline and the rush you get from driving in formula 1 is huge . i enjoyed it a lot . `` of course it 's difficult to say after just doing two test days in formula 1 , but they both went very well . ",
        "i did what i had to , and gave me some more confidence to know that if i did have to go into a race next season , it might not be quite as good as fernando , but i would say i 'm not too far off . ''   "
