        "its a wonderful life is a very heartwarming movie . it was released in 1946 , however , it continues to be a very popular and beloved movie because the overall message of the film is timeless ; it 's a very valuable lesson that everyone can relate to . the film is often played during the holiday season because it stresses the importance of not taking family and friends for granted . it makes you want to celebrate life and feel thankful for everything you have , which is what the holiday season is about . the person we can thank for bringing this movie to life was director frank capra . ",
        "its a wonderful life was his first film since his service in the war , however , the time he took off from film did not effect his movie making abilities . one beloved element that capra always showcases in all of his films is the characters and the relationships they have with each other . this film did just that by highlighting how the main character , george bailey , changed his friends and families lives for the better . as a result of a this storyline , it was important that the cinematography was n't so over the top . ",
        "having a lot of jump cuts and fancy camera work would make the scene look unnatural and would distract the viewer from the deeper meaning of the film . the main plot of the film is of george and clarence going through scenes of georges life , therefore , as viewers , we should feel like we are looking from above at georges life -- almost like we are in the scene with the characters . production took this into account which made the overall watching of the film more enjoyable , real , and easy to follow along . ",
        "another element that led to the success of the films was the casting of the characters . the actors and actresses fit their characters so well . donna reed was a perfect choice to play mary bailey because she showcases the classic all american wife in the 1950s . she played the role of her character in a natural way that made the film more believable and real . this can also be said for all the other characters in the film . the plot of this film pulls at your heart strings and will definitely make you tear up in the audience . ",
        "this is because the lesson learned from the film is one everyone can relate to . george bailey has lived in bedford falls his whole life . there , he works for a loan business founded by his father . he is married to his wife , mary , and has three kids . on christmas eve , his business loses $ 8,000 that they owe to the bank . george realizes that he could be sent to jail and his company could be shutdown . the stress becomes too much for george and he wishes he 'd never been born . ",
        "meanwhile , all of george 's family and friends have noticed how much the stress has taken a tole on george . out of their love for george , they pray for things to get better for him . george 's guardian angel , clarence , comes to george and shows him what the world would 've been like if he 'd never been born . clarence takes george back in time through old memories of his past . george realizes that he truly does have a wonderful life because of his friends and family in it . this plot is a great message for everyone to think about whenever they feel sad or depressed . ",
        "it shows that everyone 's life is special and `` no man is a failure who has friends . '' the stresses of our daily lives can mask all of the good and joy that we can easily forget . it 's easy to take the things we are used to and see everyday like , our family , friends , and community for granted . this film reminds us to not take these things for granted , which is perfect for the holiday season . one film/novel this movie is similar to is a christmas carol . coincidentally , both of these films are popular during the holiday season . ",
        "this is because they both share a similar message that is important to remember during the holiday season . in both of the plots , the main character is visited by a magical being that transports him throughout his life . the main character sees that he has developed happy relationship with people throughout his life and he should n't just throw that away .
