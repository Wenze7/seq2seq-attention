        "guillermo del toro 's fantasy romance `` the shape of water '' took home best movie at the producers guild awards on saturday , putting it in pole position for oscars glory in march . the movie bested leading academy awards contenders including `` call me by your name , '' `` dunkirk , '' `` get out , '' `` i , tonya '' and `` lady bird . `` in a crowded field , it also saw off `` the big sick , '' `` molly 's game , '' `` the post , '' `` three billboards outside ebbing , missouri , '' and `` wonder woman . ",
        "`` the 1960s-set fairytale about a mute government laboratory janitor falling in love with a merman-like creature won best director for del toro at the golden globes , considered a dry-run for the oscars . it also has 12 nominations for february 's baftas , britain 's version of the oscars , and is expected to do well when nominees for the actual academy awards are announced on tuesday . the 53-year-old filmmaker , who co-produced alongside j. miles dale , was not there to pick up his trophy due to having gone to his sick father 's bedside in mexico . ",
        "in one of the ceremony 's highlights , `` get out '' director and producer jordan peele was recognized for making a film that raises awareness of social issues and talked about `` the sunken place , '' the term used for the hypnotic , brainwashed state that traps victims in his movie . `` the sunken place is the system that silences the voice of women , minorities , and of other people , '' he said in politically charged speech condemning president donald trump for derogatory comments about haiti , africa and black football stars kneeling during the national anthem . ",
        "`` every day there is proof that we are in the sunken place , '' he added . `` coco '' -- pixar 's love letter to mexico based on the country 's day of the dead festival -- won best animated picture , the first prize of the night handed out at the beverly hilton . `` now is the time for more diversity in our culture and in our world , '' said producer darla k. anderson , dedicating the award to the people of mexico . in the tv section , hulu 's `` the handmaid 's tale '' won best television drama , while fellow internet streaming service amazon bagged best episodic comedy for `` the marvelous mrs. maisel . '' ",
        "`` the handmaid 's tale , '' based on margaret atwood 's dystopian 1985 novel of the same name , has been the darling of recent awards ceremonies , winning eight emmys and two golden globes . the pga has boasted a solid record of giving top honors to movies that go on to earn best picture honors at the oscars . the trend has been bucked somewhat recently , however , with last year 's best film award going to `` la la land , '' which lost out to `` moonlight '' at the oscars . financial crisis comedy `` the big short '' took the top prize at 2016 's pgas , but lost out to `` spotlight '' for the academy award . ",
        "the oscars ceremony is staged on march 4 , hosted by late night funnyman jimmy kimmel .   "
