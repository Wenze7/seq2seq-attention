        "an attorney for president donald trump 's transition team said he did not confront special counsel robert mueller or the general services administration before complaining about them in a letter to congress , which was then leaked to fox news . the attorney said the transition team 's lawyers `` will take up our issues with the special counsel 's office and the gsa in due course . `` legal experts said the move seemed like an attempt to feed calls to fire or discredit mueller . an attorney for president donald trump 's transition team said on sunday he had n't directly confronted special counsel robert mueller or the general services administration , despite alleging in a letter to congress that they engaged in inappropriate behavior . ",
        "the attorney , kory langhofer , accused mueller in the letter -- which was provided to fox news on saturday -- of violating trump for america employees ' fourth amendment rights by obtaining emails hosted on gsa servers without first informing the transition team lawyers . asked why he wrote the letter to congress rather than to mueller and the gsa , langhofer replied : `` congress needs to make sure this never happens again . we 'll take up our issues with the special counsel 's office and the gsa in due course . `` trump for america plans to ask mueller in a letter to return `` thousands of emails '' it says are privileged , axios reported on sunday . ",
        "but langhofer said the organization 's request to congress `` concerns legislation that would prevent abuses in the future . we 're not asking them to intervene in the mueller matter ; that 's obviously not their job . `` former federal prosecutor renato mariotti said the letter , and the fact that it was sent to congress rather than to mueller , looked like a pr stunt . `` instead of sending a letter to mueller , the attorneys sent a letter to congress , '' he wrote on saturday . `` why ? probably to try to feed the growing effort to fire mueller and/or try to discredit him to congressional republicans . ",
        "`` a republican aide to the house oversight and government reform committee -- which received the letter from langhofer along with the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee -- told the washington post on sunday that the issues raised by langhofer would be taken `` under advisement . `` langhofer claimed in his letter that the trump transition team 's emails were private property and in , some cases , contained privileged communications . by going around the team 's lawyers and obtaining the emails from the gsa directly , he argued , mueller had bypassed the process by which emails would be vetted before being handed over to the special counsel . ",
        "`` career gsa staff , working with mr. loewentritt and at the direction of the fbi , immediately produced all the materials requested by the special counsel 's office -- and without notifying tfa or filtering or redacting privileged material , '' langhofer wrote . many legal experts were quick to push back against that argument , claiming that the trump transition team 's use of . gov email addresses -- which were hosted on gsa 's servers -- meant they should not have had any reasonable expectation of privacy . `` this is not a problem , '' said former federal prosecutor jeffrey cramer . ",
        "`` the server owner , in this case gsa , properly has the emails and can turn them over if there was a subpoena or court order , '' in the same way that internet providers and banks can provide emails and records about clients to law enforcement . the trump transition team signed a memorandum of understanding with the gsa that was obtained by the legal watchdog group american oversight in response to a freedom of information act request . it is not clear whether that was the only agreement tfa employees signed -- a top gsa attorney , lenny loewentritt , told buzzfeed on saturday that anyone using gsa materials during the transition had to sign a series of agreements , including some that stipulated the devices could be monitored . ",
        "`` therefore , no expectation of privacy can be assumed , '' loewentritt told buzzfeed . a lawyer involved with the transition team 's complaints said `` the wording of the disclaimers at issue is contradictory and equivocal , '' but told business insider in a text message he did not have the disclaimer language on hand `` at the moment . `` the lawyer , who requested anonymity to discuss the organization 's legal arguments , claimed that the transition team 's `` individual expectations '' or privacy do not apply because they `` are different from tfa 's organizational/leadership expectations , which are separately protected . ",
        "`` he added that , in any case , `` the subsequent statements from the gsa 's general counsel supersede any questions about privacy that existed when the records were created , at least for tfa as an organization . `` according to langhofer , former gsa general counsel richard beckler told the transition team that it `` owned and controlled '' all of its emails , and that any requests for transition team records would be routed through the campaign 's legal representative . beckler was hospitalized in august and has since died . but loewentritt , the gsa attorney , told buzzfeed that beckler `` never made that commitment .
