        "belgian prime minister charles michel said yesterday he would seek eu help to settle a row over his country 's deportation of sudanese who were allegedly tortured on their return home . michel 's coalition government has faced an uproar since his immigration minister theo francken invited officials from khartoum in september to identify sudanese migrants and then deported around a dozen of them . `` i will undertake initiatives at the european level to trigger debate on this subject . this appears fundamental for the future , '' michel told the belgian parliament . last month , his government suspended the expulsion of sudanese without proper documents to allow officials to complete a probe into allegations several deportees were tortured . ",
        "under international law , countries are required to grant asylum to people who can prove they risk persecution if they are sent back to their home countries . the debate has surged across the european union in the last three years as it has been gripped with the worst migration crisis since world war ii . belgium 's centre-right coalition government , which includes flemish separatists like francken , has faced accusations from the opposition and human rights groups of collaborating with a dictatorship , the government of sudanese president omar al-bashir . bashir is wanted by the international criminal court on charges of genocide and war crimes related to the conflict . ",
        "he denies the charges . fueling the outrage is testimony compiled by the tahrir institute for middle east policy , which alleged several sudanese were tortured upon their return to sudan . the four parties making up the belgian coalition have rallied behind francken while the opposition has demanded his resignation and accused michel of being hostage to the n-va flemish separatists . michel , a french-speaking wallon from the liberal party , said he would like the eu to debate article three of the european convention of human rights , which protects people from torture or degrading and inhumane treatment or punishment . ",
        "lawyers have used the article to win belgian court decisions against their expulsion .   "
