        "-- when the european union 's new mifid ii market rules kick in on jan. . 3 , some firms will be temporarily unable to provide services across borders within the bloc . seventeen of the 28 eu countries are still racing to convert the revised markets in financial instruments directive into national law or regulations . until they do , investment firms in those countries wo n't have the right to new `` passports '' that enable cross-border business . if a country does n't have mifid ii on its books by jan. . 3 , supervisors elsewhere in the bloc `` should not be obliged to accept new passport notifications by firms authorized in the late transposing member state and wishing to provide services in that host jurisdiction for the first time , '' the european securities and markets authority said on monday . ",
        "this also applies to firms that want to expand an existing passport to new services or instruments , esma said . valdis dombrovskis , the eu commissioner in charge of financial-services policy , said earlier this month that financial markets could face `` disruptions '' caused by the late transposition of mifid ii . finland , the netherlands , portugal and spain are among the countries that have n't finished the process , according to the european commission . if needed , dombrovskis said the commission `` would be ready to mitigate the consequences together with supervisory authorities . '' ",
        "this last-minute dash adds to the uncertainty for banks and money managers as they brace for mifid ii , a sweeping rewrite of trading rules affecting stocks , bonds , derivatives and commodities . it also puts pressure on regulators across the eu to show lenience as the law comes into force . esma said on monday that firms authorized and with a valid passport under mifid i , which has been in effect for a decade , should be able to continue business as usual even if their home country is late in transposing the revised law . when services are provided without a branch , a home supervisor may be asked to reassure host authorities they are nonetheless applying the `` detailed operating conditions '' in mifid ii . ",
        "a `` stricter approach '' is warranted for firms without mifid i rights , `` taking into account that a firm is not already offering the relevant services in the host '' country , esma said . companies that provide data-reporting services throughout the eu fall under a similar restriction . `` only authorized entities in member states that have transposed the relevant provisions of mifid ii can provide data reporting services throughout the union , '' esma said . to contact the reporter on this story : alexander weber in brussels at aweber45@bloomberg . net . to contact the editors responsible for this story : patrick henry at phenry8@bloomberg .
