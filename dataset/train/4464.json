        "no . 10 ucf finished the season with a 13 -- 0 record and the only undefeated fbs team after a 34-27 peach bowl win over no . 7 auburn but college football playoff executive director bill hancock defended the knights ' rankings throughout the season . ucf was never ranked higher than 10th by the playoff committee , which is comprised of 13 current and former coaches , athletic directors and administrators . `` the selection committee respected ucf , '' hancock told espn . `` after all , they 're the group that put the knights in the peach bowl . ",
        "to qualify for the playoff , teams need to play tough schedules against good teams -- that is the way for all teams to stand out and be ranked high by the committee . ucf is an excellent team , but you still have to take into account who each team played and defeated during the regular season . '' `` the committee starts all over every year and takes a fresh approach every season , '' he added . `` it would n't be right for what 's happened in the past to affect what happens this year . ",
        "the committee respected ucf . they were ranked higher than any other team from that group . ucf was unfortunate not to be able to play georgia tech . you can what-if all day , but that certainly would 've changed ucf 's resume for sure . every game changes every resume . that certainly was n't their fault . they had a great season . '' â€¢ georgia or alabama ? setting the table for an all-sec national championship game knights head coach scott frost , who is leaving to coach at nebraska , still believes that it was an unfair process to select the semifinalists for the college football playoff . ",
        "`` it looked like a conscious effort to me to make sure that they did n't have a problem if they put us too high and a couple teams ahead of us lost , '' frost said . `` and oh , no , now we have to put them in a playoff ? but we just beat that beat two playoff teams and lost to another one by six points , and we beat them by seven . '' ucf played just one ranked opponent all season with a win over no . 20 memphis in the american athletic conference title game . ",
        "the knights may have also been hurt by the cancellation the game against georgia tech due to hurricane irma .   "
