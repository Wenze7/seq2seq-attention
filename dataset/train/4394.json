        "by noor zainab hussain and lawrence white london - goldman sachs is looking to hire about 250 staff in poland in 2018 and standard chartered is also considering the country as a possible new hub for around 500 staff , the banks said on tuesday . poland , by far the largest country in the european union 's eastern wing , has seen strong economic growth over the past decade and has proven attractive for international banks and other companies , partly due to its cheaper labor costs . a spokesman for goldman sachs said the bank would sharply increase its polish headcount to between 750 and 800 by the end of next year , up from 525 now . ",
        "the new jobs will primarily be in operations and technology , risk management , treasury and human resources - mainly ` back office ' roles which do not have to be located in more expensive locations such as london or frankfurt . standard chartered said it was looking to expand in eastern europe by setting up an office with about 500 staff , a spokesman said , adding that possible locations included the polish cities of warsaw and krakow as well as prague and budapest . the bank will make a decision on the location by the first quarter of 2018 , the spokesman added . ",
        "in september , poland announced that u. s. bank jpmorgan chase planned to hire more than 3,000 people for its new global operations center in warsaw . goldman sachs is also set to sign a lease on a new office in milan that will boost its presence in italy as britain prepares to leave the european union , sources familiar with the matter told reuters last week .
