        "wellington - new zealand dairy giant fonterra was ordered to pay french rival danone nz$ 183 million in damages friday over a botulism scare that saw baby formula yanked from shelves around the world as a precaution . the huge payout came after danone sued over the 2013 crisis , when fears about contamination in fonterra-supplied ingredients forced global formula recalls , including danone brands . the french company look legal action in the new zealand courts and at the singapore international arbitration centre , which administers un trade rules . the singapore-based tribunal ordered the payout on friday . ",
        "danone has estimated the botulism scare cost it 300 million euros in operating profit and 370 million euros in sales . it said the tribunal 's finding was necessary to hold fonterra to account for the food safety failures that led to the crisis . `` danone welcomes this arbitration decision as a guarantee that the lessons from the crisis will not be forgotten , '' it said in a statement . `` danone considers that this arbitration underscores the merit of its legal actions against fonterra , including to champion the highest standards of food safety across the industry . ",
        "`` fonterra is a grouping of about 13,000 new zealand farmers that accounts for approximately a third of the world 's dairy exports . the company said it was disappointed with the ruling , arguing it had limited liability under its supply agreement with danone . but it said the award would not affect its bottom line as provisions had already been made . `` fonterra is in a strong financial position and is able to meet the recall costs , '' chief executive theo spierings said . fonterra chairman john wilson said there was limited scope to challenge the tribunal 's decision , making an appeal `` highly unlikely '' . ",
        "danone said it was still evaluating its options regarding the separate legal action in new zealand . - dirty pipe - fonterra announced in august 2013 that tests had found whey supplied by them was potentially contaminated with botulism , which can cause paralysis or death . the suspect ingredient eventually turned out to be a non-toxic bacteria that was blamed on a dirty pipe at a north island processing plant . but it took more than three weeks to clarify the issue and in the meantime retailers had no choice but to pull potentially tainted formula from the shelves . ",
        "the scare dented new zealand 's `` clean , green '' reputation , particularly in the lucrative chinese market , where kiwi dairy was widely regarded as the gold standard . fonterra was accused of mishandling the crisis by releasing information too slowly and then giving out incomplete data when it finally went public . the then prime minister john key ordered government officials to oversee fonterra 's response and personally travelled to china to apologise for the scare . spierings admitted `` mistakes were made '' , but said fonterra had always put customer safety first and had revamped its crisis management systems . ",
        "`` while there was never any risk to the public , we have learned from this experience , '' he said . `` as a result have made improvements to our escalation , product traceability and recall processes , and incident management systems . `` spierings said the cooperative believed its liability to danone was capped at about nz$ 11 million under their supply agreement . following the announcement , it cut its forecast dividend to 35-45 cents a share for the current financial year , down from 45-55 cents . fonterra in september announced an annual net profit of nz$ 745 million , down 11 percent on the previous year .
