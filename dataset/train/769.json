        "antisocial , impatient , and lazyyou do n't have to look hard to find articles or see viral videos talking about how our smartphones or social media are ruining society . a forbes article from a few years ago discusses how facebook is set up in a way that can actually discourage healthy social interactions . the boston globe wrote an article talking about how impatient we are now that we have access to instant gratification . and it 's easy to see why older generations hold these opinions . with services like uber or even newer services like heb curbside pickup , it seems as though society does n't even work for the simple things in life .

        "i 'm not going to write from this point of view . rather , i 'm going to write from the viewpoint that all this change is really driven by the one thing we all trade on : time . commoditizing informationin the mid to late 90 's , personal computing and the internet took off in a way no one could imagine . all of a sudden everyone had access to a machine that could find information , help people publish their own ideas , and make thousands of computations every second . as a result , industries like education , libraries , and even advertising are going to have to rethink their purpose and strategy if they want to stay alive . ",
        "you can now learn hundreds of subjects at your own pace and in your own way with services like khan academy . amazon changed the way we read books after hundreds of years with the kindle and audible . with services like the ones listed above , companies have had to rethink their entire marketing strategy . before , they would advertise in easy ways that suit the company . the game has changed though since our attention is now where we save the most time getting our information . google 's adwords , facebook 's ad-targeting service , and snapchat ads have forced companies to rethink their strategy . ",
        "not just because we are numb to ads by now , but because this information has been commoditized so everyone can take advantage of these features . changing everything about our everyday livesin my grandfather 's lifetime , he has gone from computers not even existing to wearing a watch with more computing power than early computers . in my short lifetime , i 've gone from having to watch lectures and read textbooks in order to get the information i need to asking `` alexa '' or google for information and hear their response without having to move from my desk . ",
        "this is the embodiment of how commoditizing informational saved us time especially in the last decade alone . as a result of these advances and other technologies being realized through computing and software development , the way people live their daily lives is completely different than when the first smartphone came out . and with driverless cars , augmented reality , and ai in their infancy , who knows what the next 10 years will look like . but what about social media ? surely people staring at their phones all day rather than interacting face-to-face has some consequences . ",
        "maybe . sure people hide behind their screens and cyber-bully their peers occasionally , but this happened and still happens in face to face encounters . people will always find ways to take advantage of platforms and other people . but just this year we saw an act that would have never been possible without social media . after hurricane harvey , houston was devastated . all it took to bring peoples ' hopes up and inspire a nation however was for one man to hold up his phone and start a fundraiser . that fundraiser brought in $ 37 million dollars for relief . ",
        "all technology can be manipulated for evil acts , but focusing on those is short sighted an ignores how our everyday lives can be impacted in a positive way by anyone . even me or you . what you say online is permanent in most circumstances . now is up to us to determine what kind of legacy we 'll leave .
