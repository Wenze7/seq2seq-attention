        "newport beach -- a rare yellow-bellied sea snake washed up in newport beach this week , only the fifth time the warm water sea snake has been documented in southern california . the snake , which is rarely sighted this far north of its typical range , was found tuesday and reported to a lifeguard and animal control officer , who notified the pacific marine mammal center in laguna beach . it 's the fourth time in two years that such a creature has been spotted in the waters off southern california . the snake will be preserved and will become part of the permanent collection at the natural history museum of los angeles county . ",
        "`` it 's uncommon for these snakes to be seen this far north , as they favor the warmer waters off the coast of southern baja california , mexico , and we are thrilled to add this specimen to our permanent collection , '' said greg pauly , associate curator of herpetology . the yellow-bellied sea snake 's previous california appearances were in 1972 in san clemente and three times in the winter of 2015-16 in ventura , san diego , and orange counties -- all very strong el niño years when the waters off the california coast were unusually warm . ",
        "officials say this week 's finding is `` particularly unexpected '' because it is the first in california outside an el niño event . the museum says it will have the new yellow-bellied snake on public view within the week in its nature lab .   "
