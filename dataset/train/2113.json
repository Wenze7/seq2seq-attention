        "roto vr announced that shipments of the first roto vr chairs have begun . the first units are on their way to development studios now , followed by consumer deliveries in february . we first heard of roto vr in may 2016 when the company opened pre-orders for the roto vr motorized chair , which promised an enhanced vr experience . the roto vr chair features a motorized base , which responds to directional inputs from vr games and experiences , and rotates you accordingly . to prevent the headset cable from wrapping around you as you spin , roto vr developed a unique passthrough mechanism that enables you to plug the headset into the back of your chair and plug the base of the chair into your computer . ",
        "the roto vr chair also features optional rumble packs to add a level of force feedback to the chair , as well as mounts and surfaces for keyboards , mice , h. o.t. a.s. setups , and racing wheels . when roto vr first started accepting orders for the roto vr , the company believed that it could ship the first chairs as early as july 2016 . predictably , the two-month timeframe that the company gave itself was too short to live up to , and roto vr was forced to delay the launch . in october 2016 , roto vr announced that the roto vr chairs were about to enter production and that the company expected to begin shipping the product in january 2017 . ",
        "in january , roto vr failed to live up to its delivery promise , and the company went radio silent for most of the year . we were beginning to expect that the project fell through the cracks , and then in september , roto vr announced that it finally signed off on the production model and that a pilot production run was underway . the pilot production run went well , and roto vr recently ramped up production to prepare for the product 's launch next year . `` the team have been working around the clock to get roto vr final and shipment ready '' commented elliott myers , ceo and creator of roto vr . ",
        "`` we 've taken our time to ensure a top quality final product , and i 'm thrilled to confirm that units are beginning to ship , we will move to full production and all consumer orders will be fulfilled in early 2018 . we 're super hyped because we know roto vr will usher in a new era of unparalleled 360 vr immersion -- and it 's affordable . '' to speed up the fulfillment process , roto vr is offering to ship the hardware as a development kit . roto vr said that the dev kit chairs are identical to the production chair , including the packaging . ",
        "however , the company can ship the developer kits immediately because development hardware does n't need regulatory certificates such as fcc and ce . if you want a dev kit instead of a certified consumer unit , you must send in a request form , which you can find on roto vr 's website . roto vr said that shipments of developer kits have already begun . new requests should be fulfilled in mid-january . barring regulatory approval delays , roto vr expects to begin shipping consumer-model roto vr chairs in february . roto vr productionroto vr sells the basic roto vr chair for $ 999 , which includes the chair and a pair of sensors for rotational tracking . ",
        "if you want the rotating cable magazine to prevent the headset cord from wrapping around you , that will be another $ 150 . roto vr also offers a variety of accessories that increase the price of the chair by hundreds of dollars . if you 're interested in all of the accessories , the total roto vr package is currently $ 1,499 after a $ 125 pre-order discount .
