        "by kyle hightower , ap sports writerfoxborough , mass. . -- so many times during the patriots ' run of success over the past two decades , the defense was watching as tom brady sealed another victory . in sunday 's 24-20 afc championship victory over the jacksonville , the defense got its chance to secure the patriots ' record 10th super bowl appearance . jacksonville entered the game with the best red-zone scoring percentage in nfl , scoring touchdowns on 67.9 percent of trips this season . the jaguars scored touchdowns on both of their red-zone trips in the first half , as quarterback blake bortles had his way with short and intermediate routes to pile up first downs . ",
        "it added up to a 20-10 fourth-quarter lead , and left gillette stadium in stunned silence as new england 's hopes of getting a chance to defend its super bowl title seemed to be dwindling . but jacksonville got conservative over the final 30 minutes , much like the atlanta falcons did with 28-3 lead in last year 's super bowl collapse against new england . the patriots seized on it and the jaguars ' offense never got closer than the patriots ' 25 in the second half . `` we put ourselves in position to come back and just keep fighting , '' defensive end tray flowers said . ",
        "`` we knew they were going to run the ball , but we kept fighting and it was a fourth-quarter game . '' the most telling example came after the patriots took their final lead of the game on danny amendola 's 4-yard touchdown catch in the back of the end zone . the jaguars initially went back to their success in the first half , starting the drive with an 8-yard completion from bortles to marqise lee , followed by a 29-yard pass to dede westbrook to set jacksonville up on new england 's 38 . but the patriots reset , and after an incompletion by bortles on first down , linebackers kyle van noy and james harrison got to bortles for a sack , prying the ball loose . ",
        "jaguars tackle cam robinson recovered the fumble , but it set up a third-and-19 . new england kept the pressure on bortles and he could only manage a 4-yard completion to james o'shaughnessy . `` they had maybe one or two plays that we talk about this time of year , '' safety devin mccourty said . `` sixteen games , a play or two may have success , but matt said it best : it was n't a big adjustment that you needed to do ; it was just needing to play aggressively . '' with jacksonville facing fourth-and-15 on its 43 , cornerback stephon gilmore reached in front of bortles ' pass to o'shaughnessy to force a turnover on downs . ",
        "it was a special moment for gilmore , who battled injuries and inconsistent play after signing a five-year , $ 65 million contract in the offseason . `` it was n't the biggest play i 've made , but it was definitely one of the most important , '' he said . `` to come from where i came from last year , and be a part of this great team ... i love it and that 's why i decided to come here . '' for bortles , it was his first loss this season when he did n't commit a turnover . ",
        "he was previously 8-0 . `` we had a two-minute drive at the end of the game to win the afc championship , so there 's not a whole lot more you can ask for than that , '' bortles said . `` you 've got to take advantage of that and find a way to win the game . '' and now the patriots will have a chance at their sixth super bowl trophy , which would tie the pittsburgh steelers for the most ever . mccourty said the defense is invigorated by the opportunity . `` this team is battle-tested , '' mccourty said . ",
        "`` you go through ups and downs . you go through adversity . ... we just keep giving ourselves a chance to win , and the hard work pays off . '' ___ more ap nfl : and .   "
