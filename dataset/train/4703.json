",
        "i hope you 'll join us -- it 's going to be great . now , on to this week 's ideas ... `` new ways to plan your day , use your phone , and manage your inbox . '' i 've shared 500 + ideas in this newsletter over the past year and thought it would be helpful to recap the best of them on specific topics . the first of these recaps is this collection of my five favorite productivity tips of the year , each explained in less than 140 words to make for a quick read . ",
        "the tips include how to stop checking your phone so much , how to design your day using anti-goals , and the best auto-reply email i 've ever seen . 2 . how gary vaynerchuk discovers new trends `` my mentor is you . it is far better for you to look up to the 31 people that leave comments on your shit than to watch me more . '' gary vaynerchuk 's been ahead of the curve on a lot of things in the past decade , so it 's worth paying attention to how he does it . ",
        "in this one-minute video , he shares his secret to spotting new trends . it 's simple and anybody can do it . he analyzes what people follow , like , and share online and then asks himself why they 're doing that . `` one of the biggest mistakes i see students make when setting goals to get focused is that they start to think about how to accomplish the goals before just laying out what they want . '' most people go into a new year with a vision for how their year is going to play out . ",
        "and most people wind up being wrong . there are a lot of reasons for this and some are unavoidable , but taylor pearson -- author of the end of jobs : money , meaning and freedom without the 9-to-5 -- has put together a plan to help you get focused for 2018 . he explains why most people 's planning systems fail and suggests you sync your goals with a 25-year vision and a 90-day north star . 4 . what marketers do n't understand about critical mass `` most marketers are fooling themselves . they imagine that the audience size necessary for critical mass is right around the corner , but it 's actually closer to infinity . ",
        "that , like a boat with a leak , you always have to keep bailing to keep it afloat . if you do n't design for a low critical mass , you 're unlikely to get one . '' once again , seth godin challenges the conventional wisdom about marketing . in this post , he explains why a key to successful marketing is to focus on attracting minimum critical mass for your product -- it 's to build something where the number of people necessary for it to work is as low as possible . he offers examples of products that have achieved this such as facebook , and his book purple cow which was seeded to just 5,000 people and went on to sell millions of copies . ",
        "5 . you need a nemesis `` declaring an enemy of your work -- whether a person , product , or idea -- gets it noticed , supported , and ultimately helps it succeed . '' do you know what your work is fighting against ? in this post i explain why you need a nemesis and suggest declaring what you 're against helps you get what you want . the advantages of having a nemesis include that it rallies your audience , helps you stand out , proves you 're doing something meaningful and more . 6 . 52 interesting things learned in 2017 `` facebook employs a dozen people to delete abuse and spam from mark zuckerberg 's facebook page . '' ",
        "this is quickly becoming one of my favorite annual posts . tom whitwell has published a list of 52 interesting things he learned this year and it 's a fascinating compilation of stuff . for example : uber is the most lossmaking private company in tech history , men who travel first-class weigh more than men who travel in economy , and 50 % of playstation game systems that are sent in for repairs in new york are infested with cockroaches . for more stuff like this , check out the things he learned in 2016 . `` silicon valley faces a crucial imperative to tell the public about their morally questionable practices they have -- unfortunately -- learned from the tobacco industry , which is , setting an addiction that is extremely good for business . '' ",
        "this is n't the first time i 've heard social media compared to smoking , but it 's one of the more comprehensive explanations i 've seen about why the analogy may be apt . orge castellano declares social media is the new smoking and poses the question , `` how many likes are you chaining per day ? '' he points to a number of similarities between the addictive nature of both `` vices '' and calls for the social platforms to come clean about the danger of their products . 8 . why a breakdown is n't necessarily a bad thing `` a breakdown is not merely a random piece of madness or malfunction , it is a very real -- albeit very inarticulate -- bid for health . ",
        "it is an attempt by one part of our minds to force the other into a process of growth , self-understanding and self-development which it has hitherto refused to undertake . '' nobody wants to have a breakdown and we assume a breakdown is an awful thing . but what if we 're wrong ? the book of life makes the case that a breakdown is n't necessarily a bad thing and explores what actually happens when we lose control or get overwhelmed . it reframes the entire event not as a collapse , but as part of a `` logical search for health . '' ",
        "9 . what it 's like to raise a teenage daughter `` hannah is the most competent person in our house , and she 's a puddle . she wants to know the correct answer , what other people would like her to say , but she 's furious if she thinks the right answer is untrue . i want to say : i 'll give you all i 've got , but i was n't that great at being a teenager , and i 'm a pretty flawed adult , too . '' i do n't have a teenage daughter , but i 'm guessing this will resonate with anybody who does , used to , or will some day . ",
        "elizabeth weil shares a personal look at what it 's like to raise a teenage daughter and deal with the pride , fear , frustration , and love that comes with one . `` remember : the only way to get a reputation is to consistently provide value for people over a sustained period of time . '' the future of marketing is constantly evolving and navigating it requires a flexible team with a varied skill set . lauren holliday shares her vision for the marketing dream team of the future , explains why the marketing director needs to be replaced with a managing editor , and how a better team will lead to better content .
