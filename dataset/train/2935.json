        "king james just did something so impressive even the fans on the road had to give him some love . it does n't take a hardcore nba fan to know that lebron james is one of the all-time greats . but just in case you needed some more statistical validation of that fact , it arrived on tuesday night . in the first half of a cavs road game at the san antonio spurs , james scored his 30,000 th career point . it came in semi-dramatic fashion , as it was on a jumper that fell right before the end of the first quarter .
