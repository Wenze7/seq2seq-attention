        "how did a labor dispute that made it to court this year hinge on something as small as a comma ? it began when kevin o'connor , a driver for oakhurst dairy , realized that he was missing out on overtime pay , despite his regularly occurring 10 , 12 , 14-hour workdays . knowing that the state of maine had some exceptions to the state law , he contacted a lawyer , who found the comma that changed the game . his lawyer 's argument ? the lack of a comma in the rule made it unclear whether drivers like o'connor were eligible for overtime . ",
        "the activities that were ineligible for overtime were : . the canning , processing , preserving , freezing , drying , marketing , storing , packing for shipment or distribution of : agricultural produce ; meat and fish products ; and perishable foods . because there was no oxford comma between `` shipment '' and `` or , '' the lawyer argued , it was unclear which activities were ineligible . as quartz noted , `` is packing a single activity that is exempt from overtime pay ? or are packing and distributing two different activities , and both exempt ? '' ",
        "o'connor , along with about 75 other drivers , filed a class-action lawsuit to sue oakhurst dairy for $ 10 million in unpaid overtime . watch the video to find out the judge 's ruling and see if that oxford comma came in to save the day for o'connor and his fellow drivers . was this article helpful ? yes . no .
