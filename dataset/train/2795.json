        "dec. . 15 -- jordan is in talks with china on possible construction of a nuclear power reactor in the middle eastern country . the plant will serve as a supplement to another nuclear power station project jordan undertakes with the participation of russia , state-run sputnik news agency quoted kamal al araj , vice chairman of jordan atomic energy commission , as saying . jordan is negotiating with china that is willing to build a nuclear reactor in another area of the middle eastern country , but has made no official offer yet , said kamal al araj . ",
        "the project is estimated to cost usd4 billion . however , jordan would like to see some competition between china and russia over the country 's nuclear projects , al araj pointed out . jordan signed an intergovernmental agreement with russia in 2015 to build and operate a usd10 billion nuclear power plant . russia 's rosatom state nuclear energy corporation will own 49 per cent of the project , while jordan will hold 51 percent stake . it is the largest project deal signed between the two countries . china can also participate in the rosatom project without direct involvement of nuclear technologies , al araj suggested without elaborating . ",
        "last month , jordan signed an agreement with rolls-royce holding to conduct a technical feasibility study to build a small modular nuclear reactor program for the generation of electricity . it also held talks last year with a number of companies including shanghai electric group co. . and china national nuclear corporation to provide the rosatom plant with necessary electric systems and turbines for the two reactors that will be built under the program , jordan times reported .
