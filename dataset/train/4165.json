        "-- taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co. . forecast revenue that fell short of expectations , as waning smartphone sales in china and a strong local currency outweigh booming demand from cryptocurrency miners . tsmc , the main chip supplier to apple inc. 's iphones and ipads , foresees sales of $ 8.4 billion to $ 8.5 billion in the first quarter , missing projections for $ 8.61 billion . it 's predicting a gross margin of 49.5 to 51.5 percent , only flat to slightly up from the december quarter . the disappointing outlook may stoke concerns that sales of the top-end iphone x will turn out weaker than anticipated over the holidays and early 2018 . ",
        "tsmc gets about a fifth of its revenue from apple . investors had hoped that quickening demand for the muscular chips used to mine virtual currencies including bitcoin would offset the impact of a weakening mobile market . co-chief executive officer mark liu told investors thursday its high-performance computing unit will experience record growth in u. s. dollar terms in 2018 . some analysts estimate crypto-miners ' contribution to tsmc 's revenue could double this year to 5 to 10 percent . tsmc is preparing to move into cutting-edge 7-nanometer chip production from june -- a big question mark given it 's untested technology . ",
        "but a bigger unknown may be tsmc 's budding crypto-miners business , at a time regulators from china to south korea have clamped down on virtual currency trading to curb financial risks . `` how the customers will accept the 7nm technology , and when exactly will they able to deliver products , places uncertainty on tsmc 's performance in 2018 , '' said roger sheng , an analyst with gartner in shanghai . `` a bigger uncertainty is cryptocurrency though . we can see many governments across the globe planning to rein it in . that 's a big headwind . '' ",
        "tsmc gave out its forecasts after reporting a third consecutive quarter of declining profit . the world 's largest producer of made-to-order microchips reported a 0.9 percent dip in net income to nt$ 99.3 billion in the december quarter , exceeding the nt$ 97.2 billion projected . gross margins slipped to 50 percent from 52.3 percent . smartphone shipments slid almost 12 percent in china in 2017 as portions of the world 's largest mobile market approached saturation point , according to the china academy of information and communications technology . tsmc however may win more orders from fast-growing brands such as huawei , which designs its own mobile processors and may turn to tsmc for mass production . ",
        "`` chinese smartphone makers ' potential shipment decline in the domestic market should have a more negative impact on u. s. fabless and samsung 's foundry than on tsmc , '' deutsche bank analysts michael chou and grace hsu wrote in a memo ahead of the earnings release . read more : a legend in microchips retires just as his industry heats upfounder morris chang -- who 's handing the company 's reins to two lieutenants this year -- said thursday that the high-performance computing , internet of things and auto segments will help drive revenue growth of 10 to 15 percent in 2018 . ",
        "new businesses -- including chips for crypto-mining -- helped offset the taiwanese dollar , which gained about 8 percent in 2017 , eroding margins for export-oriented industries . the company had previously reported a 6 percent rise in fourth-quarter revenue to nt$ 277.6 billion . in the longer term , tsmc 's technological edge is expected to help it weather poor smartphone sales globally . revenue from 10 nanometer chips -- the most advanced in its line-up -- jumped to 25 percent of overall sales , from just a 10th in the previous quarter , typically a function of the latest iphones . ",
        "`` we lead in technology , we lead in manufacturing capability , and i believe we lead in customers ' trust , '' chang said . demand from companies developing artificial intelligence applications will help tsmc consolidate its market lead , e sun securities analysts wayne lin and kaiwei lin wrote in a report ahead of the earnings release . tsmc 's preparing to spend more than $ 20 billion on its next state-of-the-art plant as it 's built out in coming years : the price for staying ahead of intel corp. . and samsung electronics co. . in cutting-edge production . ",
        "tsmc spends $ 10 billion annually to stay abreast of rivals , but the cost of safeguarding its perch as the predominant player in bespoke semiconductors is climbing as chipmaking gets increasingly intricate . chief financial officer lora ho expects tsmc to spend $ 10.5 billion to $ 11 billion this year , versus $ 10.86 billion in 2017 . tsmc 's shares closed up 2.7 percent in taipei before the results were released . -- with assistance from cindy wang to contact bloomberg news staff for this story : gao yuan in beijing at ygao199@bloomberg . net . to contact the editors responsible for this story : robert fenner at rfenner@bloomberg .
