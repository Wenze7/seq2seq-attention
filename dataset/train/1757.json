        "tis the season ! to be sick . five years ago , i was sick and tired of being sick and tired . like most people with an `` office job '' my career path has lead me to being mostly sedimentary 10 -- 12 hours a day . eating healthy ? no time for that . working out ? no time for that . mental health ? what 's that ? popping a pill for this and a pill for that . stomach ache ? there 's a pill for that . tired ? there 's a pill for that . ",
        "stressed ? there 's a pill for that . in pain ? there 's a pill for that . you get it . we all have that list of somethings we wish we were n't dealing with . aches and pains , no energy , headaches , tummy aches , etc. . for me it was mostly digestive `` issues '' which lead to fatigue among other things ... i found myself in a doctor 's office being told there was n't really anything medically wrong with me but there were pills for my symptoms . not satisfied with that answer , i was encouraged by a friend to get to the root of my situation by focusing on overall health and wellness activities . ",
        "i did n't do it on my own , i found an amazing naturopathic doctor who helped me understand how my body works and the right supplements and diet to follow to feel better . i also discovered that healthy living did n't stop there . i added in other actives that supported over all health/wellness in my life and started with small goals , simple changes . i know what it 's like to feel yucky most days , and now , i know how to feel great most days . i want everyone to have the same experience i had in finding natural solutions to what ales him or her . ",
        "and , since we tend to spend most of our time at the office , what better place to start making those little changes than at work ? one of the amazing things about working at moncur is that the culture embraces my ideas and efforts to live healthy/naturally . below are a few ways we promote wellness at moncur . back to the essentialsessential oils , nature 's original `` medicine '' , have been around for centuries . if you 're using the purest oils properly , they are a non-toxic , harmless way to promote emotional and physical wellness , unlike synthetic and chemical medicines . ",
        "since working at moncur , i 've become the office oil guru and am known for using the phrase `` there 's an oil for that ! '' getting started using essential oils at the workplace is really easy and a lot of fun . here are few ways moncur uses essential oils around the office . using oils aromaticallydiffusing is one of the simplest methods for using essential oils aromatically . we have several around the office . diffusing oils purifies the air , lifts or calms moods and just smells great ! it 's a good alternative to lighting candles , which is usually a no no at the office anyway . ",
        "essential oils can also be used aromatically without any special diffusing devices . you can achieve the same health and mood-boosting benefits by simply placing a few drops of eos in the palm of your hand and cupping it around your nose and breathing deeply . topical applicationsessential oils are immediately absorbed by the skin , and once absorbed , they stay in the applied area for a localized benefit . apply them where you think you need them to help -- neck , temples , stomach , feet , etc. . internal usesa lot of essential oils can also be ingested internally . ",
        "just check the bottle first ; if it has supplemental facts , you 're good to go . avoid ingesting any oils that do not have that info . at moncur , we like to add them to our water , put them right under our tongues , or use veggie capsules . take note ! essential oils are heavily concentrated plant extracts , so a little goes a long way . for instance , one drop of peppermint oil is equivalent to 28 cups of peppermint tea ! even though a single drop might not seem like a lot , a drop or two is plenty . ",
        "oils have worked wonders for me , but do n't just take my word for it , educate yourself ! it 's important to make your own health care and dietary decisions based upon your own research and in partnership with your health care provider . if you 're interested in learning more , or picking up a few oils for you or your office , you can get started here . stretch it out , and breatheyoga is more than just a trend . another age-old practice , it promotes health , boosts immunity , improves flexibility , perfects posture , builds muscle strength and tone , increases blood flow , emphasizes proper breathing , aids in clearer thinking and reduces stress , anxiety and depression . ",
        "i had the opportunity at a recent team tuesday to walk my co-workers through a few simple yoga-inspired breathing exercises and stretches . combined with essential oils , yoga can be an office environment game-changer . here 's the routine we practiced together : fuel up with goodnessok , so disclaimer : at moncur , we 're fueled mostly by food and drink . but what agency is n't ? ! if you spend any time at our office , you learn very quickly we have a snack obsession . while we do have everything your heart desires , we intentionally display healthier items , such as trail mixes , nuts , and fresh fruit , openly on the kitchen countertops . ",
        "the rest of the yummies are tucked in the back on shelves where they are a little less accessible but still available if you so desire to indulge . if you 're craving a candy bar , you can still go for it ! who does n't once in a while ? ! but there is something a little convicting about walking past the apples and bananas to get there . we also have any thing you could ever think of to drink , including water of all kinds , literally : filtered , purified , carbonated , flavored , mineral , hot , cold , room temp ... this is important because our bodies are mostly water . ",
        "staying hydrated is one of the simplest steps you can take toward wellness . maintaining and replenishing water levels aids and supports muscle function , joint and brain protection , immune health , digestion , and even mood . i have to say , being a part of a company that supports these wellness initiatives is definitely a bonus , not only for me , but for each and every employee who participates ! i encourage companies of all shapes and sizes , across all industries , to take the moncur approach to wellness in the workplace . we spend 8 + hours a day in the office , so why not make it the healthiest and most enjoyable experience we can ?
