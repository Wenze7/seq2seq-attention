        "expand , a devotional `` as the deer pants for streams of water , so my soul pants for you , my god . '' psalms 42:1 nkjvhow hungry are you ? i once heard a story about a horse who had a carrot dangling in front of him . as long as the carrot was in front of him , he kept moving towards the direction his master guided him . i believe that god is always guiding us towards a position where he wants us to be ... his carrot is always dangling . he allows things to come into our lives that keep us hungry for more and wanting more of him . ",
        "what `` carrot '' is the lord dangling in front of you to keep you investing in a relationship with him ? as i reflect on my relationship with him , i 'm in awestruck wonder . he loves us and wants us to follow his leading . one day recently , i quieted my soul and heard the holy spirit say , `` my grace is all around you . '' it got me thinking : the lord is constantly speaking , but are we sitting still enough to hear his voice ? are we too busy to take the time to rest in him ? ",
        "are we too busy to hear what he has to say about the decisions that we need to make ? are we hungry for the will of god or are we feasting on other things ? we 're supposed to be hungry for him . our desire for intimacy ... it starts and ends with him . it 's just how we 're made . the psalmist wrote about it in psalm 42:1 : `` as the deer pants for streams of water , so my soul pants for you , my god . '' now , as we begin a new year , it 's a great time to stop and listen to his voice . ",
        "like any loving parent , he wants to have quality time with you , more than you will ever know . luke 10:38 -- 42 shows us how much he values quality time with us : `` as jesus and his disciples were on their way , he came to a village where a woman named martha opened her home to him . but martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made . she came to him and asked , `` lord , do n't you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself ? ",
        "tell her to help me ! `` martha , martha , `` the lord answered , `` you are worried and upset about many things , but few things are needed or indeed only one . mary has chosen what is better , and it will not be taken away from her . '' luke 10:38 -- 42 nkjvmy point is this : now , it 's time for us to sit at his feet , to clearly hear his voice and obey . because i love him , i choose to sit at his feet to know him and to hear his voice . ",
        "because i love him ! point to ponder : 1 . is there anything that you can add or take away from your schedule to make more room for god this year ? bible verses : psalm 42:1 , luke 10:38 -- 42 .   "
