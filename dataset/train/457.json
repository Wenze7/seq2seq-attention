        "valentine 's day supper at chambre à part with hakim chajar as the chef , not so inspired that evening . marie-claude lortie , la presse dining critic : . i do n't really want to talk about it . no need to rub it in . but what i do want to talk about is how disappointed i am that we do n't talk more about women chefs , restaurateurs , front of the house , sommeliers , how important they are in this business , how talented they are and how their excellence does not always fit into old-school `` best of '' categories .

        "ian harrison , ricardo magazine ; eater montreal founding editor : . i ate a really lacklustre sandwich at lloydie 's in october . mallory frayn , eater montreal contributor : . lili co. , hands down . i brought a food writer colleague from out-of-province for dinner and it was absolutely horrendous from start to finish . i can give the food a pass but the real letdown was the service . by the end of the evening our waiter had forgotten about us and was conversing with friends through the back door of the restaurant . totally unprofessional and when we brought it up , they refused to admit that it was even an issue .
