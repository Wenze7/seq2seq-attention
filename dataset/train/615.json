        "global enterprises will spend more than $ 7 trillion dollars in the next four years as they struggle to modernize , build a global technology foundation for growth , and support simple , secure , and reliable access to data and services , says the idc . the big drivers ? the usual suspects like cloud initiatives , big data analytics , and mobility . but , iot is becoming a major investment focus , and so are automation or ai initiatives . connectivity is always a part of the conversation here , as well as it services and enterprise applications .

        "join us for the read/write digital transformation dinner in silicon valley : february 13apply to attend by commenting on this posthost : john koetsier , journalist , analyst , futurist ; sponsor : tata communications . in 2019 alone , global enterprises will spend $ 1.7 trillion on digital transformation . that 's up almost 50 % from the $ 1.2 trillion they spent this year , according to idc . top industries include the manufacturing and transportation sectors , but professional services and healthcare firms are also driving increased investment . by 2021 , investment will reach a staggering $ 2.1 trillion . ",
        "one thing is clear : a wide range of industries is investing in digital transformation . those top industries represent just slightly more than half of all the trillions of dollars of spending . the rest , about 46 % , is spread among multiple other categories . while it 's true that companies are investing in cloud and communications technologies to grow competitiveness in an era when every company is becoming a technology company , the sleeper investment might be what all this technology does to company culture . digital transformation , after all , improves speed to market , competitiveness , innovation capacity , and other critical areas of an enterprise . ",
        "all of those depend on culture , and culture depends on people . that 's the piece that 's often overlooked when transformation efforts yield mixed results . without the right people , and without the right culture , all the technology in the world wo n't save a company . collaboration tools enable cooperation and communication , but they do n't mandate it . all of which means that enterprise transformation includes technology , but needs to consider culture . we 're looking to bring together key executives for a collaborative round table on digital transformation over dinner in silicon valley .
