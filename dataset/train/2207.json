        "the oil spill continues growingan oil spill from an iranian tanker that sank off china has spread into four separate slicks covering an area of 100 sq km , say chinese authorities . the sanchi was carrying 136,000 tons of ultra-light crude oil when it collided with another vessel 260 km off shanghai on 6 january . it burned for a week before exploding and sinking on sunday . the crew of 32 are all confirmed or presumed dead . earlier satellite imagery had shown just two oil slicks . but the latest figures from china 's state oceanic administration , which monitored the area on wednesday , said there were now four , ranging in size from 48 sq km to 5.5 sq km . ",
        "both the crude oil that was carried on the sanchi and the fuel that was used to power the vessel could cause devastating damage to marine life . most condensate oils are colourlesscondensate oil , the ultra-light crude oil carried on the ship , differs from the thick black oil slicks usually associated with a spill . it is toxic , low in density and considerably more explosive than regular crude . most condensates are also colourless and generate a toxic underwater slick that is almost invisible from the surface . china 's ministry of transport had on wednesday announced that a salvage team had located the vessel at a depth of 115m . ",
        "it said it was preparing to send underwater robots to explore the area . the ministry added that a marine patrol ship had arrived at the site , and crew had begun assessing ways to detect leaks and stop the flow of oil .   "
