        "james harden is a true icon . he 's a star on the court and makes statements off of it as well . let 's not forget he rocks some sick outfits and sweet kicks , and he further proved that on thursday night . the beard made another fashion statement and rocked a sleek pair of harden vol . 1 primeknits with some special designs on them . the dude knows what he 's doing . harden has not been afraid to wear bold outfits time and time again to games , but sometimes they 're a bit more questionable than these steezy kicks . ",
        "this season , harden has been having his third straight mvp-caliber output . he 's averaging a league-high 32.4 points per game and has also made the most threes and free throws in the nba . he 's been very ball dominant this season due to chris paul 's long absence , but is still finding a way to dish out 9.2 assists per game . it 's too bad harden did n't end up wearing a pair of shoes to remind people of his friend meek mill 's current situation . now that would 've been a statement . ",
        "who knows why he did n't rock those , but maybe he 'll do it this weekend . either way , harden is looking fly once again .   "
