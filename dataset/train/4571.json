        "opposition party leaders came out against strategic affairs minister gilad erdan 's banning members of boycott organizations from entering israel , in their faction meetings on monday . zionist union mk tzipi livni said the bill wo n't help fight bds , and it only helps erdan politically . `` i have been fighting boycotts for my entire political career by talking to leaders . that is what we should do , '' she argued at a zionist union faction meeting . on sunday , erdan published a list of 20 organizations calling to boycott israel whose senior members will be banned from entering the country , in accordance with a law passed last year . ",
        "livni said : `` israel is beautiful . israel has equality . let see it ! keeping them out only expands the gap between israel 's image and the reality . '' zionist union chairman avi gabbay added : `` i do n't understand the concept . if bds hurts us abroad , why ca n't they be here ? if they 're here , they ca n't hurt us there . '' livni , in a way answering gabbay 's question , later explained that she thinks keeping boycott activists out of the country is pointless , giving the example of palestinian teen ahed tamimi , a longtime social-media star among anti-israel activists , who was arrested for physically assaulting an idf soldier . ",
        "`` we support anything that will really fight bds , but in a world where everything is open , a girl can film herself with a soldier . we just need to learn how to deal with it -- we need to do things that will help , '' livni said . yesh atid chairman yair lapid claimed that he has been leading the fight against bds in recent years , but said the move is unwise . lapid pointed out that the members of jewish voice for peace , one of the organizations on the list , are jewish , so they can immigrate to israel under the law of return anyway . ",
        "`` bds activists are a detestable bunch , but this is an idiotic law , '' he stated . `` we should fight boycotts with another boycott ? '' erdan responded that the opposition mks ' criticisms `` prove their lack of understanding of the subject , and their inability to lead israel . '' `` boycott activists come here to hurt israel and try to harm its citizens , not as tourists who are coming to see the view , '' erdan added . `` whoever continues letting them into israel exposes israeli citizens to harm . ''  "
