        "the following ` article ' was made during the june , 2010 while doing internship at mike boyle strength and conditioning in woburn , ma . we had a homework of doing review of joint-by-joint and warm-up dvds by mike boyle . i shared short review of both approached and some of mine opinions/critiques/concerns . enjoy ! joints have needs . they are differently built , and they have different function in complex human body and its movements . it could be said that over time movement evolutionary shaped our joints to fit our movement needs . since the human movement is interplay between stability ~ mobility , different joints contribute to this continuum between these complementary conceptual pairs in different degrees . ",
        "since every joint has possible 6-degrees of freedom , 3 of which are rotational and 3 of which are translational , it can be said that each of these degrees for each individual joint has a point in stability-mobility continuum space . this is a movement classification system for different joints and they differ at different degrees of freedom by their structure . thus , it is hard to put individual joint at one group , but rather their individual degrees of freedom for a given movement task . according to constraint-led approach to motor control , human movement is an emergent process that happens under the constraints . ",
        "in this example , joints can be considered constraints , along with their individual 6 degrees of freedom and their corresponding stability ~ mobility space-point . thus , in some way joint constraints shape the movement . mark comerford basically identified one complementary pair in his writings : give ~ restriction . basically , since joints and tissues constraint movement patterns , a problem in one joint or musculo-fascial tissue may cause a problem at different place . in simple words , a restriction at one area may cause non-physiological `` give `` at same place or at more distance place . ",
        "the `` give `` is where pain is , and is usually cause by restriction at a different plane . physical therapists identified couple of give ~ restriction issues in human body , and this is the concept that mike boyle refers to as joint-by-joint approach . since some joints are more prone to develop `` restrictions `` , they need more `` mobility work `` , while other joints are more prone to `` give `` and develop pain , so they need more `` stability work `` or at least less mobility work . mike boyle , based on this concept identified a given structure : ankle joint needs more mobilityknee joint needs more stabilityhip joint needs more mobilitylumbar spine need more stabilitythoracic spine needs more mobilityscapulo-thoracic joint need more stabilitygleno-humeral joint need more mobilityalthough i would answer `` it depends `` to this classification it is pretty simple and understandable to provide practice guidelines for the trainers and coaches . ",
        "but we must remember there is more to it . one aspect that mike talks about is the difference between flexibility and mobility . according to mike , flexibility is a property of muscles , while mobility is a property of a joint . i may be wrong , but my opinion is that is just linguistic issue . flexibility is a specific motor quality that is task dependent , and basically can be classified to active , passive , static , dynamic , etc. . anyway , there are different limiting factors to the specific expression of flexibility . ",
        "sometimes , it is a muscle issue , sometimes it is a ligament/joint issue , sometimes it is just a pain threshold issues . thus , in this example mike boyle refers to different constraints that limits the flexibility in a given joint and his different planes . in his warm-up approach , mike boyle tries to address different needs of the joints , according to joint-by-joint concept , along with following this concept in strength training design . basically , the structure is following : foam roll to address `` restrictions `` in musculo-fascial tissuesisometric stretch , that utilize 3d stretching concept to further address common `` restrictions `` in musculo-fascial tissuesactivation work , to `` wake up `` given muscle groups that are in a `` give mode `` dynamic mobility to further activate and warm-up the body , imprint some appropriate movement patterns and provide a progressive transition to main workoutthe choosing of the means within each group depends on the joint-by-joint concept and the difference between linear and lateral training days . ",
        "some of my thoughts on this approach are the following : there should be more stretching of the upper-body , like traps , pecsthere should be more upper body activation/warm-up like push-ups , different kind of arm swingsthe warm-up is somehow generic . i would love to further elaborate on the last point . even if there are more commonalities in athlete needs or universality as defined by joint-by-joint , some athletes need more individualized approach . this is the complementary pair : universality ~ individuality . my point here is that although the warm-up should be the `` same `` for all athletes , some individuality must be provided . ",
        "some athletes need more upper body warm-up , some are more `` robust `` and do n't need as much warm-up , some need more time to warm up their problematic areas . it is true that young athletes need to learn good warming-up principles and procedure , but more experienced athletes have their own `` routines `` and at least we should provide couple of short time periods where athletes are able to do some of their own warm-up , like 1 -- 2 min periods at the end of every part of the warm-up where athletes after they finish with universal exercises , can address some of their individual needs . ",
        "my point here is that there should be universality , but there should also be individuality . if we want to teach athletes how to fish , we must give them options to choose , but guide them to good choosing . i know it is hard to do it due time-constraints and facility design and logistic , but this is just my opinion and i am providing it for further elaboration . another points is that this warm-up is geared toward context we have at mbsc facility . since i work with soccer players on the outside , i must address that we need to adapt the warm-up for that kind of context , especially if we warm-up in the mud and under the rain . ",
        "this is why understanding concepts and principles rather than memorizing routines is more important : it is going to give us solutions under different contexts . in summary , joint-by-joint approach is worth studying but we must remember that there is more to it , along with its implementation to mbsc warm-up which is generic routine constructed with specific context in mind which is mbsc facility and logistics . edit : just for the example , here is the warm-up we did for a boxing practice on april , 2010 in zrenjanin , serbia , with coach milan piperski . ",
        "warm up structure : general part 1 . joint circles and easy short stretches2 . dynamic warm-up and some bw exercisesspecific part 3 . specific boxing drills 4 . shadow boxing around 20 min total . please note that this in not how we warm-up every time or the warm-up we do , and not the warm-up you should or must do . again , this is just an example , and it is one training session taken out of context . most of the american readers will find this just plain weird or maybe unnecessary and long , especially the ` joint circles ' part , but please note that this is how we warm-up from elementary school . ",
        "and i agree on the point that it look like `` gey mating ritual '' . but if you think more about it , are n't all warm-ups and training protocols started from the rituals ? religious , war , etc ?   "
