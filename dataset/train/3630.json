        "source : creative services / creative services , ione digitalquick . someone remove fox news from the president 's cable package , because if journalist daniel dale 's observations are accurate , the conservative news channel is the stimulus behind trump 's latest twitter rampage , and folks are worried it could prove fatal . 45 's `` nuclear button '' tweet , in which he haphazardly responded to kim jong-un 's new year 's address , is n't the first time the president has allowed his twitter fingers to run rampant . but this instance in particular , in all its manic furor , has americans ' blood pressures skyrocketing to infinity and beyond . ",
        "`` north korean leader kim jong un just stated that the ` nuclear button is on his desk at all times . ' '' trump tweeted tuesday night . `` will someone from his depleted and food-starved regime please inform him that i too have a nuclear button , but it is a much bigger and more powerful one than his , and my button works ! '' a day in the life of the president who does n't watch much tv primarily because of documents . pic . twitter . com/jmt0inwogr -- daniel dale january 3 , 2018 . ",
        "first of all , that 's not how it works . that 's not how any of this works . second of all , so much for not having `` much '' time to watch television . though trump claims his tv fixation is a fable of the #fakenews media , the calamity on his timeline displays otherwise . speaking of #fakenews , trump also announced his forthcoming `` corrupt media awards , '' in which he 'll announce honors in dishonesty , bad reporting , and `` various categories from the fake news media . '' we say he easily just earned himself the title of troll of the year . ",
        "i will be announcing the most dishonest & corrupt media awards of the year on monday at 5:00 o'clock . subjects will cover dishonesty & bad reporting in various categories from the fake news media . stay tuned ! -- donald j. trump january 3 , 2018 . unfortunately , it seems we can only expect a lot more of trump 's antics going into 2018 . despite multiple complaints from users stating the command-in-chef 's behavior constitutes as a violation of the social media platform 's terms of service , an automated message states : `` we have reviewed your report carefully and found that there was no violation of the twitter rules against abusive behavior . '' ",
        "twitter confirmed with the hollywood reporter on wednesday that trump 's nuclear button tweet `` does not violate its terms of service regarding abusive content . '' three days , y ' all . it 's only been three days .   "
