        "-- mobile systems group at u klagenfurt -- tweets in chronological order and three `` bonus tweets '' 01 . our research on time synchronization in wireless sensor networks has been published in the ieee transactions on industrial informatics . a dynamic stochastic model is applied to track the clock evolution of oscillators and achieve synchrony to a central time reference . indoor and outdoor experiments with commercial platforms , done by wasif and jorge , serve as a proof of concept and assess the synchronization accuracy under varying temperature conditions . 02 . the institute of networked and embedded systems released a new website and blog . ",
        "being based on wordpress and a style from wpzoom , it features a tablet-friendly minimalistic design with a single-level menu bar . the list of publications is automatically fed from the university 's research database . 14 blog articles were written in 2017.03 . i gave an invited talk about self-organizing synchronization in networked systems at the itg international conference on systems , communications , and coding in hamburg . the talk summarized our work in this domain ranging from convergence proofs to experimental performance measurements with programmable radios . 04 . wasif defended his doctoral thesis , making him the 11th doctoral graduate from my group . ",
        "he joined t-mobile in vienna . 05 . our drone team gave a demonstration for state secretary and later science minister harald mahrer , who visited u klagenfurt in march . 06 . daniel will spent a semester at the university of southern california in 2018 . he received a scholarship for his stay . 07 . i visited the center for aerial robotics research and education in toronto in april . it has an exciting research portfolio in small drone systems . my invited talk discussed wireless communications for drones and novel results for job selection . 08 . ",
        "samira and i attended re : publica in berlin . it was an exciting event not least because samira gave a very personal talk about drones and their application in disaster response . the talk included a great video about `` disaster support by drones '' made by some of our researchers . 09 . my keynote at european wireless in dresden titled `` networked drones -- thy hype is ripe '' discussed the emerging technology of networked small drones operating in an autonomous fashion . i reviewed applications with focus on disaster management and aerial monitoring , gave an overview of engineering challenges in the design and operation of such systems , and highlighted open research issues for wireless networking and distributed coordination in this context .

        "our multidrone system developed at lakeside labs was presented and explained . 10 . an interdisciplinary workshop on self-organization and swarm intelligence in cyber physical systems was held at lakeside labs . experts presented their work and discussed open issues in this exciting field . the workshop was followed by a meeting of the horizon 2020 project cpswarm -- which develops a workbench for the design of swarms of cyber physical systems . my doctoral student micha and lakeside labs ' senior researcher melanie are working in this project in collaboration with my colleague wilfried elmenreich . 11 . our contribution to drone delivery systems : we analyzed different classes of job selection policies that control how a network of autonomous aerial vehicles delivers goods from depots to customers . ",
        "this work was presented by pasquale at the robotics : science and systems conference at mit in july and other events . 12 . as part of our mandatory self-evaluation at the institute of networked and embedded systems , we performed a one-day workshop to do a swot analysis . we discussed our strengths , weaknesses , opportunities , and threats in the domains of research , teaching , communications and administration , and personel . the institute also successfully passed an internal audit . 13 . we held a very inspiring group workshop to discuss and fix some strategic aspects with focus on outreach and research . ",
        "scientific presentations in the doctoral seminar were also part of the workshop . 14 . austria establishes the `` 5g playground '' -- a test field for future mobile systems . it can be used by companies and research institutes to advance their prototypes and products . the concept was presented in a press conference at the ministry for transport , innovation , and technology . 15 . our article `` drone networks : communications , coordination , and sensing `` accepted for ad hoc networks explains a high-level architecture for the design of a collaborative aerial system consisting of drones with on-board sensors and embedded processing , coordination , and networking capabilities . ",
        "we implemented a multi-drone system consisting of quadcopters and demonstrated its potential in disaster assistance , search and rescue , and aerial monitoring . furthermore , we illustrate design challenges and present potential solutions based on the lessons learned so far . 16 . a new karl popper doctoral school on networked autonomous aerial vehicles has been acquired and established . its objective is to advance collaborative research and education and makes klagenfurt a hub in this emerging and disruptive technology . groups from robotics , pervasive computing , mobile communications systems , multimedia systems , and other disciplines join forces to create an inspiring environment in which faculty members , phd students , international research fellows , and world-leading labs and companies closely collaborate . ",
        "jpl and t-mobile austria joined as external partners . four university-funded researchers joined this school in fall ; among them : agata in my team . a related project with drone navigation in forests is done in cooperation with my colleague stephan weiss . phd student arke from lakeside labs works in this project on obstacle avoidance and path planning . 17 . the university of klagenfurt awarded an honorary doctorate to johannes huber from the university of erlangen-nürnberg . i had the honor to introduce him with a laudatio . the award was given as part of the 10-year anniversary event of the faculty of technical sciences at our university . ",
        "18 . we presented two papers at the 20th acm international conference on modeling , analysis and simulation of wireless and mobile systems in miami beach . the first paper investigates the concept of interference prediction as an unprecedented approach for interference management and medium access in wireless networks . it was presented by mahin as her first paper as first author . 19 . the second mswim paper presents a proof-of-concept for an ultra-wideband sensor network deployed in a mockup of a small passenger cabin of a commercial airplane . this work with our project partner airbus received the best paper award of the conference , which makes us very proud . ",
        "20 . our work with the company skidata investigates a novel boarding solution for cabin-based transport systems -- e. g. , ski lifts , cable cars , subways : in order to avoid long queues at succeeding boarding stations , a display in the boarding area tells the guests how many of them are allowed to enter the next cabin . the system has been studied by means of queuing theory and simulations and will now be tested in a ski resort . 21 . scientists also need some free days to recover . one of the invaluable goodies of working at alpen-adria-universität klagenfurt is that many great opportunities for outdoor activities are closeby .
