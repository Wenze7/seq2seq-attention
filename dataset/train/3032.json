        "ok , so my ex and i broke up over 7 months ago . we were together for 3 years . in these 7 months , i have been running away from him and he always catches me . i was extremely heartbroken and angry . we broke up over the summer and i did no contact rule . he would call and text and i declined them . when we went back to school he would say hi to me everyday and do slick shit to make me jealous . he would get involved with other girls and i would n't bother him but when i was involved with other guys he would always watch me and tend to be near me and the guy i 'm interested in . ",
        "listen , i have cursed him out , told him he was weak and a waste of time , and i even slammed doors in his face . he does not give up . he 'll leave me alone for a while then he 'll contact me again . i was doing good until i stopped being mad about everything and forgave him . we went on christmas break and came back to school and all of a sudden i have feelings which i 'm sure never left , they were just hidden under my anger . now before christmas break we were cool with each other , not planning to get back together , i personally do n't wan na get back together , just friends . ",
        "he called me everyday and text me 24/7 and then i found out he was doing this while he had a girlfriend and i immediately cut that off and told him that 's disrespectful and unfair to her . he texted me the next day after i told him how wrong he was , and i did n't respond . now christmas break has passed and we come back to school and he says hi to me everyday and one day he called me and we had a long talk which i know was wrong . but i genuinely love talking to him and sadly i still love him . ",
        "we talked about a little bit of everything he even told me he wanted to break up with his girlfriend . i want to stop the communication , but it 's hard . i still love him and i really do n't wan na love him anymore . i just wish i had that peace of mind and the same strength i had during that time when i could decline his calls and texts and go about my day .
