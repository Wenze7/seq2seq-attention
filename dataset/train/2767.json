        "-- the 10-year u. s. treasury yield climbed to the highest level in about 10 months , leading bill gross at janus henderson group to declare a bond bear market just as a deluge of debt sales began . the benchmark u. s. yield rose seven basis points on tuesday to top 2.55 percent for the first time since march , and the treasury curve steepened the most in over a year , as a looming glut of bond supply from the u. s. , the u. k. , japan and germany coincided with a surprise cut in purchases of long-dated japanese government bonds by the bank of japan . ",
        "the securities steadied on wednesday . even though central bank watchers said the boj 's actions are n't interpreted as an imminent shift from ultra-accommodative policy , it 's yet another sign of central banks stepping back from global bond markets -- just as the u. s. treasury is about to sell the most debt in eight years . add to that rising market expectations around inflation , and traders are starting to wager that treasuries are on the verge of a big breakout from their tightest range in a half-century . `` we 're seeing a lot of overseas buyers who would come in every time we 'd have a move close to these levels who are n't coming in anymore , '' said michael franzese , new york-based head of fixed-income trading at mcap llc , a broker-dealer . ",
        "`` that 's kind of scaring me a little bit . one eye is constantly on the exit button . '' the 10-year yield was little changed at 2.5476 percent at 9:24 a. m. london time on wednesday . the yield curve from two to 10 years steepened by six basis points on tuesday , the most since november 2016 . doubleline capital chief investment officer jeffrey gundlach said markets had not priced in shrinking central bank balance sheets . the billionaire bond manager said after the market closed that the 10-year yield could head higher if it traded past last year 's high of 2.63 percent with 3.25 percent `` plausible '' some time in 2018 . ",
        "gross 's call . `` bond bear market confirmed , '' gross said in a twitter posting on tuesday , noting that 25-year trend lines had been broken in five - and 10-year treasury maturities . the billionaire fund manager at janus said last year that 10-year yields persistently above 2.4 percent would signal a bear market , though added in an interview last week that even in such an environment , investors probably wo n't lose a lot of money . of course , several money managers have been premature in calling the end of the three-decade bull market in treasuries over the years . ",
        "and others have a higher yield target . scott minerd , who oversees $ 250 billion as chief investment officer of guggenheim partners , said in an email tuesday that the long-term trend for bonds remains in place until the 10-year yield exceeds 3 percent . even in that scenario , yields may drop one final time , he said . semantics of a bear market aside , the more pressing issue for traders is the more than $ 60 billion in combined bond sales by the u. s. , the u. k. , japan and germany set to take place this week , which may test the appetite of investors for debt at current levels . ",
        "american companies on tuesday also issued the most investment-grade debt this year . auction slate . the u. s. saw above-average buyside demand for its $ 24 billion three-year note sale tuesday , though some strategists predicted increased appetite since the maturity yields the most in a decade . the next hurdle comes wednesday , when treasury auctions $ 20 billion of 10-year notes . u. s. sovereign issuance is expected to rise broadly in 2018 on the back of the budget deficit and recently passed tax legislation . meanwhile , support for lower yields may wane as the federal reserve reduces its balance sheet and other central banks contemplate exit strategies . ",
        "the bank of japan 's decision to trim its regular purchase of longer-dated debt sparked some nervousness among traders and helped spark the move higher in u. s. yields . while investors are right to expect a longer-term shift toward normalization by the boj , the most recent move by the central bank does n't have any new policy implication , said junko nishioka , chief economist at sumitomo mitsui banking corp. . in tokyo and a former boj official . yields kept rising higher as investors ramped up bets on quicker inflation . the 10-year breakeven rate , a proxy for the annual inflation rate the market expects for the next decade , climbed tuesday to as high as 2.05 percent , the highest in 10 months . ",
        "the increase shows traders may be bracing for friday 's consumer price index data , which some see as the final hurdle to elevated treasury yields . yet even if they keep climbing , the consensus is for 10-year yields to remain below minerd 's 3 percent line in the sand for a bear market . the median forecast in a bloomberg survey calls for the rate to climb to 2.92 percent at year-end .
