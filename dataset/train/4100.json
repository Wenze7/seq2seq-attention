        "struggling online news site mashable is set to be bought by ziff davis , a subsidiary of tech company j2 global , a spokesman said tuesday . the once-vaunted outlet , which was valued at $ 250 million less than two years ago , will be sold for less than $ 50 million according to recode , which first reported the acquisition . mashable has been in trouble for several months after failing to live up to huge growth rates it had promised investors . much of the decline is attributable to google and facebook 's growing chokehold on the online advertising market . ",
        "the existence of talks between the two parties was reported by the wall street journal last month . recode reported that ziff davis plans to ax around 50 positions and refocus mashable on technology , which was its niche before it branched out to other areas including politics and pop culture . ziff davis is known for managing several highly specialized sites including askmen , pcmag and ign in its four core areas of technology , gaming , healthcare , and shopping . mashable 's founder pete cashmore , who started the site as a blog in 2005 when he was 19 , will remain at the company .
