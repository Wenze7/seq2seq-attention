        "as soon as the temperatures sank below freezing last week , i started craving the pasta bolognese at giacomo 's . it 's my go-to grown-up version of the spaghetti and meat sauce that warmed and comforted me as a kid in my mother 's winter kitchen , hanging around the big paul revere skillet she used on our mint-green electric stove , breathing in the scents of tomato and garlic , ground beef and onion . i took that treasured recipe off to college with me , where the carbs and the tantalizing aromas soothed the occasional bout of homesickness . ",
        "in the fullness of time , i learned that my all-american version of spaghetti sauce was very different from its italian model : the ragu bolognese simmered with a finer mince of varied meats and vegetables , smoothed out with a bit of cream or milk , fortified with a little wine , touched with tomato rather than swamped with it . i fell in love all over again . today , my favorite houston bolognese is the version lynette hawkins uses on flat ribbons of tagliatelle made in-house at giacomo 's , her friendly trattoria on a corner where upper kirby borders river oaks . ",
        "with its mix of pork and beef , its earthy current of carrot and onion , it 's more finely tuned than the sauce i grew up with , but every bit as much of a soul-soother on a cold , miserable night . top 100 houston restaurants : see alison cook 's rankingsyou can get a $ 9 half order , and i always start out thinking , `` yeah , i 'll have that , '' before cratering and getting a whole $ 16 plateful . even that never feels like quite enough because the bolognese is so good . ",
        "i love the slight bite of the thin noodles ; the interesting selection of mostly italian wines hawkins maintains to go along ; and oh , yes , the sprightly insalata di tre cavoli that 's made for the wintry months . it 's a gorgeous chiffonade of brassicas - raw brussels sprouts , kale and savoy cabbage , all dressed with banyuls vinegar and tart verjus , all as clean and sparkling as you please . at six bucks , it 's a bargain . you 'll need dessert , of course . this month , hawkins seasonal offering is a soft , dense-crumbled almond cake spangled with blood orange on top , served with vanilla bean gelato and a sweet/tart blood orange syrup . ",
        "it 's very fine , and as a bonus , your purchase benefits the rescued pets movement , a cause dear to hawkins ' heart . when i finally departed giacomo 's last wednesday night , the temperature had dropped below freezing again and the roads had started to ice up . i did n't care . i had had a bolognese attitude adjustment that lasted all the way home , and then some .
