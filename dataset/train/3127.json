        "if you are in the market for a hybrid suv , you might want to wait until the 2018 lexus rx hybrid lands . word is that some documents have surfaced showing a massive price cut for the 2018-year model . that base price is tipped in the documents to be up to $ 7,340 cheaper than the previous model . however , there is a catch to the lower price , you will give up standard equipment and the vehicle is still far from cheap . even with the massive price cut , the starting price is $ 46,690 including destination . ",
        "what you will give up in the lower base price is standard heated and ventilated leather seats . you will need to add in $ 640 for the heated and ventilated seats and $ 1,110 if the premium package to add leather . the premium package also requires that buyers add the fancy moon roof that tacks on another $ 1,350 . the base model also gives up navigation and to add it back in you tack on $ 2,120 . buyers of the new base model also give up blind spot monitoring . that blind spot system will add another $ 1,056 to the ripe . ",
        "add all those options back on and your price rises to $ 52,975 which is still $ 1,055 less than the previous model . the 2018 rx will land in the coming months but is up for pre-order now . that seems like a lot of cash for an suv , but cheaper is cheaper and perhaps that savings will lure in more buyers .
