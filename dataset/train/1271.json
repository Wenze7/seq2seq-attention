        "vietnam 's main stock exchange , home to the nation 's benchmark vn-index , will remain shut for a second day on wednesday following a malfunction . ho chi minh city stock exchange said while the technical issue that occurred on monday has been solved , it needs to run tests with securities firms to ensure the `` safety and accuracy '' of the trading system . the exchange operator did n't provide a timing for when trading will resume , according to the statement on its website . the market was expected to resume trading today . trading was halted for a full day on tuesday after the malfunction happened in the last 30 minutes of the previous day 's session and orders could n't be matched . ",
        "the closure means stocks including those of vietnam dairy products jsc , petrovietnam gas jsc and vietjet aviation jsc are all unavailable to investors . the bourse averaged $ 319 million worth of trading each day over the past month , according to data compiled by bloomberg . `` there 's more things happening in vietnam than the exchange shutting for two days , '' said ruchir desai , a hong kong-based senior investment analyst at asia frontier capital ltd , which holds vietnamese stocks . `` most institutional investors in vietnam have a long-term view on the country and the macro outlook is positive .
