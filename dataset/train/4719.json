        "the last time microsoft tried releasing a phone , it did n't go so well . even so , rumors have been circulating for months about the possibility of a new phone from the company , the surface phone , which could actually be awesome . thursday , the world intellectual property organization granted microsoft a mysterious patent . the patent , filed in june , contains sketches and descriptions of what such a phone might look like . the patent is for a `` self-regulating hinge , '' a hinge that could grant additional flexibility to a dual-screened device , similar to lenovo yoga , but with screens on both parts . ",
        "the hinge would allow the two screens , when lined up , to make up a single display with no bezel in between . it could also allow a device to fold backwards and forwards into multiple positions : sometimes a laptop , sometimes a tablet , sometimes a tent . while the patent does n't say this hinge is intended for a phone rather than a tablet or laptop , the text mentions that the hinge can be made very compactly , allowing devices to fit in a user 's pocket . back to reality : this phone might not actually be a thing . ",
        "there 's little evidence that anything called a surface phone actually exists , and microsoft has certainly never indicated it 's making one . but even if such a phone is released , it might face some stiff competition , even after the novelty is filled . samsung recently submitted sketches of a foldable smartphone to the korean intellectual property office that would , if produced , probably blow dual-display competitors like zte 's axon m out of the water . samsung 's smartphone does n't appear to fold both ways , which might give it an advantage over a surface phone where pragmatics are concerned . ",
        "so keep an eye out for this sick-looking phone , but do n't hold your breath yet .   "
