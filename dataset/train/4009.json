",
        "naismith has made it clear that he would like a second chance at ibrox before the end of his career . the scotsman adds that the light blues are yet to make an offer for the scotland international , who has made just four appearances across all competitions for norwich this term . opinionnaismith would be a top addition for every side except celtic in the scottish premiership . rangers really can not let hearts beat them to the punch though and should make an offer for the scotland international as soon as possible . naismith is a clear improvement on eduardo herrera , the injured kenny miller and josh windass . ",
