        "what is the song that you most identify with new year 's eve ? you may not know the name of it ; however , i 'm sure you could hum the tune . it 's the scottish classic auld lang syne , and without doubt , it has become the musical score for new year 's celebrations around the world . auld lang syne means `` times gone by '' or `` old time 's sake . '' even it 's long , slow-drawn melody evokes a sense of reflective nostalgia . it serves to remind us to look not only ahead to the new year but also to look back . ",
        "it suggests we reflect on all the past year 's experiences and reminisce about the fond ones with family and friends . it 's a pretty common practice for people to make new year 's resolutions . however , part of why they are often unsuccessful within the first couple weeks of the new year is because , generally speaking , people make them without reflecting on the prior year . it is imperative to take the time to reflect on the previous year 's joys , disappointments , and challenges . it 's important to learn from them and use that knowledge to further improve upon of our life in the upcoming year . ",
        "take the old standby resolution , `` i 'm going to exercise more next year . '' that 's great ! sounds like a pretty simple-to-achieve resolution ; however , if you do n't look back at the last 12 months and ask yourself , `` why did n't i exercise ? '' chances are moving forward you wo n't have learned how to change the behavior for the desired results . reflect on why you did n't exercise . you may come to realize that you did n't make it a priority . it may be that you did n't have any workout gear . ",
        "perhaps you do n't like to exercise alone . armed with these discoveries , you can put forth the effort to make exercise a priority , shop for some new workout clothes , and join a gym . all these adjustments are bound to increase your chances for resolution success . and furthermore , because reflection is such an essential part of life learning , we need not limit our musing to only the first of the year . as i sit here reflecting upon 2017 , i realize that i did n't do nearly enough reflecting ! so , there 's my personal resolution # 1 -- build in time for daily reflection . ",
        "i wo n't use the excuse , `` i 'm too busy , and the next thing wo n't wait ! '' the truth is if you make the time , you have the time . in the past , i have allowed reflection to devolve into an optional activity . i will not let that happen again . i will make it mandatory at least once a week and set a specific time aside . that time will be sunday evenings . and , i will use the following list of prompts to help me stay on track with my weekly reflection . ",
        "• did the week go as intended ? • if no , why not ? • if yes , did i accomplish everything ` precisely ' as planned ? • if no , why not and shall i make adjustments ? • what were the problems facing me during the week ? • how can i avoid the same problems next week ? • what are my aspirations for the upcoming week ? • what are the steps i need to follow ? there , you see , my reflections upon reflecting have helped me to understand why i was n't successful in reflecting throughout the year and has hopefully helped me to find ways to do so and perhaps enjoy the success of new year 's resolution # 1 -- to reflect more . ",
        "in the vein of our last blog about christmas family traditions -- reflection and resolution can make for a fun family tradition on new year 's eve or day . even children as young as elementary-school aged can embrace the call for reflection and resolution . here 's how : create an interactive handout ; you can borrow ideas from pinterest . include categories such as favorite movies , books , teachers ; best experience ; most significant personal achievement ; gratitude for someone or something ; goals for the coming year . make a copy for each family member to fill in while you ring in the new year . ",
        "using the handout will help prompt every person 's feel-good memories from the year prior as well as their goals for the future . for children who are too small to write , have them draw pictures , or let them dictate their responses to a writing family member . after filling out the individual sheets , go around reading your responses , sharing and reminding each other of the `` wonderful times that have gone by . '' in recollecting of the past , you 'll also find this the perfect time to consider the coming year and how you resolve to improve it . ",
        "while i 'll grant you that this activity makes for an entertaining new year 's family tradition , just remember that reflecting as a family will be helpful the other 364 days of the year too ! so , if you 're reading this a little too late for the first day of the year -- there is no wrong day of the year for reflections -- or resolutions , for that matter ! happy 2018 !
