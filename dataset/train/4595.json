        "i met with the marketing lead of a tech startup recently . he was developing his 2018 marketing plan and wanted my feedback . the company 's business model was b2b with a focus on `` industry distributors '' as the sales force to the end customer , employers . my first question was , `` what is your value proposition ? '' he had a great timeline that included the appropriate different campaigns , content , and targeting . he told me the areas he would be focusing on . it was all good stuff but with a limited budget , it would not maximize the results . ",
        "he was highly underselling the value of their disruptive offering by promoting the wrong elements . what problems does it fixthe most important of all marketing dimensions is your actual value proposition . what is it that your product or service does better than anyone else ? why would someone want to buy what you have over what they are currently using ? if you can answer those , without listing features , you have your value proposition . as innovation guru , clayton christianson would ask , `` what job does it do ? '' this should answer questions such as : does it make my work easier ? ",
        "my life better ? is it cheaper ? can i expect higher performance levels using it ? particularly with b2b models , you are displacing an incumbent and must show a significant improvement to be worth the extra hassle of dealing with a new vendor . technology for technology 's sake is not good . although people may be wowed by it , your technology is not the value proposition , it simply enables it . technology for technology 's sake is not good . it must solve a problem . the more widespread the problem , the higher the potential for success . ",
        "the better it solves the problem the more people will be willing to spend . if you can clearly articulate the one to three customer `` pain points '' solved by your solution , you can get a buyer and you can easily enable your salesforce . the harder it is to articulate a value proposition , the more difficult it will be to sell your product . the value proposition sells itselfas you can see , your go-to-market strategy should be a natural extension of your product development . even if your salespeople can sell ice to an eskimo , it 's better to give them messaging that makes their job easier and you will sell much more . ",
        "it can be as simple as a clever rewording of the information you uncovered during the early design thinking stage . you will have an excellent message . with everything in development , it should be tested . it 's very easy to get early feedback by meeting face-to-face with the sales members and key customers . do this at least once prior to campaign launch to ensure success . lead with what your solution can do , not what makes it do it .
