        "san francisco artist carrie leeb snagged her favorite piece of furniture from an unusual spot : a church bathroom . `` i just thought it was the coolest -- the scandinavian style , the great lines -- so i called up the church , offered a donation of 25 bucks , and they accepted , '' says leeb , who lugged the piece on public transportation to her apartment . she later saw the same chair for sale at a designer thrift store , dangling a $ 900 price tag . for leeb , these moments are n't uncommon . ",
        "she sees life as a constant treasure hunt , and as an award-winning graphic designer and illustrator who has crafted covers for chronicle books and maps for magazines such as travel & leisure , she 's adept at finding inspiration in items other people would ordinarily disregard . `` i 'm a total scavenger , '' says leeb , who has been known to collect sticks and dryer lint for future projects . `` things that are easily overlooked can actually jog ideas for me . '' two years ago , after only a couple months of house hunting , she discovered one of her greatest treasures yet : a dated townhouse tucked away on a tree-lined duboce triangle street that she had long admired . ",
        "when the house went on the market , leeb jumped at the opportunity -- she was n't the highest bidder , but the owner chose her based on the heartfelt letter she submitted with her offer . the tri-level house had good bones , but the work leeb undertook was nothing short of a total renovation . carpet was ripped out , replaced with white oak hardwood floors . a dark and dated kitchen was gutted and opened up . new white corian counters and ikea cabinets and an ocean blue , recycled-glass backsplash by fireclay in san francisco give the space a crisp , glacial vibe . ",
        "for the loft , leeb built a wood-and-plexiglass railing to shine even more light through the house . the ground floor 's 12-foot windows illuminate with natural light the open-plan living room , dining room and kitchen , as well as the towering 16-foot gallery wall , which serves as a striking showcase of leeb 's art collection , where you can find an early photograph by oakland photographer todd hido , for example , hanging next to a typography print , `` be kind to other people , '' acquired during the rodney king protests in 1992 . you could say that the gallery wall sets the tone for this homegrown museum leeb has curated , where curiosities are highly prized : a lifelike papier-mâché cake sits on the kitchen counter . ",
        "framed pages from leeb 's lewd limericks , a book of salacious poetry by her grandfather , hang in the bathroom . shelves are filled with eclectic objects such as pieces of the berlin wall , a tiny black piano found on a street in paris , and a series of petri dishes containing butterfly wings or old ticket stubs . `` each represents a different memory or moment in life , '' says leeb , who shares the home with her son , milo , 16 , and ozzie , their irish terrier . leeb 's furniture is similar in fashion ; a mix of items she 's found on the street mingling with stuff she 's built herself . ",
        "those aforementioned sticks she collected ? they 've been cast in bronze and welded together to form a chair that now sits on her patio . `` i may have a chair fetish , '' she says . mismatched seats surround her boconcept dining table . the yellow , green and orange fiberglass herman miller originals scattered throughout the main room were purchased as a group at a garage sale for $ 20 . `` it 's so much more fun to make something or to find something with a story behind it , '' says leeb . `` when something has a history , it 's infinitely more interesting .
