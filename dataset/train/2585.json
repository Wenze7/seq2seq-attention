'' ",
        "coach cal will turn 59 on feb. . 10 , 2018 . at that point you 've got to think he has maybe 3-4 more years with the wildcats . the announcement should n't come as a surprise to those who are familiar with the wildcats current roster . right now they 've got a sophomore guard whose last name is calipari . kentucky coach john calipari has a favorite player : his son , brad -- michael carvell march 18 , 2017 . that 's right , john 's son might be a major reason as to why the coach thinks he 's still got some years left in the tank .
