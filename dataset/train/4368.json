        "there 's a great ted talk where a brain scientist explained what happened when she had a stroke . she did n't just experience it as a victim of a stroke , she was able to , in some way , use it as a personal research study . that 's a little how my move to new zealand has felt . i 'm accustomed to writing , talking , thinking , and processing all the time . it 's a part of my personality , part of my routine , part of how i see the world . i know it about myself and so do people that know me . ",
        "but something 's been shifting , and i 've tracking it . sort of like a personal research study . i , like a lot of people that write a lot , have a very reliable way of thinking about things : `` i had a thought . i should write it down . '' and that makes sense when it 's a big life event or a surprising event . but it can get silly when you 're dealing with wispy topics like self acceptance , or slowing down enough to find clarity . i 've had plenty of moments where a personal realization i decided to press into service as an important medium dot com thought leader essay probably should have just stayed in my personal journal , or been a quiet conversation amongst friends . ",
        "and i 'm sure to have many , many more . you do n't fundamentally change who you are , and until now i 've been super chatty . but as of today , right this moment , my move has altered me in one very noticeable way . when things happen , i do n't feel the same urge to share or analyze it . other people will do that . lots and lots of people . i 'm just watching the wheels go round and round . i really love to watch them roll .
