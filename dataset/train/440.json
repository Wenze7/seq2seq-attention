        "fifth & west residences , the 39-story , all-residential tower located downtown at 601 west avenue , topped off earlier this month and is predicting it will be austin 's next condo building to open , likely in fall of 2018 . developed by austin 's riverside resources , the 448-foot-tall tower was designed by dallas-based gda architects , with interiors by local firm michael hsu office of architecture . it 's bucking trends a little in that it has only residential units -- no first-floor restaurants or retail -- and only 154 of them at that . fifth & west has a total of 154 units , units range in size from 846 to 2,822 square feet , with an average of 1,754 square feet . ",
        "there is an average of 4.7 units per floor . prices range from $ 575,000 to over $ 2,090,000 . half the units in the building have been pre-sold . in addition to its status as a purely residential building , fifth & west is also departing a bit from the most common , boxy style of residential towers . instead , it is triangular -- a shape that builders chose to maximize views . according to architect michael hsu , the shape and interiors were created to enhance , first and foremost , the experiences of individual residents . ",
        "`` fifth & west is a large building , '' hsu explained , `` but with a very small community within . so the idea of intimacy has been a part of this project from the beginning . with no restaurant or retail storefronts , it 's a very private place . this heavily informed the interior spaces , which were designed to encourage a closeness among neighbors when they want it , but also distance and anonymity if desired . `` we also aimed to bring a genuine warmth to the interiors , '' hsu said , `` with generous displays of naturality all throughout the building . ",
        "we wanted to capture the woods , the natural green spaces that surround austin , and bring them in . we strove to create a space truly native to this city , that celebrated the people who lived here . it 's a building that ca n't be from anywhere else . it can only exist here . ''   "
