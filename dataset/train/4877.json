        "i 've always wondered what makes people do things . most of the time , i do n't even know why i do things . i 've been trying to figure that stuff out . about a year ago , i took over the organizer role for a `` self improvement '' meetup group in pittsburgh . i renamed it the `` life hackers '' meetup . since then , the meetup list membership has grown to 1195 people . i 've been trying to figure out why people join the meetup , but never come . every month , i schedule a meetup with a new topic and prepare a bunch of material . ",
        "usually , about 6 people say they 're coming , and 2 actually show up . this month i thought i 'd finally figured out something that people were interested in ! i had 16 people sign up , and 4 people were on the waiting list . my topic was `` side projects for fun and profit . '' part of my motivation for that was a comment by my friend alyssa that a `` side hustle '' is nothing but a second job , and we should just call it that . but it seems to me there 's a spectrum , so i made up a diagram to talk about at the meetup : i came up with a whole single-spaced page full of ideas for things that fall in the middle of the spectrum , that you could do yourself but that might turn into something larger . ",
        "i bought and skimmed a handful of ebooks and read some blogs , but mostly i just wanted to have a discussion -- i really do n't want a side project myself . i already have a full time job and am spending the rest of my time writing a novel . that lets me finally circle back to the subject of this blog . of the 16 people who were signed up , only 3 showed up -- and one of them was actually on the wait list . so in this case , 1200 people said they were interested in something , 20 people said they would do it , and 3 people actually did it . ",
        "why did n't the rest of them ? i do n't know , but i have a theory . in kelly mcgonigal 's terrific book `` the willpower instinct '' , i read about a psychologist named hal ersner-hershfield . he was interested in how much people identified with their future selves . why is this important ? a 2010 survey found that 34 % of adult americans have absolutely zero retirement savings . what ersner-hershfield discovered was that people who identified more with their future selves were more likely to have retirement savings than those who felt their future self was essentially a stranger . ",
        "and that 's my theory right there , about why people say they 'll do things and then do n't do them . they 're not saying they 'll do it , they 're saying future self will do it . because , you know , future self is somebody who does stuff like that . more importantly , it 's not self 's problem . my future self will write a much better blog next time , just you wait and see . side project spectrumthis has been another 1 minute blog . i 've been writing these every tuesday and friday for ever .
