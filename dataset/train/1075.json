        "sacramento -- city police are enforcing a new california law to help prevent deadly accidents , and as it turns out , many are actually caused by pedestrians . `` i looked . i did n't see anything coming and the next thing you know this woman came that far from running me over , '' shirlene darby said while trying to cross the street . there 's been a big spike in the number of people killed on sacramento streets . on average , the city has about 10 fatal pedestrian accidents each year , but last year 19 people lost their lives while walking . ",
        "`` one fatality is too many , '' said sacramento police department sgt. vance chandler . officers are launching a new outreach effort called `` wait for the walk . '' `` we got a lot of complaints out here , people not following the rules , jaywalkers , '' an officer told one pedestrian . on wednesday , police conducted high-visibility enforcement in areas known to have problem pedestrians . part of the effort is education with officers handing out a warning . `` technically you 're in violation today , '' the officer told the man who crossed in the red . ",
        "`` so instead of giving you a ticket , i 'm going to give you a crosswalk flyer . '' before , pedestrians were n't allowed to cross a street once the walk signal began a countdown or flashing red . but now you 're allowed to cross as long as you make it across before the clock expires -- if it has a countdown . if it 's just a red flashing hand , you must stop and wait for the box to turn white . police say following the law and being alert is key . `` your safety is far more important than that text or whatever you 're doing on your cell phone , '' chandler said . ",
        "the city is also installing new crosswalk signals to help improve pedestrian safetycity leaders have set a goal of having zero fatal accidents by the year 2027 .   "
