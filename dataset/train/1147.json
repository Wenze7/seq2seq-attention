        "can you score top marks in our tough picture quiz ? how well do you know your city ? well ? fairly well ? not at all ? this fun quiz should go some way to finding the answer . we 've compiled a series of questions - some easy , some not-so-easy - documenting how the face of chester has been transformed down the decades . because so much has changed since the romans rumbled in and set up a fort here in 79ad , we 've kept things fairly simple and restricted our questions to buildings and landmarks which were features of the city skyline in the last 200 years or so . ",
        "some of the places you 'll see here are much-missed . others were eyesores that cestrians were n't sorry to see the back of . some of the buildings are still standing , but have changed in some way as the years have gone by . so it 's over to you . enjoy the quiz , and do n't forget to share your results on twitter and facebook to see if your friends can beat your score . this quiz works best on desktop computers or using dedicated mobile browsers . if you have opened this page via twitter on mobile please reload it in a dedicated browser .
