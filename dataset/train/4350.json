",
        "finding your breakeven point to decide when to take social securityto find your breakeven point , you need to know how much benefits are increased , or reduced , by claiming early or by waiting to claim benefits . the amount of increase or deduction is based on your fra , which is 67 for people born after 1960 . if you claim benefits less than 36 months before fra , benefits are reduced by five-ninths of 1 % for each month before fra . if you claim benefits more than 36 months before fra , benefits are further reduced by five-twelfths of 1 % .

        "here 's simple math to find this number : lower annual benefitx extra years of benefits / difference between higher and lower annual benefitfor example , if your benefits at 67 would have been $ 18,000 annually , a 30 % reduction for claiming at 62 would leave you with $ 12,600 annually -- $ 5,400 less per year than you 'd receive if you waited . five extra years of benefits gives you $ 63,000 , so divide this by $ 5,400 to get your breakeven point of 11 years and eight months . after receiving a higher benefit for 11 years and eight months , you 'd have made up for $ 63,000 in missed income . ",
        "every month thereafter , the extra money is money you 'd have missed out on by claiming early . if you expect to live past 78 , you 'd be better off waiting . should you claim social security benefits early ? there are lots of factors to consider when deciding whether to claim social security benefits , including whether you could claim benefits on your spouse 's work record . still , by calculating your breakeven point , you 're one step closer to making a fully informed choice . it 's up to you to decide if you want to claim early to get guaranteed extra income , or wait so you do n't face a reduced benefit for the rest of your life .
