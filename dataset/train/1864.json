        "new york - international flights were suspended into a flooded terminal at new york 's flagship airport on sunday , flung into chaos after a water main broke during brutally cold temperatures following a deadly winter storm . gushing water compounded meltdown at john f. kennedy international airport , where furious passengers have camped out for days as a result of equipment damaged by the storm and a backlog of flights . water poured from the ceiling and the arrivals area was submerged by standing water , through which a few intrepid passengers picked their way gingerly , according to footage broadcast by cnn . ",
        "international flights into terminal 4 were suspended and the water main break occurred just before 2 pm , said a spokesman for the port authority of new york and new jersey that runs the airport . the west end of terminal four lay under about three inches of water , where maintenance crews were mopping up , with police and fire crews on site , the spokesman told afp . the cause of the break is being investigated , he added . terminal 4 is used by more than 30 airlines , including air india , china airlines , delta , egyptair , el al , emirates , etihad , klm royal dutch , singapore airlines , thomas cook and virgin atlantic . ",
        "on saturday the airport was forced to close terminal 1 , which serves the likes of air france , japan airlines and lufthansa , to international arrivals in an attempt to get on top of the backlog . but tempers have flared among furious travellers , forced to sleep on the floor of terminals , with others stranded on planes for hours waiting to access a gate and massive delays in baggage claim . `` i am so angry , words can not even express how i feel right now , '' one stranded female traveler told nbc television before the water leak . ",
        "`` it 's getting like a madhouse , '' traveler steven litvin told nbc , leaving with his wife eight hours after their plane landed -- with only half their luggage . - no sleep - `` we 're tired , '' he said . `` we 're frustrated . we did n't get any sleep and we still do n't know where our bags are . nobody knows anything . `` ninety-four flights were cancelled at jfk on saturday and 17 diverted , as the extreme cold and storm recovery `` created a cascading series of issues , '' said the port authority . ",
        "`` frigid temperatures continue to cause equipment failures and slower than normal operations . customers may experience residual delays , particularly for international flights , '' it said . jfk was one the parts of new york that saw record lows for january 7 , including four degrees fahrenheit . the big freeze follows a storm thursday dubbed a `` bomb cyclone , '' which has been blamed for at least 22 reported deaths in the united states . boston , which saw some of the heaviest snow from the storm , froze with a sunday morning low of minus two degrees fahrenheit -- matching the previous january 7 record in 1896 . ",
        "massachusetts marked three record lows on sunday , with providence and worcester frozen at minus two and minus seven respectively , breaking records last set in 1912 and 1942 , the national weather service said . the bitter cold is forecast to remain on the east coast sunday with highs below freezing as far south as parts of north carolina . forecasters predicted ice accumulations from a band of freezing rain from missouri through ohio and tennessee into the mid-atlantic , warning of hazardous road conditions before temperatures rise monday . extreme cold advisories were also lifted in parts of eastern canada , albeit with midday temperatures still at minus four degrees in quebec and heavy snowfall due in southern ontario , and newfoundland and labrador .
