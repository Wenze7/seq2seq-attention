        "in 2017 , i spent many months working on a collection of essays culled from my website . i wanted to publish this book as a `` best of '' alongside several new essays on the same theme of relationships , human nature , and sex . the book is 50,000 words long and it lives on my computer . i have lost interest in publishing it . i am a fiction writer . i have enjoyed writing essays as they have sharpened my writing skills and helped me put some of my ideas into words but ultimately , i like to create characters and stories to live out the ideas i have . ",
        "instead of `` convincing you '' of an idea through an essay , i want you to `` live the idea '' through my fiction so that the idea is your own , even if only for the span of time you suspend disbelief to exist in the world of my making . i will probably publish this book eventually , along with my book of essays on feminine badassery and owning your shit as a woman . but first i want to finish some fiction . i 've had a story clunking around my head for a long time . ",
        "it has a romantic element but is n't a romance . because i 'm so good at writing about the sexual and emotional dynamic between men and women , many have encouraged me to write romance and i just ca n't . i like my characters tortured . i do n't like happy endings . i do n't like anything that feels contrived or easy and that 's how romance is to me . i 'm not dissing romance as a genre . just like i would n't diss science fiction , but i know that these genres are not for me . ",
        "after putting together this story , it 's many layers , developing the characters , plotting out the story and detangling the timeline , the final piece for me to figure out was the point of view . to my shock i will be writing this novel with a male narrator . i hope i can pull it off ! it 's really his story . my next shock was the surprise ending which hit me when i was trying to find a resolution to a certain plot point . i wo n't spoil it , but it 's a twist that will make you want to go back and read the book again to see if you see it coming . ",
        "i love these kinds of twists and i hope you love it too ! i ca n't wait to tackle this book . i am hoping my discipline and stamina are up to the task because i 'm guessing it will be a doozy of a saga . the story spans twenty-five years , three locations , has nine main characters will full stories of their own , three love stories , a car crash , a hustler , a road trip and lots of sex ! in the end , the genre became obvious to me and i 'm not sure why it took so long for me to see it but it 's a psychological thriller . ",
        "it 's an emotional roller coaster of hope and despair , love , hate , sex and fear . it will be painfully true when you wish it were fantasy and fantasy where you wish it were true and i hope it leaves you exhilarated , exhausted and craving more . i 've outlined the story , fleshed out the timeline , built the characters and locations and all i have to do now is write the damn thing . once this book is finished , i will go back and publish the essays . i just do n't want to be that dating advice girl . ",
        "i really am no expert in dating . it 's sort of ridiculous to take advice on love from a perpetually single girl , you know ! but they were fun to write and do have some value so i will keep them online and will collect them in print form once i 'm established as a ` serious ' writer . ha . let 's hope ! so , i may be quiet this year . if i am quiet , that means i 'm working and that 's a good thing . if you want to make sure you know about the release , sign up for my newsletter and check back here . ",
        "i hope you have a wonderful 2018 and meet all your goals also ! much love , kitten .   "
