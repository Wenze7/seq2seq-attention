        "joining the growing group of stars speaking out against sexual misconduct in hollywood , justin baldoni opened up about sexual harassment during a recent interview with glamour -- and helped to powerfully expand the #metoo campaign in the process . the jane the virgin actor , a vocal advocate for gender equality , revealed that he was propositioned by a producer when he was just starting out in the industry . at 21 , baldoni reportedly went to a los angeles spa after completing work on his first show , where a man approached him in the hot tub and began expounding on how he could advance baldoni 's career . ",
        ". as baldoni claimed to glamour : baldoni 's allegations highlight a crucial part of the ongoing conversation . while allegations against industry power players like harvey weinstein , brett ratner , and louis c. k. have critically impacted abuse culture , they 've largely elevated the voices of women -- and more specifically , white women . that 's a momentous , necessary stride , but it overlooks the large swath of others who experience abuse . that includes men as well as women of color -- the latter of which gabrielle union called out during a new york times interview earlier this week . ",
        "she said , that her and baldoni 's comments hit so close to one another feels less like a coincidence and more like an urgent reminder . it can be easy to celebrate how much progress has been made -- and justly so -- but we need to keep pushing until everyone is heard , no matter what their race , gender , or status . that 's not to devalue the stories of those that have come forward in any way -- especially since men have long been prioritized over women of any color -- but simply to broaden the perspective , and both baldoni and union are helping to accomplish that . ",
        "of course , baldoni is aware that he comes from a place of privilege . he continued to glamour , . i mean i was stronger and bigger than the guy , and the fact that no one is going to believe you if you 're a woman because your voice is already not heard . `` and he also knows that as a man , he must use that privilege to improve the culture and create safe spaces , even if it makes him , or those around him , uncomfortable . `` it 's so much easier to stay in this little box and not say something wrong , but then there 's no growth , '' baldoni said while recently speaking to bustle about his new gender-upending talk show , man enough . ",
        "`` if one of your boys admits to raping a girl , then you better stand up and f*cking say something , you have to . it 's your obligation , not as a man , but as a human being . '' but baldoni told glamour that he 's experienced harassment from both men and women , which only reinforces that everyone , no matter how you identify , must do better in treating one another , in supporting one another , and in lifting people up . we may have opened up the floodgates , but we still have to keep swimming .
