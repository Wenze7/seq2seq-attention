        "photo : jeff gross/getty imagessean mcvay is rightfully getting a great deal of credit for transforming the los angeles rams from perennial throw-rugs into the champions of the nfc west . as the rams prepare to host to the atlanta falcons on saturday night -- the prodigal franchise 's first home playoff game in l. a. proper in 39 years -- here 's a question worth pondering : how did mcvay so quickly turn the nfl 's least-efficient offense into one of the the league 's best ? just one season after scoring a league-low 14.0 points per game , the rams led the nfl by scoring at a clip of 29.9 points per game this season . ",
        "it 's conventional wisdom at this point to celebrate the 31-year-old mcvay for being an innovative wunderkind . and it 's true he developed a scheme that plays to the strengths of his personnel . but what exactly does that mean ? how does that apply when it comes to jared goff , who looked like a surefire bust as a rookie but is now every bit the franchise quarterback gm les snead hoped he 'd be when he traded up to draft goff first overall ? it 's a copycat league , as the saying goes , and mcvay and offensive coordinator matt lafleur have found success by blending different concepts different teams have been using in different ways . ",
        "to wit : i 'll get to what some of that looks like in a bit . but some personnel reinforcements have indeed helped , too . the rams ' biggest and most consequential offseason signing was the addition of left tackle andrew whitworth . but late in free agency , l. a. also signed veteran center john sullivan , who had been a backup in washington , where mcvay was an assistant before the rams hired him . that connection has proved vital to goff 's development , as goff acknowledged to the los angeles times : `` it takes a lot off my shoulders for sure , with his ability to understand defenses and make a lot of calls up front . ",
        "... if i see something , and overrule , i can . ninety-nine percent of the time he 's right . '' the rams also made some changes at receiver by adding robert woods in free agency , drafting cooper kupp in the third round , and trading for sammy watkins . one major result , according to the l. a. times , has been a 36-percent decrease in dropped passes by the rams ' receivers . but the team 's leading receiver -- and the fulcrum of the offense -- is running back todd gurley , who returned to his outstanding rookie form and then some this year . ",
        "gurley led the league in yards from scrimmage , and his 1,305 rushing yards was a close second to chiefs rookie kareem hunt 's 1,327 . but gurley 's 64 catches led the rams , and his 788 receiving yards and six receiving tds both ranked second on the team . and this is where mcvay 's and lafleur 's scheme kicks into gear : by finding a variety of ways to get gurley the ball , goff is able to use play-action often -- and to his advantage . per pro football focus , goff used play-fakes on 29.1 percent of his throws this season , second only to the texans ' deshaun watson 's 30.3 percent . ",
        "goff 's play-action passer rating of 109.3 ranked ninth , and his 1,446 play-action passing yards led the league . as andy benoit noted over at sports illustrated , the rams ' use of a outside-zone blocking system -- i. e. , one in which all of the linemen move in a given direction in unison , thus pulling more defenders with them -- further works in concert with that heavy use of play-action . and the rams did all this even as they used an `` 11 '' personnel grouping on a league-high 75 percent of their plays this season . ",
        "tavon austin caught just 13 passes , far and away the lowest total in his five-year career . but he has emerged as a rushing threat and as a decoy : austin averaged 4.6 yards per attempt on 59 carries . the threat he poses by going in motion before the snap has proved to be invaluable . that kind of pre-snap movement freezes the defense -- will austin get it on a jet sweep or not ? -- in addition to creating space for gurley to do his thing . here , on a third-and-11 against the seahawks in week 5 , the rams had austin line up in the backfield and just gave it to him : gifmcvay has also made clever use of the rule that allows coaches to communicate with quarterbacks via the in-helmet headset until the play clock hits 15 seconds . ",
        "the rams sometimes use this to their advantage by breaking their huddle quickly and lining up so mcvay can diagnose the defense and relay what he sees to goff . rather comically , former nfl quarterback chris simms called this `` cheating '' and `` immoral . '' but then-arizona cardinals head coach bruce arians took the air out of any budding controversy by acknowledging during the week of a cardinals-rams game that the rams are n't even the first team to do this . then there are the formations and route combinations the get flipped around to create space for receivers depending on what the defense may show , as this excellent thread demonstrates : si 's benoit further described how this functions given the formations the rams use : this team , more than any other , aligns its receivers tight to the formation , inside the field numbers . ",
        "those tighter splits eliminate the sideline , giving each l. a. receiver a two-way go . defenders must cover more ground and more route possibilities ; because of the clustered spacing , they 're more susceptible to rub and pick routes . mcvay builds a lot of these rubs and picks into the beginnings of his plays by aligning receivers close to one another , and those receivers get open quickly . it 's what the patriots have perfected in recent years . it 's how you beat man coverage . a personal favorite of mine was the double slant the rams ran on the goal line to get the ball to watkins for a td against the 49ers way back in week 2 . ",
        "there 's simply no way for the outside defender to get inside fast enough to stop this : gifmcvay is pretty much a shoo-in to be coach of the year . but in a wide-open nfc in which the top-seeded eagles wo n't have carson wentz due to injury , mcvay also has the rams in position to possibly achieve much more .
