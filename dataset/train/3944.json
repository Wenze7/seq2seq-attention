        "montgomery , ala. . -- after all the charges , denials , claims and promises , alabama voters have had their say . polls closed across the state tuesday night after a scandal-stained senate election campaign that tested the limits of party loyalty in the age of president donald trump and -- win or lose -- promised significant political consequences for republicans everywhere . at the center of the special election was fiery christian conservative roy moore -- `` judge moore '' to his supporters . the 70-year-old republican was twice ousted as state supreme court chief justice after flouting federal law . ",
        "this year he attempted a political resurrection against party officials horrified by accusations that he was guilty of sexual misconduct with teenage girls when he was in his 30s . in moore 's path stood democrat doug jones , 63 , a former u. s. attorney best known for prosecuting two ku klux klansmen who killed four black girls in birmingham 's infamous 1963 church bombing . he was trying to become the first democrat in a quarter century to win an alabama senate seat . the stakes are high for alabama and perhaps higher for the national republican party , which faces two painful outcomes : the gop could lose a senate seat in a deep-red state that would energize democrats everywhere ; or the party could win tuesday 's election and welcome a man accused of sordid conduct to the u. s. senate just as republicans prepare to defend their congressional majorities in 2018 . ",
        "the election has also renewed lingering tension between trump , who backed moore in the campaign 's final days , and the republicans who control congress , senate majority leader mitch mcconnell chief among them , who called for moore to abandon the campaign promise an ethics investigation if he 's elected . on the ground in alabama on tuesday , those who stood in line to cast their ballots were far more focused on the candidates than the broader political fallout . `` he 's not a truthful man , '' 69-year-old mary multrie said of moore . multrie , who works in a children 's hospital , was not influenced by accusations of sexual misconduct against moore , she said , because she already did not like him . ",
        "`` he talks about god , but you do n't see god in his actions . '' she was among more than two dozen people queued up in the chilly morning air at legion field , a predominantly black precinct in birmingham , to cast their ballots . al bright , 63 , who does refrigeration repair , said he voted for moore . `` regardless of the allegations against him , i believe he is an honorable man , '' bright said . teresa brown , a 53-year-old administrative assistant , said she preferred jones , in part , because he would be better positioned to work across party lines . ",
        "`` we do n't need a pedophile in there , '' brown added . tuesday 's winner will take over the seat previously held by attorney general jeff sessions through 2020 . one seat alone will not change the balance of power in the senate , where republicans hold a 52-48 majority , but a loss would make it harder for trump to push legislation through a bitterly divided congress . a gop loss would also give democrats a clearer path to a senate majority in 2018 -- albeit a narrow one -- in an election cycle where democrats are far more optimistic about seizing control of the house of representatives . ",
        "ultimately , tuesday 's contest came down to which side better motivated its supporters to vote . alabama secretary of state john merrill said turnout likely would not exceed 25 percent of registered voters . jones fought to cobble together an unlikely coalition of african-americans , liberal whites and moderate republicans . `` this is an important time in alabama 's history , and we feel very confident where we are and how this is going to turn out , '' the democrat said after casting his ballot tuesday . moore , who largely avoided public events in the final weeks of the race and spent far less money on advertising than his opponent , was counting on the state 's traditional republican leanings and the strength of his passionate evangelical christian supporters . ",
        "moore sidestepped questions about sexual misconduct as he arrived at his polling place on horseback . democrats were not supposed to have a chance in alabama , one of the most republican-leaning states in the nation . trump defeated democrat hillary clinton here by nearly 28 points just 13 months ago . yet moore had political baggage that repelled some moderate republicans even before allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced . virtually the entire republican establishment , trump included , supported moore 's primary opponent , sen. luther strange in september . trump 's former chief strategist , steve bannon , was one of the only early high-profile moore backers . ",
        "moore was removed from his position as state supreme court chief justice the first time after he refused to remove a boulder-sized ten commandments monument at the state court building . the second time , he was permanently suspended for urging state probate judges to refuse marriage licenses to same-sex couples . in his final pitch before polls opened across the state , jones called the choice a `` crossroads '' and asked that `` decency '' prevail . `` we 've had this history in the past , going down the road that ... has not been productive , '' jones said . ",
        "`` we 've lagged behind in industry . we 've lagged behind in education . we 've lagged behind in health care . it 's time we take the road that 's going to get us on the path to progress . '' by kim chandler and steve peoples .   "
