        "we have all seen the stephen hawkings advertisement regarding the smart pill . problem is there is little evidence to support it and it ignores the fundamental driver of iq , which is your genotype and genetic expression . further it does n't address the reason the brain does not improve and actually deteriorates over time ... in a word , inflammation . more specifically , lack of resolution to that inflammatory damage . the study below demonstrates fish consumption combined with time increases iq . now we know it works , we can make it better . how ? ",
        "a few ways , control insulin , better grade of fish oil and proper dosage ! voila , iq improvement plan . how much , there was an 11-point difference over time in the study . so i am guessing it would have been quite a bit more on a proper protocol . best of all it genetic expression is cumulative , including generational ! scottish iq study confirms cognitive value of fish oillife enhancement products , an innovative manufacturer of nutritional supplements with unique formulations for memory ... www . life-enhancement . comso as the imagination loosely correlates each nutritional constituent with a `` half truth '' the science indicates that its inflammation and lack of resolution that needs to be present . ",
        "many of these `` iq enhancers '' have to work against a deteriorating foundation . like trying to mop up a puddle derived from a leaky faucet . why not just fix the glitch and in the process add to iq by generating internal resolution ? so most the past wellness `` promises '' have fell short due to the lack of scientific understanding . at some point you have to wave the white flag and denounce the institutional health power grab that establishes an institution first , based on hypothesis , and hopes that knowledge follows . time for the top down , institution-based regime to fall and the truly knowledge based `` institutions '' to rise . ",
        "further , promoting nutritional constituents in isolation ignores this understanding and is destined to fall short of full potential . we are at critical junctures with converging historical political and economic cycles so it should n't be long before that occurs . so let your genotype be `` healed '' and your genes express more positively ! scott fabyanic , mba , certified in anti-inflammatory nutritiondisclosure : nothing in this story constitutes advice of any kind . short and sweet !
