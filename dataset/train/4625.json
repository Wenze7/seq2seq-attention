        "facebook says it will book the revenues it earns from selling advertising to kiwi companies in new zealand in future . the change is part of worldwide move by facebook to restructure its accounting and appears a major victory for policy-makers concerned about the way facebook and many other technology multinationals have structured their affairs to minimise tax . facebook is believed to earn tens of millions of dollars from new zealand firms which buy advertising on its popular social media platform , but has previously invoiced them from ireland , which has a company tax rate of 12.5 per cent and has allowed tax loopholes . ",
        "a facebook spokeswoman confirmed facebook new zealand would book revenue from sales made to new zealand advertisers . read more : * steady as she goes in revenue minister 's approach to multinational tax facebook had no timings on when that will be as yet , she said . in 2014 , labour 's then associate finance spokesman , david clark , turned heads by suggesting a future labour government might try to shut facebook down in new zealand because of the low amount of tax it paid here , before downplaying that threat . the last publically-available accounts filed by facebook nz showed it paid $ 43,261 in tax in 2014 on the $ 1.2 million of revenue it received from facebook ireland in return for the services it provided the firm . ",
        "the switch to booking revenues locally should greatly boost facebook nz 's pre-tax income . it is not the only multinational that has minimised the tax it pays in new zealand by booking sales revenue overseas , but other businesses have been making changes elsewhere . google began booking its australian sales in australia part way through last year , which immediately resulted in it doubling the amount of tax it paid in australia to a$ 32 million . that followed a tightening-up of australian legislation dealing with multinational tax arrangements . google still books the bulk of its new zealand sales through singapore and spokesman nic hopkins would not say whether it was considering a similar change here . ",
        "microsoft , which also books the bulk of its new zealand sales overseas , would also not comment on whether a change was in the wings for its local business . the government introduced a bill to parliament last week which is designed to tighten up on a range of multinational tax practices , including tax residency rules . however , its impact on individual businesses may not become clear until after the legislation takes effect -- if at all , given tax secrecy rules . facebook chief financial officer dave wehner wrote in a blog post on tuesday that its global change would `` provide more transparency to governments and policy makers around the world who have called for greater visibility over the revenue associated with locally supported sales in their countries '' . ",
        "facebook would move to a local selling structure `` in countries where we have an office to support sales to local advertisers '' , he said . facebook 's spokeswoman confirmed that included new zealand . `` in simple terms , this means that advertising revenue supported by our local teams will no longer be recorded by our international headquarters in dublin , but will instead be recorded by our local company in that country , '' wehner said . wehner had appeared to indicate there might be exceptions to the way the changes were applied , saying `` each country is unique '' . ",
        "dublin in ireland would remain the base for facebook 's international business , he said .   "
