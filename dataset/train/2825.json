        "denver -- defenseman tyson barrie scored twice , semyon varlamov stopped 30 shots -- even getting a little help from the posts along the way -- and the colorado avalanche beat the pittsburgh penguins 4-2 on monday night . j.t. compher also scored and mikko rantanen sealed the win with a late empty-netter as the avalanche knocked off the penguins for the second time in a week to sweep the season series . barrie scored his first goal since oct. . 13 in the first period . he followed that up with another in the second for his fifth career two-goal game . ",
        "chad ruhwedel and evgeni malkin found the net for the penguins , who finished a three-game trip with a 1-2 mark . pittsburgh was a little unfortunate in the second period when josh archibald 's shot trickled through the pads of varlamov , clanged off the post , stood on its edge for a moment and fell down on the line for no goal . malkin lined in a shot just 1:25 into the third to make it 3-2 . ryan reaves nearly tied it late in the third , but his wrist shot down low clanged off the post . ",
        "matthew murray was pulled in favor of an extra skater with around 1:40 left . seconds later , rantanen scored an easy goal . compher took a baseball swing to knock in a puck out of the air to give the avalanche a 3-1 lead late in the second . earlier in the period , colorado capitalized on a cross-check penalty on ian cole as barrie scored from the blue line . the penguins entered 23 of 23 in killing penalties over their last eight contests . barrie staked the avalanche to an early lead in the opening period when he scored his 50th career goal on a wrist shot over the glove of murray . ",
        "it lasted all of 5:35 before ruhwedel 's shot hit varlamov in the right arm , got lost in his jersey for a moment and then rolled in off varlamov 's left skate . compher thought he scored late in the first , even raising his hands , but the official disallowed it when sven andrighetto made incidental contact with murray near the goal . the avs were without top defenseman erik johnson as he served the first of a two-game suspension for boarding tampa bay lightning forward vladislav namestnikov on saturday . the suspension will cost johnson $ 64,516 . ",
        "`` no excuse from my end -- a dangerous play i should n't make , '' johnson said monday morning . `` it 's an expensive mistake . `` notes : penguins rw patric hornqvist was sent back to pittsburgh to be evaluated for an upper body injury , coach mike sullivan told reporters at morning practice . ... c dominik simon was a scratch with an illness . ... avs f alexander kerfoot returned to the lineup after missing three games with a foot injury . he 's also wearing shot shields over his skates for added protection .
