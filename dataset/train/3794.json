",
        "`` the renunciation of him and his work , no doubt , has some purpose . but it 's unfair and sad to me . i worked w wa 3 times and it was one of the privileges of my career . '' he added : `` is it possible to support survivors of pedophilia and sexual assault/abuse and also believe that wa is innocent ? i think so . `` the intention is not to dismiss or ignore such complaints . but accusing ppl of such crimes should be treated carefully . on behalf of the victims , as well . '' ",
