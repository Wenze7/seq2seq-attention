        "a mannnequin is thrown from a us-made black hawk helicopter during an annual military drill in taichung , central taiwan , on january 17 , 2017 . beijing has never conceded and will not yield an inch on taiwan being part of china . it is a matter that leaves no room for negotiation . this seems to be something that needs restating since the provisions concerning taiwan in the national defense authorization act , signed by us president donald trump on tuesday , constitute a potential provocation to china , as they include consideration of port calls to the island by the us navy , among other measures aimed at strengthening defense ties with the island . ",
        "such provisions may be intended as a bargaining chip or increasing the geostrategic pressure on china . if so , trump should be informed that not everything is negotiable , and too much pressure can have unintended , even though anticipatable , consequences . although the us may be bound by domestic law to provide the island with the means to defend itself － a legacy of history and perhaps the lingering view that the island be considered an `` unsinkable aircraft carrier '' － china resolutely opposes any meddling in its internal affairs , and it has made that clear in the protest it has lodged against the content relating to china 's sovereignty in the act . ",
        "should the us breach the three communiqués , which in their pledges to respect each other 's national sovereignty and territorial integrity are the very foundation for relations between the two countries , beijing will have every reason to do whatever it considers appropriate to deal with the subsequent crisis in its best interests . however , while the use of military force for the reunification of the island with the motherland is always an option on the table for beijing , as its anti-secession law dictates , it has long sought to realize this by peaceful means , which is in the interests of people on both sides of the straits . ",
        "this remains the case today . on wednesday , beijing again made clear it was willing to communicate with any political party , organization or individual who adheres to the one-china principle . however , there are those on the island who have become emboldened in their separatist intention by recent us posturing , and they have pinned their hopes on arms sales and military intervention from the united states for the realization of their untenable aspiration . washington should not give sustenance to their fantasies . us policymakers would do well to bear in mind there is a line that should not be crossed when it comes to taiwan .
