        "antonio brown was one of four repeaters from last season on the associated press 2017 nfl all-pro team , and the only unanimous choice . the brilliant wide receiver of the pittsburgh steelers drew all 50 ballots friday from a nationwide panel of media members who regularly cover the league . brown missed the last two-plus games with an ankle injury . he was among four players to make a fourth all-pro squad , joining new england tight end rob gronkowski , carolina linebacker luke kuechly and los angeles rams punter johnny hekker . the repeaters from 2016 were rams interior defensive lineman aaron donald , who got 49 votes , and punter johnny hekker ; and seattle linebacker bobby wagner . ",
        "in their turnaround season , the rams led the way with six all-pros , including two more specialists : kicker greg zuerlein and kick returner pharoh cooper . running back todd gurley and left tackle andrew whitworth were honored . `` dang , that 's crazy . it means a lot , honestly , '' said gurley , who likely would have led the league in rushing had he played in la 's finale . `` it 's a blessing . i 've got so much respect for everybody in this league , and to be in this position just means so much to me . ",
        "`` i 've been following people around the nfl my whole life , and to be considered as an all-pro , man , god is good , honestly . honestly . `` patriots quarterback tom brady made his third all-pro team . three steelers joined brown on the roster : le'veon bell as the flex , interior defensive lineman cam heyward , and right guard david decastro . no other team had more than two all-pros , with the stronger nfc getting 18 players and the afc 10 . two rookies made it : punt returner jamal agnew of detroit and special teamer budda baker of arizona . ",
        "also making it : eagles right tackle lane johnson and center jason kelce ; panthers left guard andrew norwell ; texans wide receiver deandre hopkins ; jaguars edge rusher calais campbell and cornerback jalen ramsey ; saints edge rusher cameron jordan ; cardinals linebacker chandler jones ; vikings cornerback xavier rhodes and safety harrison smith ; detroit defensive back darius slay ; and titans safety kevin byard . first-timers made an impression on both sides of the ball , with 15 on the team : byard , slay , rhodes , jones , jordan , ramsey , campbell , hopkins , norwell , kelce , johnson , agnew , baker , gurley , and cooper . ",
        "wagner is on his third all-pro squad . `` when you get voted for these types of awards , '' he said , `` it shows you all the work you do in the offseason , the grinding , all the things you push through ... when you get this , when people say this is not afc , nfc , this is the league , this is who we deem the best at their position in the league , that says a lot . and you see the guys before you , the things they were able to accomplish , you 've seen those things and you want those things . ",
        "it 's part of that mindset of wanting to be great and understanding what comes along with that , and wanting that kind of acknowledgment . `` while making all-pro has become almost natural for wagner , jordan finally got there in his seventh pro season . `` i 'm definitely trying to push myself to be better than i was the year previous , '' he said . `` i think i had a really good year last year . of course , sack numbers wo n't show that , but in terms of playing the run , in terms of getting after the passer i thought last year was one of my better years . ",
        "so what i wanted to do this year is , of course , push myself to be better than last . that probably only poses the problem of where i go next year . now i 've got to shoot for more than what i did this year .
