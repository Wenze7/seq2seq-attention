        "-- women are more likely than men to be knocked out of their u. s. jobs by automation in the next eight years , and they 'll find half as many opportunities to land new positions unless there 's a new effort to retrain them . those conclusions , from a study released monday at the world economic forum , show about 57 percent of the 1.4 million u. s. jobs to be disrupted by technology between now and 2026 are held by women . with proper retraining , most of the workers would find new , higher-paying jobs . ",
        "without it , very few have opportunities , but women fare the worst , according to the study , conducted in collaboration with the boston consulting group . making the transition will be expensive and difficult , the authors said . `` it is definitely unprecedented , the effort that would be required on the part of policy makers , '' said saadia zahidi , one of the authors and head of education , gender and work for the world economic forum , which is holding its annual forum this week in davos , switzerland . `` what is different today , is that businesses also do recognize that it 's something that would be useful for them . '' ",
        "workers are bracing for a future where it 's estimated each industrial robot displaces six employees and 30 percent of banking jobs could disappear within five years as artificial intelligence gets smarter . much of the worst disruption will affect lower-paying jobs often held by women or less educated workers . the world economic forum now estimates it will take a century for women to reach gender parity in the workplace , almost 20 years longer than it forecast a year ago . story : being a woman got even worse in 2017businesses leaders are becoming more aware of their need to take a leadership role in fixing the gap , zahidi said . ",
        "at the same time , it will be a complicated problem to fix because it requires an entire new educational focus as well as a likely need for income support for workers being retrained , she said . without retraining , a quarter of the workers face annual income losses of about $ 8,600 and many would not be able to find a new jobs , compared with a gain of $ 15,000 for most workers after two years of retraining -- with about 95 percent having a new position available , according to the report . the study was based on data from burning glass technologies and the u. s. bureau of labor statistics . ",
        "one positive for women : under the retraining scenario , women 's wages would increase 74 percent while men 's income would rise 53 percent , having a potential for narrowing the pay gap , she said . the study looked at 15 different job strategies that could pave the way for professions as diverse as assembly line workers , truck drivers , secretaries and cashiers for finding new careers . while the report found that 90,000 manufacturing jobs , predominantly held by men , are at risk for disruption , there are about 164,000 at risk female secretaries and administrative assistants who are often overlooked . ",
        "`` a lot of the narrative around job losses and re-skilling in the u. s. tends to focus around male , blue-collar , factory and mining workers , but in fact , there are a lot of women in a lot of those disrupted jobs , '' zahidi said . `` so there is a quite a lot of discrepancy in terms of the public narrative and what 's actually happening in the data . there is this possibility of blind spots .
