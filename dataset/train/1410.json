        "luxury automakers tend to roll out new technology on more expensive models before bringing it down to more affordable cars . but that 's not the case with the latest mercedes-benz infotainment system . mercedes-benz announced this week that it plans to bring a new infotainment system to ces 2018 in las vegas this january . the new system , called mercedes-benz user experience or mbux for short , is promised to be a `` pioneering in-car experience , '' but the company has n't offered up any further details . mercedes has some of the largest in-dash screens in the industry , and mbux looks to continue that trend . ",
        "mercedes-benzwhile you might expect it to first arrive on something expensive , like a new g-class or s-class , that wo n't be the case . instead , mbux will make its production debut on mercedes-benz 's new compact cars , which the automaker claims will arrive `` as early as '' 2018 . that 's not very far away , in case you forgot that it 's already 2017 . that 's not all the automaker will bring to the show . it will also trot out three important cars -- the concept eqa electric hatchback , the smart vision eq fortwo city car concept and the mercedes-amg project one hypercar . ",
        "now that is a trio worth checking out . we 'll be at ces for an entire week , so keep your eyes peeled for more mbux-related news , even if the name sounds like some sort of company credit you receive for buying packs of marlboros . 55mercedes-amg project one hypercar is 1,000 horsepower incarnate .
