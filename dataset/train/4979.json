        "the gourmands ' way : six americans in paris and the birth of a new gastronomy by justin spring takes a look at the rich lives of americans who changed the way we eat . this passionate pack of epicureans set aside what they 'd learned from their families and american culture in favor of adopting french culinary norms . what they found were countless sumptuous delicacies that were too decadent not to share back in the united states . as a result , there was a proliferation of books , tv shows , first-hand accounts , and of course recipes that made their way to america during the mid-20th century . ",
        "following world war ii , there was a three-decade stretch , known as les trente glorieuses , where paris became not just the apex of tourism for intellectuals and artists but also an incubator of gastronomic genius too . ironically , this culinary revolution was gaining steam just as processed foods were seeing their heyday across the pond . in america , dried eggs , powdered milk , and tv dinners were amassing a cult of followers dedicated to convenience . early on , these products did n't have the reputation of being bad for you . in fact , there were proponents of this space-age food who were producing `` cookbooks '' at the same time that new ideas about food and wine were beginning to trickle over from france . ",
        "this period was formative in the way americans talk about and eat food today . and if it were n't for these six people , our country may never have experienced the renaissance of cooking that led our current generation 's appreciation for haute cuisine and michelin stars . aj lieblingaj liebling was a writer for the new yorker who used his words and widespread media presence to paint a lasting portrait of the chic and elaborate experience of dining out in paris . naturally , americans could n't help but want to feel that too when they ordered a steak downtown on a saturday night , so they slowly began to live out their interpretations of his descriptions of dinner in the city of light . ",
        "and so haute cuisine was born stateside . alexis lichinelet 's all take a moment to thank the man who made french wine available and comprehensible to americans . this impresario and wine merchant led a lively life which resulted in him becoming the leading importer of french wines in america , and who , in effect , cultivated the american conception of what fine wine is today . you can even purchase wines that are branded under his name . alice b. toklasproving that it 's never too late to pursue your dream , toklas did n't become a legendary foodie until she was 75 . ",
        "the life companion and muse of gertrude stein , she chose to autobiographically recount her life under the guise of writing a cookbook . eventually , her work evolved to be more of a guide to meals at home in the style fran√ßais than a memoir of her role in the modernist period 's bohemian literary circles . julia childthis woman may be the most well-known personality of all american francophiles , and she 's famous for bringing the french palate to america . through her tv show and two-volume cookbook , she forever changed the way we appreciate this european cuisine by introducing mid-century viewers to the rich food from an even richer culture . ",
        "watching her show , you get the distinct impression that french food must be good if this jolly lady can enjoy it so much . mfk fisherby elegantly weaving her feelings about good food and associations with fine wine into her novels , this french cuisine pioneer offered a new perspective on food -- one which asked the reader to consider food for its artistic merit in addition to its taste . her most famous work was aptly named the art of eating . richard olneythis reclusive artist unexpectedly blossomed into one of the most notable gastronomic visionaries of our age . ",
        "his deconstruction of the french menu helped him create a model of eating that not only synchronized dishes with wines , but also with the season , to transform eating into an organic experience that 's linked to the earth . needless to say , his beautiful depictions of meals made his cookbooks like simple french cooking works of art . french food is more than just baguettes and recipes with red wine -- it embodies a lifestyle . these six adventurous and enterprising american expats captured the joie de vivre of french cuisine and educated their fellow americans on the link between a happy life and food -- and we still benefit from their efforts today in the most delicious ways .
