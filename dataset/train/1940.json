        "graphene power - world today has been filled with chemicals and pollution due to waste generated from energy that are less environmentally friendly . this is not bias blamed for granted given the energy really help human life . but if seeing his side effects then it is time to move on to a more environmentally friendly energy and does not cause negative effectsone solution is well thought out and developed by frs platform power . frs power with this great idea of doing a project can attract the ico to all communities to participate in the development of this project .

        "frs will use a crypto token power as a land investment . the following review about frs power , lest you miss to invest on this great projectwhat is frs ? frs is a thinnest and strongest materials on earth , has only one atom thick but 150 times stronger than the same weight of steel . one square metre frs has 1,000 times lighter than a piece of paper , it also is more flexible than rubber . frs can conduct electricity savings of more than 200 times , so more efficient than silicon , the material penunjangnya made entirely out of carbon , the fourth most abundant element in the universe . ",
        "where frs will be applied ? frs is widely used in supercapacitors and battery construction . the frs battery light is chemically inert , durable , more appropriate for high-capacity energy storage , has a longer lifespan and electrically charged in the short interval compared to other batteries . frs global market growth was driven by an acceleration in global sales of electric cars and other electronic devices . frs provides solutions to the problems that arise in human life . an example is : global issues : cars produce a lot of carbon emissions into the atmosphere naturally issued us , making us vulnerable to things like pollution and greenhouse gases . ",
        "when the car engine is running , some kinds of gases and particles emitted can give bad impact on the environment . our solutions : not needed gas , savings , no emissions , popularity , cost effectivefrs power projectfrs tech power has application in the sector of electric mobility , electronic devices , as well as in the field of medicine . the plan to set up a factory manufacturing nano-materials frs `` frs power '' in yecla , spain . the factory will manufacture products based on frs . the plant will produce batteries and super condenser by using frs massively .
