        "as bitcoin popularity and significance rises , more people do n't want to `` lose the opportunity '' to speak about it . we 've already got used to negative and critical opinions of experts . fortunately , more and more people notice pros of btc . what do famous people say positively about bitcoin ? trend to slate bitcoin is almost as long as the history of the cryptocurrency itself . forbes already in 2011 said , that it lacks liquidity and does n't work as mean of storing value . as the time went on , there were so many people who wanted to throw in their two cents that negative opinions on cryptocurrencies became mainstream . ",
        "it became a matter of honour for people from politics or financial circles . the latest example are the words of jpmorgan ceo -- jamie dimon -- who called bitcoin ` a fraud ' . gambling , fun or road to riches ? even though dimon has been harshly criticized for his words , he was still often quoted by many mainstream media . it 's a pity , that e. g. billionaire mark cuban did n't get such fame . in his advice on how to become rich , he suggested to invest 10 % of your savings in bitcoin or ethereum . ",
        "even though he advises to treat such investment as loss , it 's possible to see the change in investor 's attitude towards cryptocurrencies . high-risk investments are obviously not the same thing as speculative bubble . tony robbins , coach and speaker , also presents interesting approach . in his opinion , bitcoin investments are similar to trip to las vegas . as with gambling , you should only invest assets that you can afford to lose . in this case , potential losses wo n't hurt , gains can be treated as a bonus , and the whole investment as fun . ",
        "positively about bitcoin -- better than fiat and goldprobably the most positive opinion on the largest of cryptocurrencies was presented by steve wozniak , apple co-founder . last year he mentioned that he got really curious about cryptocurrencies and started `` investing and playing around '' with bitcoin when it was worth 700 $ . according to wozniak , btc is the mathematical concept better than gold or fiat currencies . us federal reserve or similar entity can print dollars or other currency `` from nothing '' for any reason . the entrepreneur explains that in case of bitcoin , matters look slightly different : `` there 's a finite number of bitcoins that can be created . ",
        "at the same time , gold is constantly mined and mined . maybe there 's a finite amount of gold in the world but bitcoin is more mathematical and regulated and no one can change mathematics . '' in your opinion , do we need more famous people talking positively about bitcoin ?   "
