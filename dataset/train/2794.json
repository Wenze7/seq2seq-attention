        "want warriors news in your inbox ? sign up for the free dubsdaily newsletter . oakland -- the pairing has become poetic symmetry , as stephen curry and klay thompson make shots from anywhere on the court with grace and precision . for the past week , though , a key member of the `` splash brothers '' no longer can douse opponents with countless 3-pointers . when the warriors host the dallas mavericks on thursday at oracle arena , curry will miss his fourth consecutive game because of a sprained right ankle injury , and he will remain sidelined until the warriors reevaluate him early next week . ",
        "does that mean thompson has had to elevate his workload and leadership role ? `` if klay starts talking because steph is out , i 'll let you know , '' warriors coach steve kerr said with a grin . nearly eight days have passed since kerr spoke those words . kerr has not had an update on if things have changed . that is because thompson has spoken very little since then . following thursday 's morning shootaround , thompson maintained has been `` not much different at all '' even without having his backcourt mate to split the 3-point heaves . ",
        "`` i put the hard work in and guys will follow , '' thompson said . `` i 'm not a vocal guy . but if i do that by example , people will respect that a lot . '' the warriors respect thompson a lot for his game basically staying the same . in the past three games that curry has sat out , thompson has averaged 22.33 points while shooting 49.06 percent from the field and 38.5 percent from 3-point range . while those numbers mirror his season averages in points and shooting percentage , thompson has taken a dip from his season averages in 3-point shooting . ",
        "but that has more to do with thompson having an off night from the perimeter in detroit compared to his efficient nights in charlotte and against portland . `` i just go out there and play my game like i do every game , '' thompson said . `` i try to be myself and help the team win and just have fun . nothing should change , regardless of who 's out there . you have to be yourself and do what got you to this point . '' what has gotten thompson to this point is pretty simple . ",
        "thompson makes a lot of shots . thompson willingly defends the opposing team 's backcourt players that often are the roster 's best scorers . and even if thompson fills the highlight reels with his prolific outside shooting , thompson prefers to have those sequences speak for itself . `` he hardly says anything , but he 's there every night . defensively and offensively , he competes , '' kerr said . `` he 's out there and he 's healthy . it 's an incredible trait to have when your teammates can count on you every single day . ",
        "in practice , he 's a constant presence . that , in itself , is a form of leadership . '' it is also a form of leadership that thompson has declined to take any credit for the team 's seven-game winning streak . with the warriors also nursing recent absences to draymond green , zaza pachulia and nick young , thompson put more credit on the depth around him including kevin durant , andre iguodala and a handful of role players ready to contribute . `` we 've been working hard . we 're lucky because we have such a deep team , '' thompson said . ",
        "`` i do n't think a lot of teams could handle this stretch if two of their better players got hurt . we just got guys that are eager to play and have been in the league for a long time and guys that are fresh in the league . i think it does make it harder , but we 've been prepared for this . this is what the front office prepared for . '' and this is what thompson has prepared for , though he will not say so .   "
