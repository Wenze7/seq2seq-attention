        "blake griffin of the la clippers cracked a joke about his tweet he posted after the la clippers and houston rockets spat . after the la clippers defeated the houston rockets on monday night , everything got weird . you 've surely read or heard about it at this point . if not , please enlighten yourself . after all the festivities at the stadium ended , players began to take to twitter , including blake griffin who was at the center of all the fun . blake 's tweet was simple and it seemed pretty obvious what he was going for . ",
        "obviously , blake was glad he caused a stir and was enjoying watching all the mayhem surrounding the situation on monday . however , according to blake , that 's not what he was going for at all . what he `` really '' meanton tuesday , during a community outreach program , blake explained that the tweet was completely coincidental and unrelated to the argument between the two teams . `` oh man , i was watching the dark knight and that 's one of my favorite scenes , so i just wanted to show appreciation for that scene `` that makes sense , right ? ",
        "maybe blake just needed to unwind and the dark knight is one of his go to movies . right ? of course , he was definitely being coy with the media . the forward made similar jokes during the press conference after the game , citing that him and rockets ' forward trevor ariza were just discussing the topic of ariza 's birthday party and whether or not blake would be able to attend . with possible suspensions looming , it 's probably best that blake keeps acting ignorant . we 'll keep you updated on any decisions the nba comes to .
