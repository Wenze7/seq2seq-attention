        "learn which of these ishares funds topped the list . international investing can be tricky for u. s. investors . some foreign companies list their shares on u. s. stock exchanges , but many -- including some of the largest businesses on the planet -- are n't available on the new york or nasdaq stock exchanges . for those who do n't want to go to the trouble of inquiring about getting access to foreign stock exchanges , international exchange-traded funds offer an easier path into overseas markets . the ishares line of etfs has made international investing a specialty . ",
        "investors can find more than 60 different funds that are oriented toward single countries , many of which performed extremely well in 2017 . the following funds had the top returns last year , and they reveal a lot about what the latest trends in international investing are . etfassets under managementexpense ratio2017 returnishares msci india small-cap $ 341 million0 .75 b % ishares msci germany small-cap $ 74 million0 .59 w % ishares msci china $ 3.12 billion0 .62 s % ishares msci poland $ 383 million0 .63 s % ishares msci austria $ 279 million0 .49 s % ishares msci brazil small-cap $ 78 million0 .62 q % ishares msci south korea $ 4.31 billion0 .62 d % ishares msci chile $ 578 million0 .62 c % ishares msci turkey $ 376 million0 .627 % ishares msci india $ 5.64 billion0 .686 ta source : etfdb .

        "com . moving beyond the obviousthose who 've followed country etfs over the years have seen the space evolve dramatically . at first , the focus among most investors was on developed nations . even now , ishares has more assets in its japan fund than in its next three largest etfs combined , and germany also remains a favorite pick among country-fund investors . the rise of emerging markets in the early 2000s started to turn the tide , spurring the fund manager to create new funds offering exposure to those increasingly important foreign markets . brazil , india , and china attracted huge numbers of investors . ",
        "over the years , emerging markets performed quite well , rewarding those investors who jumped in early . yet more recently , those looking at international stocks have sought new ways to invest , and some of the best returns have come from newly explored niches . within larger foreign markets , small-cap stocks have gained notoriety , in large part because market capitalization-weighted index funds have tended to ignore these smaller stocks in the past . at the same time , smaller economies like austria , chile , poland , and turkey have attracted attention from investors wanting opportunities in lesser-followed markets . ",
        "image source : getty images . the importance of indiathe fact that india shows up twice on this list deserves particular notice . the indian economy has unmatched potential in the world , largely because it has the largest population of any country in which english is a primary language . although china gets most of the publicity as the most populous nation on earth and with a long history of strong growth rates , current projections from the u. n. 's economic affairs department show that india will likely become the fastest-growing economy in the world in the near future . ",
        "india offers plenty of solid large-cap investment prospects , including leaders in the banking , manufacturing , and technology . yet as the results from 2017 show , some of the smaller companies in the indian economy are taking even greater advantage of favorable conditions there . with a government in place that has demonstrated a business-friendly set of policies , india could see sustained gains for years to come . what 's ahead in 2018 ? key trends like an increased appetite for small-cap stocks and a greater focus on previously neglected nations with smaller economies played a major role in 2017 's returns , and there 's little reason to expect changes in those attitudes in 2018 . ",
        "as the u. s. bull market ages , many investors are looking at international markets for better values . country etfs make interesting investment vehicles for betting on the success of specific economies , and making the right choices can lead to extremely strong returns for smart investors .
