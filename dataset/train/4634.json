        "mexico city -- a unique shelter for dogs -- and one pig -- is struggling to get back on its feet after mexico 's devastating earthquake four months ago . the tale of perseverance involves the `` can-geles '' shelter in mexico city . its name is a combination of the spanish slang for dog , `` can , '' and `` angeles '' or angels . the shelter is run by jair benavides and his wife , mariam gutierrez de velasco . they go by their `` dog family '' nicknames of jair solcan and mariam luzcan , which respectively translate to `` sundog '' and `` lightdog '' in english . ",
        "they have about 20 dogs , and a pig , and regularly take in strays , whose numbers vary because they are quickly trained and put up for adoption . when the sept. . 19 quake shook mexico 's capital it severely damaged the five-story building next to the couple 's row house . they had to get out quickly , and are living in a crowded garage that a neighbor lent them . authorities are demolishing the quake-damaged neighboring building and it may be three months of more before they get back into their home . but they continue caring for their canine charges despite the challenges . ",
        "the whole pack is quite a sight to see when they go to nearby parks for walks in a patched-up old vw van . the couple also provides daycare and walks for neighbors ' dogs . mariam estimates she has rescued and placed in adoption upward of 2,000 dogs over the last couple of decades . `` they are part of my life , '' she says . `` they have taught me unconditional love . ''   "
