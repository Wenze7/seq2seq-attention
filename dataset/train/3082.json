        "melbourne - us open champion sloane stephens was the first big name casualty of the australian open on monday , crashing out 2-6 , 7-6 , 6-2 to zhang shuai in an error-strewn performance . the american extended her sorry losing streak since winning at flushing meadows in september to seven matches against the 34th-ranked chinese number two , a surprise quarter-finalist in melbourne two years ago . stephens came back from a long-term injury to record her us open victory but has struggled since with form and fitness . things looked back on track for the woman known as `` sloane ranger '' as she raced to the first set 6-2 in 38 minutes . ",
        "but zhang would not lie down and gradually got herself on top , winning the second set on a tiebreak for the loss of only two points . she then scooted away to victory in an hour and 58 minutes over an increasingly frustrated stephens . `` she 's a tough player , '' said zhang , who has happy memories of margaret court arena -- zhang reached the last eight there after coming through three qualifying rounds two years ago . `` i 'm so happy to play on this court and play a great player , '' she added . ",
        "and the chinese star had a warning for the rest of the field . `` i know how hard i have worked so i 'm ready for every match , every player . `` she will face either of the unseeded pair denisa allertova of the czech republic or france 's pauline parmentier in the second round .   "
