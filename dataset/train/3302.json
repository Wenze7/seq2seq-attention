        "office space equivalent to the shard is being lost from westminster each year in an `` unprecedented decline '' as workspace is converted into housing . westminster city council said the trend could threaten the area 's status as a centre of international business . developers have cashed in on the government 's easing of planning rules to encourage `` office-to-residential '' conversions in recent years . the council is now changing its planning policy to protect office space and stop the decline . analysis by westminster showed the borough lost 300,000 square metres of office floor space to residential conversions between 2013 and 2017 . ",
        "the area , which includes business hubs such as victoria and oxford street , stands to lose a further 730,000 square metres through ongoing schemes . town planners estimate that , if unchecked , more than 1,000,000 square metres could be lost in less than a decade . that works out at nearly 110,000 square metres a year -- the equivalent of the shard 's total floor area . westminster is home to 120,000 businesses , employing 650,000 workers . the council said it already faces a shortage of commercial property space and virtually no empty office space . councillor daniel astaire , cabinet member for planning , suggested westminster 's ability to compete with other business-focused areas could be at risk . ",
        "`` if this trend continues westminster risks losing business to other global cities , like paris and new york , '' he said . `` we have experienced a rapid loss of office space in westminster . it 's a worrying trend . `` not only does this change the character and feel of our communities but our reputation as a political and professional centre relies upon maintaining the office spaces which allow business to flourish . '' the government is now set to make the planning rule on office-to-residential conversions permanent . to combat this , the council will effectively exempt itself with a policy which means developers will still need planning permission to convert office space . ",
        "mr astaire said : `` this policy helps us to strike a balance and ensure that as well as delivering more housing we can also retain suitable professional space for businesses to operate . ''   "
