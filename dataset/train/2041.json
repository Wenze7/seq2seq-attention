        "paris -- lanvin and paul smith capped a masculine and utilitarian menswear season in paris as design veteran hedi slimane was named the new creative chief at celine . here are some highlights from sunday 's final fall-winter men 's shows and the run-up to paris fashion week for couture collections : lanvin 's utilitarian chica constellation of bright lights that were fixed on stands around the runway gave lanvin 's display a dreamlike air . the clothes at the sunday morning show were more fixed on reality -- with sneakers , hoods , hats , toggles and straps appearing on urban-looking and masculine winter looks .

        "the notable creative feature here was the cross-over styles . sometimes asymmetrical , it worked well alongside designer lucas ossendrijver 's signature use of layering . a long coat with square pockets featured a flat cross-over lapel , alongside a partly-unzipped and oversized sleeveless coat in beige -- that hung wonkily and possessed a carefree quality . at times , styles that fused a japanese and workmen 's aesthetic demonstrated ossendrijver 's penchant for mixing vestimentary references . lanvin owner and enigmatic taiwanese media magnate shaw-lan wang -- who 's reportedly been behind the recent tumultuous creative changes at the house -- clapped vigorously .

        "patrick gibson talks `` tolkien `` french notables including lulu gainsbourg , the musician son of the late serge gainsbourg , and dj martin solveig attended lanvin 's brightly lit show in the palais de tokyo . actor patrick gibson of `` the oa '' and `` the tudors '' fame was among the speckling of international faces . gibson posed for the cameras in sunglasses and a low-key , coffee-colored lanvin coat that matched the coffee being served around him . the 22-year-old irish actor has wrapped filming for the upcoming biopic `` tolkien . '' it tells the true story of author j. r.r. tolkien , who wrote `` the lord of the rings '' after returning from the horrors of world war i. `` i think there 's going to be a lot of interest . ",
        "nick hoult did an amazing job portraying tolkien , '' gibson said . `` it shows the really human side . it does n't feel like a biopic . it feels like a story about a regular person out of the framework of history . and that makes it real , his flaws , too , '' he said . former saint laurent designer slimane named at celineveteran fashion designer hedi slimane has been named the new creative director of the edgy paris brand celine . slimane , who gained critical and commercial success as saint laurent 's designer during 2012-2016 , will replace outgoing british designer phoebe philo , whose departure was announced in november .

        "in a statement sunday , celine parent company lvmh praised slimane 's `` talent and his remarkable ability to anticipate and express in a unique way the evolutions and desires of his age . `` french-born , italian-tunisian slimane previously worked for lvmh as designer of dior homme during 2000-2007 . he was credited with contributing to the influential skinny menswear aesthetic . calling silmane `` one of the most talented designers of our time , '' lvmh head bernard arnault said he was `` particularly happy that hedi is back within the lvmh group . `` paul smith 's 80sit was the dramatic styles of the 1980s that were in vogue at paul smith 's fall show .

        "the british designer stuck closely to suit - and coat-heavy looks for his smart collection that referenced the broad and angular shoulders ubiquitous during that dressy era . asymmetrical paneling on outerwear -- such as a half-tartan , half-plain tailored coat -- was a recurrent style and mirrored the days of the new romantics . large architectural lapels or turned-up collars on long oversized coats also had the exuberant flourish of that decade 's heady fashions . the sober and beautiful color palette of myriad blues -- navy , cetacean , cerulean , blueberry , turquoise -- as well as purple and vermilion ensured the collection stayed tasteful .

's perfectly saleable designs were dapper , but the collection ultimately played it safe . for fall-winter , the french designer 's best styles riffed on the retro suits of the 1960s . fitted gray and gray-blue woolen suits flared slightly at the jacket hem and were accessorized with a trilby hat . they would n't have looked out of place on the james bond of the sean connery era . jazzy shirts and ties in contrasting patterns added the contemporary lift that was also seen in a vivid royal blue hat and chic three-button jacket .
