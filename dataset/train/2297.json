        "by now most people are aware of the impending changes to the u. s. tax code brought about by the gop tax bill , dubbed the `` tax cuts and jobs act , '' which congress voted to pass on december 20 , 2017 . these substantial changes , which are widely regarded as the most significant overhaul of the tax code in last 30 years , have driven matrimonial attorneys and litigants into a frenzied state as they try to determine the impact of these changes on alimony awards . one of the modifications presented via the tax bill was to eliminate the tax consequences of alimony . ",
        "under the current tax laws , alimony is tax-deductible to the payor and taxable as income to the payee . the revised tax code , however , completely eliminates the payor 's ability to deduct , and the payee 's obligation to report , alimony payments . although at first blush this may seem beneficial to the recipient , the end result will find both payors and receipts of alimony with less money to go around . whether or not these sweeping changes will impact your alimony case may depend on a number of factors , primarily the timing of the order or agreement addressing alimony . ",
        "it is anticipated that the tax code modifications on the treatment of alimony will not be effective until 2019 . specifically , the current rules on alimony will remain in effect through december 31 , 2018 . the elimination of the tax consequences of alimony would begin january 1 , 2019 . so , if you have an agreement or order for alimony entered on or before december 31 , 2018 , the taxability/deductibility of alimony would remain in effect . there is , of course , at least one wrinkle : if your order or agreement for alimony entered on or before december 31 , 2018 is later modified after december 31 , 2018 , and if the modifying order or agreement specifically references the tax code revisions , the new tax rules will apply and the tax consequences of alimony would be eliminated . ",
        "the extent to which these significant changes will impact divorce settlement negotiations , and the manner in which they will be treated by the courts , remains to be seen . what is apparent , however , is that any individuals currently contemplating divorce may be best served by initiating the divorce proceeding now , before the end of 2018 , to take advantage of the tax benefits of alimony while they still can .
