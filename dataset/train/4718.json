        "well , the major underdog beat the minor horndog . in a historically ugly election , democrat doug jones defeated republican roy moore in what normally would have been a blowout for the gop . it 's clear that the washington post bombshell report derailed moore 's campaign and in the midst of the #metoo movement , it made enough of an impact for alabama republicans to either stay home , write-in candidates , or even vote across the aisle . and in the wake of every election , the blame game always ensues . so who 's to blame for this ? ",
        "some will blame president trump for his mostly arms-length support for the candidate or , as democrats will claim , for the anti-trump sentiment in the country . others will blame senate majority leader mitch mcconnell for getting heavily involved in the primary by backing luther strange . but the biggest blame belongs to one man : steve bannon . since his firing as the white house chief strategist , bannon promised to `` wage war '' against the establishment and he vowed to find primary challengers in virtually every gop race . and perhaps it 's a fight worth having against republicans who block trump 's legislative agenda . ",
        "in this race , in particular , bannon painted strange , who was already serving as alabama 's senator since jeff sessions became attorney general , as the `` establishment candidate , '' especially since he was backed by mcconnell , an arch rival of bannon 's . both mcconnell and bannon are to blame for not backing mo brooks , a wildly popular conservative in who also ran in the alabama primary , but bannon got his way and had enough influence among alabama republicans to vote for the judge . can an argument be made that strange and brooks were n't `` trumpian '' enough ? ",
        "sure . but at least they were n't polarizing and controversial . even before allegations of sexual misconduct came out against him , roy moore had a history of being a bigot . from saying homosexuality should be illegal to thinking muslims should n't be allowed in congress , his intolerance for others is truly disgusting . his remarks blaming america `` turning away '' from god for 9/11 and sandy hook were despicable . on top of that , he had a shoddy political record . aside from his battle he won over his ten commandments statue that earned him a cult following , he was fired twice as a judge and he had two failed runs for governor . ",
        "so moore had a ton of red flags leading up to this race . obviously , things were turned upside down when several women accused him of harassment and assault , some of whom were teenagers . not only were the allegations credible , moore 's denial was unconvincing . if he , in fact , was wrongfully accused , his interview with sean hannity should have been a cakewalk . instead , he stumbled . and after that , he changed his story from knowing some of these women to flat-out denying knowing any of them . and even if moore was n't a child molester , all of his surrogates who defended the candidate only made matters worse . ",
        "from the insane religious comparisons , the pointing to the `` group of non-accusers , '' to the utter stupidity that came from that campaign , none of them presented moore as a person alabama voters should vote for . for goodness sakes , even his wife kayla moore botched their `` we 're not anti-semitic '' defense by uncomfortably declaring that one of their lawyers `` is a jew . '' which brings us back to bannon . between the nauseating allegations made against moore to the incompetent campaign , bannon chose not to pressure the candidate to drop out of the race like the vast majority of the party did and instead doubled down with his support . ",
        "he used breitbart to discredit moore 's accusers . plus , he made an ass out of himself with his attacks on mitt romney and he made a complete ass out of himself when going after msnbc 's joe scarborough . and in the end , his candidate still lost . was n't bannon supposed to be this `` master political strategist ? '' was n't he supposed to be this shadowy , powerful figure in conservative america ? maybe he was and his best days are behind him . yes , he can still brag about how he helped get trump over the finish line during the 2016 election , but it 's way easier when your opponent is someone as unlikable and distrusting as hillary clinton . ",
        "and doug jones was no hillary clinton . in many ways , steve bannon is actually a lot like hillary clinton . both are past their prime . both have shamelessly defended sexual predators . both no longer have influence in their respective parties . and both lost elections they should have won , even more so for bannon . clinton had the political establishment , hollywood , and the media behind her , but she was the epitome of everything wrong with the status quo and that led to trump 's victory . bannon 's candidate was a republican in the deep red state of alabama , but the empowerment of sexual harassment victims buried him and that led to jones ' victory . ",
        "you can even say that bannon was a bigger loser in alabama than clinton was in 2016 . at least she still won the popular vote . when bannon left the white house , he felt emboldened to lead the trumpism movement from the outside . if the alabama senate race proved anything , he led trumpism off a cliff . how can anyone take him seriously after such a devastating defeat ? he humiliated himself for picking the one gop candidate in the alabama primary who would lose to a democrat . and bannon made the same mistake democrats did in 2016 by nominating the one candidate that would lose to trump . ",
        "he should be embarrassed to show his face in public for needlessly handing a precious senate seat to the democrats . bannon must ask himself if fighting this civil war among republicans was worth it . and will it be worth it in 2018 when the stakes are so much higher ? if it is , bannon should consider finding someone else to lead the fight . because he clearly ca n't handle it .
