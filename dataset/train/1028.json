        "most have been demolished or turned into something elsethe history of the forgotten cinemas of west wales has been rediscovered thanks to a new book by writer and former cinema projectionist allan phillips . most of the cinema and picture houses of west wales -- from barmouth in gwynedd to llanelli in carmarthenshire -- have long since disappeared , been demolished or converted to other uses . the cinemas of west wales records where they were , gives descriptions of their interiors and programmes , and includes over 100 photographs of what they looked like then , and now . ",
        "in wales , most cinemas were built around 1910 and 1911 , although a number of buildings had been converted into cinemas before that . `` in days gone by a weekly visit to the ` flicks ' was as common as watching the television is today . it was an adventure and one of the few modes of entertainment available , '' said the book 's author , who worked as a cinema projectionist with the kinema corporation and later with the ministry of defence . `` it was a chance to step back in time or to the future , a chance to forget daily toils and , for an hour or two , be transported to a make-believe world . '' ",
        "villages or towns that had or have cinemas and are featured in the book include carmarthen , cross hands , kidwelly , llandeilo , llandovery , llanelli , pembrey and burry port and pontarddulais in west glamorgan . wales had its own film pioneers , such as john codman , son of the llandudno pier punch and judy man , who travelled throughout north wales with his magic lantern living picture show . then there was arthur cheetham who filmed day-to-day scenes throughout the country for the purpose of showing them at venues across most of wales . he eventually settled in rhyl and in 1906 established the silvograph animated pictures - the first permanent cinema in wales . ",
        "but , by the 1960s the advent of television and increased running costs caused cinema attendances to decline and several went into financial difficulty . `` times have changed now , '' added alan . `` some cinemas or theatres were converted into bingo halls or were used for other uses , such as supermarkets , or eventually demolished . today several cinemas have been taken over by j. d. wetherspoon pubs , and they have retained the d√©cor to give us a glimpse of their former glory days . '' the cinemas of west wales by alan phillips is available now . "
