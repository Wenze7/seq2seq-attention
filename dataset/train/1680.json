        "if you 've always been curious about what kate middleton does in her pockets of spare time , you might be surprised to learn about her favorite hobby -- and that she 's really good at it . yep , even royals have to feed their creative passions . even though the duchess of cambridge has spent a lot of her life in front of cameras , she 's actually quite adept at being behind one : before becoming a royal , she worked for her family 's business -- the uk-based event-planning company party pieces -- doing photography work , and her love of the art continued into her relationship with prince william . ",
        "according to vogue , she was the shutterbug responsible for the first official photo of princess charlotte , as well as for prince george 's first-day-of-preschool snapshots . and i 'm not talking about standard iphone photography , either : middleton 's skills are so impressive that she was granted a lifetime honorary membership by the royal photographic society . unfortunately , likely due to royal protocol , middleton 's body of public work is very limited , but we can all certainly dream of a world in which she could share artfully composed insider shots on instagram from prince harry and meghan markle 's may wedding .
