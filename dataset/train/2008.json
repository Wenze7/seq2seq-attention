        "the nashville predator 's gm david polie has been named the nhl 's gm of the year in the past and has made moves that will put him in the running again . prior to 2016 , nashville predators ' general manager david polie may not have been a name that grabbed much attention from hockey fans around the league . however , now most people know his name and expect a huge trade to come along . since january 2016 , david polie has engaged in three blockbuster trades that turned the hockey world 's attention to nashville . ",
        "the trades involving ryan johansen , p. k. subban , and kyle turris have brought leadership , chemistry , attention , and numerous points to nashville . there are various reasons why david polie was named the nhl 's general manager of the year last year . in addition , moves made this year will put david polie in the running for gm of the year again following the 2017-2018 season . jones for johansenon january 6 , 2016 , the nashville predators traded defenseman seth jones to columbus for center ryan johansen . at the time of the trade , it was hard to predict who would win the trade . ",
        "nashville already had a solid defense core with names like shea weber , roman josi , and ryan ellis . even though seth jones was predicted to be a top line defenseman , nashville had many young defensemen who could play top line minutes . the loss of jones did not affect them the way it would have if they lacked a strong 'd ' core . the strong defensive core that nashville had did not make up for the fact that they lacked a first line center . although ryan johansen did not fit perfectly in the system in place in columbus , he fit perfectly in nashville 's system . ",
        "ryan johansen made a great first impression scoring on his first shot attempt as a predator . during his time , thus far , in nashville , johansen has continued to be the number one center nashville needed . in the 2016-2017 season , johansen contributed 14 goals and 47 helpers for a total of 61 points . during the 2017 portion of the 2017-2018 season , johansen contributed 5 goals and 19 helpers for a total of 24 points . next : subban for webersubban for weberon june 29 , 2016 , the nhl saw one of its largest trades to date . ",
        "david polie was right in the middle of it . the nashville predators traded their captain shea weber to the montreal canadians for defensemen p. k. subban . shea weber helped establish the franchise that is known as smashville . if fans had to guess who polie would have traded following the 2015-2016 season , not many would have said weber . subban made a strong impression on nashville from the moment he arrived . the day he got to nashville he performed karaoke at tootsie 's and just days after , pictures swarmed the internet of him sporting his new predators jersey . ",
        "subban 's impact in the community continued throughout his first season in nashville . in the 2017-2018 season , he started his blueline buddies program which brings a nashville teen and law enforcer together for a game . he continued his traditional christmas surprise in nashville which can be seen in a video here . it is safe to say subban embraced nashville and in return , nashville embraced subban . a strong presence in the community does not win hockey games . luckily , in addition to performing at tootsies , subban performs on the ice . in the 2016-2017 season , subban contributed 10 goals and 30 assists for a total of 40 points . ",
        "he is off to an even better start in 2017-2018 with 9 goals and 20 assists for 29 points in the 2017 portion of the season . shea weber was nashville 's leader , however ; nashville adjusted just fine without him . subban is a younger defenseman who is in his prime while shea weber is getting older and out of those prime years . david polie made a tough decision by trading his captain but he is paid to win hockey games , and that is what the predators are currently doing . but , what about now ? ",
        "next : neal vs. jarnkrokneal vs. jarnkrokthe nhl named david polie general manager for the 2016-2017 season after he acquired subban and made moves that allowed his team to compete in the stanley cup finals . however ; after receiving the award , polie was faced with a huge decision due to the expansion draft . polie chose to protect calle jarnkrok and expose james neal . the vegas golden knights selected james neal from the nashville predators and many fans questioned polie 's reasoning for exposing him . the protection of jarnkrok in the expansion draft was the first decision polie made following the stanley cup finals that would put him in the running for general manager of the year after the season . ",
        "the nashville predators lost some leadership when they lost james neal . however ; there were already players in the locker room ready to step up . in addition to naming roman josi captain , polie chose an associate and three assistant captains . these guys have done their part in leading the group , as shown by their current division standing . the nashville predators also lost a wicked wrist shot when they lost james neal . however ; between filip forsberg , kevin fiala , and viktor arvidsson , the predators have many options when it comes to snipers . ",
        "calle jarnkrok is a young and dynamic player . he has proven he can play center or winger which is necessary for the predators down the stretch as they deal with different line combinations , the chemistry between players , and injuries . in addition , jarnkrok is having a tremendous year with 10 goals and 10 assists through the 2017 portion of the 2017-2018 season . lastly , protecting jarnkrok gives the predators an extra $ 3 million in cap space that allowed them to sign bigger names , like ryan johansen . next : acquisition of turrisacquisition of turristhe acquisition of kyle turris in a three-way trade was an exclamation point on all the moves david polie has made in the last few years . ",
        "in the trade between colorado , ottawa and nashville , the predators lost samuel girard and vladislav kamenev but received kyle turris . his impact has been seen nightly on the ice . turris had 18 points in the 24 games he played with nashville in 2017 . the acquisition of turris also sparked chemistry in the predators second line consisting of him , kevin fiala and craig smith . david polie knew that in order to reach the ultimate goal , his team needs four dangerous lines . acquiring turris as a second line center allows the preds to have this . ",
        "with ryan johansen centering the top line , and guys like nick bonino , colton sissons , and scott hartnell centering lines three and four , the preds are able to compete at all levels of the lineup every night . next : new year , new questionsthere is no question why polie was chosen as the nhl 's general manager of the year in the past . in addition , there is no question that he will be in the running for the award again this year . as crazy as it seems , it 's only january . ",
        "one can not predict what polie has up his sleeve before the trade deadline . all we know is that he will do whatever it takes to give the nashville predators a chance at the stanley cup again this season .   ",
