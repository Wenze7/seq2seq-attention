        "in 1976 , this railway station had been hit by graffiti vandals - today it 's one of the busiest stations on the tyne and wear metrolong before it became a busy station on the tyne and wear metro line , pelaw operated as a railway station . it was one of the many stops on the new rapid transit system that metro adapted from the old suburban railway lines on the north and south of the river tyne . a chronicle photographer arrived at the station in gateshead on june 30 , 1976 to capture photographs of graffiti which was daubed over walls and buildings . ",
        "our main image shows the word ` newcastle ' emblazoned down the side of the public walkway which led to the platforms . newcastle chronicleit was an era when the sight of graffiti sprawled across tyneside public places was not uncommon . ` nufc ok ' , ` skins ok ' and ` supermac ok ' - the last one referring to newcastle united striker malcolm macdonald - were some of the regular tags around tyneside in the 1970s . the phenomenon of graffiti was not quite as commonplace when pelaw railway station opened back in 1843 . it underwent changes in 1850 , 1857 and 1896 as pelaw became home to the co-operative wholesale society at the turn of the 20th century . ",
        "the co-op built an almost mile-long string of red-brick factories along shields road on what had been fields between heworth and bill quay . they included a drug and drysaltery works , as well as engineering , cabinet-making , printing , tailoring , shirt , clothing , quilt and bedding factories . many of the goods that filled the shelves of co-op `` stores '' around the north were made here . when all the factories were operating at their peak , they provided jobs for 3,000 local people , many of whom would have got the train to and from pelaw . ",
        "in 1979 - three years after our graffiti picture was taken - the british rail station closed , being replaced by heworth interchange as a rail stop , with the site also operating as a metro station when the system began running in 1981 . remember 35 years ago ? 20 photographs of newcastle and the north east in 1983in 1984 , the metro line was extended down through hebburn and jarrow towards south shields , but it was n't until the following year that pelaw opened as a new metro station . in 2002 , when the line to sunderland opened , the new route branched off just east of pelaw station . ",
        "then , in may 2006 , we reported : `` revamped pelaw metro station , hailed by bosses as a vision of the future , opened its doors after a Â£ 1.2 m refit . with a large domed silver roof and a covered waiting area , it will give commuters more comfort and safety , say nexus chiefs . ''   "
