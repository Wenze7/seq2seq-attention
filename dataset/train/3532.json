        "australian jeff horn retained his world boxing organisation welterweight title with an 11th round technical knockout win over english challenger gary corcoran in brisbane on wednesday . horn , in his first title defence since he upset philippine boxing hero manny pacquiao in brisbane in july this year , finished strongly to batter corcoran and force the decision . horn is now in line to face the undefeated american terence crawford in las vegas in april . asked about crawford , horn said : `` it 's a big possibility . if that is what everyone wants to see , i guess that is what is going to happen . ",
        "`` the win took horn 's career record to 18 wins , 12 by ko , with one draw . `` i felt my timing was a bit off but i got him in the end . he definitely pushed me in there , '' horn said . `` we both had cuts over our eyes and i was just trying to wear him down . `` corcoran 's corner threw in the towel in the 11th round after the englishman had endured a savage beating from horn , leaving his face a bloodied mess . british boxer amir khan is another who has designs on horn 's world title belt and was ringside on wednesday with a potential fight between the two next year . ",
        "horn , who reached the quarter-finals of the light-welterweight division at the 2012 olympic games , has never lost a professional bout . corcoran slugged it out with horn up until the middle stages of the scheduled 12 rounds , but the australian 's superior stamina and punching power won him the closing rounds leading to the fight 's stoppage . `` just too many cuts , i could n't see the shots coming , '' corcoran said . `` fair play to jeff , he 's a good fighter . i 'll be back , i 'll learn from it . ",
        "`` horn was well ahead on the three judges ' scorecards when the fight was stopped with corcoran cut and bleeding badly .   "
