        "arlington -- one of the foundational philosophies of jason garrett 's life , for 25 years in pro football , has served him well . `` i only concern myself , '' garrett has said so often , first as a dallas cowboys player and now as the organization 's head coach , `` with things within my control . '' on sunday , rather amazingly , a handful of other nfl results opened a path for dallas to leapfrog into the playoffs -- only to see garrett 's cowboys flop in a 21-12 home loss to seattle . things were within dallas ' control . ",
        "and the cowboys blew it . so now , should garrett be concerned for his job ? `` no , '' said cowboys owner jerry jones when i posed the question immediately after the loss , which dropped dallas to 8-7 and out of the playoffs , adding , `` there 's no qualms or no issues ... relative to anything to do with the coaching ... specifically at the top . we 've just got to get it done better . '' the cowboys have been to the playoffs twice in garrett 's seven full years as head coach , but lost in the divisional round each time . ",
        "maybe that means garrett has failed to fill expectations -- certainly those of some in cowboys nation . `` i do understand frustration right after you lose a game that has such meaningfulness as this ball game , '' jones said of how some fans feel about garrett , who is signed for the next two seasons at about $ 6 million per year . `` but ... i feel good about our head coach . ''   "
