        "ciudad guayana , venezuela -- juan carlos goite has to be creative , finding spare parts stripped from one broken-down locomotive to repair another in a desperate attempt to keep a once-thriving iron ore mining company running . dressed in a hard hat and oil-stained work clothes , the mechanic paces a dimly lit workshop strewn with salvaged train parts like motors , metal plates and hoses looking for the right piece . in cash-strapped venezuela , there 's no money to buy spare parts . years of neglect and corrupt management have left in decay ciudad guayana , a would-be pittsburgh carved from the jungles at the edge of the amazon . ",
        "`` the machinery that we have , it 's worn out , '' said juan arias , venezuela 's minister of industry who was sent by the socialist government in caracas to fix the once-thriving factory town . production this year at state-run sidor , venezuela 's largest steelmaker , is expected to reach barely 20 percent of its peak production , set a decade ago , he said . at its height in 2007 , under private ownership , the factory put out more than 4 million tons . still , it is eking out more than the year before , raising arias ' hopes of a shifting trend , despite venezuela 's lack of hard currency and u. s. sanctions that officials say are starving factories of the resources they need . ",
        "venezuela sits atop the world 's largest oil reserves , but low crude prices and a plunge in production have left it in an economic free fall . ciudad guyana was long seen as the future of venezuela . u. s. companies in the 1950s zeroed in on venezuela 's vast resources , pouring money into factories for turning iron ore to steel and bauxite for aluminum as well as rails and river ports for shipping it to market . dams on the caroni river provided abundant hydropower , while workers from all over the country poured into the new city dreamed up by planners from the massachusetts institute of technology . ",
        "nearly two decades ago , president hugo chavez came to power and launched his socialist revolution . in 2008 he began putting the factories , then owned by conglomerates from japan and argentina , under the state 's control . output steadily eroded even before the oil price crash . today , a massive dump truck that loads ore onto trains to be sent to the foundries -- a lynchpin in the cycle -- runs on a tire so badly worn that strips of rubber tread are missing . twisted piles of train cars that used to transport raw iron ore litter a hillside . ",
        "they derailed when an engineer was travelling too fast on rails left unmaintained . at sidor , only two of the four smelting ovens that make steel bars are functioning , and workers who used to operate around the clock put in just one shift a day now , officials said . `` chavismo ran all of these companies into the ground , '' said ricardo hausmann , a harvard university economist and former venezuelan planning minister . `` this whole thing has been imploding catastrophically . `` hausmann said that reviving venezuela 's industrial base will require abandoning the socialist model and replacing it with a market economy , motivated by supply and demand . ",
        "in 2016 , chavez 's successor as president , nicolas maduro , launched the nearby arco minero project , setting aside a wild swath of surrounding bolivar state for mining gold , diamonds and other precious metals . it was an idea chavez had proposed years earlier . leaders called upon dozens of foreign and domestic companies to invest in the project , which was designed to fill venezuela 's coffers and break its dependency on oil . so far it has gained little momentum . isaias suarez chourio , who worked his way up the ranks to be named president of another major plant in ciudad guayana , ferrominero orinoco , blames a long line of mediocre , deficient or corrupt managers who looted the factories ' profits for personal gain , while mistreating workers . ",
        "confident a turnaround has begun , suarez chourio says a key to increased production is inspiring the respect of workers -- from providing them with dignified locker rooms to honoring contracts to pay them . it also requires leading by example , he said . `` workers are n't stupid , '' said suarez chourio , whose brother heads venezuela 's army . `` it 's all about what the management , the president , does and what he says . `` workers at the state-run factories quietly complain that they once proudly filled the ranks of venezuela 's middle class , taking their families out to eat and going on vacations . ",
        "now , all their money goes to buying food . tony franco , 50 , put on his work shirt after a sunday lunch with his family and got ready for his night shift at ferrominero , where he has spent 28 years in electrical maintenance . franco had to sell his car and now walks several blocks to catch a bus to make it on time for his night shift . ferrominero is part of his self-identity , and he said he is ready to fight for a better life , not quite yet giving up on the government 's turnaround campaign . ",
        "`` paddle very hard , because if you keep paddling , the boat wo n't sink in the middle of the sea , '' he said . `` if you do n't save yourself , nobody else is going to save you . ''   "
