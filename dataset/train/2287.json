        "missouri botanical garden researcher dr. carmen ulloa is the lead author of `` an integrated assessment of vascular plant species of the americas , '' published today in science . ulloa along with 23 co-authors compiled a comprehensive , searchable checklist of 124,993 species , 6,227 genera and 355 families of vascular plants of the americas . this represents one third of all known vascular plants worldwide . establishing a checklist like this one has long been a goal of the garden . in 2015 , ulloa started to research what already existed among existing garden projects and other botanical institutions across the americas . ",
        "she then contacted the editors of the 12 major projects in the last 25 years that served as the basis for this larger checklist including the checklists of bolivia , brazil , colombia , ecuador , the guianas , mexico , peru , the southern cone , venezuela , and the west indies . two partially published datasets of the flora of north america north of mexico and the flora mesoamericana were also used . the garden 's plant database , tropicos ® was used as the projects data repository for the project . in the process , more than 25,000 names were added to tropicos before a final list was compiled . ",
        "`` this is the first time we have a complete overview of the plants of the americas , '' said ulloa . `` it represents not only hundreds of years of plant collecting , and botanical research , but 6,164 botanists who described species that appear on this list . it is vital we have this information so that we know what each species is for conservation purposes . '' co-author dr. robert magill first developed tropicos in the early 1980s on tiny osborne 01 microcomputer . today , it is the world 's largest botanical database . it is accessed more 70 million times each year by researchers around the world . ",
        "it is a link to the past , a digital version of 4.4 million specimens in the garden 's expansive herbarium . it is also a link to the future , the basis of a larger project , the world flora online . the missouri botanical garden and more than 40 other institutions are working to develop the world flora online with the goal of documenting all known plant life by 2020 . a number of co-authors are current or former members of the missouri botanical garden research staff including dr. gerrit davidse , heather stimmel , dr. james zarucchi , dr. peter jørgensen , magill and garden president emeritus dr. peter raven . ",
        "in addition to this , dr. tom croat and dr. charlotte taylor are both acknowledged in the study 's supplemental material for having more than 400 described plant species on the americas list . each year , missouri botanical garden researchers name hundreds of new species of plants with unknown potential . though the process starts at collection at sites around the world , the real work takes places through the examination and comparison of all known species in herbaria and in tropicos . digital records make it possible for those researchers working around the world to access information on their way to a new discovery . ",
        "other recommendations in the paper , including the support and development of taxonomic expertise , more focused research and embrace of new technologies are shared goals of the garden for its work in around the world . digital and video images of a collection of species in this checklist found at the missouri botanical garden can be obtained by emailing pr@mobot . org . the missouri botanical garden 's mission is `` to discover and share knowledge about plants and their environment in order to preserve and enrich life . '' today , 158 years after opening , the missouri botanical garden is a national historic landmark and a center for science , conservation , education and horticultural display . "
