        "when snowstorms like thursday 's terrifying `` bomb cyclone '' come for the east coast , many people decide to stay inside . many people , but not ansel elgort . elgort , who is nominated for a 2018 golden globe for his lead performance in baby driver , took advantage of snow being on everyone 's mind and reposted a video of him taking to an empty lot in a red corvette and spinning effing doughnuts in the snow , all with a smile , while a blizzard rages around him . look at this guy go ! nyc snowstorm no worries baby will give u a ride ðŸ˜Ž pic . ",
        "twitter . com/ouyvi787bh -- ansel elgort january 4 , 2018 . watching this clip , which was probably taken by elgort 's brother warren , makes me proud of my very fast son , but i also have some questions . does he know one of his headlights is out ? did he put snow tires on his car before attempting this ? and most importantly : were his seats heated ? in any case , good for ansel elgort for delivering exactly what the world expects of the irl baby driver : stunts and smiles . the only thing he 's missing is a killer soundtrack .
