        "countless seniors rely on social security to pay the bills in retirement . but if you 're not careful , you could end up losing out on some of the money you 'd otherwise be entitled to . as we prepare to start a new year , here are three glaring social security mistakes you should pledge to avoid at all costs . 1 . jumping the gun on benefitsif you 're turning 62 in 2018 , you may be tempted to file for social security right away and get your hands on the cash you 're eligible for . ",
        "but before you rush to claim benefits , you should be aware that if you file before reaching full retirement age , you 'll reduce the amount you get to collect each month . how much of a hit are we talking about ? say your full retirement age is 67 , at which point you 'd be entitled to $ 1,600 a month based on your personal earnings history . if you claim benefits at 62 , you 'll lower each payment to just $ 1,120 . now if you 're not really counting on social security to pay the bills in retirement , but rather just want the money sooner to use mostly for leisure purposes , then claiming benefits at 62 is n't such a bad idea . ",
        "but if your savings level is poor and you need those benefits to stay afloat financially in retirement , then be sure to think twice before filing early and slashing your payments for life . 2 . delaying benefits when your health is poorwe just talked about the fact that filing for social security early is a move that can backfire in the long run . on the other hand , if you 're diagnosed with a medical condition next year that shortens your life expectancy , and you 're at least 62 at that point , then it actually pays to file for benefits rather than wait until the age you might 've previously planned on . ",
        "though social security is technically designed to pay you the same amount in lifetime benefits regardless of when you first file , that formula only works if you live an average life expectancy . if you have reason to believe that you 'll pass away sooner than the average person your age , then it pays to jump on those benefits immediately . here 's an example . say you 're 63 with a full retirement age of 66 , at which point you 'd be eligible for $ 1,600 in monthly benefits . a few months down the line , you 're diagnosed with a health issue that shortens your life expectancy to 73 . ",
        "if you wait until 66 to get at those benefits and do indeed pass away at 73 , you 'll end up with $ 134,400 in total lifetime payments . if you file at age 63 , you 'll reduce each monthly payment to $ 1,280 , but you 'll collect 10 years ' worth of benefits for a total of $ 153,600 , which means you 'll come out nearly $ 20,000 ahead . 3 . ignoring missing paymentsif you 're already collecting social security and suddenly have a payment go missing next year , do n't wait to follow up on it . ",
        "thanks to the equifax data breach that occurred earlier this year , countless social security numbers were left compromised , so if you do n't receive a payment as scheduled , it could be that a criminal has gotten your information and has managed to divert your benefits to a new address . if that 's the case , then you 'll need to get on top of that issue before more of your money goes missing . what should you do in this sort of scenario ? your first move should be to contact the social security administration and get the issue on record . ",
        "from there , you should be given instructions on what you 'll need to do to verify your identity and prove that the criminal claiming to be you is n't . this could mean providing copies of old tax records , pay stubs , or even social security documents you formerly received . convincing the social security administration that you 've had your benefits stolen could be a lengthy process that takes time to correct , so do n't delay if you find that your payments suddenly stop . avoiding these huge social security mistakes can set the stage for not just a more prosperous 2018 , but a healthier long-term financial outlook . ",
        "so as the new year gets closer , pledge to read up on social security and familiarize yourself with how it works . consider it a resolution you can easily keep .   "
