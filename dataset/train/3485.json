        "speed skaters ekaterina konstantinova , emina malagich and sofia prosvirnova Â© alexey filippov / sputnikthe russian olympic committee has unanimously voted in favor of russian athletes participating at the 2018 pyeongchang winter games under a neutral flag . the decision was announced at a meeting on tuesday , during which prominent russian athletes , coaches and roc members discussed the international olympic committee 's proposal to allow russians to perform under a ` no-flag ' status . the ioc has banned all russian national emblems in pyeongchang . roc president alexander zhukov stressed that the committee 's decision to back russian team members to compete as neutrals was based on the athletes ' willingness to travel to pyeongchang , despite all the difficulties . ",
        "`` today during our meeting we discussed the main issue that concerns not only our athletes , but our entire society , i mean the issue of russian athletes ' participation at the 2018 pyeongchang games that will start in less than two months , '' zhukov said . `` today a lot of russian athletes and coaches took part in our meeting and basically everyone had the same opinion : we believe that our athletes should go to south korea and do their best to glorify russia , '' he added . he outlined that athletes ' decisions on participating in or boycotting the upcoming games in south korea should be respected . ",
        "`` russian athletes expressed their willingness to participate in the pyeongchang games despite very difficult conditions and the unfair decision made by the ioc , '' zhukov said . `` we respect any decision our athletes make and we are urging everybody to respect the athletes ' position , even those who for personal reasons will decide not to participate at the olympic games . '' `` i would like to underline once again that today during our meeting we heard the voices of our athletes who said they want to participate in the olympic games , '' he concluded . ",
        "` ioc decision is against russia , not just athletes ' -- 3-time olympic champion irina rodninazhukov also emphasized that former moscow anti-doping laboratory chief grigory rodchenkov , whose claims triggered sanctions against russia , has `` inflicted irreparable damage to russian sport and the olympic movement in general . '' ice-hockey world champion and stanley cup winner pavel datsyuk , who attended tuesday 's meeting , said that the decision to compete under a neutral flag was correct . `` of course we should go and prove , '' he said to rt. `` i think the decision will unite us and will make us only stronger , so we should go to the olympics under a neutral flag and prove that we are strong . '' ",
        "speaking on the ioc 's verdict to ban the russian flag at the winter games , datsyuk noted that the team should n't focus on the decision and instead concentrate on the upcoming olympic tournament . `` i think that the decision is unfair , but we have to live with that and turn it to our advantage , '' he said . `` russian athletes have a very specific character : the more difficult conditions we face , the stronger we are . we need to be united and patient while dealing with that situation , '' he concluded . ",
        "russian sports minister pavel kolobkov also expressed hope that athletes who will compete in pyeongchang will cope with the pressure that has been exerted on them . `` it will be difficult to perform under pressure , but our athletes are true fighters and i 'm sure they 'll cope with all the difficulties , the same way as denis uskov did at the recent speed skating world cup stage , where he earned two gold medals , '' kolobkov exclusively told rt. . last week , an ioc executive board meeting decided to ban russia from the 2018 winter olympics in pyeongchang over alleged systematic doping manipulations , but allowed ` clean ' athletes who have never been convicted of doping to compete in south korea as neutrals .
