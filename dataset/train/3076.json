        "a young patient is accusing a gynecologist in northeast china of pressuring her to undergo unnecessary procedures then forcing her to settle the bill up front by whipping out a qr payment code in the operation room . according to one expert , her ordeal resembles similar accusations against gynecologists in china who mislead women to pay for ultimately needless treatments with threats it will affect their chances of conception , media reported . jiang meng , 20 , had been diagnosed with a condition that if not treated right away , according to the doctor , would leave her infertile . ",
        "she was promptly charged 1,860 yuan and rushed to undergo treatment . a following check-up at another hospital , however , revealed that not only had jiang been misled , but her records show she never underwent the prescribed treatment . jiang said visited the dalian hospital on saturday for what she suspected were severe menstrual cramps when the doctor broke her the news . `` they said i had severe ` cervical problems ' and needed an operation , '' said jiang . more specifically , cervical eversion , a harmless condition found in many women where cells from inside the cervical canal are present on the outside surface of the cervix . ",
        "jiang said she wanted to inform her family when another doctor dissuaded her . `` they said if i postpone this any longer , i could be infertile , '' jiang said . the doctor waited until they were in the operation room to bring up the 1,860 yuan bill . he also produced a scannable qr code to make the transaction . `` i only had 600 yuan in my wechat wallet , '' jiang said , who managed to pay the balance after the operation . it was only afterward that jiang felt something was wrong . `` what kind of doctor carries a qr code to perform an operation ? '' ",
        "she asked . jiang 's suspicions heighted after a follow-up at a reputable area hospital , where doctors told her condition was quite normal . `` cervical eversion can not even be counted as a disease , '' employees at the hospital said . `` and they did not even administer the proper cervical exams . `` the previous hospital confirmed the doctor in question as an employee . `` the woman with qr code is our doctor , '' said an employee , declining to comment further . some medical institutions in china have been accused of similar diagnoses to pad bills , a gynecologist told the reporter .
