        "`` the post '' was made for this moment , in more ways than one . not only does steven spielberg 's crisp retelling of the pentagon papers story call attention to journalism 's highest calling , but washington post publisher katharine graham 's heroic stand -- having been thrust into that position -- is a stirring portrait of courage during feminism 's pre-roe v. wade era . with meryl streep at her best as graham , and tom hanks cast as the post 's colorful editor ben bradlee , `` the post '' certainly does n't lack for star power . ",
        "but its assets , and significance , go well beyond the showier roles , capturing a newspaper -- still on the cusp of greatness -- that stood up to a corrupt administration , which included putting journalism ahead of its business interests , as quaint as that sounds . at first , the movie appears to have put the camera in the wrong place , given that it was the new york times that first broke the leak of classified documents in 1971 that outlined the prosecution of the vietnam war -- and what the government really knew about it -- across multiple administrations . ",
        "bradlee , in fact , has surmised something big is brewing because a star times reporter has gone too long without a byline . still , the post 's role becomes clear as it races to catch up , while the nixon administration has handcuffed the times by suing to enjoin the paper from further publication . the timing , however , could n't be worse , with graham in the midst of an initial public offering , and her advisers counseling against taking on the government , or doing anything that might rock the boat , during that process . ",
        "for graham , who only became publisher after her husband 's suicide , the pressure reflects a departure from a privileged d. c. society life where the women are shown politely retiring to the other room while the men discussed politics and business . graham is `` in a position she never thought she 'd be in , '' bradlee 's wife tony reminds him . paulson is only one of the high-profile tv stars that appear at the margins , as the filmmakers have cast this project to the hilt , including matthew rhys as whistleblower daniel ellsberg and bob odenkirk as bradlee 's trusted lieutenant ben bagdikian . ",
        "richard nixon , notably , also plays a supporting role , with spielberg using snippets of his white house recordings to reflect the animus he harbored toward the post . hanks ably captures bradlee 's hard-charging swagger , falling somewhere between the actual guy and jason robards in `` all the president 's men . '' `` the only way to assert the right to publish is to publish , '' he snarls at one point . streep , however , towers over it all as the refined , soft-spoken graham , in no small part because the movie not only humanizes her but gives her the best dialogue -- seemingly designed , as it did during an early screening , to unleash spontaneous applause from those in the audience who will immediately see parallels between the press today and these seminal events 36 years ago . ",
        "inevitably , `` the post '' will be politicized , but the story stands on its own , establishing a powerful sense of drama and gravity with the attributes of a thriller , even knowing the outcome . to put it in terms that meant a lot more at the time , spielberg has delivered an above-the-fold story , from start to -30 - . `` the post '' premieres dec. . 22 in the u. s . it 's rated pg-13 .
