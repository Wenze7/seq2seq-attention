        "teaneck , n. j. -- it is a terrible human toll you might not know about -- more than 1 million limbs are amputated every year due to poor blood flow . as cbs2 's dr. max gomez reported monday , a local hospital is working on a groundbreaking treatment that could give those at risk of amputation the greatest gift of all -- a chance to keep their limbs . `` i 'm 83 years old , so i lived a good life , '' said charles mcclester . mcclester , a diabetes sufferer , knew if doctors had to take his foot , his good life would forever change . ",
        "`` i ca n't imagine what that would be like , '' he said . but limb amputations do happen -- every 30 seconds in the u. s . many of these cases could be avoided , said dr. john rundback of holy name medical center in teaneck , new jersey . `` more than half of the people who have a major amputation never even get a vascular evaluation to find the underlying cause , '' rundback said . the most common underlying cause is atherosclerosis in blood vessels . it could be the result of high cholesterol , high blood pressure , or diabetes . ",
        "`` there 's a prevailing view that atherosclerosis , or hardening of the arteries , is just a phenomenon of getting older , '' rndback said . when left untreated , the disease can impede blood flow and prevent wounds from healing -- which is what leads to amputation . but now , a revolutionary procedure at holy name hospital teaneck may prevent many of those amputations . rundback and his team of interventional radiologists are studying a way to prevent the worst-case scenario . `` this clinical trial is now evaluating the injection of a special protein that recruits your own stem cells -- cells that migrate to the area where there 's a wound and now turn into blood vessels ; turn into healing cells ; turn into skin cells , '' he said . ",
        "the injection , which follows a minimally invasive procedure to clear the plaque , is called stop-pad . the two-year study , conducted at 24 sites across the u. s. including holy name hospital , has shown such positive results in treated patients that it has been fast tracked by the food & drug administration . `` charles was a typical patient for us -- an older man , diabetic , who presented with a wound and had the potential to have a major amputation , '' rundback said . it is a double blind study , so neither mcclester nor the researchers know if he received a placebo or the actual protein . ",
        "either way , mcclester avoided amputation and he is back on his feet . `` i 'm happy about that , '' mcclester said . the clinical trial follows a previous study with 180 patients that saw a majority of patients experience less pain , a reduction wound size and improvement in overall feeling of wellness .
