        "atlanta -- mention `` last year '' in the atlanta falcons domain and it 's sure to elicit a rebuke in return . but somebody had to do it . `` i do n't think about last year , '' star receiver julio jones scoffed . `` i do n't want to talk about last year . '' you 'd be sick of last year , too , if you were a falcon -- new year 's eve or not -- and people are still prone to bring up the past and a season that ended with the biggest blown lead in super bowl history . ",
        "yet by some measure , last season says something about this campaign for the falcons , who clinched their return ticket to the playoffs with a gritty , 22-10 victory against the carolina panthers on sunday . the falcons open the wild-card round on saturday against the upstart los angeles rams and strikingly are the only team on the nfc side of the playoffs to make it back to the postseason . think about it : the dallas cowboys , green bay packers , seattle seahawks , detroit lions and new york giants are all on the sideline for the playoffs after having a shot last season . ",
        "stuff happens . that 's why jones is expressing some serious truth in filing away last year . still , just getting back to the playoffs is a positive testament to the psyche of these falcons , who have heard too much about super bowl hangovers , the super bowl collapse and the fact that you 'd have to go back to the bruce smith-jim kelly buffalo bills of the 1990s to find a team that returned to the super bowl the season after losing in the big game . `` it shows our grit , our ability to overcome the whole thing of people having a lack of success the year after the super bowl , '' linebacker vic beasley said . ",
        "`` we just took that to our mind and tried not to have that outcome . '' playoff picture : the field is set after wild week 17 finish . nfl playoffs schedule : games , dates , times , tv channel info . raiders make move : del rio fired amid report of gruden pursuit . at midseason , the falcons were 4-4 and seemingly destined for a season on the scrap heap . but they won six of their final eight games to charge into the postseason with a healthy dose of momentum that will make them a tough out . ",
        "new year , different identity . in the clincher on sunday , the defense led the way . the front line kept consistent heat on cam newton , and the ballhawks in the secondary picked him off three times . that was sorely needed because the matt ryan-led offense spent the bulk of the game sputtering while in striking range . ryan passed for 307 yards and avoided the big gaffe on a turnover-free day , but they would not have won without the five field goals from matt bryant , including a 56-yarder in the fourth quarter . four of bryant 's kicks salvaged something after atlanta reached the red zone , with the other one coming as the group approached the area . ",
        "this is what can happen when your running game is derailed . devonta freeman caught a team-high nine passes for 85 yards , but he rushed for just 23 yards . meanwhile , as efficient as ryan was , it was a tough day to find any explosive chunk plays . `` obviously , we 're a very explosive team , '' jones said . `` people always say , ` aw , you can score more points , ' which we can . but we did enough today to get the w. '' jones caught five passes for 80 yards , but beyond that epitomized the identity of his team early in the game . ",
        "on the first series , he absorbed a thunderous hit in the midsection from mike adams as he ran a crossing route over the middle . jones was attended to by trainers and briefly left the game . when he returned , his first two routes took him over the middle . that type of grit is seemingly more essential to the identity of this year 's team . no , jones does n't want to compare , but last year the falcons rolled into the playoffs with the nfl 's highest-scoring team . they averaged 33.8 points per game and put up 540 points , seventh-most in nfl history , which equated to a lot fast starts and a lot of opponents playing catch-up . ",
        "that formula aided the young , fast defense , allowing it to play faster while protecting leads . yet this season , with former coordinator kyle shanahan coaching the 49ers and steve sarkisian now pushing the buttons , the falcons have had to scratch out points like common teams . they 've averaged more than 11 points fewer per game , which has equated to much tighter games , week after week . `` last year , the expectations were super high because we were putting up a lot of numbers , '' said freeman . `` now , it 's been a struggle . ",
        "but we 're just going out there continuing to fight . '' that 's the spirit . but if the falcons are to get back to the super bowl , it will mean winning three consecutive road games as a wild-card entrant . last year , they had a bye and won back-to-back playoff home games . `` anywhere , any place , any time , '' freeman said . `` it 's another opportunity . '' besides , who 's sweating last year now ? that 's so 2017 . follow jarrett bell on twitter @jarrettbell . photos : best of nfl week 17 . "
