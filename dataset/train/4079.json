        "the popularity of exchange-traded funds rose in 2017 as investors shied away from investing in mutual funds . growth in etfs , which are baskets of stocks , rose globally . credit suisse , the swiss investment bank , reported that inflows for etfs topped $ 424 billion in november 2017 while mutual funds only received $ 91 billion . as both institutional and retail investors allocated more money into etfs because of the ability to trade them during market hours like individual stocks and their tax efficiency , interest in mutual funds fell rapidly . the rise in the inflows of etfs is not surprising since the expense ratios for etfs have declined and the assets often mirror the ones in open-ended mutual funds , making the decision easier for investors to choose between the two options . ",
        "etfs are usually cheaper than open-ended mutual funds , said c. j. brott , founder of capital ideas , a registered investment advisor in dallas . a direct comparison is the vanguard s&p 500 open-end fund , , which has an expense ratio of 0.14 % . its duplicate in the etf format is the vanguard s&p 500 etf , , which has an expense ratio of 0.04 % . while 10 basis points annually appears like a nominal difference , it adds up over time , especially when an investor is saving for retirement , he said . when market volatility picks up again , the ability to buy and sell intraday in etfs will become an advantage unlike mutual funds which price after the markets close . ",
        "the number of etfs has also grown , and investors can choose them not only based on sectors , but also types of assets and regions . the yield of many etfs has increased in this bull market , especially factor-based approaches like smart beta which have `` performed extremely well in the past few years , no doubt contributing to investor demand for etfs , '' said rich messina , a senior vice president of investment product management at e-trade , a new york-based brokerage firm . `` the record inflows to etfs comes as no surprise since they are cost-effective and highly liquid , '' he said . ",
        "`` for passive investors , they may not require much portfolio maintenance . `` portfolio managers are facing headwinds in justifying the fees in actively managed assets like mutual funds since they often do not outperform those of a standard index fund , messina said . `` for those who still want some component of active management , there are plenty of actively managed etfs to get their fill , '' he said . as the market continues to reach new highs in 2018 and extends one of the longest bull runs in history , investors who follow a sector rotation strategy can pursue a `` dogs of the dow '' theory , said patrick morris , ceo of ny-based hagin investment management . ",
        "`` this is the only way to play etfs , '' he said . investors could overweight the underperforming etfs from the past 12 months and underweight outperformers . `` this makes for a sort of mean regression to average hypothesis , '' morris said . `` however , sectors can remain unattractive for more than 12 months , so the timing is arbitrary . right now the argument would be that the energy sector has underperformed the commodity price of oil , so you would overweight energy . `` the real estate , consumer staples and energy sectors have all underperformed both the equal weight and s&p 500 , but healthcare and technology have `` massively '' outperformed with the materials and industrials sectors also over performing , he said . ",
        "`` so if you flip it and go big by overweighting energy , consumer staples and the real estate sectors , an etf strategy is the most efficient way to build a diversified sector rotation portfolio , '' morris said . investors favored non-u . s. etfs in 2017 , especially ones which focused on the emerging markets , said brott . one of the largest and most active is the ishares msci emerging markets and has the `` most institutional interest and the most active options market , '' he said . `` but is also relatively expensive with a net expense ratio of 0.69 % and only $ 39.44 billion of assets . ",
        "`` a better choice for investors who want to buy and hold their asset is the vanguard ftse emerging markets etf , which has the same index with assets of $ 66.7 billion , but less trading volume . the expense ratio is 0.14 % and that is a `` significant advantage for a non-trader , '' brott said . one of the emerging markets which is attracting interest is india . ishares has two good offerings , including ishares india etf . the net expense ratio is high at 0.68 % and with only 70 stocks , it is very concentrated in the top 10 indian companies and so far , that has been the way to play india , '' he said . ",
        "as india develops , an investor could add ishares msci india small-cap etf to their portfolio , brott said . the expense ratio is 0.75 % , but the etf holds 240 indian small caps . `` if the economy takes off , owning both etfs would give great exposure to the entire indian economy , '' he said . one of the hurdles investors could face when they are investing in emerging markets is the potential strength of the us dollar this year . `` if the us dollar starts to recover , it could suck liquidity out of the emerging market economies and cause havoc with very small economies , '' brott said .
