        "for the first time in four years , the saints are playoff bound with a 23-13 win over the falcons in the mercedes-benz superdome . it 's been a minute since the saints were in a playoff game . four years worth of minutes to be exact . but they are going thanks to a monstrous performance from their defense on sunday . a win over the buccaneers on new year 's eve will make the saints the champions of the nfc south as well . this was one of the strangest games in the history of the heated rivalry between atlanta and new orleans . ",
        "neither offense really got things going at any point . and , ultimately , it was the saints defense that ruled the day . it was n't actually as close as the score would indicate . the falcons put up 10 points in the 4th quarter as the saints fell into a softer , prevent defense . drew bees needed 35 yards on sunday to surpass 70,000 passing yards for his career and had that sewn up in the 1st quarter . but the passing game was relatively quiet for the rest of the day save for a 54-yard bomb to ted ginn jr. . ",
        "to put the saints up 13-0 just before the half . the marshon lattimore versus julio jones battle , round two , was epic . both players put in amazing performances though jones was kept out of the endzone . the game will best be remembered for the `` butt pick '' which you need to see to believe . the numberslattimore ended the day with six tackles , four passes defensed and an interception . julio had seven catches for 149 yards . and he was really the complete focus of the falcons offense in week 16 . the saints locked down devonta freeman holding him to 36 yards on 11 carries .

        "more from who dat dish michael thomas is now questionable for saints/falcons rematch1 d ago saints : marshon lattimore , julio jones matchup round two will be epic1 d ago mark ingram and alvin kamara showing records are meant to be broken1 d ago saints superfan harry connick jr. . posts epic hype video1 d ago saints : avoiding mistakes , containing the run and getting at matt ryan are key2d ago matt ryan was 22 of 36 for 288 yards , 1 td and 1 int . brees was 21 of 28 for 239 yards with 1 td and 1 int . ",
        "alvin kamara was held to 90 yards from scrimmage and was kept out of the endzone . mark ingram had 66 yards from scrimmage and an early td . the story of the day was atlanta getting within the 5-yard line twice and coming up with nothing . once on a fumble by devonta freeman and once on an epic goal line stand by the saints defense . the nfc southdespite the win , the 11-4 saints still have n't won the nfc south . they need to win next sunday against tampa bay to take that honor . or they can lose and win the division if carolina loses as well . ",
        "they did lock down a playoff seed however . if the saints lose next week and the panthers beat the falcons , the panthers win the division . if the saints beat the bucs , it does n't matter what happens with the panthers . it 's that easy . so , while it would have been nice to rest some starters next week , the saints wo n't have that luxury . they 'll need to go out and make sure a pesky tampa team does n't screw up their playoff seeding . there are still some injury concerns . ",
        "terron armstead and hau'oli kikaha both left the game early though it did n't appear to be anything serious . and michael thomas was limited in his touches due to a hamstring injury that showed up on saturday . shout outs for this game need to go to saints linebackers craig robertson and manti te'o . both showed they could handle the task at hand with a. j. klein out for the season . and to george johnson , the defensive end who 's been with the team less than two weeks but has 2.5 sacks in that time . ",
        "of course , cameron jordan is going to get a mention . he finished with three tackles and two sacks as he continues his ridiculous pace in the race for defensive player of the year . for the first time in four years , the saints are playoff bound with a 23-13 win over the falcons in the mercedes-benz superdome . it 's been a minute since the saints were in a playoff game . four years worth of minutes to be exact . but they are going thanks to a monstrous performance from their ...
