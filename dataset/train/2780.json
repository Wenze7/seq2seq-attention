        "south korean telecom giant samsung electronics expects to post record operating profits of more than $ 14 billion in the fourth quarter , it said tuesday . the company estimated operating profits of 15.1 trillion won in the october to december period , an all-time high for quarterly profits and nearly double the 9.2 trillion won posted a year earlier . but the figure was below analyst forecasts , which averaged 16.1 trillion won in a survey by bloomberg . the firm 's financial performance has soared on the back of demand for its memory chips and full-year operating profits were projected at 53.6 trillion won , or $ 50.4 billion -- also a record . ",
        "samsung has had to overcome a bribery scandal that saw the company 's de-facto head lee jae-yong thrown into jail as well as a damaging recall last year of its flagship galaxy note 7 smartphone over exploding batteries . lee , who was found guilty in august of bribery , perjury and other charges relating to payments made by samsung to ousted president park geun-hye 's secret confidante choi soon-sil , is appealing his five-year sentence and says he is innocent . but his travails have not impacted demand for its products . fourth-quarter sales were projected to have jumped 23.8 percent year-on-year to 66 trillion won , with full-sales estimated at 239.6 trillion won . ",
        "the company is set to release its final earnings report later this month . analysts have raised concerns in the face of a stronger korean won and a drop in memory chip prices . `` the won-dollar exchange rate is worrisome , '' lee seung-woo , an analyst at eugene investment and securities , said in a report before the announcement , according to bloomberg . but greg roh , an analyst at hmc investment , said the figures were `` satisfactory '' despite being lower than estimates . `` i think samsung overspent on marketing because it was the end of the year , '' roh told afp , and added : `` the first quarter for this year looks good for samsung . ",
        "`` samsung will reportedly roll out its new flagship smartphone , the galaxy s9 , next month , to compete with rival apple 's iphone x. samsung shares were down 1.27 percent on tuesday morning at 2,568,000 won . samsung electronics announced last october the first major reshuffle in its top leadership since 2014 , when the wider group 's chairman lee kun-hee suffered a heart attack that left him bedridden . the company replaced each of the three co-ceos who lead its semiconductor , mobile and tv units with younger executives , after its chief executive kwon oh-hyun stepped down saying the south 's biggest firm was facing an `` unprecedented crisis '' .
