        "sports are often an interesting prism for larger societal debates . as the u. s. considers a course of economic nationalism , a sports league that was founded with such inward leanings , major league soccer , is moving the other way -- becoming a buyer and seller of international talent . its nationalistic approach failed . perhaps that 's a warning sign for lawmakers . major league soccer was founded in 1993 as a way to grow american interest in soccer and to develop u. s. talent . yet every move the league has made since to grow and stabilize its finances has been to globalize . ",
        "american-centric rules for play , such as using a countdown clock , were dropped because they alienated traditional soccer fans . in 2007 , recognizing that american talent alone was n't enough to improve the league , mls created the designated player rule , allowing teams to spend extra money to attractive international players . initially set at one player per franchise , which let the legendary english player david beckham to join the los angeles galaxy , the rule now allows three designated players per team , with the money allotted for each slot increasing over time . rule changes can take a while to translate into revolutionary changes in strategy . ",
        "the national basketball association first introduced the three-point shot in 1979 , but it took until the 2010s for the golden state warriors to win nba championships by gearing their offense around it . and just as the warriors changed the nba , atlanta united may have changed the mls with its strategy as a first-year expansion team in 2017 . rather than building its team around american talent or aging international stars , atlanta took advantage of the designated player rule to create a high-scoring team with young south american talent . for its coach , atlanta hired gerardo `` tata '' martino , who previously had led the argentinian national team . ",
        "for its three designated players atlanta signed josef martinez , a venezuelan , héctor villalba , an argentinian , and miguel almirón , a paraguayan , all in their early 20s . the strategy bore fruit . atlanta was the second-highest-scoring team in the league and made the playoffs . it set the league record for attendance in a season and a single game . the three designated players accounted for 42 of the team 's 70 goals , with no american on the team scoring more than three . and two of those three players were in the top three in jersey sales , with almirón 's being the best-selling mls jersey . ",
        "with the atlanta model proving a success , other teams are looking to apply an even more extreme version of it . the los angeles football club , an expansion team in 2018 , has signed uruguayan teenager diego rossi , the second-youngest designated player in mls history . for its part , atlanta has tried to acquire 18-year-old ezequiel barco from his argentinian club team , willing to pay an mls-record $ 12 million transfer fee to acquire him . a spending spree on young south american talent is n't just about wins and losses . it 's also about the potential for profit by reselling players to wealthier clubs in europe down the road . ",
        "after their successful season with atlanta , offers came in for both almirón and martinez . the club is willing to pay $ 12 million for barco because of the potential to sell him for tens of millions of dollars down the road . mls may still be in the talent development business , only it 's likely to be south american rather than u. s. talent . although the league ca n't offer the money that wealthier european club teams can , it can offer young players more money than it could in the past and starting roles , rather than secondary positions they could expect in stronger leagues . ",
        "for the time being , promising american players like phenom christian pulisic are better off developing in stronger leagues in europe . mls is betting its future lies with fans in seattle , new york and atlanta cheering on young paraguayans , venezuelans and argentinians for a few years before they 're sold to europe . for this american sports league , globalization represents the best path forward . this column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or bloomberg lp and its owners . to contact the author of this story : .
