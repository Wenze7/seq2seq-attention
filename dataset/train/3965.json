        "at flexport , we believe that trade is the world 's single greatest force for economic and social uplift . we also believe that millions of people are blocked from participating in global trade due to complexity , difficulty , distance , and language . simply put : any two people on the planet should be able to trade with each other . today it 's far too hard for far too many people . flexport 's mission is to fix the user experience of global trade and enable millions of entrepreneurs to flourish . trade is inherently social . ",
        "when a small business owner in madison , wisconsin wants to import a product -- let 's say , hair dryers -- from a factory in shenzhen , china , people need to interact to make that happen . human interaction is central tao every step of the process : from designing and procuring the product , to placing purchase orders , to shipping the product from origin to destination . a big part of our work at flexport is facilitating these interactions . as a freight forwarder , flexport coordinates freight shipments end-to-end for our clients , across a network of underlying carriers . ",
        "we sit at the center of all the major players in the global supply chain : every shipment requires us to work with banks , carriers , factories , warehouses , importers , government agencies , and more . we 've seen firsthand that the industry status quo is fragmented communication . a single shipment requires the exchange of dozens of documents , forms , emails , and phone calls between all these different parties . each party requires access to different pieces of information , and it 's difficult for any individual collaborator to get the context they need to push the shipment forward . ",
        "supply chain professionals know all too well the pain of cross-referencing five different id numbers from one document to the next , or scrolling through hundreds of email replies on a single purchase order to figure out what 's going on . this type of information-gathering is painstaking , time-consuming , and unnecessary . we think one of the key components of fixing the user experience of global trade is to make it easier for everybody to communicate . that 's why we 're building a single platform where all supply chain stakeholders can connect and communicate seamlessly , with the most important context front and center . ",
        "no more cross-referencing id numbers . in flexport , each shipment is a single view with all the associated containers , documents , and products , alongside an activity feed of events . each stakeholder can get and give the information they need to , with minimal effort . factories can submit bookings ; importers can approve quotes ; teammates can ask and answer one another 's questions ; shipments can be updated , rerouted , and paid for ; all in one system that every stakeholder can join . as we 're building this platform , our network of connected stakeholders continues to grow . ",
        "soon , when you sign up for flexport , we will invite you to connect with factories who have already joined our network -- or invite your own factories to join if they have n't already . traditionally , when an importer selects a new factory to work with , the process involves qualifying and vetting , reviewing capabilities and licenses , and so on . with flexport 's network , that qualification only has to happen when the factory first signs up . we match signups against all global denied and restricted parties lists to ensure compliance , so you can trust that every factory in flexport is trustworthy . ",
        "there 's no end to the list of problems we can solve by connecting the global supply chain more seamlessly . we can use live translation to eliminate language barriers between trading partners . we can use a standard data model and a single api to eliminate the need for expensive custom integrations . we can build tools up and down the supply chain , from po management to allocation management to warehouse inventory management , making work easier for everyone who does business through our platform , no matter their role . companies like facebook , linkedin , and twitter have made it easier than ever before to connect and communicate with anyone on earth . ",
        "but this same level of frictionless discovery and interaction has n't been harnessed for the enterprise -- and that 's where we come in . flexport 's goal is to become the platform for global trade and expand economic opportunities for everyone in the world .   "
