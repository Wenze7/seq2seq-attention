        "asus may be best known for its laptops and other products but some of you will be well aware that the company has a track record of making some great all-in-one pcs as well . it 's no surprise that asus has launched a new aio at the consumer electronics show 2018 called the vivo v272 . it should provide decent performance considering what it has got going on under the hood . the asus vivo aio v272 has an 8th generation intel core i7 processor under the hood . while this is not a pure gaming machine , it does have a discrete nvidia geforce mx150 graphics which should be enough to get some casual gaming sessions done . ",
        "the aio pc has a 27 inch multitouch display with a wide 100 % srgb color gamut and 178 degree wide-view technology . it 's combined with the asus sonic master audio system with its bass reflex speakers for a superior entertainment experience . that 's all well and good but despite unveiling the product , asus has n't revealed the full technical specifications for the vivo aio v272 just yet . questions about the display resolution ram allotment , and additional configuration options are yet to be answered . asus says that the vivo aio 272 is going to be available in the first half of this year and that it going to confirm the pricing for this product at launch .
