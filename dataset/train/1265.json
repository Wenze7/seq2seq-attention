        "toronto -- the head of the investment industry association of canada says the risk of cyberattacks is being amplified by the significant outsourcing done by investment dealers and asset managers . ian russell told attendees at an empire club of canada luncheon on thursday in toronto that firms ' financial integrity and cybersecurity may not be matched by third-party vendors hired to enhance efficiencies , compensate for scale and reduce costs . to remedy this , he says regulators within canada need to co-operate and co-ordinate across the financial sector , involving insurance , banking and securities firms . russell says a positive example of such co-operation is the information-sharing memorandum recently forged between the financial consumer agency of canada -- the independent government agency that enforces consumer protection legislation -- and the investment regulatory organization of canada , a national self-regulating organization for investment dealers that sell stocks , bonds and other securities to consumers . ",
        "this formal co-operation between the two groups sets a framework for compliance and enforcement of rules , and suggests a more active rule-making and requirement regime at the fcac , russell says . such rule-making will in turn require greater interaction between bank and securities regulators , he adds . russell also says the newly established financial services regulatory authority in ontario will develop detailed regulations for the insurance industry and other financial institutions operating in the province . `` it is important that these banking and insurance regulators co-operate with securities regulators to ensure similar rules for similar retail activities , '' he says .
