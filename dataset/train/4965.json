        "westwgo , la. . -- a woman 's crabbing trip in louisiana turned tragic after she died from a flesh-eating bacterial infection health officials say came from eating raw oysters . jeanette leblanc of texas reportedly purchased a sack of raw oysters in westwego , louisiana during a family vacation in september . the woman 's wife told local reporters that the trouble started after leblanc ate about two dozen of the oysters . `` about 36 hours later she started having extreme respiratory distress , had a rash on her legs and everything , '' vicki bergquist told klfy . ",
        "the woman 's condition got even worse over the next two days and doctors determined that leblanc had been infected with vibrio . `` it 's a flesh-eating bacteria . she had severe wounds on her legs from that bacteria , '' bergquist added . according to the cdc , the victim 's family was at the wrong place at the wrong time . `` vibrio bacteria naturally live in certain coastal waters and are present in higher concentrations between may and october when water temperatures are warmer , '' according to the cdc 's description . about 80,000 cases of vibriosis are diagnosed in the united states each year with most of the illnesses coming from eating raw shellfish . ",
        "while most cases are mild and patients recover within three days , much more serious forms of the infection can put victims in intensive care or result in limb amputation . a quarter of patients with the severe form of the illness die . jeanette leblanc died on oct. . 15 , 2017 after battling the infection for three weeks . `` i ca n't even imagine going through that for 21 days , much less a day , '' family friend karen bowers added . `` if they really knew what could happen to them and they could literally die within 48 , 36 hours of eating raw oysters , is it really worth it ? ",
        "'' `` if we had known that the risk was so high , i think she would 've stopped eating oysters , '' leblanc 's partner said . while eating raw oysters is commonplace and the risk is low , it is not negligible . the food and drug administration has a page on their website devoted to myths associated with raw oysters and the vibrio bacteria that can be contracted as a result . the fda points out that vibrio in oysters has no scent , can not be killed by hot sauce or alcohol , and can contaminate oysters in any month -- not just summer months when temperatures are warmer ; although the disease is more commonly found then , as noted by the cdc as well .
