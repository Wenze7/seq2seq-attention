        "by plexi glass , primate researcher android # 16541dear fellow robots , aliens , and other life and death forms , in this issue of turning humanoid , we discuss ten subtle but distinct features that can distinguish you from the rest of the drove in perfecting your human-like craft . it 's not easy trying to fit in with humans . they are complicated at best , short-circuiting at worst . here are some tips and tricks so you wo n't raise suspicion in conspiracy theorists , lose a wiring module or get caught with your tail out in public . ",
        "complaining : humans are always complaining about something . think about your current human persona . what is your daily routine and how can you find something worth complaining about ? humans are prone to mistakes while completing a task , so that can be a sure-footed place to start . are you a `` sharon from human resources '' ? complain about people not filing paperwork correctly . do n't worry , even if you 're secretly programmed to organize chaos so you love when humans fail , complaining will make you relatable . important note : find a sweet spot between complaining about your own aliments and letting a human complain about theirs to you . ",
        "that is how `` friendships '' and `` bonds '' are formed , which are essential for your study and/or mission while visiting earth . 2 . facial expressions : as we all know , facial expressions are one of the hardest things to relate to . why do people laugh when they 're nervous ? cry when they laugh too hard ? say everything is fine when all logic and reasoning indicates otherwise ? this is something called `` learned behavior '' and it 's used to `` get along '' in modern day society . these methods were not common merely a few thousand years ago , but evolution took a left turn . ",
        "for example , if people are passive-aggressive , it helps them release tension in an unproductive way , thus letting them maintain their same status quo in their workplace or home environment . important note : microexpressions are very important . when you are listening to a human , be sure to furrow the brow and give direct eye contact every thirty seconds . nod your head in understanding whenever they are showing particular vulnerabilities . do this correctly and you establish `` trust '' . do this incorrectly , and humans will tend to think you have ulterior motives . ",
        "3 . where is your phone ? in this day and age , humans are constantly holding their phones like a security blanket . it is wise to always be in contact with your phone , regardless of what upgrades your circuitry has , or technology advancements your own planet is capable of . these pocket devices are not only a way to communicate with each other , but theyalso help humans in fixing `` boredom '' or `` social awkwardness '' - one of the most interesting characteristics a human being has , in my opinion . 4 . ",
        "self-deprecationlast year , extraterrestrial extra did a study on why a well-balanced vocabulary of self-deprecation worked so well in a group of teenage girls . it was a way to forge bonds , but also a way to express how `` humble '' they were , in spite of being perfectly symmetrical . humans are nothing if not contradictory ! the best way of expressing self-deprecation is to hyper focus on one area of your humanoid body , job or relationship and negatively obsess about it whenever someone brings up something similar in conversation . be sure to advert your eyes to express `` shame '' . ",
        "5 . politicsif there is one thing humans love to discuss , it is the long considered taboo subject of politics ! this topic is not best in every social situation , so it is wise to `` test the waters '' with a vague reference to a news channel discussing political matters , or a light hearted joke that will not be offensive to either party . be sure to check microexpressions in their responses to your quip , and move forward cautiously . debating is a fun and fruitless human effort , so enjoy when possible ! important note : due to our highly advanced memory boards , you will likely know each and every aspect of the political climate from your studies . ",
        "do not mystify the human you 're conversing with with hyper-detail or `` facts '' . instead , proceed with over-emotions and forgetfulness . 6 . set nonsensical goals and never achieve themas this year comes to a close , humans often turn inward on themselves and self-reflect . between experiencing `` nostalgia '' during the holidays , and eating too many negative energy food groups , humans create elaborate lists for the new year . these are often called `` resolutions '' or goals . from the end of december to february , you will see humans work on these goals with half-hearted attempts and unrealistic expectations . ",
        "this inspires `` hope '' just long enough for spring to come around and brighten everyone 's depressive winter mood . follow suit by creating your own truly useless list . important note : be sure to add things regarding your weight or finances . and whatever you do , do not succeed in achieving your goals as that will cause envy and arouse suspicion . as our anthropoid friends would say : happy holidays !
