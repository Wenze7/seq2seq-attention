        "human growth hormone has a huge impact on your physical appearance . it is well known that muscle growth is tightly connected to testosterone level . i have already discussed this phenomenon earlier . however , the main anabolic hormone next to testosterone is surely growth hormone . beside its high anabolic ability , people are often unfamiliar with hgh . for this reason , i am going to write about its role in the body , the best ways to increase it naturally and consequently improve your appearance , and finally which health risks are related to hgh abuse . ",
        "hgh is produced by the front pituitary gland . production is controlled by hypothalamic hormones . it is a polypeptide made from 191 aminoacids and it regulates the growth of all cells in the body . this includes muscle cells , viscera , nails , eyes and all tissues you can remember of . unlike all other anabolic hormones , hgh has the ability to induce hyperplasia , which means cell division resulting in increased cell number in some tissue . just imagine the influence of enlarged muscle cells on your look and strength . now you can probably understand the reason of hgh abuse in professional sports . ",
        "the highest hgh level is found in newborns . puberty is also followed by hgh increase . on the contrary , this hormone level is quite low in people older than 40 . secretion disorders in childhood and youth lead to growth disturbance . hgh does not affect body cells directly . igf-1 is the main mediator in hgh-cell communication . this is also polypeptide made in liver only when hgh gives the signal . also , it is responsible for described growing effect . let 's go deeper and learn something useful : how to naturally increase hgh and improve your performance without side effect which are common in hgh abuse . ",
        "by the way , hgh is in strict and complex relation with other hormones in the body . those relations are not fully understood yet , so i will write only about the confirmed ones . firstly : hgh induces protein synthesis , as well as nutrients transport into cells . secondly : hgh mobilizes fats from fat tissue and makes it available for burning and energy providing . so we can conclude : aminoacids easily enter cells , build proteins and cells grow . fats are being used as the source of energy , therefore glycogen storage is full which results in great muscle pump and strength . ",
        "this sounds fantastic , does n't it ? additionally , calcium absorption by bones is facilitated , so bones become strong and dense . other hgh effects are : cartilage , tendons and ligaments improvement , hdl increase and ldl decrease , skin rejuvenation , energy levels raising , metabolism acceleration and so on . it is more than obvious that an adequate hgh level is required for a healthy and long life . pituitary gland does n't release hgh constantly , this process is rather done in pulses . the greatest peak is achieved during a deep sleep , in rem phase to be exact . ",
        "this is why sleep quality is extremely important . every waking up , even for a few seconds , interrupts hgh secretion and certain time is needed to restore it . hitting snooze button for 15 times in the morning does n't seem like a good idea anymore , does it ? dehydration significantly decreases hgh release . on the other hand , hunger stimulates it . i am not advising you not to eat for all day long , but being hungry from time to time is not such a bad idea . also , try to eat your 5 -- 6 meals daily and nothing between . ",
        "every food intake is followed by rapid insulin increase . insulin and hgh do n't get along very well . actually , insulin causes an instant drop of hgh blood level . this does n't make insulin a bad guy , those two hormones simply have opposite functions in the body . insulin decreases blood glucose level by transporting it to the cells . hgh raises glucose in blood by making its absorption harder in order to make cells use fatty acids as a source of energy . as you can see , both of described metabolic pathways are important for maintaining healthy metabolism , it is up to us to make our body utilize them in an useful manner . ",
        "researches show that certain way of resistance training can stimulate hgh release . compound exercises in 1 -- 6 repetitions range as well as 30 sec sprints provoke hgh secretion peaks . it is believed that aminoacids such as arginine , glutamine and beta-alanine also induce hgh secretion . hgh secretion is tightly connected with fat percentage in the body . lower body fat means higher hgh . hence , if you are fat , try to lose some weight , this is the best advice i can give you . abuse of hgh is common in professional sport . ",
        "hgh or its derivatives are being injected in order to enhance performances . however , there is a huge span of possible side effects . as i have mentioned earlier , hgh induces the growth of all cells . just imagine what would happen if your inner organs such as heart , lungs , liver stared to grow wildly . even worse , if you had some cancer cells in the body , hgh abuse would only make them divide faster and grow more . also , since hgh raises glucose in blood , constant high levels of this hormone lead to diabetes onset . ",
        "do n't be afraid , natural levels of hgh and casual peaks wo n't cause such consequences . you can freely relay on techniques i shared in order to increase your growth hormone level and feel the benefits . professionals are the ones who should be aware of risks . serbian version : follow me on instagram : dusan petrovic * фотографије и видео записи на услузи instagram5 ,811 пратиоца , 4,869 праћења , 47 објава - погледајте фотографије и видео записе које dusan petrovic ... www . instagram . com .
