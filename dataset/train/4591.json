        "writing is in many ways like biology . in biology we were taught about the brain which is made up predominantly of two lobes - the left and right hemispheres . these two are distinct but they function together . the left brain controls the right side of the body and is largely responsible for logic , language , and analytic reasoning , while the right brain is the center for creativity , imagination , music and arts . to put those into perspective , we can simply say , the left side is for logic and numbers , while the right side is for creativity and imagination . ",
        "what does this have to do with writing ? everything . i 've observed many writers are tilted to one side of the brain than others . there are only a few who are balanced , i. e. those who tap fully into both sides of their brains . here 's what i meanfor me , the left side has to do with the business aspect of writing , while the right side has to do with the creative dimension of writing . they are equally important and demand equal focus . but , i 've realized that a lot of writers and aspiring writers are gravely concerned about the creative dimension of writing and not the business side of things . ",
        "they are unaware , or lack the information on how to tap into the monetary side of writing . that 's not right . i started out tapping solely into the creative side of writing . i studied , practiced , and weared my fingers out in writing pieces that inspire people . but then i began to read about men and women who were making thousands of dollars on a monthly basis from writing . then , i had a paradigm shift . my brain metaphorically reset itself . i began to dig and find a means to tap into this business dimension . ",
        "it was then i found ghostwriting and began to help people birth their books . i also caught a vision to start a publishing company . it was then heart2world publishing was born . it was amazing . i eventually resigned from paid employment to focus on the business , and it has been a tough adventure since then . if you are going to succeed as a writer , you can not afford to tap only into the creative sides of writing , you must see the commercial value in your writing talent . you can not continue to fuss and drool over the creativity of j. k rowling or the fondness of wole soyinka , or the depth of fiction in chimamanda adichie and forget that your words can earn you an income . ",
        "this is why , apart from my services as a ghostwriter , editor , and publisher , i went ahead to create paid courses for people . these courses add value to the students and to me as well . while i 'm reading everyday , trying my hands on different kinds of writing , i 'm also continually haunting down writing opportunities that can earn me income . that 's the way to go . what kind of writer are you ? are you only tapping into the right side or left side ? it 's time to merge the two . ",
        "i hope this helps someone .   "
