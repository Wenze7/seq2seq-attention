        "a russian comic book fan has launched a petition on change . org to `` make the joker gay again , '' as pointed out by bleeding cool . the petition , launched by elena shestakova , is aimed at dc comics president and chief creative officer geoff johns . the petition reads : the joker is a comic book character with almost 80 years history , half of which he was portrayed as homosexual - for instance , in such significant graphic novels as frank miller 's the dark knight returns or grant morrison 's arkham asylum : a serious house on serious earth . ",
        "neal adams claimed that the joker was and always had been homosexual . this opinion was shared by other comic books authors and artists for decades . that is why it 's so important to me and other queer readers to return his homosexuality . the joker repeatedly confessed his feelings to batman and showed an interest in other men . also there was joker 's unnamed boyfriend in the graphic novel devil 's advocate . the joker has many feminine traits - he uses lipstick , paints his nails , wears high heels and sometimes does crossdressing . we realize that some of these things is stereotypical , but it gives a very clear picture . ",
        "over the years , there were plenty of other queer moments in comics , cartoons and video games . however , in the late nineties someone decided to erase joker 's homosexuality and introduced harley quinn as his girlfriend . in the mass consciousness harley became his only love interest , although in canonical comics there is no evidence that there are romantic or sexual feelings from the joker 's part . his enforced relationship with harley quinn looks like an attempt to retconned his homosexuality and turn him in acceptable straight man . dc comics already has a great cast of queer characters - heroes , as well as villains . ",
        "maybe some people do n't want to see the `` terrible villain '' as part of the lgbt community . but on the other hand , in gotham series the penguin became gay without any problem , and he is morally no better than the joker . it 's not homophobic to have a queer villain . so why not let the clown prince of crime `` out of the closet '' ? dc rebirth is an excellent reason to bring the joker back to his roots . we ask dc comics to restore the joker 's homosexuality in comics and other media . ",
        "no one 's sexual identity should be changed , even it 's only a fictional character . because sometimes fictional characters is something real people hold onto . the above is a word-for-word copy and paste from a post made on comic book resources ' message board dated august 21 , 2017 . some users made the case for joker being asexual -- `` joker is too trollish to be sure about what is really going on with him , '' wrote jbatmanfan05 -- while others made the case for the villain being `` ambiguously gay . '' `` i think of the joker more as a pansexual who 's interested in whatever strikes his mood at the time , '' wrote user frontier . ",
        "the lego batman movie most recently played up joker 's `` love '' for the dark knight , exploring the relationship between the hero and villain : the joker needs batman , as has often been portrayed across various media across various continuities , whether or not a sexual component is involved . the iconic batman foe would join an ever-expanding list of lgbtq characters in comics : popular a-listers like dc 's catwoman and marvel 's iceman have been portrayed as bisexual or gay , with the icy x-man 's series most recently being nominated for a glaad media award for outstanding comic book .
