        "manchester city managers of the future have a problem . the football played at the end of 2017 will always be the standard to which they are held . this month , city fan noel gallagher , a man not known for his compliments and somebody that has seen 250,000 people at knebworth sing his name , described what is going on at the etihad as `` the greatest thing i 've ever seen in my entire life '' . hyperbole perhaps , but if you do not agree that pep guardiola 's side are playing the best football of the premier league era , then nobody can argue with the record that city are furthering each week -- it is 18 consecutive league wins and counting . ",
        "this is , however , not yet a guardiola record . between october 2013 and march 2014 under the spaniard , bayern munich won 19 bundesliga matches on the trot , the last of which a 3-1 victory at hertha berlin that secured the league title with seven matches to spare , also a record . how to compare guardiola 's run at bayern with this run at city ? different players in a different league at a different time . guardiola favoured a 4-1-4-1 formation in 2013-14 with philipp lahm scurrying about in front of the back four and the attack focused around one of mario mandzukic or thomas müller as the central pivot , the axis in a whirlwind of one-twos and cut-backs . ",
        "guardiola applied an updated tiki-taka model from barcelona to that bayern team : possession was still king - averaging 71.6 % over the winning run - with the inverted wingers of arjen robben and franck ribery allowing the full-backs to provide the width . just as dani alves had been the assist king at barcelona , nobody created more goals at bayern over that 19-game span than rafinha , arguably the team 's least technically accomplished player . his strategy at bayern , in its purest form , would die a death later that season when bayern lost their champions league semi-final second leg 4-0 at home to real madrid , as it became evident that the side could not cope with the counterattacks of europe 's elite . ",
        "but against werder bremen and eintracht frankfurt , schalke and wolfsburg , it worked a charm . bayern scored 64 goals in 19 matches at an average of 3.36 per game , and conceding 10 ; city have scored 58 times in the past 18 matches , at an average of 3.22 per game , conceding 12 . a tinkered version of that bayern blueprint lives on at city . the full-backs are still vital - as guardiola 's pre-season spending on benjamin mendy and kyle walker proved - but they sit a little deeper with leroy sané and raheem sterling instead providing width . ",
        "playing out from the back through the fulcrum of the team - first it was xavi/iniesta , then thiago/xabi alonso , now it is kevin de bruyne/silva - to these players remains key , but transitions are slower . guardiola still has his detractors . there are those that point out that he has never managed a struggling club . to others , it is simply the players and the money that has got him where he is - but josé mourinho is proving at manchester united that having seemingly unlimited resources does not necessarily mean unlimited success . other city managers have enjoyed huge budgets , but none can claim to have a winning record longer than eight matches . ",
        "he has also bought well : only nolito and claudio bravo look like clangers in the company of sané , john stones , danilo , ederson , walker , mendy , gabriel jesus , bernardo silva and ilkay gündogan . nearly every player has drastically improved under him , from sterling to fabian delph . nicolás otamendi , once a liability , now looks world-class . what is more , throughout his career , guardiola has made brave decisions . deco , ronaldinho and samuel eto'o were sent packing from barcelona . in the middle of bayern 's winning run , mario mandzukic - the bundesliga 's leading scorer - was dropped and told that he would be replaced by robert lewandowski at the end of the season . ",
        "at city , joe hart was quickly moved on and even sergio agüero occasionally relegated to the bench . to make such changes shows remarkable foresight , to appease such talented squads displays intelligent man management . the democracy and history at barcelona and the politics at bayern meant that guardiola was never free of constraints . the difference at city is the dna of the club has not yet been written . off the pitch , he oversees the three pillars : transfers , training , media . on it , and in the stands , he commands complete obedience . ",
        "city 's fans have known what it is to be bad , that is why this journey is all the more thrilling . there is no looming shadow of johan cruyff or jupp heynckes , no school of science to adhere to , no cries from the terraces to `` attack , attack '' , no bulging trophy cabinet , no directors like karl-heinz rummenigge or uli hoeness eager to give their two cents . almost without fail , guardiola 's is the sole voice emanating from the club , with no disgruntled physios or imperious club slogan like '' '' or '' '' to hold him back . ",
        "city are just finding out who they are under guardiola - manchester city 3.0 - and whether this run ends or continues at crystal palace on sunday , the rest of us watching on are somewhere between spellbound and terrified .   "
