        "opinion : the last thing we need to worry about right now is what this will do to parramatta 's season . footy is secondary . a young woman known only as `` ms v '' has accused australian rugby league player jarryd hayne of raping her in december 2015 in san jose , california , while hayne was playing for the san francisco 49ers in the nfl . the court documents released when her lawyer filed a civil lawsuit in santa clara county churn the stomach ; graphic details of how she met hayne , how the alleged sexual assault occurred , the words he said to her before it happened , the bloody aftermath and physical pain she felt from the incident . ",
        "hayne deserves the presumption of innocence and the chance to clear his name , just as the woman involved deserves respect and the opportunity to prove the graphic claims she has made in her lawsuit . read more : * rugby league star jarryd hayne ` unequivocally ' denies raping woman * hayne accused of rape we must also make it very clear that ms v made a complaint in may , 2016 , to police and no charges were laid because of a lack of evidence . hayne co-operated at that time . as always , though , hayne left parramatta second guessing , the last to know , as the story unfolded throughout the afternoon . ",
        "simply , the club that have thrown him a lifeline next season was blindsided . despite numerous attempts throughout the day , no club officials could reach him . to the best of their knowledge , he flew out of sydney on tuesday night to return to israel , where he visited the holy city of jerusalem earlier this month . his long-term manager , wayne beavis , could not shed light on where his client was when contacted , directing all inquiries to his lawyer , ramy qutami . late in the day , qutami released a statement with hayne `` unequivocally and vehemently '' denying the accusations . ",
        "`` mr hayne and his management are aware of recent media speculation in relation to a civil complaint filed in the united states of america making certain allegations in relation to an event which allegedly occurred in 2015 whilst playing for the san francisco 49ers . mr hayne has not been served with any proceedings or formal complaint relating to the incident . '' media speculation ? a lawsuit was filed in a courthouse in the us , outlining some monstrous claims . hayne 's father , the former souths player manoa thompson , texted this to channel 9 : `` slow news day ? ",
        "2015 ? ?? seriously . '' while all this was unfolding , neither hayne , his management or his lawyers had contacted the club . at the time of writing , they still had not heard from him . when the eels decided earlier this month to sign hayne -- their former star fullback who left them to play nfl , rugby sevens , then for the titans -- they were adamant he would not be a risk . they were getting a representative outside back with a streak of genius for about $ 500,000 , for one season . ",
        "`` i do n't see it as a risk and i 'm not prepared to put the club in jeopardy , '' coach brad arthur told nrl . com . `` who says it 's a risk ? fans say it 's a risk because they are all making comments around perception . '' this has nothing to do with perception . hayne has waved away any criticism of him in the past as nothing more than a media witch-hunt . this one can not be explained away in a lengthy instagram post . the story broke while parramatta chief executive bernie gurr was also in the air , flying back to the us where he was based for many years before taking up the eels job . ",
        "both the eels and the nrl were adamant hayne had not made the police investigation into the alleged incident with ms v known to them when he returned to rugby league -- nor did he have to . when hayne does return to the club early in the new year , he will be allowed to train and then play with the eels as the lawsuit plays out . `` we note that the police in the united states did not proceed with any criminal proceedings but we will review the information available and continue to monitor the civil case , '' an nrl spokesman said . ",
        "parramatta chairman max donnelly said in a statement : `` the club has been made aware of serious allegations regarding jarryd hayne during his time with the san francisco 49ers . we were unaware of these allegations until they were made public today . `` as with any legal matter , it is important that we follow due process and ensure that we review all relevant information available , including giving jarryd the opportunity to respond . '' another question that has been raised is about the timing of his departure from the 49ers . ms v lodged a complaint with police sometime in may . ",
        "in that same month , hayne announced he was taking up once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pursue an olympic dream with the fijian rugby sevens team . indeed , the abruptness of it all was surprising but those close to him explain this is nothing more than a coincidence . we still do n't know if hayne will be compelled to answer this question , or any for that matter . how hayne handles this latest episode in his career is the unknown . he 's dodged bullets in kings cross , won dally m awards , almost won a premiership , played like a reserve grader and coiled coaches into the foetal position for long periods of time . ",
        "but as long as this matter remains unresolved , at every press conference , every training session , every public appearance and at every match , the issue will be there , in the background . footy here is secondary , but it 's something hayne and parramatta will both have to deal with .
