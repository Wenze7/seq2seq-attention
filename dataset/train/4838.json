        "new year resolutions - fails & savesever made resolutions on new year 's eve that feel like a fire has been lit and you 're on the brink of something new and refreshing ? you spend the first month feeling a new drive & passion to achieve . and bam ! that 's how long it lasts -- -- -- a month ! wondering why past resolutions have not worked out ? research has indicated that with most new resolutions , the first couple of weeks work like magic and by february , it seems like people start moving backward -- back to old habits , back to old routines and back to feeling a sense of regret which fuels a sense of failure and diminished self-worth . ",
        "the one that ties to ` social pressures ' how many of us are guilty of choosing resolutions that have been fed by voices that are not our own -- perhaps a parent , a spouse or the latest diet fad or fitness guru . this often causes people to build resolutions that seem ` motivating ' , ` socially trending ' or ` appropriate ' . ever had a friend say , `` this should be the year you quit smoking '' , or your partner say `` couples goals - i think we should focus on losing those extra christmas pounds '' . ",
        "we are quick to believe that these are ` intelligent ' , ` positive ' and ` supportive ' goals . however , we do n't stop to ask ourselves one important question -- do i really want this change to manifest ? if the answer is ` yes ' , ask yourself -- how do i make this goal mine ? ! before you pick your goals , dig deeper -- find the ` why ' . if you sincerely believe that quitting smoking should be your resolution , look beyond the ` social pressures ' , go deeper than ` it 's a bad habit ' . ",
        "you know this already and it 's still a part of your life , so what 's going to cause the mental and behavioral shift ? perhaps the reasons are health , family or a sense of achievement . making goals that are driven by the ` why ' helps you to remember the reason you made the choice for this change and provides you with an invigorating sense of motivation when you feel like you may slip . the one that drives ` hope'many choose resolutions that seem to cause a sense of ` hope ' . hope for a better lifestyle , hope for a better future , hope for a better home , hope for a better relationship . ",
        "that sounds great ! here 's the problem -- hope does n't mean realistic . these resolutions can often be vague , too many or just not what you really want . the question what aligns to your personal values right now and the change you want to make in your life ? the sense of ` hope ' thus , drives you to pick a resolution that seems ` rosy ' , not really allowing you to jot down the resolution that causes you to reflect intrinsically and deeply connect to yourself . if you were to think of your values & choose a resolution that reflected one value that you truly wanted to honor in 2018 -- what would your resolution be now ? ",
        "the one that is ` glamorous ' any of you pick the resolution to get in shape & be fit ? ! i can see those hands begin to go up . so that 's a great idea -- health & wellness is definitely a goal . but , it is a lifestyle goal , a long-term goal . ever wonder why the resolution to ` be fit ' usually starts out great and then the fire just seems to go out ? here is one possible reason -- the goal is not smart ! if this is what you really want , how about we break it down ? ",
        "pick something more specific like running a marathon in december 2018have a measurable , realistic and achievable goal and plan -- i will lose 3 kilos every month or work out 3 times every weekensure you are accountable -- book a spot in the marathon and pay for it in advance or use social media to your advantage and declare your resolution publicly -rrb- . these are just a few quick tips & tricks to successful resolution planning and action . by following these , you are slowly but surely minimizing the chances of you slipping up and into that dark hole of a sense of failure and sinking self-esteem . ",
