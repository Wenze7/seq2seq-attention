        "london - british police said thursday they are investigating a man over a third sexual assault , with the press association news agency reporting that us actor kevin stacey is the suspected assailant . the assault allegedly occurred in central london in 2005 , during spacey 's 11-year tenure at the old vic theatre in the british capital . `` on 13 december we received an allegation that the man sexually assaulted a man in 2005 in westminster , '' a metropolitan police spokeswoman told afp on thursday . the force does not name people before they are charged with a crime , but the press association said the accused was the same man from earlier complaints . ",
        "the other two alleged victims said they were assaulted in 2005 and 2008 in the lambeth area of the city where the old vic is located . they came forward in the wake of the hollywood scandal which erupted last year after numerous claims of sexual assault and harassment were made against mogul harvey weinstein . spacey has since faced a series of abuse allegations , prompting the old vic to launch an investigation into the actor 's tenure at the theatre between 2004 and 2015 . a total of 20 claims of inappropriate behaviour were received , covering a broader period of 1995 to 2013 , and have not been verified .
