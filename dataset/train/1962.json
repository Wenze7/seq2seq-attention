        "i dont understand why my marriage is already broken when weve only been married for 3 yrs . broken because obviously my husband has fallen out of love . he said im not the kind of woman he wants , i lack a shit ton of knowledge , im not independent , im hella dull/boring . i do n't know how to talk . i look dead/tired wout makeup , i look weird with makeup . yet , he wo n't ever leave me , nor wants me to leave him . when i do leave , hed say all these shit that im everything he ever wanted , he can never love anyone anymore . ",
        "when we 1st married , i never wanted to be a sahm , but he insisted on it very badly , i just did as he wished . now that im a sahm , he acts like im lazy and so dependent . id find and apply for a job , hed be upset , and tell me not to get a job until our kids all go to school cause he does n't want to babysit them . he no longer wants sex w me , no longer kisses me , no longer talks to me unless he wants to eat . ",
        "no longer wants to go on dates or spend time w me . yet , always want me to cuddle him at night . he always checks out other women online . is this marriage even worth it anymore ?   "
