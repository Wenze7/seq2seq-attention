        "having won 12 of their past 16 games entering a meeting thursday with the devils , the rangers have pushed themselves back into the thick of things in the metropolitan division . but they 're making sure their brutal start does n't entirely go to waste . `` i think for us , the good part about it is we still feel like we 're clawing back and i think we still have a hunger to make up for the ground we lost at the beginning of the season , '' defenseman kevin shattenkirk said . rebounding from a 3-7-2 start has come with a reminder that they will take wins of all shapes and sizes . ",
        "`` i do n't think we 've had a ton of games where we played perfect for 60 minutes but that 's not what it 's about , '' henrik lundqvist said . `` it 's about finding ways to win hockey games . '' coach alain vigneault said he believes defenseman ryan mcdonagh has been `` turning the corner '' lately , in timely fashion as the rangers enter a heavy part of their schedule . `` lately , he 's looked real powerful on the ice , strong and committed , '' vigneault said . `` yesterday he blocked that shot , took a minute to shake it off and he was right back at it and playing with speed and a lot of determination . ",
        "i think he believes that he 's turning the corner . i see it with my eyes . '' there has been an added emphasis in the nhl on advanced stats such as corsi in recent years , vigneault said he prefers his own set of numbers . the rangers have `` one of the most sophisticated stat packages '' that has evolved through the years , he said . `` i know it 's out there after every game , the shot attempt , corsi , whatever you want to call it , '' vigneault said . `` i 've got other things that i rely on , so i do n't put a lot of stake into that . '' ",
        "during practice wednesday , lundqvist began breaking in the pads he will wear for the winter classic at citi field . after sporting pinstripes when the rangers played at yankee stadium in 2014 , he helped design some new pads that feature the mets logo , minus the actual word `` mets . '' `` we 'll see if i can get them ready , usually need a couple practices , '' lundqvist said . `` obviously we 're there as guests , so it feels good to kind of pay the respect to those guys and appreciate we get this opportunity to play in their home field .
