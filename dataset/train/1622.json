        "if you have n't heard because you were distracted by the minnesota vikings ' miraculous last-second , walk-off touchdown in the divisional round , new orleans saints punter thomas morstead had a gutsy performance by playing through the game with a pair of broken ribs . despite the obvious pain the 31-year-old veteran must have been feeling , he was still able to total four solid punts , averaging a net total of 48.0 yards per kick with a long of 56 yards . even though special teams players do n't normally get a lot of attention and love , the toughness displayed by morstead did not go unnoticed -- especially to the minnesota vikings fans . ",
        "an incredibly classy gesture here and one that we hope to see more of in the future . in a year where there has been some uneasiness among athletes and spectators with disagreements of national anthem displays and differences of political opinions , this is something that restores faith that players and their viewers are on the same page . well done , minnesota , and an excellent example to set .
