        "reese witherspoon and nicole kidman will get around $ 1 million an episode for season two as the tech giant , as one agent says , `` inflates the whole ecosystem of tv actor salaries . `` apple 's arrival in the scripted originals space already is changing the price for top talent on the small screen . the tech giant , estimated to enter the scripted genre with a budget of $ 1 billion in its first year , recently paid what sources say is upward of $ 1.25 million per episode to stars jennifer aniston and reese witherspoon for its 20-episode untitled morning-show drama . ",
        "the eye-popping salaries also include fees for executive producing and points on the show 's backend . and that payday directly impacted the recently announced second season of hbo 's smash hit big little lies , sources say . the david e. kelley drama was originally eyed as a limited series -- with witherspoon and nicole kidman bringing liane moriarty 's book to hbo after the duo optioned it as a feature film . hbo did not have additional season deals with any of the big little lies cast since the series was intended as a one-off , covering all of moriarty 's book . ",
        "following the show 's breakout success -- it won the emmy and golden globe for limited series -- hbo had to ink entirely new deals with the cast for a second season . the option to do more was not in anyone 's contracts since part of the appeal for top stars to do tv is the limited nature of a show -- like big little lies ' seven episodes . witherspoon and kidman , say sources , received between $ 250,000 and $ 350,000 an episode for season one , plus exec producer fees and points off the show 's backend . ",
        "those numbers skyrocketed for season two not only because of the show 's success , but also because of the precedent of the massive payday witherspoon scored from apple . sources say the duo is getting in the $ 1 million-an-episode ballpark for season two , as well as points off the show 's backend and ep fees . co-stars like zoe kravitz also are said to have scored significant bumps , with the actress ' total season-one salary of $ 380,000 jumping to $ 3 million for the sophomore run . shailene woodley , who earned $ 1.7 million for season one , is also said to be getting a sizable pay raise . ",
        "season two of the show is being planned to shoot in the spring but wo n't air until 2019 . `` it 's not a shock to anybody that having a second season of an ongoing series is easier to have with those deals in place , '' hbo programming president casey bloys tells thr . `` every outlet has to make their own decisions about economics that make sense for them . i 'm not going to shake my fist and say , ` darn it , apple ! ' if that 's what made sense for them for that show , god bless . ",
        "`` sums up one agent of the war for top talent in a landscape approaching 500 scripted shows : `` if hbo pays witherspoon her quote that apple is paying , it inflates the whole ecosystem of tv actor salaries . `` as for a potential third season of big little lies -- which now will compete in the drama series category for awards -- sources say none of the cast has deals in place . says bloys : `` everybody involved is so busy that it 's hard to imagine aligning everybody 's schedule again . that we were able to get season two together is a small miracle .
