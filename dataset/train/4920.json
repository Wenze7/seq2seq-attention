        "scott frost celebrates after ucf defeated auburn to finish a 13-0 season . someone check college football 's outrage meter . this ca n't be right . as the all-sec national championship game approaches , and with it the chance to claim all the southern fried bragging rights , the sport 's arrows are pointed toward ... ucf ? whether it 's the new twitter name , the banner to be raised , the parade to be held or the bonuses to be paid to coaches now working for nebraska , ucf has gone all in on its national championship campaign . ",
        "from the moment scott frost went off on the cfp system after ucf completed a perfect 13-0 season , the reaction has been sharp and swift , as many have gone out of their way to discredit ucf 's title claim . plenty of charged words have been used to describe what ucf is doing . here 's another word : tradition . it 's a proud tradition for college programs to claim national championships , even if virtually no one outside of their campuses acknowledges them . the sport 's history books are filled with teams writing their own chapters . ",
        "odds are , those eviscerating ucf root for a team that claims a questionable championship or four . good luck finding a sport with more haziness surrounding its national championship . the knights are merely the latest to crown themselves . is their title any less legitimate than the one claimed by alabama in 1941 ? the tide went 9-2 and finished third in the sec and ranked no . 20 in the final ap poll , which was compiled before the bowl games . even though minnesota is the acknowledged national champion that season , alabama claims a title because something called the houlgate system selected the tide as the top team . ",
        "alabama is the worst violator of the we 're - champs-cause-we-said-so tradition . the tide claim 16 national titles , but the ncaa only acknowledges 14 . both alabama and notre dame claim the 1973 national title , but the upi coaches ' poll awarded its title to the tide before the sugar bowl , where they lost to , yep , notre dame . the next year , the poll began naming a top team after the postseason . imagine that . alabama 's opponent monday night , georgia , claims the national title in 1942 , even though ohio state finished no . ",
        "1 in the final pre-bowl ap poll and earned the title from most of the awarding outlets . georgia has two claimed championships and three unclaimed . claiming titles is n't only a practice of the distant past . nick saban won his first national title when his lsu team beat oklahoma in the bcs championship game after the 2003 season . but do n't tell that to usc . the trojans claim a national title that year after being voted no . 1 in the final ap poll . months after that final bowl , usc became a national champion again , without even playing a down . ",
        "that 's because the school began claiming the 1939 national title after conducting `` significant research , '' then-athletic director mike garrett said at the time . although texas a&m had topped most of the final polls , taken before the bowl season , usc 's rose bowl win over tennessee , which had n't allowed a single point all season , gave the trojans the nod from the dickinson system , a formula conceived by a university of illinois economics professor that awarded the national title from 1926 to 1940 . give ucf credit for this : at least the school did n't waste any time staking its title claim . ",
        "in august 2012 , minnesota announced it had won a seventh national title , only 108 years after the fact . minnesota claimed the 1904 title after an athletic department staffer realized the ncaa acknowledged the gophers as champs that year , even though the university had not . the ncaa also lists michigan and penn as national champions for 1904 , and the debate between them comes down to , you guessed it , scheduling . even though minnesota opened its season against twin cities central high school , played both dakotas and another high school , and did n't leave its home field until nov. . ",
        "12 , the gophers ' schedule strength trumped michigan 's . minnesota beat nebraska , wisconsin , northwestern and iowa down the stretch , while penn did n't allow a single point . if ucf needs help for its potentially anticlimactic banner-raising ceremony , it should call oklahoma state , which unveiled the 1945 national championship sign at boone pickens stadium in july . a panel of coaches from the american football coaches association had awarded the 1945 title to the oklahoma a&m aggies , who became the cowboys of oklahoma state in the 1950s . confused ? you 're not alone . ",
        "go ahead and rage against ucf if you 'd like . call the knights ' championship celebration fake or petty or annoying . do n't pretend like this is unprecedented . so raise the banner , ucf . hold the parade . pay the coaches . in college football , claiming titles is a tradition unlike any other .
