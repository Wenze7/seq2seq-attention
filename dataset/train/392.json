        "over the past several years , berkshire hathaway 's succession plan for when warren buffett can no longer run the company has become of greater interest to investors . we recently got some more concrete information about the succession plan when berkshire managers ajit jain and greg abel both joined the company 's board and were named vice chairmen , a move buffett confirmed was part of the company 's succession plan . so who are these two men who could take warren buffett 's place ? here 's what we know about berkshire 's succession plan , and a brief introduction to the two berkshire managers who could potentially run the $ 600 billion conglomerate in the future . ",
        "berkshire 's succession plan . warren buffett is 87 years old , and his business partner and right-hand man , charlie munger , is 94 . while we all hope buffett and munger live well into their 100s , the reality is that they wo n't be able and/or willing to run the company forever . so over the past few years , berkshire 's succession plan has become much more of a hot topic . the most extensive discussion of buffett 's thoughts on the matter can be found in his 2014 letter to berkshire hathaway shareholders . the letter represented 50 years at the helm for buffett , and it should n't come as a surprise that much of the `` next 50 years '' discussion included berkshire 's post-buffett future . ",
        "the first part of the plan is that buffett 's son , howard , will most likely succeed buffett as a non-executive chairman . this is to create a system of checks and balances , as it is significantly easier to remove an underperforming or otherwise poorly matched ceo if that person is also the chairman . going further into the discussion , buffett discussed some qualities that berkshire 's next ceo should possess . just to name a few of the key attributes : . the ceo must be a `` rational , calm , and decisive individual who has a broad understanding of business and good insights into human behavior . '' ",
        "the ceo must `` know his limits . '' berkshire 's ceo must be `` all in '' for the company , not for himself . the ceo must be motivated by the company 's success , not by money . the ceo must be able to `` fight off the abcs of business decay , which are arrogance , bureaucracy , and complacency . '' the ceo should come from internal candidates . buffett wants the next ceo to already know the company well . the ceo should be relatively young , and `` not likely to retire at 65 . '' ",
        "buffett defines this as someone who should last for more than 10 years at the helm . who is ajit jain ? ajit jain is 66 years old and has been working with berkshire for 31 years . he is berkshire 's newly appointed vice chairman of insurance operations . until recently , jain was president of berkshire hathaway reinsurance group and also led several of berkshire 's insurance companies . buffett has spoken very highly of jain throughout the years , and at one point he even told berkshire 's employees that they could `` swap me for him . '' ",
        "in his most recent annual letter , buffett said : . ajit has created tens of billions of value for berkshire shareholders . if there were ever to be another ajit and you could swap me for him , do n't hesitate . make the trade ! on another occasion , buffett said that `` if munger , i , and ajit are ever in a sinking boat and you can only save one of us , swim to ajit . '' to put it mildly , buffett feels that jain has been , and will continue to be , a tremendous asset to berkshire and its shareholders . ",
        "who is greg abel ? greg abel is 55 years old , has been with berkshire for 25 years , and has been in charge of berkshire hathaway energy . whereas jain was named vice chairman of insurance operations , abel is now vice chairman of non-insurance business operations . in other words , jain is in charge of insurance , and abel is in charge of all of the other subsidiaries . buffett has also been eager to praise abel over the years , calling him a `` dealmaker '' and speaking highly of his management skills . `` i always make time for greg when he calls , because he brings me great ideas and is truly innovative in his thinking and business approach , '' buffett said in 2013 . ",
        "why two potential successors ? buffett has run berkshire hathaway for more than 50 years and wants a successor who will be at the helm of berkshire for a long time . in other words , he does n't necessarily want a ceo who 's going to retire in a few years . while there are probably several factors that berkshire 's board will take into account when the time comes to name a successor , the age and potential longevity of the next ceo will certainly be one of the main deciding factors . there has been widespread speculation that jain would take the reins of berkshire if it were necessary now . ",
        "in his 2014 letter to shareholders , buffett wrote , `` both the board and i believe we now have the right person to succeed me as ceo -- a successor ready to assume the job the day after i die or step down . '' many believe buffett was directly referring to jain in this statement . however , jain is 66 years old . if buffett remains in charge for another five years , jain would be in his 70s , and the board may be more likely to appoint abel , who will just be turning 60 . ",
        "in a nutshell , since nobody knows if buffett will continue to lead berkshire for one more week or 10 more years , this move gives the board some flexibility .   "
