        "in-state rivalries are often overblown , yet interesting enough to watch . that 'll be the case between the astros and rangers in 2018 . let 's be honest : the only reason why the astros and rangers rivalry matters so much to the public today is due to the frequency of the games . the two clubs play at least 19 times each year . division rivals . quite frankly , the lone star series mattered zilch before 2013 . one could even argue 2015 . and for the first time in state history , one will face off against a defending world series champion from their own backyard in 2018 . ",
        "the rangers are in a precarious spot as a franchise . the farm system has n't produced the sheer bulk of quality players one would hope . see jurickson profar as a prime example . injuries have played a major role in the narrative . regression and aging have not been kind . alas , the rangers are making one last push as adrian beltre finishes his impressive hall of fame resume and cole hamels leading a makeshift starting rotation . and it 's a noble cause . it could also be a fruitless one . the rangers , like the angels , have decided to address their roster in numerous ways thus far in the off-season . ",
        "specifically for texas , it was mainly the starting rotation that has been tinkered . mike minor , doug fister , and matt moore have been acquired to go with hamels and martin perez . there also have been rumors that homer bush could make a conversion to the starting rotation from the bullpen . in theory , this should be a more successful group than the one that leaned on tyson ross and andrew cashner for innings in 2017 . unfortunately for the rangers , it was announced on tuesday that perez injured his non-throwing elbow , which occurred at his ranch in venezuela . ",
        "by a bull . and the starting rotation suddenly has a renewed depth problem . per fangraphs depth chart projections , the rangers ' starting rotation was expected to post an 8.1 war as a staff next season before the perez news . that 's good , or bad , enough for 25th overall in projected war for a starting rotation . and this includes all of the supposed upgrades the front office made led by jon daniels . of course , projections are just projections . perez is only projected to be out for four months , which means he could return as early as mid-april . ",
        "i just would n't count on that . the projections will change , for better or worse . the rangers will look for additional depth . if certain pitchers like minor and bush can make a successful transition to the rotation , the outlook may improve . fister had a decent 2017 , so the hope is his improvement carries over into 2018 . there is potential for this staff to be better than the projections . or worse . and the bullpen is still not in good shape as fangraphs currently projects the rangers ' pen to post just 1.7 war in 2018 . ",
        "regarding the offense , the rangers will be leaning on an elder beltre and a young joey gallo to lead the offense . by the way , gallo 's home runs are worth watching . carlos gomez is most likely gone , and texas could be in the market for upgrades in the lineup when available . center field could be a position to watch as we head into 2018 with delino deshields . the offense as a whole is currently projected to in the top-thirteen in all of baseball with a 20.3 bat rating . willie calhoun and nomar mazara will be fun players to watch . ",
        "it 'll be interesting to see how rougned odor and elvis andrus perform in 2018 . overall , the rangers are projected by fangraphs to win 79 games next season . the lack of a formidable pitching staff will likely be texas ' downfall if the projections are anywhere close to accurate . of course , the rangers can surprise us . teams can outperform their projections . see baltimore orioles since the early 2010 's . at the end of the day though , the rangers are most likely chasing the astros just the like the rest of the al west .
