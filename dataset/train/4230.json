        "elon musk is daring boeing to beat him to mars . the tesla and spacex ceo posted a challenge on twitter after boeing ceo dennis muilenburg said on thursday that his aerospace giant would transport the first humans to mars . `` eventually we 're going to go mars and i firmly believe the first person that sets foot on mars will get there on a boeing rocket , '' muilenburg told cnbc 's jim cramer this morning . in response to a tweet from the `` fortune tech '' twitter account linking to fortune 's news article about muilenburg 's bold bet , musk simply wrote , `` do it . '' ",
        "here 's musk 's tweet : do it -- elon musk december 7 , 2017 get data sheet , fortune 's technology newsletter . muilenburg has made the same proclamation in the past , including last year at a tech conference . however , musk 's own very public ambitions to not only reach mars , but to colonize the red planet , seem to have linked the celebrity billionaire 's name with the idea of mars exploration in the public imagination . in october , musk outlined the spacex strategy for reaching mars and even his goal of settling large groups of people on the planet as part of his vision of making humans into a `` multiplanetary species . '' ",
        "musk believes that spacex could begin landing spaceships on mars as soon as 2022 , while muilenburg said on thursday 's that boeing 's own next generation rockets would be tested starting in 2019 . musk is an active twitter user who is known to jump into the twitter conversations among tesla customers and critics . last year , the billionaire even engaged in a brief twitter spat with fortune over its reporting in the wake of a tesla driver 's fatal crash and musk 's post-crash sale of tesla shares in a public offering .
