        "by richard loughparis - french president emmanuel macron is urging wealthy countries and global companies to commit more funds to combating global warming and help poorer nations deal with the impact of climate change . the french leader is hosting the `` one planet '' summit two years after nearly 200 governments agreed in paris to end their heavy reliance on fossil fuels and limit further global warming . macron wants to show that progress toward those hard-fought goals is being made after president donald trump said in june that he was taking the united states out of the pact . ",
        "trump 's decision to withdraw was a `` deep wake-up call for the private sector '' to take action , he said . `` if we decide not to move and not change our way to produce , to invest , to behave , we will be responsible for billions of victims , '' macron told u. s. television channel cbs news in an interview broadcast on monday night . though macron has said that concrete projects with real financing behind them are lacking , no internationally binding commitments will be announced at the summit . in focus is how public and private financial institutions can mobilize more money and how investors can pressure corporate giants to shift toward more ecologically friendly strategies . ",
        "more than 200 institutional investors with $ 26 trillion in assets under management said on tuesday they would step up pressure on the world 's biggest corporate greenhouse gas emitters to combat climate change . that , they said , would be more effective than threatening to pull the plug on their investments in companies , which include coal india , gazprom , exxon mobil and china petroleum & chemical corp . separately , european commission vice president valdis dombrovskis said the executive was `` looking positively '' at plans to reduce capital requirements for environmentally-friendly investments by banks in a bid to boost the green economy . ",
        "the move could be part of a broader set of measures the eu plans to present in march to meet the target of cutting carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2030 , for which it estimates around 180 billion euros in additional low-carbon investments are needed per year . funding gapclimate change is causing more frequent and severe flooding , droughts , storms and heatwaves as average global temperatures rise to new records , sea ice melts in the arctic and sea levels rise . developing nations say the rich are lagging with a commitment dating back to 2009 to provide $ 100 billion a year by 2020 - from public and private sources alike - to help them switch from fossil fuels to greener energy sources and adapt to the effects of climate change . ",
        "`` the missing piece of the jigsaw is the funding to help the world 's poorer countries access clean energy so they do n't follow the fossil fuel-powered path of the rich world , '' said mohamed adow , charity christian aid 's lead on climate change . on tuesday , the european commission unveiled 9 billion euros worth of investments targeting sustainable cities , sustainable energy and sustainable agriculture for africa and eu neighborhood countries . some 50 world leaders and ministers are due in paris , including mexican president enrique pena nieto and leaders of states at the sharp end of climate change such as chad , bolivia and haiti . ",
        "the united states will send only an official delegation from the paris embassy , but screen superstars leonardo di caprio and arnold schwarzenegger and california governor jerry brown , leader of the world 's sixth largest economy , are championing more action . in a pointed piece of timing , macron used the eve of the summit to award 18 grants to foreign climate scientists , most of whom are currently u. s.-based , to come and work in france .
