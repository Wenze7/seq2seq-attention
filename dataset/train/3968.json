        "poland 's president andrzej duda has signed a controversial judicial reform package into law , hours after the european commission triggered the so-called `` nuclear option , '' opening an unprecedented sanctions procedure . if backed by eu leaders , the article 7 mechanism could see warsaw being punished with financial sanctions or the loss of voting rights . the measure , which was activated for the first time since the foundation of the bloc , is aimed to counter poland 's alleged violations of democratic values with the reforms in question . duda put his signature to the bills , which he initially partly drafted , ap reported citing the president 's spokesman , krzysztof lapinski . ",
        "announcing his decision , the polish president defended the changes , saying it would see the country 's justice system become more democratic . having referred to us legal practice , in which judges to america 's supreme court are nominated by the president and approved by senate , duda said it was unfair to interfere with changes aimed at making judges more accountable to politicians in poland . since its initial drafts , the bills that seek to allow the government more control over the courts had been much improved , he claimed . article 7 was not directly mentioned in the speech . ",
        "to declare `` a clear risk of serious breach of the rule of law '' that would involve sanctions against one of its member states , including the loss of voting rights in the eu council , brussels must get unanimous approval from the rest of the members . however , hungary has already made clear it would oppose any such move .
