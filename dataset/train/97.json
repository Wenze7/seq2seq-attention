        "that movie exists . it won an oscar . back in 2016 , hernandez suggested the character may have survived when he told variety latino , `` you know what , let 's just say he 's a metahuman . what are you going to do ? there are possibilities there . i 'm not saying anything but , there are some possibilities . i have n't heard anything yet from anyone but even if i had , do you think i could tell you ? '' now it appears diablo survived . joel kinnaman posted a photo of him , hernandez , and jai courtney getting ready for something with their trainer , brendan . ",
        "kinnaman says , `` brendan whipping us back into shape . jay puked . '' these guys are n't slated to work together on anything except possibly suicide squad 2 . it 's in pre-production , with a planned production start of next october with director gavin o'connor . it looks like diablo is re-joining the family after all , so you know what that means : * starts chanting * fa-mi-ly ! fa-mi-ly ! * sprays faygo everywhere * .
