        "one week ago , in its latest assessment of the current state of tax reform in the aftermath of the senate 's passage of the tax bill , goldman analysts calculated that while growth impact from tax reform had increased fractionally to around 0.3 % in 2018 and 2019 `` reflecting the slightly larger amount of tax cuts in the senate plan following revisions , and our expectations regarding the eventual compromise '' , it expected a very modest - if any - boost to us economic growth from tax reform . today , in a report prepared by the us treasury - which as reminder is run by former goldmanite steven mnuchin - and which was meant to bolster the case for the economic growth to be unleashed by the trump tax cuts , and distract from the spike in deficit funding , the treasury 's office of tax policy calculated that - somehow - the senate 's version of tax cuts will result in 2.9 % real gdp growth rate over 10 years . ",
        "this 2.9 % gdp growth scenario compares to a baseline of previous treasury projections of 2.2 % gdp growth . treasury `` expects approximately half of this 0.7 % increase in growth to come from changes to corporate taxation , while the other half is expected to come from changes to pass-through taxation and individual tax reform , as well as from a combination of regulatory reform , infrastructure development , and welfare reform as proposed in the administration 's fiscal year 2018 budget . `` this treasury also claims that this 0.7 % increase in growth results in an increase in tax revenues during the 10 - year period of approximately $ 1.8 trillion . ",
        "and this is where the magic of fairy-tale forecasts comes in because adding this $ 1.8 trillion of incremental revenue to the static current law score of - $ 1.5 trillion results in total receipts over the 10-year window increasing by $ 300 billion . in other words , the trump tax cuts will not only not add to the deficit but will reduce debt by $ 300 billion , according to the treasury . conveniently , the treasury caveats that `` these increased receipts are primarily collected in the last five years , as full expensing creates growth in early years but results in a deferral of collection of taxes . ",
        "`` it is unclear what is more ridiculous : that the propose gift to corporations will not only pay for itself but lead to a perpetual engine of trickle-down economic growth , one which has been refuted in every single instance in history , or that the treasury expects the us economy to continue for another decade without a recession , which in 2027 result in an 18 year period of continuous growth since the last official recession ended in 2009 , the longest period without a recession in history . of course , when the next recession hits no later than 2019 when the yield curve will be steeply negative and crushing the financial sector , government tax revenues will plunge leading to a blowout in government borrowing , forcing the fed to launch qe4 as its monetization of the surging deficit will be critical in a world in which every other central bank will be dealing with its own issues at home . ",
        "as parting humor , the otp notes the following : we acknowledge that some economists predict different growth rates . otp projects that at approximately 0.35 % of incremental annual gdp growth , treasury tax receipts would generate approximately $ 1 trillion of incremental revenue . neither jct nor treasury has released a score showing increased tax receipts from the house plan , though we would not expect the results to be materially different . we will be happy to revert to this post some time in 2027 when total us government debt is between $ 35 and $ 45 trillion , and when as the cbo correctly predicted , total us debt/gdp will be in its exponential phase .
