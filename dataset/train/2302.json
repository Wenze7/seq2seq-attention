        "in recent years , `` mindfulness '' has become a buzzword well beyond the confines of the yoga retreats . schools , corporations and even prisons have embraced the concept in an effort to promote peace and community-building . we spoke to dr. elizabeth ochoa , chief psychologist at mount sinai beth israel . what is `` mindfulness '' ? mindfulness is a mental activity that promotes self-awareness and the ability to focus on mind and body experiences in the moment . it has a soothing , calming effect for many people . the process is usually referred to as a `` practice '' ; to be `` mindful '' takes practice on a consistent basis . ",
        "the process of learning to observe yourself and your experiences in a particular moment and to pay attention to feelings and thoughts as they float in and out of awareness without judgment is initially very challenging . it is through the consistent practice of mindfulness skills that a person achieves a greater sense of well-being and serenity . why the surge in popularity ? it is a safe and cost-effective technique that anyone can use . mindfulness is often included by mental health clinicians as a treatment technique in psychotherapy to help people manage stress and other types of emotional distress . ",
        "in therapy , learning to `` sit '' with difficult feelings rather than to react impulsively to them might be a desired goal of practicing mindfulness . benefits include decreased emotional distress , improved interpersonal effectiveness and relationships , and enhanced productivity . how can mindfulness help us stick to resolutions or goals ? mindfulness teaches us discipline and consistency and self-awareness , which can lead to effective problem solving . mindfulness encourages forgiving . if , for example , you are disappointed in yourself that you did n't stick to a resolution , you can reset the goal and start again , without attaching negative judgments about yourself . ",
        "decreasing perfectionistic thoughts and feelings pave the way for achieving goals successfully . how is mindfulness practiced ? beginning to use mindfulness techniques , including rhythmic and slowed breathing , the focusing of attention on the breath , and meditation does not require fancy equipment . all you need is yourself , a comfortable spot to sit in , usually with feet on the floor , arms gently resting , closed eyes and a dedication to set aside at least five to 10 minutes of time each day initially . many people practice mindfulness when they first wake up , at lunchtime or in the evening before bed . ",
        "it can also be used during times of stress as a way to relieve tension . guided mindfulness meditation techniques are helpful to a beginner because you hear a soothing voice guiding you to maintain attention on your breath , as distracting thoughts and feelings wander in and out of awareness . there are a variety of great online apps that can help you get started with a practice of your own at your own pace . in which situations can it be applied ? any and all . do i need to learn to meditate to be mindful ? ",
        "mindfulness meditation is a key strategy for `` being mindful , '' but i believe that being mindful comes from increased self-awareness and acceptance , no matter the source .   "
