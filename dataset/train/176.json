        "academy award winners | 856my author journey , saturday , december 16 , 2017 # 856 woke up 4:45 am . recently i watched this series of three documentaries in which five present-day directors discuss five wartime directors who voluntarily joined ww2 in order to film it : william wyler , frank capra , george stevens , john ford and john huston . it 's called five came back and i liked it a lot . i decided that i 'll watch the entire series of seven propaganda films commissioned by the united states government during world war ii to justify to u. s. soldiers their country 's involvement in the war . ",
        "i 've already watched four of them . now i 'm on why we fight : the battle of russia . the films were directed by academy award-winning director frank capra and narrated by academy award-winning actor walter huston along with famed radio actors elliot lewis , harry von zell , screen star lloyd nolan and others . the music for the series was performed by the army air force orchestra . they 're available on us national archives youtube channel and some of them on netflix -rrb- . animation for the series was produced by disney studios . i think those people did a great job . ",
        "apart from being propaganda films they show wwii start to end in a nutshell -lrb- good for school kids who will learn about wwii for the very first time in schools and for their parents who would like to refresh their memory / maybe even learn something new -- i learned a lot , which means that either a / i was n't paying attention in school , or b / in the era where there was no google they wanted us to learn too many details by heart , and it made the whole thing excruciating and boring , and when something is boring to you you wo n't remember much of it , or c / our history teachers sucked .",
        "or it 's just me . or all of it combined . anyway , now this topic is very interesting to me . did i mention that my mother was a history teacher ? but she was never my history teacher in school . i wonder how come my knowledge of history is so ... limited . had this thought today . when you collect some kind of a prize it 's a common practice that you mention your parents ' contribution . academy award winners do it , sport figures do it , celebrities do it , etc. . ",
        "`` thank you mom , dad . were it not for you i would n't be standing here today . '' but what about those who never had the chance to address the public on such occasion , because they did n't win any award , or because they 're not famous , or because they did n't accomplish anything special in their lives , or because they failed miserably in life ? if they had their chance , would they tell us that the reason they failed completely , or did n't achieve much in their lives were their parents ? ",
        "would they say `` mom , dad , i know great things would be possible in my life if i had n't had you as my parents '' ? i know it 's nice when those accomplished figures say such things to / about their parents , but does it make any sense ? `` were it not for you mom and dad i would n't be standing here today . '' apart from it sounding nice , is that all ? are their parents the reason they 're standing before all those people ? and i guess they do n't mean merely that their parents had sex to make them -- it would be a joke , would n't it ? ",
        "does it really come down to having great parents ? or rather the conviction that they 're great and that none of it would be possible without them is a yet another cliché ? putting parents on a pedestal only happens during such events and in interviews . we almost always hear it from people who are on the front covers of magazines . does it mean their parents were really perfect in every aspect ? did n't they make a single mistake ? and if they did some mistakes , does it mean their accomplished children should mention that too ? ",
        "does it mean that those who have shitty parents are doomed ? does it mean they can let themselves off the hook by saying `` if only my parents were perfect like the parents of those accomplished people i would have done / accomplished this or that '' ? does it mean that hearing those cliché statements about parents , uttered by all those prominent figures , make the rest of people believe that since they did n't get the best parents they have no prayer ? it 'd be a convenient story , so i think that it 's what most of those unaccomplished people might feel . ",
        "anything that lets us off the hook is good for us . of course most people would prefer to blame it on the fact that their parents were deficient in one way or another , that it 's someone else 's fault , not theirs . what could be more convenient ? what else could make you feel better than the thought that someone else screwed up your life ? same thing when those prominent figures thank their fantastic spouses . it 's nice , but does it mean none of it would be possible without them ? by no means i intend to belittle the help and support of those people , but i think those nice and cliché statements about them are not true . ",
        "their help and support were important , no doubt , but in all honesty those who say those clichés should admit that they have no proof that those statements tell the truth , that otherwise those great accomplishments would not be possible . again , having sex to make this person does n't count as such extraordinary contribution in my opinion , as this is something all parents did to have offspring . and what about adoptees who do n't even know their biological parents ? whom they would need to thank ? and by saying those clichés they only contribute to the creation of a false conviction in people that the factor which determines whether or not you will accomplish great things in your life are a / your parents , and b / your spouse . ",
        "and this makes for a perfect excuse for hundreds of millions of people in this world . is it because their parents are / were perfect that those remarkable people accomplish so much in their lives , or rather because they made different decisions about their lives than those who think of themselves as failures and sit and bitch about most things ? recent listening to audio . recent movies . recent youtube videos . couple videos from gary vaynerchuk 's playlist dailyveegreat photographer i learned from recently : robert caparecent progress on my fourth book : 15 min yesterday .
