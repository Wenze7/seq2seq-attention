",
        "of the topics discussed , allen was brought up due to a series of tweets by dylan farrow during last weekend 's golden globes in which she said she hoped allen 's time would have been up by now . farrow has accused allen of molesting her . allen has denied the accusations . `` what would you want to say to her ? '' winfrey asked the women . `` i hope so , '' said rhimes . `` you know , i 'll be honest . i do n't know about anybody else , but i hope so . ",
        "`` kennedy added , `` i 'd like to believe that time 's up for silence . we can start there . `` winfrey asked the powerful hollywood women , `` how do we as a society have a mature , nuanced conversation about how men and women should be relating to each other ? because there 's so many men and women now who are uncomfortable in their workplaces because of all that 's been uncovered and are n't just really sure how to be . what do we say to them ? '' `` we 're humans . ",
        "we 're all humans , '' portman said . `` and i think it 's treating people as fellow humans and -- and it 's not because you have a daughter that you respect a woman , it 's not because you have a wife or a sister , it 's because we 're human beings , whether we 're related to a man or not . we deserve the same respect . '' during the golden globes , while presenting for best director , portman called out the hollywood foreign press association for selecting `` all male '' nominees in that category . "
