",
        "`` the books that they get published in are just a huge motivator for them , and they get to have like a lavish book release party where their families and all the tutors are listening to them read their original work . and that 's just something that people love working towards , especially students , '' says volunteer leeann duggan . the power of words -- reading and writing them -- is what 's super here . find more from the `` sweet spot '' here .
