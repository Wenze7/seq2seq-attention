        "berkshire hathaway inc ceo warren buffett has few peers as an investor . his half-century career is full of lessons that many of us can use to improve our own investing results . the best lesson for most of us is undoubtedly buffett 's maxim , to paraphrase , `` buy great businesses at reasonable prices , and hold for as long as possible . '' this has worked incredibly well for berkshire investors , who have enjoyed more than 4,000 % returns over the past 30 years as buffett has built one of the strongest , most profitable companies in the world . ",
        "if you 're looking for the next great `` buffett-style '' stocks for your own portfolio , our contributing investors have identified starbucks corporation , brookfield renewable partners lp , and sherwin-williams co as the kinds of companies that fit the warren buffett mold . they 're reasonably priced , high-quality companies with strong competitive positions -- which buffett says can lead to wonderful returns for long-term investors . could this be the next coca-cola ? jason hall : when warren buffett bought a billion-dollar stake in coca-cola for berkshire hathaway in the late 1980s , he was able to snap up the shares at a bargain price , but invested with the expectations that coke , with its powerful brand appeal and decades of success , would continue to be a strong , highly profitable business for many years to come . ",
        "to say it 's worked out well would be a huge understatement . the $ 1.3 billion berkshire spent on its stake in coke is worth $ 18 billion at recent prices , and it pays berkshire over $ 500 million every year in dividends . it may not seem like it , but starbucks is n't that far removed from where coke was when buffett added it to the berkshire portfolio . coca-cola was a hugely popular brand with global appeal and decades of success already behind it 30 years ago , but early in its international expansion . ",
        "today , starbucks is in a similar situation , with its americas business generating more than four times as much operating income than its china/asia pacific segment . but its asian business is growing much faster , as chinese and southeast asian economic growth drive a massive expansion in the region 's middle class . this is creating an enormous number of new starbucks consumers , just as past global economic expansion was a big part of adding millions of new coke drinkers around the world during the 1980s and 1990s . it may not be trading at the discount coke was when buffett invested in that company , but at around 30 times earnings , starbucks shares are cheaper than they have been over much of the past several years . ",
        "also like coke , starbucks pays a solid dividend , increasing the payout regularly since inception , and management has made repurchasing shares -- and driving up per-share value -- a priority with excess cash flows . between the growth prospects , likelihood of dividend growth , and plans to continue repurchasing shares , fans of buffett-style investing should give starbucks a close look . covering all the bases . rich duprey : warren buffett owns nearly 50 stocks , and he 's dumped over $ 1 billion in almost half of them . but four companies actually account for more than half of his portfolio 's holdings : kraft heinz , wells fargo , apple , and coca-cola . ",
        "three of those are dominant consumer-oriented businesses and arguably also meet buffett 's general guideline of being simple businesses to understand . it 's why i think fans of the oracle would like paint and coverings leader sherwin-williams . first , rival benjamin moore is a subsidiary of berkshire hathaway ; it 's clear buffett likes paint . and that could be because paint is something that works well in bull markets , when there 's a lot of construction going on , and in bear markets , where consumers can slap on a coat as a cheap , quick , and easy way to spruce up a home . ",
        "and that 's been borne out by sherwin-williams ' performance . since 2000 , the paint specialist has returned some 1,850 % compared to an 80 % return by the s&p 500 . although sherwin-williams has traditionally been geared more toward the professional painter than the homeowner , with its network of 4,200 independent stores -- just like benjamin moore -- its purchase of valspar helps balance that out . and as an added bonus , sherwin-williams also qualifies as a dividend aristocrat because it has raised its payout to shareholders every year since 1979 , though the $ 3.40 dividend does yield only a very modest 0.8 % . ",
        "in all , sherwin-williams looks like a stock that warren buffett fans could get behind . an energy stock buffett should love . travis hoium : we know that warren buffett loves companies that generate consistent cash flows and trade at a reasonable value . brookfield energy partners fits that profile because it owns clean electricity-generating assets around the world and pays a strong dividend , which currently yields 5.7 % per share . 85 % of brookfield renewable partners ' assets are hydroelectric power plants , which generate predictable cash flows and drive continued growth . management aims to pay out most of its cash flow in the form of dividends , but it also wants to keep enough cash to grow distributions 5 % to 9 % organically . ",
        "you can see below that the company generates more operating cash flow than it pays in dividends , which is what allows for long-term growth . brookfield renewable partners also is n't reliant on a low dividend yield to grow , something that hinders most yieldcos , and it 's not tied to one form of energy . the company also owns wind assets in brazil and north america and could be a buyer of solar plants in the future as well . given warren buffett 's affinity for companies with strong recurring cash flows and reliable dividends , this is a dividend stock that 's great for buffett fans .
