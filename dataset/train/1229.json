        "there are far fewer fitness-friendly bluetooth headphones on the market than there are in-ear options . thankfully , plantronics ' backbeat fit 500 pair is a winner . for $ 99.99 , audio performance is quite good , with thunderous bass balanced out by a sculpted high frequency response . and the moisture-resistant design manages to feel both comfortable and secure at the same time . that makes the backbeat fit 500 a solid overall value , and our editors ' choice for exercise-focused bluetooth headphones . designavailable in black or black-and-teal models , the supra-aural backbeat fit 500 headphones have a generously cushioned memory foam headband and earpads for a comfortable fit over long listening periods . ",
        "the headband has an angular , geometric contour that is striking , and the fit can be adjusted from ear to ear precisely using detents on each side . despite the on-ear design , the fit is quite secure on the head and should stay in place during most exercise routines . the outer panels of the earcups are a moisture-resistant matte rubber , which unfortunately acts like a magnet for dust . the good news is they can be easily cleaned , thanks to the water-resistant p2i nano-coating . inside each earcup , 40 mm drivers deliver the audio . ",
        "on the outer panel of the right earcup , there 's a switch for power/bluetooth pairing , and a button for answering or ending phone calls . a status led is located in between these two controls . on the right earcup 's outer panel , there are controls for play/pause , dedicated track navigation buttons , and a separate volume switch on the outer panel . why so many manufacturers fail to create such a simple setup that does n't combine multiple functions onto one button is a bit of a mystery -- plantronics succeeds in giving you all the controls you need in a graceful , easy-to-use design . ",
        "the headphones ships with a 3.5 mm audio cable for wired , passive listening . the cable lacks an inline remote control or mic , so using it means answering calls and controlling playback and volume manually , as connecting the cable automatically powers down the headphones . in addition to the cable , the headphones ship with a short micro usb charging cord and a drawstring carrying pouch . the mic offers above-average intelligibility . using the voice memos app on an iphone 6s , we could understand every word we recorded clearly without too much in the way of added audio artifacts -- it 's a crisp , clear microphone . ",
        "plantronics estimates battery life to be roughly 18 hours , but your results will vary with your volume levels and your mix of wired and wireless playback . performanceon tracks with intense sub-bass content , like the knife 's `` silent shout , '' the headphones deliver powerful bass depth that will appeal to those who are motivated by deep lows during their workouts . at top , unwise listening levels , the bass does n't distort , and at more reasonable listening levels , the lows are still quite full , and reasonably balanced with the higher frequencies . ",
        "bill callahan 's `` drover , '' a track with far less deep bass in the mix , tells us a little more about the backbeat fit 500 's overall sound signature . the drums on this track sound almost thunderous here -- these same drums can sound thin on less bass-boosted headphones . so , the headphones definitely boost the lows beyond levels that will appeal to purists , but there is a strong high-mid and high frequency presence as well . in other words , this is an exceptionally sculpted sound signature that manages to balance out the boosting by doing it on both ends of the frequency range . ",
        "on jay-z and kanye west 's `` no church in the wild , '' the kick drum loop gets an ideal amount of high-mid presence , allowing its attack to retain its punchy edge and cut through the layers of the mix . the sub-bass synth hits that punctuate the beat are delivered with serious depth -- bass lovers will be thrilled . and yet , the booming lows do n't overwhelm the mix -- the vocals on this track are delivered with solid high frequency clarity and little added sibilance . orchestral tracks , like the opening scene in john adams ' the gospel according to the other mary , have more bass boosting than will appeal to most classical music fans , but it 's not egregious -- the lower instrumentation just takes a notable step forward in the mix . ",
        "the higher register brass , strings , and vocals still retain their brightness through the backbeat fit 500 , but the lower register instrumentation plays more of a noticeable role and less of a supporting one . conclusionsif you 're looking for accurate , audiophile-grade sonic performance , look elsewhere . however , if you like boosted bass during your workouts and want an on-ear fit that will stay in place without issue , look no further than the plantronics backbeat fit 500 . in terms of competition , we also like the jabra move wireless and urbanears active hellas , but neither pair is quite as gym-friendly . ",
        "if you want to go the in-ear route , the jaybird x3 and jbl reflect mini bt are both solid options for roughly the same price . as far as on-ear headphones go , though , the backbeat fit 500 earn our editors ' choice . plantronics backbeat fit 500excellentatbottom line : if you like an on-ear fit and big bass response for your workouts , the wireless plantronics backbeat fit 500 headphones get just about everything right .
