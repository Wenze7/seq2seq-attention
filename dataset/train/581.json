        "arsenal are accidentally lending tottenham a handthe last thing any arsenal fan wants to hear is that the gunners are doing tottenham a favour in the january transfer window . unfortunately , the club 's decision to ship alexis sanchez to manchester united is helping spurs in their chase for psg star lucas moura . it 's pretty easy to connect the dots here . jose mourinho clearly wants to add an exciting wide man to his squad during the current transfer window . originally , the special one expressed strong interest in bringing lucas in from france . then , the portuguese manager switched to another attacking target . ",
        "that target , of course , is arsenal star alexis sanchez . the internet rumour mill is lit ablaze with reports that the exciting chilean will move to old trafford any day . his move to united effectively takes mourinho and company out of the running for lucas . in their absence , speculation has ramped up that tottenham will swoop in . transfer odds have been slashed on the possibility of lucas signing with spurs in recent days . like mourinho , mauricio pochettino would also like to add a real speedster to round out his attack . the brazilian international certainly fits the bill .
