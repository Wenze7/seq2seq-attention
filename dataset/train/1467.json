        "shutterstocka california man who ate sushi every day is changing his raw fish diet after a 5-foot-long tapeworm `` wiggled '' out of his body . the sushi-lover went to the hospital went to a fresno hospital after he extracted a 5 ' 6 â€³ - long tapeworm from his body . the man blames salmon sushi for this enormous parasite growing inside of him . dr. kenny banh documented the stomach-churning incident on his medical podcast called `` this wo n't hurt a bit . '' `` apparently it was still wriggling when he put it in the bag but it had died in transit , '' banh said . ",
        "the anonymous patient showed the doctor the giant parasite , which was over 5-feet-long and was wrapped around a toilet roll . are you ready for how the lengthy parasite was removed from the patient 's body ? i do n't think you 're ready . okay , here we go . banh said a young man walked into the hospital complaining of abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhea in august . one unfortunate session in the bathroom ended with the patient thinking a piece of his intestine was hanging out . it was n't his intestine thankfully . the patient asked to be tested for worms . ",
        "you never want to have the same medical maladies as a cocker spaniel . `` oh , my goodness my guts are coming out of me , '' banh recalled the man saying and then he allegedly started pulling the worm out . and he pulled . and he pulled . and he pulled . eventually the entire massive tapeworm was removed from his body . the patient was given a de-worming pill which , is actually no different from the ones given to your doggo . `` he said he 'd felt like something was moving around in his guts and he thought it was just gas , '' banh said of the patient . ",
        "`` he 'd been in discomfort for a few months . '' the poor , poor man said he ate sushi , especially salmon sashimi , almost every day . tapeworm larva can survive in raw salmon and then set up shop in a human 's digestive tract . the man with the gigantic tapeworm said that he would continue eating sushi , but he would stop eating salmon sushi .
