        "stephen colbert started off the new year by discussing donald trump 's recent twitter-tirade , commenting on the president 's first statements of 2018 . during the pre-recorded programme -- which was taped before trump threatened north korea with `` bigger and more powerful '' nuclear weapons or posted about the ` most dishonest media awards ' -- the late show host picked apart trump 's nine early-morning messages . the first tweet colbert brought up concerned hillary clinton aide huma abedin , the president calling on the justice department to act . `` she put classified passwords into the hands of foreign agents , '' trump wrote . ",
        "`` remember sailors pictures on submarine ? jail ! deep state justice dept must finally act ? also on comey & others . '' crooked hillary clinton 's top aid , huma abedin , has been accused of disregarding basic security protocols . she put classified passwords into the hands of foreign agents . remember sailors pictures on submarine ? jail ! deep state justice dept must finally act ? also on comey & others -- donald j. trump january 2 , 2018 . colbert joked : `` ` remember sailors pictures on submarine ? ' i think grandpa 's reminiscing again . '' ",
        "the host then reminded viewers the message was from the president of the united states who was `` tweeting and describing the justice department as a ` deep state ' conspiracy '' . `` that is a serious charge , the kind of thing you can never make lightly and , of course , you can never take back , '' colbert said , pausing for a moment before adding : `` i 'm kidding . '' white house press secretary sara huckabee sanders has since tried to insist trump does not see the justice department as ` deep state ' `` despite tweeting otherwise '' . ",
        "`` who got to her ? '' colbert questioned , followed by dramatic music . `` could it be the deep state ? '' see the segment below . colbert also mocked trump 's tweets about no-one dying on commercial flights during 2017 , saying : `` trump took credit for no one dying in a plane crash this year ! that explains his new campaign slogan , ` trump 2020 : you got to tulsa , did n't ya ? '' actor bryan cranston has also mocked the president over the message in a tweet that has since gone viral . "
