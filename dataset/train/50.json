",
        "input costs rose at the fastest rate in three months , the report said . `` however , as has been increasingly the case in recent months , the good news comes with a health warning about the sustainability of the upturn , '' said chris williamson , chief economist at survey compiler ihs markit . `` digging into the details behind the resilient strength signaled by the headline numbers , the survey data reveal an economy that is beset with uncertainty about the outlook , which is in turn dampening business spending and investment , '' he added . ",
        "the report came after similar surveys earlier in the week showed that growth in the uk manufacturing sector cooled last month from four-year highs struck in november , but remained solid . meanwhile , growth in the construction sector slowed last month for the first time since september . taking the three sector surveys together , britain 's economy probably expanded at a quarterly rate of around 0.4 % to 0.5 % in the fourth quarter of 2017 , survey compiler ihs markit said .
