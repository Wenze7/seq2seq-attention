        "many of us have had the fortune of travelling and even living in various parts of the world and yet , for those of us who have visited or lived in italy , it will always hold a special place in our hearts . what is it about italy that has us obsessing over living like a local ? i lived in italy for many years as a student , intern , professional and an adventurer . most weekends , i would travel to various cities and get to know the locals . i travelled all over italy while living there and one important lesson stood out : italians really know how to live . ",
        "it 's not just that the pace can be more relaxing or that you are surrounded by some of the most beautiful architecture in the world , it 's that italians really enjoy every moment that many of us take for granted . take a simple cup coffee -- there are so many ways to enjoy it . sit outside at a street caf√© , enjoy it at the bar , catch up with friends or even your local barista -- any way you drink it , it 's social time for you to enjoy not only your coffee but also your friends , the weather , a moment to relax and people watch . ",
        "the same is true for a glass of wine or prosecco during an aperitivo . it 's not just about the delicious wine or prosecco . the aperitivo is time for socializing and catching up with friends ; it 's about taking a moment and creating a transition between the work day and your dinner and evening . it 's much more than just a drink -- it 's a ritual . furthermore , italy is all about quality not quantity . if you people watch , you will see everyone dressed nicely or at least trying to . one of the things you will notice is the quality of everyone 's clothing and shoes . ",
        "even if finances do n't permit two closets full of clothes , the italian will always prefer quality or quantity . beautifully tailored jackets , a silk scarf , a nicely tailor skirt or pair of pants are essentials . also notice the leather goods -- from the shoes to the belts , leather in italy is beautiful ! mostly , italians will always have a nice pair of shoes , belt , watch or a purse . italians take pride in their look -- not too overdone but definitely full of good taste . in italy , it 's the intangibles that really matter . ",
        "a strong cup of coffee spent catching up with friends , people watching , feeling good about yourself , feeling connected to others , spending time outdoors , enjoying a delicious aperitivo to transition from day to evening , ending your evening with dinner and wine with a group of friends or family , all are part of the italian way of life and each , make us so obsessed with living like a local and la dolce vita !
