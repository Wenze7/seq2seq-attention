        "i 'm 21 and the youngest person at my workplace easily , i 've always had a very good relationship with our hr person , we talk a lot and we ' get along really well , despite her being probs a little more than twice my age . problem is , oh this is so embarrassing , i went to her office to to talk for a second and she was wearing such a short skirt , she has such beautiful and tan legs , i could n't help myself i could n't take my eyes off of them , she 's just so beautiful . ",
        "i was trying to play it off and talk to her but i did n't even realize what i was doing and got pretty hard , she just kept grinning at me , i did n't realize it at the time but i 'm sure she noticed how excited i got , she gave me a very sly smile when i went to walk out and would n't stop . she has n't mentioned it , do i apologize or just pretend like it never happened ? i really do feel kinda like a pig , and it sucks because i really do value being friends with her , nothing like that has ever happened to me before , how would you feel if you were her ?
