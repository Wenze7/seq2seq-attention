        "it has been a summer of just wins and more wins for new zealand . after winning the first t20i against pakistan , they have 13 victories on the trot across formats in this home season . and that despite some chopping and changing , forced or otherwise . that they go into the second t20i as favourites would be an understatement . even more so given their opposition , pakistan are dealing with a host of problems of their own . first amongst pakistan 's problems will be the failure against the new ball where they have lost crucial wickets consistently through the limited-overs games this series . ",
        "and there will be no let-up this time around either . new zealand have a rotational policy going for this series and in accordance to that they will have the services of trent boult and lockie ferguson for this game . needless to say then that pakistan will have their task cut out once again early while batting . they will be eager to break the rut of losses in this series . they have threatened with a few good individual performances over the course of the series but have n't managed to run new zealand close . the nature of the t20i format though ought to reduce the gap between the two sides , and pakistan will be hopeful of those individual performances turning the game in their favour .

        "have the unenviable job of changing the batting overnight . they might experiment a touch with the batting order in a bid to beef up the top with experience in the absence of shoaib malik . squad : fakhar zaman , ahmed shehzad , umar amin , babar azam , haris sohail , mohammad hafeez , sarfraz ahmed , shadab khan , faheem ashraf , aamer yamin , hasan ali , mohammad amir , mohammad nawaz , rumman raeeswhat they said `` i think they 're a pretty unpredictable team . when they come out and play to their potential , they can beat anyone , and you can see that in the results that they 've had .
