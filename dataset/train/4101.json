        "-- juho sarvikas december 28 , 2017 . the nokia 2 launched in late october , with a us expansion in november , and it 's available at best buy , amazon , and b&h . while it 's certainly not the cream of the crop performance wise , its entry-level price sets it apart from other devices . it features an aforementioned 1 gigabyte of ram , as well as a qualcomm 212 processor and a 720p lcd display . overall , it features pretty respectable specs for a $ 100 device . thoughts ?
