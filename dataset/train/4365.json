        "the tech firm 's new streaming dongle condenses what was great about the previous generation into a smaller , cheaper packagesamuel gibbsthe amazon fire tv with 4k hdr is arguably the easiest and best way to play ultra hd content on your tv , condensing what was great about the previous generation into a smaller , cheaper package . the new fire tv is no longer a set-top box -- instead it 's more like the cheaper fire tv stick , hanging off a built-in flexible hdmi cable . it means the new fire tv can be inserted straight into the back of a tv , hidden from view , and likely powered straight from the tv 's usb port . ",
        "the downside is that by shrinking the fire tv down to an 87.1 g dongle , amazon has cut the built-in ethernet and microsd card sockets . the former is available as an optional extra through an adapter , but this fire tv is clearly more about streaming and less about android games than the previous generation , so expandable storage is less important . plug in , switch on , log in the fire tv plugged into a free hdmi socket on the back of your tv and powered either by the tv 's usb socket or the included power adapter . ",
        "photograph : amazonsetup took about five minutes . it comes with a remote , a usb power adapter and microusb cable for powering the fire tv . some will need the power adapter , others will be able to power it straight from a usb port on their tv -- the usb ports on the sony bravia 55xe9005 were capable of powering it playing 4k hdr content . once connected the remote pairs up with the fire tv at the touch of a button and all you have to do is follow the instructions to connect to wifi and the necessary amazon account -- you do n't have to subscribe to amazon 's prime subscription service , but you ca n't use the fire tv without a basic account . ",
        "you 're then shown an introductory video that guides you through the basics of using the fire tv and alexa via the voice remote . the interface of the fire tv remains pretty much same as previous versions , despite running on a newer version of amazon 's fire os . it 's focused around getting you to the content or content apps as fast as possible , and it works well . there are plenty of options beyond amazon 's built-in video and music services . netflix , all the uk terrestrial broadcaster streaming services , spotify and others are free to download from the amazon app store . ",
        "the home screen of the fire tv puts content and content apps front-and-centre . photograph : samuel gibbs for the guardiansubscriptions to discovery , eurosport player , itv hub + and hayu are also in the subscription amazon prime account , with free trials to see what 's available . the only big one missing other than apple 's itunes is google play movies , but movies bought via google are available through youtube , which is viewable through a built-in browser but not an app as amazon and google are squabbling at the moment . services such as netflix can suggest content directly within the home screen , making it easy to get straight back into what you were watching last night . ",
        "amazon 's voice assistant alexa is also integrated into the fire tv . hold the mic button on the remote , make your request and alexa will respond via voice and on-screen cards similar to that available on the echo show . searching for content is as easy as asking for a show , movie , actor or genre . alexa then shows the results with options to stream from a subscription you already have or buy it from amazon 's video library if you do n't already own it . 4k hdr in all its glorythe previous version of the fire tv could manage 4k content , but not the new high dynamic range content , which like hdr photography , is richer , with a wider colour range . ",
        "paired with the right tv , such as the sony bravia 55xe9005 it looks absolutely stunning . the new fire tv supports hdr content from amazon 's prime video service as well as from netflix 's catalogue , giving you access to two of the largest libraries of 4k hdr content available at the moment . the catalogue is growing too , with many new tv shows being available in 4k hdr , and almost all the netflix and amazon own-brand movies and tv shows available in the format . the fire tv also supports dolby atmos , for improved surround sound with compatible systems , but the catalogue of content that supports atmos is quite limited , as is device support . ",
        "observations you can control the fire tv with some tv remotes , although not all the functions work videos normally start at a higher quality sooner than the old fire tv connected to the router via ethernet , but are more susceptible to quality dips mid stream some apps could hang or crash early on , but updates appear to have fixed any issues the amazon remote can not do volume on your tv pricethe 2017 fire tv with 4k hdr costs £ 69.99 . for comparison , google 's chromecast ultra costs £ 69 , the roku streaming stick + costs £ 79.99 and the apple tv 4k costs £ 179 . ",
        "verdictthe fire tv with 4k and hdr is one of the best streaming devices around . it takes most of what was good from the last generation and squeezes it into a dongle that 's at least £ 10 cheaper and you can hide behind your tv . what was taken away in that shrinking process has n't hurt what most use it for : streaming content . but if you do not have an up to date router that supports the latest 802.11 ac wifi standard , the lack of ethernet might make streaming 4k more difficult . with a prime and netflix subscription , the fire tv gives uk users access to one of the largest collections of 4k hdr content available in a neat and tidy box . ",
        "the fire tv 's 4k hdr content looks stunning when paired with the right tv , making even scenes featuring three old men driving around in amazon 's the grand tour look beautiful . given the mess that built-in smart tv software can be , the fire tv is blessed relief .   ",
        "pros : simple to set up and use , compact , good remote , slick interface , wide uk catchup service support , alexa integration , 4k and hdrcons : no support for itunes or sky content , requires amazon account , wifi only , needs £ 79 amazon prime subscription to get most out of it , no expandable storage other reviews amazon fire tv stick review : cheap , great tv streaming device with new interface and alexa amazon echo show review : smart speaker with a screen has great potential amazon echo second-generation review : smaller , cheaper and better amazon echo dot review : as good as the echo for one-third of the price this article contains affiliate links to products .",
