        "-- nikki haley , the u. s. ambassador to the united nations , took credit for a five percent cut in the world body 's two-year operating budget , saying she would n't let the generosity of american taxpayers go `` unchecked . '' but she did n't mention one thing : the un 's budget had already been on a decline . haley , in a statement sent on christmas eve , said the u. s. negotiated $ 285 million of cuts to the un 's $ 5.4 billion general budget for 2017-2018 . that compares to a $ 5.61 billion budget approved for 2016-2017 , which was down from $ 5.8 billion for the previous two-year period . ",
        "`` in addition to these significant cost savings , we reduced the un 's bloated management and support functions , bolstered support for key u. s. priorities throughout the world and instilled more discipline and accountability throughout the un system , '' the statement said . the budget cuts were not related to last week 's rebuke by the general assembly of president donald trump 's decision to move the american embassy in israel to jerusalem . but after that 128-9 vote , trump and haley appeared to threaten funding to the global body . diplomats have been negotiating the un 's 2018-19 budget for months . ",
        "un secretary general antonio guterres had spoken of the need for greater efficiency as part of his reform agenda since taking office about a year ago . whether the un budget goes up or down , the organization 's charter , written at the end of world war ii , says the u. s. is responsible for 22 percent of the body 's annual operating budget , or about $ 1.2 billion in 2017-2018 . haley did signal that more cuts could be coming in the future , adding in her statement that `` we 'll continue to look at ways to increase the un 's efficiency while protecting our interests .
