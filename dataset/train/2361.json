        "a few years ago , i made a conscious decision to tell my friends and family that i 'd much rather have experiences than get presents under the tree . this request has led me to some of the best experience gifts for couples and family members alike . for example , i would take a bruno mars concert with my mom over a bath and body works gift set any day -- so , that 's exactly what we did . as early christmas presents to each other , my mom and i recently went to bruno mars 's 24k magic world tour and it was awesome . ",
        "she had never been to a concert before and i was thrilled that i could be there for her first one . in fact , i loved the idea of a holiday experience gift so much that i 'm doing something similar with my younger brother in a few days . because we wo n't be together for christmas , we 've decided to go on a doors-off helicopter tour of our city before he leaves for the holidays . holiday experience gifts are n't just for you and your family . you and your partner can definitely skip the gift-wrapped tech devices and opt for an adventure together instead . ",
        "the absolute best part of a holiday experience gift ? assured gift reciprocity . this way , neither person has to worry about whether or not their gift is as good as the other person 's gift . instead , you can decide on something you 'd like to experience together . maybe it 's a live concert or maybe it 's a road trip . whatever it is , you 'll be happy to be there together , making it a gift to remember . if you 're thinking of doing a holiday experience gift this year , here are a few ideas to get you started . ",
        "a weekend getawayholiday travel always gets a bad rep in the movies but it does n't have to be miserable . after all , it was a last minute decision to spend christmas in the english countryside that led cameron diaz to jude law in the holiday -- i know that 's my holiday dream . unlike diaz , though , you do n't have to plan your trip alone . use websites like airbnb to book a romantic weekend away in a cozy cabin some place cold . alternatively , if you 're looking to get away from the snow , why not book a short stay at an all-inclusive , tropical resort ? ",
        "planning the trip will be half the fun . all that matters is that you and your partner agree on a location and split the costs appropriately . ice skating hear me out with this one . if you 've done this a hundred times before , it might not seem like anything special , but i think there 's something so uniquely romantic about a private ice-skating session . do you remember in gilmore girls when lorelai decided that her lifelong love affair with snow was over ? she was miserable and depressed for days . luke , small-town hero that he is , made her an ice rink in her front yard and watched her skate like a dork all afternoon . ",
        "it was adorable , ok ! i 'm not saying you have to get that crafty but reserving a few hours of private rink time might just be the cutest holiday experience gift ever . a holiday performancethe best holiday experience gift i 've ever done with a partner was seeing a live performance of the nutcracker by the miami city ballet . what made it even more special was the fact that it was his idea and i could tell he actually enjoyed the show . this is n't an anomaly , either . i recently went on my most interesting date yet with an orchestra musician who invited me to see him play in a holiday concert . ",
        "maybe i 'm just a sucker for christmas music , but i have to admit that both of these dates were pretty memorable experiences and i 'd be happy to relive either . a champagne cruise another experience i can successfully vouch for , romantic , champagne cruises for two are fairly easy to come by on groupon if you live near the coast . typically , these packages will offer two-hour-long cruises aboard a catamaran for one to three couples . most set sail right before sunset and include complimentary champagne and wine . all that 's left to do is show up . ",
        "a spa daynothing says , `` i love you ... and me , '' like spending the day getting pampered at a luxurious resort . you and your partner can customize your experience together , choosing from services like massages , facials , and body scrubs . the soothing music and aromatherapy oils will make for an intimate and relaxing experience together . charlie brown was right . the best gifts are n't what 's under the tree but who 's around it . this year , instead of spending hours in line at the mall , plan a holiday experience gift for you and your partner .
