        "defensive heroics do the job as goodison witnesses a goalless premier league stalemateeverton produced an incredibly resilient display to draw 0-0 against a dominant chelsea at goodison . the blues ' unbeaten run under sam allardyce has been extended to six games in all competitions after they defended for their lives against the premier league champions . chelsea finished the game having had 24 attempts but dogged defending and some fine saves from jordan pickford ensured everton kept an unlikely clean sheet . chelsea came close to breaking the deadlock after 10 minutes . but twice in the space of a few seconds , phil jagielka cleared off the line from tiemoune bakayoko and willian . ",
        "everton defended doggedly but were indebted to pickford who produced a fine save to deny pedro after michael keane had given away possession . allardyce made a double sub at the break - bringing on sandro ramirez and ashley williams - but was forced into a third change six minutes later when idrissa gueye picked up what appeared to be a hamstring injury . chelsea continued to control proceedings and pickford saved again from pedro and eden hazard to keep it at 0-0 . pickford was stranded as williams headed towards his own goal but was saved when it cannoned back off the underside of the bar . ",
        "chelsea piled on the pressure but everton stood firm and came close to grabbing a winner late on when keane headed a corner just over the bar .   "
