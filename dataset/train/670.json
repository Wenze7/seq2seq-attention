        "north american growth remains elusive , but the global athletic footwear and apparel juggernaut is doing just fine . nike inc. . announced stronger-than-expected fiscal second-quarter 2018 results on thursday after the market closed , demonstrating sustained momentum for its international and direct-to-consumer businesses , and an unsurprising decline from its north american wholesale segment . let 's suit up to get a better idea of what drove nike as it ended the first half , and look deeper at what investors should anticipate going forward . image source : nike . nike results : the raw numbers metricfiscal q2 2018fiscal q2 2017year-over-year growthrevenue $ 8.554 billion $ 8.180 billion4 .6 % net income $ 767 million $ 842 millionearnings per share $ 0.46 $ 0.50 data source : nike inc. . ",
        "what happened with nike this quarter ? these results are technically in line with nike 's rough guidance provided in late september , which called for revenue to increase in the low-single-digit range as international strength would more than offset `` short-term headwinds '' in north american wholesale . they were also comfortably ahead of consensus expectations for more modest 2.7 % revenue growth and earnings of $ 0.40 per share . nike brand revenue grew 4 % at constant currencies , to $ 8.1 billion , driven by growth in sportswear and nike basketball . by geography , nike brand sales in north america declined 5 % , to $ 3.485 billion , emea grew 19 % , to $ 2.133 billion , greater china climbed 16 % , to $ 1.222 billion , and apla grew 6 % , to $ 1.273 billion . ",
        "converse revenue fell 2 % year over year -- down 4 % at constant currency -- to $ 408 million , due to continued weakness in north america . gross margin fell 120 basis points year over year , to 43 % , as higher average selling prices were offset primarily by foreign currency exchange . repurchased 16.7 million shares during the quarter for $ 902 million , leaving $ 5.8 billion remaining under nike 's four-year $ 12 billion program that was initiated in november 2015 . what management had to say `` this quarter , led by our consumer direct offense , we accelerated international growth and built underlying momentum in our domestic business , '' stated nike chairman and ceo mark parker . ",
        "`` for the back half of the fiscal year , nike 's innovation line-up is as strong as it 's ever been and we 'll continue to actively shape retail through new differentiated experiences . `` looking forwardfor the current fiscal third quarter , nike expects reported revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range . more specifically , nike sees growth arriving at , or slightly below , the rate it achieved in fiscal q2 , assuming new product launches planned for near the end of the quarter . trending toward the bottom line , nike sees gross margin contracting in the range of 125 to 175 basis points due to a combination of higher promotions and foreign exchange . ",
        "but gross margin should begin to see sequential improvement starting in the fiscal fourth quarter . that said , nike essentially reaffirmed its previous full fiscal-year 2018 guidance , which calls for reported revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range and contraction in gross margin in the 50 to 100 basis-point range . `` as we look ahead to the second half of the fiscal year and into fiscal-year 2019 , we have an unprecedented wave of new innovative products coming to market , we have strong international momentum , and we are building underlying momentum in the u. s. , '' added nike cfo andy campion . ",
        "`` our current momentum is the direct result of our focus on what matters most to consumers . `` putting aside nike 's slight outperformance relative to the market 's expectations , the athletic footwear and apparel giant essentially delivered just as it said it would three months ago . margins are under pressure right now , but that 's no surprise given factors largely out of nike 's control . as its international momentum picks up steam , the company continues to view near-term weakness in north america as a chance to solidify its industry leadership . as such , and with the stock up nearly 25 % so far in 2017 , i think nike has confirmed it remains a worthy place for patient investors to put their money to work .
