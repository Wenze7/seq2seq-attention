        "rinspeed and harman have partnered up once again , producing the snap concept car . this is a level 5 autonomous driving vehicle , without a steering while , which the two companies believe will be used on the road as early as 2025 . harman and rinspeed are no strangers to each other , this is actually the tenth project the two have done together , and the third connected car concept that harman will be showing off in las vegas at ces next month . harman says that the snap will actually be accompanying a market-ready vehicle , which will showcase transformative digital cockpit experiences from both harman and samsung . ",
        "the other car is going to be a semi-autonomous vehicle -- these type of cars are already on the road right now . the purpose of the rinspeed snap is to showcase a seamless user experience no matter who is in the car . harman decided to go this route because car-sharing services are gaining a lot of momentum , so no matter who is in the car , you can get a vastly different experience , from the colored lighting in the car , to the music playing and everything in between . the rinspeed snap is basically a pod that can be rearranged based on who 's in the car . ",
        "whether you want to be alone , and just chill out on the ride , or party in the snap , it can do either one , seamlessly . harman and rinspeed will be showcasing a few forward-looking features on the snap . this includes true level 5 infotainment , an intelligent personal assistant , the ability to personalize the car to individual needs and full connectivity to the outside world . harman has actually designed a hmi as well as a ux for users to actually be able to use in the snap , since the users are n't focused on the road any longer . ",
        "access to the snap is a snap , you will use a smart device to unlock the car , then two-step verification is used to access personal content . the final step in two-step verification is going to be a biometric identification , like facial recognition . some of harman 's other products announced today are also part of this concept car , like the next generation of ignite . as well as cyber security measures , over-the-air software updates and much more . harman has also integrated softbank 's personal robot , pepper into the car , which will be used as a concierge service . ",
        "there 's also a personal control panel at each seat , which features a high-density , multi-touch interface , as well as an interactive rotary dial with contextual haptic feedback . harman and rinspeed will be showing the snap off at ces , so we 'll be able to go hands on with it in january , but it looks to be the car of the future , for sure , at this point . the post harman & rinspeed debut snap : a level 5 autonomous concept car appeared first on androidheadlines . com | .
