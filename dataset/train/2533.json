        "as with most , i am happy to have 2017 behind us . but in times of turmoil , it is art - and especially music - that lights the spark of resistance and love . 2017 is one of those years where music meant more , and many artists brought us sounds that will be our soundtrack for eternity . here 's my top 9 albums : soft sounds from another planet -- japanese breakfastthe modern rock version of lana del ray . more guitars . much more musicianship . but the same side-to-side sway to modern romance . ",
        "this album fits in with the best 90s efforts of liz phair and belly . cigarettes after sex -- cigarettes after sexjust as forbidden and satisfying as their band name . somehow they cracked the code to cowboy junkie 's version of sweet jane and turned it into a suite of sensual delights . aromanticism -- moses sumneythere 's a yin/yang quality to listening to sampha and moses back-to-back . moses uses some of the same soaring vocal production techniques . but instead of taking you higher , he takes you to the sunken place . the only thing missing is the coffee cup and spoon .

        "aromanticism is a void . a place without . these are the places one needs to visit to remind us of what we live for . process -- samphathis year 's headphone champion . sampha 's production has distorted synths and voices swirling around , sending you into a trance . even in his saddest songs , joy abounds . american dream -- lcd soundsystemrock is not dead . it 's just everybody 's doing it wrong . except james murphy and crew . the key was staying true to themselves . they are a band without a time . ",
        "their only touchstone is the new york of decades past . the beautiful thing is you get to pick the decade . flower boy -- tyler , the creatorhe 's finally growing into his skin . the confidence he shows by being vulnerable throughout this record is a welcome step forward . and his production work continues to make the simple sound fresh and furious . mura masa -- mura masasince high school i 've had a soft spot for seedy british clubs and the music culture it 's produced . mura masa is the kid that dreamed of these places since birth then spit out a first rate heirloom to his heroes . ",
        "ctrl -- szaunapologetically single . unapologetically real . making mistakes . making memories . building a life through experience . sza let 's us sit shotgun . she 's a ride-or-die chick . damn -- kendrick lamarthe importance of kendrick and this album this year can not be overstated . the anger . the rage . the confusion . the fear . he crammed in the psyche of a nation into 14 taught jabs . and while spilling over with aggression , it 's once again his introspective moments like fear that take these songs to lands only the greatest artists ever have dared to travel to and tell their tale . ",
        "he is bob marley for this generation . and just like bob , he knows in tough times , music - even the political kind with jagged edges - makes you feel alright . bonusno _ one ever really dies -- n. e.r. d1000 % bias -- but this album is still undeniable . ridiculous production shifts in each track . monster guest verses . and throughout a reminder these guys are the architects of all the interesting , alternative , weird , rap the kids eat like lucky charms these days . plus , essential messages for plotting 2018 and beyond .
