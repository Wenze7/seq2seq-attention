        "famously thrifty sen. bernie sanders did not spend new year 's eve with the millionaires and the billionaires . instead , he celebrated in just about the most bernie sanders way imaginable : consuming an early-bird meal while surrounded by adoring millennials snapping photos with their cell phones . according to vanity fair , sanders was spotted with his wife , jane , at the downtown manhattan beer hall clinton hall , where they dined on chicken wings , coffee and tea around 4:30 pm . the tab : $ 16 . a bodyguard watched over the table , which `` became truly communal because supporters kept going up to him , '' reports page six . ",
        "`` millennials were snapping away , taking pics while he ate . `` sanders , a brooklyn native , was in town for the second inauguration of new york city mayor bill de blasio on monday . newsweek tweaked him for wearing a $ 690 burton parka during the ceremony . the vermont senator spent the rest of dec. . 31 watching the ball drop in times square . on monday , he tweeted his hopes for the new year . `` we will not only intensify the struggle against trumpism , we will increase our efforts to spread the progressive vision in every corner of the land , '' he wrote . ",
        "according to predictit on dec. . 29 , sanders is viewed as the most likely democratic nominee to oppose president trump in 2020 , with california sen. kamala harris in second place . but the same day that bernie was chowing down in nyc , former democratic national chairman ed rendell said that former vice president joe biden would `` overwhelmingly '' beat trump . `` there 's only one person i can say who will definitely win the election and has a superstar appeal in almost every state in the union , and that 's vice president biden , '' he said on a radio show . ",
        "neither sanders nor biden have committed to a run .   "
