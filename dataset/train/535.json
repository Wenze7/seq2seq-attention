        "the haitian government and its international partners thursday launched an appeal for $ 252 million in aid to respond to natural disasters in 2018 . the haitian government and its international partners thursday launched an appeal for $ 252 million in aid to respond to natural disasters in 2018 . in 2017 , haiti was spared the impact of natural disasters which devastated other caribbean islands -- but is still struggling to recover from past catastrophes . eight years after an earthquake killed over 200,000 people and ravaged the metropolitan area of the capital port-au-prince , more than 38,000 people remain in makeshift camps . ",
        "a year after hurricane matthew hit southern haiti , over one million citizens there are still in need of humanitarian assistance , according to the government 's plan . meanwhile since july 2015 , 230,000 haitians -- 16 percent minors -- have had to leave the neighboring dominican republic following changes in immigration law , and aid is needed to help them resettle in haiti . the humanitarian response plan was created in partnership with un agencies working in haiti , but risks falling short of the needed funding , as it has in the past . in 2017 , only 37 percent of the funds needed were raised . ",
        "`` we are in a period of declining external aid . the government is now exploring how to achieve empowerment to finance recovery and make the transition to development , '' planning minister aviol fleurant told afp . on the topic of humanitarian aid , president jovenel moise has not hesitated to criticize the failure of aid programs to lift haiti out of extreme poverty . `` thirty years of assistance and several billion dollars spent by our international partners , mostly to finance small non-structural projects , have sadly demonstrated their limit , '' he said in a speech monday .
