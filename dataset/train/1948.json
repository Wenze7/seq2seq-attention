        "here 's why i 'm going to try anywayto put off your old self , which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires , and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds , and to put on the new self , created after the likeness of god in true righteousness and holiness . ephesians 4:22 -- 24 i 've always been the kind of person who did n't care much what other people think . i rarely do something just because other people are doing it , and tend to make fun of such things , calling them `` bandwagons '' . ",
        "something in me just could n't take it seriously . sometimes i 'd think : if you want to change something , just do it . you do n't need the beginning of a year to do it . and i certainly do n't need to hear about it . this year i 've been doing a little thinking , a little more studying , and-just maybe-a little more listening to god . the above scripture teaches members of the church in ephesus that they should be letting go of old , bad habits and improving themselves , taking on new habits and new ways of thinking . ",
        "paul was not talking to unbelievers . he was addressing people who assumedly had already put off quite a lot of bad habits and behavior in their conversions to christianity . but paul knew we always have room to grow . self-improvement is important . i appeal to you therefore , brothers , by the mercies of god , to present your bodies as a living sacrifice , holy and acceptable to god , which is your spiritual worship . do not be conformed to this world , but be transformed by the renewal of your mind , that by testing you may discern what is the will of god , what is good and acceptable and perfect . ",
        "romans 12:1 -- 2 when thinking about the concept of a `` new year 's resolution '' , i am beginning to realize it 's not biblical to resist the idea of improving myself . even as a christian , i 'm supposed to be continually `` renewing '' my mind . i should be improving my thinking , what i care about , what i choose to do with my time . no , god does n't actually say this self-improvement must be done at the beginning of a year . but he does say to improve . so if you have something in your life you 'd like to improve or change , do n't hesitate to do it ! ",
        "but what about announcing your new year 's resolutions ? well , i 'd advise caution ... `` beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them , for then you will have no reward from your father who is in heaven . thus , when you give to the needy , sound no trumpet before you , as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets , that they may be praised by others . truly , i say to you , they have received their reward . but when you give to the needy , do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing , so that your giving may be in secret . ",
        "and your father who sees in secret will reward you . '' matthew 6:1 -- 4 here jesus gives the specific example of making a show about giving to the poor , but the larger principle is that we should n't be doing good to get attention from other people . i 'm not saying anyone who mentions a new year 's resolution is doing it for the attention . sometimes those things are done for encouragement and accountability . but it 's definitely worth considering our motives . am i letting others know about my self-improvement efforts to help me achieve them , or simply for more immediate gratification ? ",
        "this new year 's day , i want to encourage you all to find something in your life needing improvement and work on it . with god 's help , make yourself a better person , a better friend , a better parent , sibling , employee . make yourself a better follower of christ . do n't do it for accolades , do it between yourself and god , for his glory . thank you for reading !
