        "margot robbie married british director tom ackerley in 2016 , however due to the filming schedule of i , tonya , which the actress currently stars in , they had to delay their honeymoon for a few months . on wednesday during a visit to ellen , robbie said that when they did finally go on their honeymoon they stayed in a rustic shack on an island in tahiti , before eventually making their way to a luxury hotel . unfortunately , when they got there it was raining , so the newlywed couple decided to check out the gym . ",
        "`` we get changed to go to the gym , and tom puts on these shorts that are the oldest gym shorts , and they 're tiny , and they 're like really short , and there 's nothing underneath , '' she told ellen . `` so he gets on this bicycle to ride and i was like , ` whoa ! , ' i was like , ` babe , you can not wear those shorts ! you know , i can see everything , ' and he was like , ` come on , who are we gon na run into . ' ",
        "`` of course , at that point they pretty much jinxed themselves into running into someone , and as such who else would be running on treadmills but degeneres herself alongside wife portia de rossi . but that was n't even the worst part . while she was still recovering from being starstruck over the encounter , ellen said to her , `` have you met obama ? '' and sure enough , former president barack obama was standing right next to them . things got even more awkward during the stretching part of a fitness class , although to her credit ellen found the whole thing hilarious , at one point telling him , `` boy , those are the wrong shorts to wear today ! '' ",
        "clearly a lesson learned the hard way .   "
