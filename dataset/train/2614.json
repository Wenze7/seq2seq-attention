        "while no major storms are pressing the northeastern united states in the short-term , milder air will trigger spotty , light snow and freezing drizzle to start the week . motorists should allow some extra time for their commutes on monday , especially from northern pennsylvania to upstate new york and central and northern new england . a few patches of freezing drizzle may also occur farther to the southwest in parts of the lower michigan peninsula , ohio , west virginia and southern pennsylvania first thing monday morning . only a small amount of precipitation is forecast ; however , even a thin coating of ice can cause motorists to lose control of their vehicle or lead to a slip and fall incident . ",
        "in some cases , a thin coating of snow may cover up patches of ice . temperatures are likely to be too high for concerns of black ice in most areas from new york city to washington , d. c. , and richmond and roanoke , virginia . rising temperatures will alleviate the risk of spotty ice and snow over much of the region late monday into monday evening ; however , in far northern new york state and northern new england , slippery spots may continue into tuesday .
