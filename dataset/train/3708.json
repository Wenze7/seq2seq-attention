        "councils are being forced to divert resources into supporting universal credit claimants , labour has claimed . freedom of information requests submitted by the party reveal that local authority cash is being used to help those moving onto the new benefit with rent arrears and other forms of support . shadow employment minister , margaret greenwood , said : `` universal credit is causing misery and hardship for thousands of families this christmas and councils are being expected to pick up the pieces . `` this is yet more evidence that the government should immediately pause the roll out of universal credit so its fundamental flaws can be fixed . '' ",
        "according to the findings , newcastle city council is spending £ 390,000 supporting claimants , while liverpool city council said it had put £ 175,000 from its local welfare provision into the new benefit . altogether , 26 councils across the uk said they had set aside extra cash or were expecting increased demand for support as part of the rollout of the tories ' flagship welfare reform . the controversial policy has received criticism from mps of all parties , with conservative backbenchers threatening to rebel if key aspects were not changed , forcing a government climbdown . in his november budget today , the chancellor announced the waiting time of six weeks for new claimants to receive their first payment would be reduced by seven days . ",
        "announcing the change , mr hammond told the commons : `` universal credit delivers a modern welfare system , where work always pays and people are supported to earn . `` but i recognise the genuine concerns on both sides of the house about the operational delivery of this benefit . '' however , labour mps have continued to warn about the effects of the new policy . writing for the house magazine earlier this month , oldham west and royton mp jim mcmahon said the rollout had `` turned into a quagmire of unintended delays and pure design flaws . '' ",
        "responding to today 's claims over council funding , a dwp spokesman said : `` councils have been providing welfare advice and housing payment top-ups as standard , since long before the introduction of universal credit . `` the majority of claimants are comfortable managing their money but advances are available for anyone who needs extra help , and arrangements can be made to pay rent direct to landlords if needed .
