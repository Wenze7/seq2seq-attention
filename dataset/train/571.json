        "we used to consider adolescence ending at age 19 , but now scientists in the uk think we should consider the period of development as lasting from ages 10 to 24 . given that young people are now spending more time in school and are waiting longer to do things like get married and start a family the time when adulthood officially begins is getting pushed back , the bbc reports . puberty starts when your brain starts to release a hormone that activates your body 's pituitary and gonadal glands . that used to happen around age 14 , but thanks to good health and nutrition has started to happen as early as 10 . ",
        "on the other end of the spectrum , our brains continue to develop after the age of 20 , and many people do n't get all their wisdom teeth until they 're 25 . the idea behind changing the time frame for adolescence is to encourage services like health care to support children until they reach 24 , rather than cut off services in their teens . we all still have to grow up at some point , but it looks like that point might be a few years later now .
