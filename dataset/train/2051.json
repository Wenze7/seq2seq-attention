        "-- house leaders intend to take another stab next week at advancing a long-term extension of a program for conducting foreign surveillance that is about to expire , but there are opponents on both sides of the aisle . a key issue has been demands by some lawmakers for more stringent limits on when officials can access americans ' communications incidentally caught in the foreign surveillance . the trump administration and the intelligence community want to preserve the program as is . republicans on friday released a revamped measure to make changes to section 702 of the foreign intelligence surveillance amendments act , or fisa . ",
        "the program allows the national security agency to intercept calls or emails from suspected foreign terrorists outside the u. s . the house rules committee is scheduled to consider the measure on wednesday , when it could be advanced to the house floor for a vote . the existing language was set to lapse at the end of 2017 . however , party leaders ' efforts to address some of the demands for changes sputtered in december and the current version was temporarily extended through jan. . 19 . the aim was to allow more time for negotiating , explaining the bill to members , and rounding up enough votes from both parties needed for passage . ",
        "in fact , the proposed text released friday remains largely reflective of an earlier version released by house intelligence committee chairman devin nunes , a california republican . it includes a requirement that the federal bureau of investigation , in most potential criminal cases `` unrelated to national security , '' seek a court order before viewing information about americans ' communications in the program database . but there are various exceptions . critics were quick to renew their complaints that the bill does n't go far enough to protect americans from being spied upon . representative jerrold nadler of new york , the top democrat on the house judiciary committee , said in a statement the measure is a `` warmed-over version of a bill that has already been panned by companies , as well as the privacy and civil liberties community . '' ",
        "he called the new warrant requirement `` a fig leaf for reform '' and said it does n't address a `` vast majority '' of searches of information under the law . nadler said he will oppose it , and his sentiment was supported by others who have concerns about the law . `` we strongly oppose this legislation , '' said neema singh guliani , legislative counsel of the american civil liberties union . `` this bill is not reform by any stretch of the imagination . it leaves the door wide open to abusive surveillance practices that allow the government to search the intimate emails , text messages , and other sensitive data of americans without a warrant of any kind .
