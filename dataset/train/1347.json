        "by michelle martin berlin - germany 's environmentalist greens , still reeling from the collapse of coalition negotiations last year , are set for a shake-up at the top after their leaders both said they would not stand for re-election . the reshuffle follows the failure in november of three-way `` jamaica '' talks between chancellor angela merkel 's conservative bloc , the greens and the pro-business free democrats . the `` jamaica '' moniker came from the official colours of the three parties that combine to make up that country 's flag . the greens , who got 8.9 percent in september 's vote , still have an outside chance of getting into government - either in a two-way tie-up with the conservatives or in a jamaica coalition , if current talks between chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives and the social democrats fail . ",
        "cem ozdemir , a 52-year-old politician of turkish origin who was touted as a potential foreign minister if the jamaica talks succeeded , said he did not stand a chance in a leadership vote so he would not attempt to extend his tenure . `` ultimately it became clear to me that what i offer did n't have enough support in the parliamentary fraction at the moment - i obviously do n't have a majority and i must accept that , '' he told newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . his co-leader , 52-year-old simone peter - who belongs to the party 's leftist wing , also said she would not run for re-election after anja piel , another leftist member , said she would stand . ",
        "other candidates include 48-year-old robert habeck , a popular regional environment minister , and 37-year-old annalena baerbock , a member of the national parliament . both of them are considered to be in the party 's pragmatic wing . the greens tend to choose a man and a woman as co-leaders , with one coming from the pragmatic wing while the other comes from the `` fundamentalist '' leftist wing . ozdemir and peter were largely responsible for leading the jamaica coalition negotiations for the greens - talks which met with widespread scepticism among the party 's grassroots . the greens , which once styled themselves as an `` anti-party party '' , have disappointed some voters by shifting towards the centre , with some complaining they have become too normal and boring . ",
        "their environmentalist agenda becoming mainstream has deprived them of a unique selling point . in an opinion piece , the daily die welt wrote that the leadership turnover would inject some life into what was `` until half a year ago considered the topsy-turvy house of german politics that was fit for demolition '' . but it suggested the outlook was not bright . `` past experience shows that vibrancy in the greens rapidly leads to arguments . ''   "
