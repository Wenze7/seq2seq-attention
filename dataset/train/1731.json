        "facebook inc. , twitter inc. . and google 's youtube on wednesday told lawmakers that they support a legislative effort to restore net neutrality rules wiped out by the federal communications commission last month . executives appearing before the senate commerce committee replied to senator ed markey , a massachusetts democrat , who asked their position on his resolution to nullify the fcc 's action . `` yes , sir , thank you for your leadership on this issue , '' replied carlos monje , a director for twitter . youtube 's juniper downs , global head of public policy and government relations , said the platform `` will support any effort '' to put back in place the rules gutted by the fcc . ",
        "facebook 's monika bickert , head of global policy management , said she had the `` same answer : we will support the cra , '' shorthand for the measure proposed by markey that would use the congressional review act . markey 's measure is backed by all 49 senators who organize with the democrats and one republican , meaning it needs just one vote to assure senate passage . he ca n't introduce it until the new fcc rule , passed by agency republicans without democratic support , becomes official with publication in the federal register . the odds are long that the measure would get though the republican-majority house or avoid an almost certain veto by president donald trump , who backed the fcc 's move . ",
        "but democrats see political value in forcing the showdown . in the meantime a legal battle has erupted , with 22 democratic attorneys general asking a federal appeals court to reverse the fcc . california and new york are part of the effort .   "
