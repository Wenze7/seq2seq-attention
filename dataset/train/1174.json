        "scientists believe they are on the way to finding a cure for haemophilia a , the bleeding disorder that currently requires sufferers to inject themselves every other day to avoid life-threatening complications . one dose of a gene therapy given experimentally to 13 patients by nhs doctors in the uk has allowed them all to come off treatment . these were men -- most sufferers are -- who would not only bleed without stopping from an injury but would bleed into their joints even in their sleep causing pain and disability , without frequent injections of a clotting factor . ",
        "none of them now bleeds spontaneously in that way . `` i think it 's a huge step forward , '' said professor john pasi , haemophilia centre director at barts health nhs trust and one of the authors of the study . `` gene therapy for haemophilia has historically been the holy grail . our patients have to treat themselves at least three times a week and even then they may still bleed . the treatment burden is massive . `` the opportunity to give them a one-off treatment perhaps for a lifetime but maybe for many years is a huge opportunity . ",
        "it could transform their care . '' patients were recruited from around england and all injected with a copy of the single gene responsible for causing blood to clot , which they were missing at birth . the treatment given at a low dose in the first two patients did not work . but the 13 subsequently treated at a higher dose have all stopped their regular injections . more than a year on , 11 of them have levels of the blood clotting protein factor viii that are at or near normal . the results of the trial in nine of the patients are published in the new england journal of medicine , together with an editorial by dr h marijke van den berg , vice president of the world federation of haemophilia . ",
        "she hails the trial and a second study into gene therapy for people with a resistant form of the rarer haemophilia b as `` leading the way to a cure for haemophilia '' . if the therapies can be perfected , she writes , `` children born with this devastating disease could benefit from a life without bleeding . '' the treatment would be particularly welcomed in the developing world , where patients can not get access to clotting products , she points out . globally , various types of haemophilia affect around 400,000 people . in the uk , around 2,000 people have severe haemophilia a . ",
        "the best known sufferer historically was the young russian tsarevich alexei , who had haemophilia b and whose treatment by the monk rasputin has often been linked to the fall of the imperial family . scientists always thought it ought to be possible to find a gene therapy for haemophilia , but it has taken many years of unsuccessful attempts . one of the chief problems was finding a suitable virus to act as a delivery agent , or vector . the researchers have used an adeno-associated virus , which does not cause disease but could rule out the therapy for people whose immune system has encountered it in the past . ",
        "the 13 patients will be closely followed to discover whether the therapy lasts and a bigger trial will need to be done before the treatment can be licensed . there will then be the issue of cost . `` this is going to be hugely expensive therapy , '' said pasi . `` the average cost in the uk of current treatment is Â£ 100,000 per year per patient for a lifetime . you can see what numbers can clock up . it is the elephant in the room . '' jake omer , 29 , who lives in billericay with his wife and two small children , has been living with haemophilia all his life . ",
        "for the last 18 months , since joining the trial , he has no longer had to give himself intravenous infusions . his levels of the blood clotting protein factor viii are higher than the average man in the street , he says . `` it means i do n't have haemophilia any more . it 's crazy , '' he said . omer was two when he was diagnosed . `` i was pottering about as a child and fell over in the kitchen and cut my lip . the bleeding did n't stop . after one or two days of waking up in a pool of blood , i was taken to the hospital , '' he said . ",
        "life for his parents in romford then became one of anxiety and frequent trips to the royal london hospital . `` they 'd have to drive me to the royal london and then hold me down to get the injection in , '' he said . `` i was back and forth every two or three weeks . '' it got better when his mum was able to give him the infusions once he was six or seven and better still when he could do it himself , at the age of 11 . `` but you always have to be a little bit more careful than your mates when climbing trees or jumping over things on the bikes . '' ",
        "as an adult , he had to take holidays only in countries with excellent haemophilia centres , just in case . the bleeding that occurs into the joints caused arthritis in his ankles . `` the gene therapy has changed my life , '' he said . `` i now have hope for my future . it is incredible to now hope that i can play with my kids , kick a ball around and climb trees well into my kids ' teenage years and beyond . the arthritis in my ankles meant i used to worry how far i would be able to walk once i turned 40 . ",
        "at 23 i struggled to run 100m to catch a bus ; now at 29 i 'm walking two miles every day which i just could n't have done before having the gene therapy treatment . '' this article originally appeared on the guardian .   "
