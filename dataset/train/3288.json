        "the yankees being hated again is music to cc sabathia 's ears . new york -- the yankees being hated again is music to cc sabathia 's ears . the veteran left-hander , who returned to the bronx on a one-year , $ 10 million contract earlier this offseason , told the mlb network on thursday if the bombers are n't doing their best to be the `` evil empire , '' then they are doing something wrong . `` last year , we were the team that everybody loved , that feel-good story , '' sabathia said . `` but getting giancarlo just brings us back to being that hated team . ",
        "that 's what we like . we want to go out there , put the best team on the field and crush everybody every game . '' yankees left-hander cc sabathia looks on during the alcs game 4 win over the houston astros at yankee stadium on oct. . 17 , 2017 . giancarlo , of course , is 2017 nl mvp giancarlo stanton , whom the yankees acquired from the miami marlins in a stunning early-december trade . the move gave the bombers the most feared lineup in baseball , with stanton and his 59 home runs from last season joining al rookie of the year aaron judge and catcher gary sanchez . ",
        "more : judge thrilled to have stanton on yankees : ` he 'll blend right in to this team ` the yankees entered last season as a team in the first full year of an extensive rebuild , yet they surprised everyone by going 91-71 and qualifying for the postseason as a wild card . after taking care of the minnesota twins in the one-game playoff , the bombers stunned the world series-favorite cleveland indians in five games in the division series . they then took the eventual world series champion houston astros to seven games in the alcs . ",
        "the belief heading into the offseason was the yankees would look to tweak their everyday lineup and add more starting pitching , but at least part of that idea was blown up by the shocking trade for stanton , which cost new york veteran second baseman starlin castro and two lesser prospects . sabathia flirted with the toronto blue jays and los angeles angels not long after the free agency signing period started , but ultimately returned to the yankees in part because he said he had `` unfinished business , '' as in adding another championship ring to the one he won with new york back in 2009 . ",
        "`` and that 's why i would n't have went to the blue jays , '' sabathia said on the players ' tribune podcast last week . `` if i 'm going to be in the al east , i 'm going to be on the best team . i 'm not coming to yankee stadium to get my ass kicked .

",
        "general manager brian cashman admitted on wfan he would have to do some maneuvering in order to sign the japanese right-hander and stay below the $ 197 million luxury tax threshold in 2018 , something the yankees have vowed to do . new york 's payroll is reportedly $ 178 million , but darvish figures to command around $ 20 million per season and cashman has said he wants some wiggle room in case he needs to add reinforcements at the trade deadline . the yankees ' rotation is currently made up of right-handers luis severino , masahiro tanaka and sonny gray , plus sabathia and young lefty jordan montgomery .
