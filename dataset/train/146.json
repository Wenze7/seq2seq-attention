        "the two brothers are the museum 's oldest mummies and amongst the best-known human remains in its egyptology collection . they are the mummies of two elite men -- khnum-nakht and nakht-ankh -- dating to around 1800 bc . credit : manchester museum , the university of manchesterusing ` next generation ' dna sequencing scientists have found that the famous ` two brothers ' mummies of the manchester museum have different fathers so are , in fact , half-brothers . the two brothers are the museum 's oldest mummies and amongst the best-known human remains in its egyptology collection . ",
        "they are the mummies of two elite men - khnum-nakht and nakht-ankh - dating to around 1800 bc . however , ever since their discovery in 1907 there has been some debate amongst egyptologists whether the two were actually related at all . so , in 2015 , ` ancient dna ' was extracted from their teeth to solve the mystery . but how did the mystery start ? the pair 's joint burial site , later dubbed the tomb of the two brothers , was discovered at deir rifeh , a village 250 miles south of cairo . they were found by egyptian workmen directed by early 20th century egyptologists , flinders petrie and ernest mackay . ",
        "hieroglyphic inscriptions on the coffins indicated that both men were the sons of an unnamed local governor and had mothers with the same name , khnum-aa . it was then the men became known as the two brothers . when the complete contents of the tomb were shipped to manchester in 1908 and the mummies of both men were unwrapped by the uk 's first professional female egyptologist , dr margaret murray . her team concluded that the skeletal morphologies were quite different , suggesting an absence of family relationship . based on contemporary inscriptional evidence , it was proposed that one of the brothers was adopted . ",
        "therefore , in 2015 , the dna was extracted from the teeth and , following hybridization capture of the mitochondrial and y chromosome fractions , sequenced by a next generation method . analysis showed that both nakht-ankh and khnum-nakht belonged to mitochondrial haplotype m1a1 , suggesting a maternal relationship . the y chromosome sequences were less complete but showed variations between the two mummies , indicating that nakht-ankh and khnum-nakht had different fathers , and were thus very likely to have been half-brothers . dr konstantina drosou , of the school of earth and environmental sciences at the university of manchester who conducted the dna sequencing , said : `` it was a long and exhausting journey to the results but we are finally here . ",
        "i am very grateful we were able to add a small but very important piece to the big history puzzle and i am sure the brothers would be very proud of us . these moments are what make us believe in ancient dna . `` the study , which is being published in the journal of archaeological science , is the first to successfully use the typing of both mitochondrial and y chromosomal dna in egyptian mummies . dr campbell price , curator of egypt and sudan at manchester museum , said : `` the university of manchester , and manchester museum in particular , has a long history of research on ancient egyptian human remains . ",
        "our reconstructions will always be speculative to some extent but to be able to link these two men in this way is an exciting first . `` provided by university of manchesterthis story is republished courtesy and copyrighted by phys . org , a popular site that covers news about science research . read the original article .
