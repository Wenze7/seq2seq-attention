        "this is not about bitcoin 's price . i 'm studying the market 's understanding of blockchains . the way we tell blockchain stories determines their value . right now , the story is changing at some major blockchains . confusion reigns . bitcoin is misunderstood as only `` one thing '' bitcoin is both a network and an asset . it 's an asset that only runs on the bitcoin blockchain and the blockchain is a network that only does one thing -- it issues , secures and trades a specific asset i. e. bitcoins . in the same way as the internet and the www were better understood as distinct but interdependent entities , the bitcoin blockchain and bitcoins are distinct entities with distinct features . ",
        "understanding the distinction creates a better framework for understanding blockchains and what comes next . this is where my internet analogy falls flat . we did n't need to understand the www to value the web 2.0 services revolution when it came along . the same may apply to the leap required to understand programmable blockchains . i doubt it . there 's too much money in the mix this time . if anything encourages lazy thinking it is a lot of easy money . lazy thinking explains bitcoin as only one thing . we tell wall street that it is gold 2.0 -- just trust the tech . ",
        "we tell geeks that it is digitally-decentralised-open-money -- just trust in wall st to realise its value . bitcoin is always explained as one thing . bitcoin started out as `` the cryptocurrency '' and has now pivoted to `` gold 2.0 '' -- it still does just one thing . you know the line ; `` bitcoin is a store of value . '' bitcoin got lucky . its blockchain only does one thing and so the lazy narrative has worked . the next generation of programmable blockchains wo n't be so lucky . going the `` one thing '' route oversimplifies their value and more importantly , downplays their potential to disrupt first generation cryptocurrencies . ",
        "is bitcoin a smartphone with only one application ? this week , the ethereum narrative started to focus on differentiation vs btc . ethereum has no end to smart , humble , credible spokespeople . joseph lubin started to move the ethereum story to the smart blockchain narrative . you should note that neo got there first -- though i do n't believe it matters in the long run . yesterday , lubin had this to say : much of the tweetback was brutal and the btc army voted that up . then , eth believers climbed on board and adopted the new rally cry in various versions . ",
        "some people thought it is sacrilegious to drop the `` d '' in dapps . in short ; anger and confusion reigns . i applaud lubin for having the guts to start the conversation . this is not going to be a civil debate . the nice guy will lose credibility if his story is n't perfect . it is n't . as with the gold 2.0 . analogy , there 's an obvious flaw in lubin 's app-store jab at btc . what do you call a phone that only makes phone calls ? a phone that `` only does one thing '' -- that only makes calls -- the telephone 's primary use case is a -- phone . ",
        "it 's not `` a smartphone that only runs one app '' -- it 's not `` a single app app store '' . lubin is making analogies to things that do n't exist . analogising fallacies surmounts to sarcasm . you are guaranteed to offend half the audience and confuse the other half . you are going to offend the btc half regardless ; you might as well give the eth army something to work with . in the eternal politeness that handicaps the ethereum message , lubin did not go low enough . let 's fix the analogy : bitcoin is a phone . ",
        "ethereum is a smart phone . simple . this analogy has real , accurate analogs -- let 's use them correctly . bitcoin is a global phone . bitcoin runs on an awesome global network and you can do one thing with it -- make calls to anywhere from anywhere -- i. e. use it at as currency / gold / whatever asset btc claims to disrupt this week . bitcoin does this one thing well -- less well than it used to but that 's another topic . ethereum is a smartphone . like bitcoin -- it also makes calles -- i. e. the ethereum blockchain is a store of asset value . ",
        "unlike bitcoin , you can program the ethereum blockchain to also run applications on the network using your phone 's account balance -- ` pay with your airtime ' as we say in africa . we call this smart currency , this ` airtime ' , ether on the ethereum blockchain . everybody 's happy . who am i kidding ? we are at a better understanding though : bitcoin supporters are happy that you 've acknowledged their store of value and their decentralised network . these assets and those in their forks are worth north of 70 % of the total value in crypto-assets . ",
        "teasing these investors with imperfect analogies will not break through . give btc its due -- then explain why it 's past-due . the smartphone analogy is the right one for ethereum and the other blockchains . the way lubin tells it does n't give the asset -- the cryptocurrency -- eth -- its rightful place in the ethereum story . in bitcoin 's story , the currency is everything . in ethereum 's story , eth is `` just another application . '' this leaves eth dangerously exposed and it 's why the smart money has n't doubled down on the smart currency yet . ",
