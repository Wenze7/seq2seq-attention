        "klay thompson had an off night against denver . oakland ' € `` klay thompson walked over to a small group of reporters and muttered something under his breath . ' € terrible , terrible , terrible game , ' € he said , looking at the carpet . thompson shook his head , then didn ' € ™ t make any excuses for the warriors ' € ™ 96-81 loss to the denver nuggets on saturday , in which he made only six of his 24 shots from the field , and was one-for-10 from beyond the three-point line . ",
        "did fatigue play into the loss ? ' € it ' € ™ s still early in the season , ' € he said . did the back-to-back throw you off ? ' € we ' € ™ re paid to do it , ' € he said . thompson said the defending champions lost because they weren ' € ™ t mentally there . after winning 11 straight games , they simply lost their edge . ' € i don ' € ™ t think our emotion was there or our fight as it has been in the last 11 games , ' € thompson said . ",
        "thompson kept shooting , but nothing seemed to fall . he says he ' € ™ s fought through countless slumps and never knows when he ' € ™ s going to catch fire , so usually a few misses don ' € ™ t shake him up . but he just couldn ' € ™ t get anything going this time around . ' € i hold myself to such a high standard sometimes that it can be my achilles heel , ' € thompson said . ' € i just try to relax . tonight , i don ' € ™ t think i was relaxed as i usually am . ' ",
        "€ with 5 minutes and 12 seconds left in the third quarter , draymond green tried to inspire thompson to snap out of his funk by yelling at him . thompson said he deserved it . ' € i didn ' € ™ t go after my shot when i missed it , ' € thompson said . ' € that ' € ™ s just basketball . i don ' € ™ t mind draymond getting on me . that ' € ™ s what teammates can do you if you guys trust each other . i hope he does it next time . ' ",
        "€ thompson is averaging 20.8 points on 49.3 percent shooting from the field , and 45.8 percent shooting from beyond the three-point line this season . he just had an off night , and so did the rest of his team . the warriors shot 38.6 percent from the field , and were three-for-27 from beyond the arc . kevin durant gave thompson credit for continuing to shoot even though things weren ' € ™ t going his way . ' € he never hangs his head , ' € durant said . ' € he continues to keep working on his game , gets better . ",
        "even in games , he misses shots , you see him hit that big one in the corner to kind of give us some life a bit . we were two-for-27 at the time and he was zero-for-nine , and he still shot it . that ' € ™ s just the mentality he has . and we need to have him continue to think that way . ' € thompson said he woke up saturday morning feeling great . but that ' € ™ s hardly an indicator of how he ' € ™ ll perform . ' € it ' € ™ s very unpredictable , ' € thompson said . ' ",
        "€ i can ' € ™ t tell you when i ' € ™ m going to get 60 in three quarters . i can ' € ™ t tell you when i ' € ™ m going to go six-for-25 . it happens . it ' € ™ s basketball . it ' € ™ s just about how you respond . ' € thompson knows exactly what his response will be . his shot was short . he felt it . and it likely won ' € ™ t stay that way when the warriors host cleveland on christmas . ' ",
        "€ i ' € ™ m going to make the adjustment come monday , ' € thompson said . he expects things to go a little differently when that happens . ' € hopefully i ' € ll have the exact opposite game i did tonight , ' € he said .   "
