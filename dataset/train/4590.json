        "manila - tens of thousands have been forced from their homes by a tropical storm that battered the southern philippines leaving at least 182 dead , police and aid agencies said sunday . tropical storm tembin , which triggered flash floods and mudslides as it lashed the nation 's second-largest island of mindanao , has displaced more than 70,000 people , said the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies . `` people left everything behind when they fled for their lives , '' the ifrc 's philippines operations and programmes manager patrick elliott said in a statement . ",
        "the philippines is pummelled by 20 major storms each year on average , many of them deadly . but mindanao , home to 20 million people , is rarely hit . police said 153 people were still missing and more than 40,000 had fled to evacuation camps as tembin , which slammed into the island on friday , continued westwards . police , soldiers and volunteers used shovels to dig through mud and debris as they searched for bodies in the village of dalama on saturday . `` the river rose and most of the homes were swept away . ",
        "the village is no longer there , '' police officer gerry parami told afp by telephone from nearby tubod town in lanao del norte , one of the provinces hardest hit by tembin . local police said 127 people have been confirmed dead in the province , with 72 missing , as rescuers pulled dozens of bodies from the swollen salog river near the town of sapad . the bodies had been swept downriver from a flooded town upstream called salvador , rando salvacion , the sapad town police chief , told afp . authorities in salvador said other bodies were retrieved upstream . ",
        "`` the people received ample warnings . but as we are rarely hit by typhoons , people living near rivers did not take them seriously , '' salvador police chief wilson mislores told afp . - ` unfortunate ' so near christmas - the death toll for mindanao 's zamboanga peninsula also rose to 28 , and police said 81 people were missing after mud and rocks swept down coastal communities in sibuco and other fishing towns . landslides had blocked rescue and relief convoys to the impoverished region , officials said saturday . one man was killed by a crocodile while he was securing his boat as the storm closed in this week on the western island of palawan , a police report said saturday . ",
        "the storm hit balabac , a fishing island of 40,000 people in the western philippines , on saturday afternoon with gusts of 145 kilometres an hour , the state weather service said . tembin struck less than a week after tropical storm kai-tak left 54 dead and 24 missing in the central philippines , straining the disaster-prone nation 's resources . `` it is unfortunate that another tropical cyclone ... made its presence felt so near christmas , '' harry roque , president rodrigo duterte 's spokesman , said in a statement . roque vowed continued government aid to the affected communities , but romina marasigan , spokeswoman for the national disaster risk reduction and management council , described the situation as `` challenging '' . ",
        "the deadliest typhoon to hit the country was haiyan , which killed thousands and destroyed entire towns in heavily populated areas of the central philippines in november 2013 .   "
