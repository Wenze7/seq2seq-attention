        "retailer outlines five-year aim to replace all plastic packaging with trays made of paper and pulp @nicola_slawson share on facebook share on twitter share via email share on linkedin share on pinterest share on google + share on whatsapp share on messenger iceland has become the first major retailer to commit to eliminate plastic packaging for all its own-brand products . the supermarket chain , which specialises in frozen food , said it would go plastic-free within five years to help end the `` scourge '' of plastic pollution . the current plastic packaging would be replaced with paper and pulp trays and paper bags , which would be recyclable through domestic waste collections or in-store recycling facilities . ",
        "the supermarket recently carried out a survey in which 80 % of 5,000 people polled said they would endorse the move to go plastic-free . iceland managing director , richard walker , said : `` the world has woken up to the scourge of plastics . a truckload is entering our oceans every minute , causing untold damage to our marine environment and ultimately humanity -- since we all depend on the oceans for our survival . `` the onus is on retailers , as leading contributors to plastic packaging pollution and waste , to take a stand and deliver meaningful change . '' ",
        "he also said iceland would ensure all packaging was fully recyclable and would be recycled , through support for initiatives such as a bottle deposit return scheme for plastic bottles . as it was technologically and practically possible to create less environmentally harmful alternatives , `` there really is no excuse any more for excessive packaging that creates needless waste and damages our environment '' , walker added . iceland has already removed plastic disposable straws from its own label range and new food ranges in the next few months will use paper-based food trays . the move , which has been welcomed by environmental campaigners , comes amid growing concern over plastic pollution in the world 's oceans , where it can harm and kill wildlife such as turtles and seabirds . ",
        "greenpeace uk executive director john sauven , called the announcement a `` bold pledge '' and that it was `` now up to other retailers and food producers to respond to that challenge '' . last week , theresa may pledged to eliminate all avoidable plastic waste within 25 years as part of the government 's environmental strategy . the prime minister promised to extend the successful 5p levy on plastic bags to smaller shops , as well as exploring a potential charge on single-use plastic containers such as takeaway boxes . other initiatives include a plan to urge supermarkets to introduce aisles without any plastic packaging , where all food is sold loose , along with new research funding for `` plastics innovation '' and aid to help developing nations deal with their plastic waste . ",
        "samantha harding , from the campaign to protect rural england , said : `` iceland are steadfastly laying the path that all supermarkets should be following . `` alongside its support for a deposit return system , iceland 's commitment to go plastic-free by 2023 shows that powerful retailers can take decisive action to provide what their customers want , without the environment paying for it .
