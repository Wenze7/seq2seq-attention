        "`` somebody said to me , ` but the beatles were anti-materialistic . ' that 's a huge myth . john and i literally used to sit down and say , ` now , let 's write a swimming pool . '' -- paul mccartneytoday i want to talk about money and art -- two beautiful topics that are rarely used in the same sentence . society has the misconception that you ca n't have both . that a rich business individual ca n't be creative , and that a talented creative ca n't be rich . it 's a misconception that i know to be a misconception because i have built a business around utilizing both . ",
        "i own an agency called honey copy , where i work as a creative copywriter helping technology startups make more money through compelling words . last month for example , i wrote a sales page for an awesome luggage company called samsara which has since generated $ 40,000 in capital . that 's not just art ... that 's about two swimming pools `` if it does n't sell , it is n't creative . '' -- david ogilvyfor a while , i allowed creative critics to dictate what i really wanted to pursue -- advertising . i felt guilty meshing creativity with money . ",
        "and to be honest , there is a part of me that still questions whether or not i am `` selling out '' . but , after stumbling upon a story about paul mccartney and john lennon , and one of their approaches to writing music , i have n't looked back . while not everyone loves the beatles , nobody can argue that they were n't true artists -- yet even they got giddy over the idea of writing a hit that could build them a swimming pool . no , i am not comparing my copywriting to the writing abilities of paul and john , but i am saying there is a major element of money in regards to art ... and i would argue that these elements propel art further . ",
        "what i love about advertising and marketing is that it forces artists to not only be creative , but to be effectively creative . i think david ogilvy said it best with his infamous cut-throat quote , `` if it does n't sell , it is n't creative . '' while i would n't say that all of an artist 's worth should be measured in dollar signs ... i certainly get where ogilvy is coming from . in advertising , your job is to write swimming pools for your clients ... if you are n't making that happen ... then you 're not being creative enough .
