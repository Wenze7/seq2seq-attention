        "in the past few weeks there has been a steady stream of rumors and leaks regarding the samsung foldable galaxy x . it would be the first of its kind to hit market , and apparently samsung has brought to phone to ces 2018 expo to show off to interested parties . image source : lets go digitalthis actually is n't the first ces where we 've seen a samsung foldable galaxy x , but industry insiders have claimed that the phone is `` almost finished '' -- at least in terms of hardware -- and may be ready for mass production this november . ",
        "a november production schedule means that we may not see the samsung foldable galaxy x until 2019 , but a late 2018 release is also still possible . at ces , both infolding and outfolding prototypes were debuted , but sources suggest that the retail version of the samsung foldable galaxy x will be the infolding model , due to the increased durability requirements of an outfolding design that may require further research and development before the technology makes it to a consumer phone . the investor reports that the screen size will be a huge 7.3-inches when fully unfolded , which will allow users to watch their favorite videos on netflix or hulu and then snap the device shut when it 's time to hit the road .

        "`` samsung attracted more clients to the private meeting compared to last year . the phone development seems to be almost finished , raising expectations for the phone launch , '' said a source present at the ces meeting that took place on january 10 . image source : lets go digitala potential win for samsungwhile samsung phones have largely been a major success , their phones have started to become largely iterative . while each phone is a clear upgrade over its predecessor , there have n't been any truly groundbreaking advancements in quite some time . when compared to the iphone x with the innovative face id technology , it 's a little disappointing that most galaxy releases seem to be simple power bumps that do n't really bring anything new to the table . ",
        "a samsung foldable galaxy x may be just what the company needs to establish themselves as an industry innovator once again . sources suggest that the galaxy x will be separate from the main s and note lineups , indicating that the company expects it to be a niche product -- at least at first . like any new groundbreaking technology , adoption at its first launch may be limited . proving to users that a samsung foldable galaxy x is a trailblazer and the phone of the future rather than a neat gimmick may be a bit of a battle for the korean tech giant . ",
        "as a stark departure from any phone they 've made before , they may have trouble convincing users to purchase their foldable phone over their more traditional alternatives . another thing to keep in mind is that the price of the samsung foldable galaxy x may be on the high side . we anticipate that it will priced at the top end of luxury phone prices due to the innovative technology that is no-doubt difficult and expensive to develop and implement . this may limit the market that can purchase the phone -- especially in countries where leasing phones is n't commonplace . ",
        "samsung foldable galaxy x : what we knowdespite this recent reveal and a series of rumors and leaks , we 're still left in the dark for the most part when it comes to the features of the samsung foldable galaxy x -- especially since we have n't gotten much at all from samsung other than some patents that have been pulled up by various websites . recent patent images included below seem to confirm a large phone with an infolding design , however . the main draw to the samsung foldable galaxy x will be the flexible screen , of course , but we also anticipate some pretty beefy specifications . ",
        "as a high-end phone from samsung , the galaxy x wo n't be hurting for power , and it needs some impressive specifications to warrant a high price tag -- as the foldable screen may not be enough to drive high sales . if the foldable screen truly makes it to market at the end of 2018 or early 2019 , it will be the first tech of its kind to be included in a consumer smartphone . the device may very well have solved the problem of capped-out phone sizes , adding extra screen space when needed while also remaining compact enough to use comfortably as a regular handset . ",
        "many flagships are already difficult to hold with one hand , so adding a bigger screen in traditional ways is n't feasible if people are to fit their phones in their pockets . it will likely be some time before we get a closer look at the samsung foldable galaxy x , but what we 've seen so far has us excited for a future of flexible screens . whether this technology remains niche or becomes part of the mainstream remains to be seen , but we 're certainly hoping for the latter . the post samsung foldable galaxy x makes appearance at ces 2018 appeared first on valuewalk .
