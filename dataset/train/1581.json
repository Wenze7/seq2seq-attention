        "everton continue their premier league campaign on monday evening as swansea city head to goodison park . the blues will be keen to continue to their revival under sam allardyce and build on the midweek win over newcastle . the swans , meanwhile , are desperate for a win as they look to get themselves off the bottom of the premier league table . we reached out to an old friend of the site steven , the managing editor of swansea oh swansea to get the lowdown on the swans ' season so far . swansea currently sit bottom of the premier league , is there a real danger of them getting relegated or can they turn things around ? ",
        "yes we 're in big trouble . i do n't see enough quality to get us out of the drop zone this time . we will need to spend big in key positions to have a chance . a big problem has been the lack of goals , with just nine in the league so far . is it simply a case of not replacing gylfi sigurdsson and fernando llorente or is the problem greater than that ? that 's part of it yes , gylfi was n't replaced which was ridiculous considering he was a huge player for us . ",
        "up front we have two decent strikers in bony and abraham but this manager is so cautious . he plays for draws ; we have n't scored in 10 of our games and have n't even had a shot in target in 4 . completely unacceptable . speaking of gylfi sigurdsson , he will be facing his old side for the first time . what kind of reception is he likely to receive ? probably not a great one , after he refused to travel to usa for the preseason tour the fans were not happy . he was probably badly advised . ",
        "i did n't really blame him wanting to leave , in his shoes i would have gone . we sell our best players and replace them with ones not as good . must have been frustrating to watch as a player . while we 're on the subject of the summer transfer window , what on earth is going on with renato sanches ? it 's not working at all , we 're playing badly which does n't help and i see him as a bit of a luxury , if we were playing well he 'd probably be good . ",
        "if not he 'll probably be our worst player . but then again , this manager gives no one confidence so that does n't help either . finally , paul clement is currently the second favourite for the sack , is there a chance of it happening ? or does he deserve more time to turn things around after righting the ship last season ? he 'd be out already if i was calling the shots . awful , boring , negative football . still does n't know his best 11 and formation . blames everyone but himself . he should be out by now , the board are a bigger issue than him but he really is n't helping . ",
        "our thanks to steven , and here 's wishing the swans all the very best for the rest of the season . do n't forget to check out swansea oh swansea for more insightful fan perspectives on the swans .   "
