        "corporations are setting a dangerous new precedentthis article originally appeared on alternet . in this insane post-truth world of ours , it 's become increasingly hard to separate fact from fiction . as a result , we 've got presidents who comfortably refute scientific thought , and legitimate media sources categorized as `` fake news . '' the problem boils down to profit , and the old clich√©d formula `` money equals power . '' need another example ? look no further than the current legal war being waged against environmental activists . the standoff over the controversial dakota access pipeline made national headlines earlier this year . ",
        "in large part , this was thanks to grassroots organizations working together with larger environmental advocacy groups . because of these efforts , millions of people were made aware of the potential hazards of this project , which helped bring construction of the pipeline to a temporary standstill . in other words , these actions had an impact . the protests proved so effective in fact , oil companies have started to pursue their own strategy for countering this sort of activism : litigation . this past august , energy transfer partners , the company responsible for the dakota pipeline , filed a suit against greenpeace , banktrack and earth first ! ",
        ". under the auspices of rico -- a federal conspiracy law geared toward clamping down on racketeering -- the suit alleges that these groups were involved in an illegal `` enterprise '' aimed at furthering their interests at the expense of the company . adding further insult to injury , the suit also claims that greenpeace and the others violated the terms of the patriot act by supporting acts of eco-terrorism and drug trafficking . michael gerrard , a faculty director of climate change law at columbia university , recently told insideclimate news reporter nicholas kusnetz that `` the energy transfer partners lawsuit against greenpeace is perhaps the most aggressive slapp-type suit '' he had ever seen . ",
        "referring here to a legal acronym for lawsuits that attempt to silence political advocacy , gerrard added that the `` the paper practically bursts into flames in your hands . `` what is even more concerning about gerrard 's assessment is that this is n't the first rico suit recently filed against greenpeace . last may it happened courtesy of resolute forest products , a canadian logging and paper company . issued against greenpeace and another group named stand , the lawsuit alleged that these organizations -- which have opposed resolute 's logging activities in canada 's boreal forest for years -- were conspiring to extort the company 's customers and defraud its donors . ",
        "`` maximizing donations , not saving the environment , is greenpeace 's true objective , '' read the official complaint issued by the same legal team who represent the current litigator-in-chief , donald trump . the complaint goes on to note that the environmental awareness campaigns aimed at groups such as resolute are based on `` sensational misinformation untethered to facts or science '' with the sole intention of inducing emotion and prompting donations to the ngo . using this reasoning , the suit claims that the group 's campaign emails and tweets constitute wire fraud . as for `` sensational misinformation , '' in 2012 greenpeace canada released a report claiming that the logging company was operating in a protected section of the boreal forest . ",
        "this claim turned out to be false and greenpeace issued an apology and retracted its material on the matter . does this instance actually constitute a damning claim of racketeering ? as carroll muffett , president of the center for international environmental law explained to kusnetz , that may not even matter . `` as an ngo , that is a deeply chilling argument , '' said muffett , whose organization together with eight other groups filed a counter civil action in support of dismissing resolute 's case . for muffett , the fact that rico has been used more than once against greenpeace means a dangerous precedent has been set . ",
        "`` this was precisely what we were concerned we would see , '' she added , referring to the dakota lawsuit that lumps dozens more organizations in with greenpeace . by referring to anyone involved in the protests as co-conspirators , muffett explained , this suit could serve as a major deterrent for similar actions in the future . `` those groups will be looking at this and trying to decide on how to respond and what it means for their campaigns going forward , '' she said , `` not only on dakota access but other campaigns as well . ",
        "and that is , in all likelihood , a core strategy of a case like this . `` beyond greenpeace , a number of other lawsuits have been filed in the past year against vocal critics . both the new york times and john oliver 's `` last week tonight , '' for instance , got slammed with libel claims by murray energy corp. . after reporting on the ohio-based coal company 's business practices . another lawsuit was filed in august by pennsylvania 's cabot oil & gas corp. . against a resident who accused the company of polluting residential water wells . ",
        "joshua galperin , head of yale law school 's environmental protection clinic , explained to kusnetz the highly political nature of this disturbing trend . `` they can change the tenor of the debate , '' galperin said , referring specifically to the lawsuits against greenpeace that equate activism with racketeering . pointing to the stance of the current administration , galperin added , `` now would n't be a bad time to try these aggressive tactics , unfortunately . `` another damaging aspect of these lawsuits is the effect they could potentially have on the protest strategies used by groups such as greenpeace . ",
        "central to the success of greenpeace has been their `` high-profile antics '' writes kusnetz , who lists as examples the time the group `` sent protesters dressed as chickens to mcdonald 's franchises in london to protest logging in the amazon , deftly mimicked a dove soap public service announcement in canada to link its parent company , unilever , to deforestation in indonesia , and dropped banners across the front of procter & gamble 's corporate headquarters for its sourcing of palm oil . `` the energy transfer partners lawsuit explicitly refers to these tactics as the `` greenpeace model . '' ",
        "by creating a legal grounding for how this model equates to a form of racketeering , these suits could greatly undermine the efficacy of this strategy in the future . `` i do n't think it 's really about the money , '' tom wetterer , greenpeace 's general counsel , told kusnetz . `` i think they have to realize that their claims are not strong , that it 's the process that they 're really focused on , regardless of the end . it 's really a means to drag us through the legal process .
