        "things are looking up on the culinary side of things for melrose avenue , with a slew of recent and soon-to-come openings landing in 2018 . among them is stuff 'd , a new organic dumpling spot landing in the former short-lived ammo takeaway location . stuff 'd will operate as a fast casual , mostly takeaway option for buzzy melrose avenue , working a menu of pan-regional dumplings for all to enjoy . there will be traditional options from china , taiwan , and russia , as well as room for things like black miso cod dumplings and even sweetened dessert dumplings . ",
        "as for the space , look for some limited seating both inside and out , but with a small footprint there 's also going to be a focus on takeaway and likely delivery for the neighborhood . look for an opening sometime in mid-to-late february . meanwhile , the rest of melrose avenue continues to heat up with action . the recently-opened coffee for sasquatch is already packed with regulars daily , while just across la brea milk bar is preparing for an early 2018 arrival and further down options like alta and blackbird are offering something new for the area .
