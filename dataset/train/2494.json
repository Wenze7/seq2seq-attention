        "bitcoin alternatives are closing the gap with the market leader after names like stellar and cardano became red hot as 2017 was closing . the biggest cryptocurrency 's share of market value has fallen to about 37 percent from 56 percent a month ago , according to coinmarketcap prices for coins and tokens . stellar , designed for cross-border payments , has more than doubled in the first trading days of this year , achieving a record market cap of more than $ 13 billion . that kind of move raises questions as to whether speculators will drive up second-tier digital coins at the expense of bitcoin , even though they have different purposes . ",
        "the paper value of all cryptocurrencies combined has more than doubled to almost $ 700 billion in the past month . `` the altcoins today , in large part , are not trying to be bitcoin competitors , '' said lex sokolin , global director of fintech strategy at autonomous research llp in london . `` they are doing something else entirely -- ethereum as a smart-contracts platform , iota as a machine-economy token , ripple for interbank payments , and so on . '' how each is used `` should become increasingly relevant as the novelty of crypto wears off . '' ",
        "relative performance is now a multibillion-dollar question as professional investors search for ways to value digital assets that seem to defy traditional techniques , such as profit and dividend potential for equities , or industrial-demand outlooks for commodities . correlation , for example , is one of many technical-analysis tools used across asset classes in forecasting , and altcoins historically have moved mostly in step with bitcoin . while there were many periods of disparity , on balance the group rose or fell together , a bloomberg survey of more than 5,000 data points show from coinmarketcap and coincap prices . ",
        "with bitcoin rivals now making bigger gains , it matters more whether the group continues moving mostly in sync -- as they largely have done ever since the early days when enthusiasts were mostly computer programmers and libertarians . while naysayers insist the crypto market has many signs of a bubble , speculating has been promising for many who bought second-tier coins . ethereum , the second-largest by market value , has roughly tripled in the last two months . cardano is up more than 40-fold in the period . that compares with an approximate doubling for bitcoin , which went more mainstream in december by sporting its first u. s. futures contracts . ",
        "the technical shortcomings of bitcoin signal its benchmark status may be taken away someday by a second-generation rival , according to mike mcglone , a commodity strategist at bloomberg industries who likens the market to internet-based companies a few decades ago . `` when the frenzy subsides , 2gs should continue to gain on bitcoin , which has flaws and where futures can be shorted , '' mcglone wrote in a note last week . `` ethereum appears prime to assume benchmark status , though bitcoin forks ripple and litecoin are the primary up-and-coming contenders . '' with a $ 216 billion market value on dec. . ",
        "31 , bitcoin was often the first stop -- and maybe the last -- for investors who then maybe dabbled in smaller , more volatile tokens . a surge in investor interest typically benefits the smallest more , simply because they have smaller market values , said spencer bogart , a partner at blockchain capital llc in san francisco . `` this goes both directions though : often when crypto markets are falling you see a rotation out of the long-tail of crypto assets and into bitcoin , the ` king of crypto , ' which is rightfully perceived to have the most staying power in the ecosystem , '' bogart said . ",
        "crypto party . as the crypto party grew bigger , the crashers -- blue-suited investors and hedge funds -- have purchased mostly bitcoin , and they have different buying criteria than early converts who may have moved on to less-liquid units like dash or monero , according to industry observers . the diluted investor base may weaken the yoke to bitcoin , the biggest by market value , they say . `` the capital base of these markets is evolving rapidly , '' said kyle samani , managing partner of multicoin capital , a digital-asset hedge fund in texas . ",
        "`` before the recent bitcoin bull run , the investor base in crypto was mostly engineers , nerds , and libertarians . '' in the u. s. , samani of multicoin capital says he sees a division between what 's on offer at the popular coinbase exchange , and everything else . `` most retail investors are only buying assets available on coinbase , '' he said . `` we should continue to see a decoupling between what 's on coinbase versus other altcoins .
