        "in april , canadian singer-songwriter neil young announced that he was shifting gears on his high-fidelity audio project , pono . what began as a music player and online music store would become a high-quality streaming service , xstream . this week , young not only released his thirty-ninth studio album , the visitor , he also launched the neil young archive , a site that contains almost his entire back catalog using the service , which visitors can listen to in a high quality format . young has decried the relatively low quality that most music is available in for digital audiences . ",
        "in 2012 , he told walt mossberg and peter kafka at d : dive into media that he was concerned about the quality of mp3 , and hoped that better devices would come to market that would bring allow audiences to listen to music the way it was meant to be heard . in 2014 , he put his money where his mouth was and kickstarted a music player called pono , and later launched an accompanying music store . he later pulled his entire catalog from the various streaming services out there , saying that he was frustrated by the low quality : `` i do n't need my music to be devalued by the worst quality in the history of broadcasting or any other form of distribution . '' ",
        "you can now listen to nearly all of his back catalog , for free , at least through june 30th , after which users can subscribe `` at a very modest cost , '' according to my welcome e-mail . the archive , young says , was developed `` to provide fans and music historians with unprecedented access to all of my music and to my entire archives in one convenient location , '' and is available via the high-quality streaming streaming service he announced earlier this year . in april , he said that xstream would be an `` adaptive streaming service that changes with available bandwidth , '' and the site will automatically adjust the streaming rate based on a user 's connection , according to the audio set up section on the site . ",
        "the quality will go from an mp3 quality all the way up to 192khz/24-bit high resolution , while the music files themselves are of master quality . the site will display the quality while you listen , and users can toggle between 320kbps or master resolution if they wish . listeners can browse through the site as a filing cabinet or as a timeline , starting with his 1963 song aurora from his first act , the squires , and going all the way up to his latest release , the visitor . each section is accompanied by additional material : scans of the sheet music , press clippings , and pictures . ",
        "not everything can be streamed : some of his work with buffalo springfield , such as `` for what it 's worth '' , and several unreleased albums are n't available to stream . the site 's faq also says that more material will be regularly added . while the site is n't exactly the most intuitive -- young recorded a 10-minute tutorial video to explain how to use the site -- and it is n't available on your mobile phone , it 's a fascinating , deep dive into a vast body of work , one that goes far beyond your typical artist homepage . ",
        "it showcases not only more than a half-century of music , but lets you listen the way that it was intended to be heard in the first place . i respect him as an artist . 24/192 is selling snake oil . there 's absolutely no benefit in using anything higher than 16/44 for listening . 4k is also snakeoil marketing for quite a lot of people who wo n't sit close enough to notice the ppi density , but , `` durrr ... . bigger number better . '' by farrellj . on 12.03.17 1:00 pm . with 4k , you can sit closer or increase screen size , either of which legitimately benefits from higher resolution . ",
        "with high end audio , there 's a similar argument to be made as you get better equipment . at the end of the day , though , i have no idea whether 16/44 is just as good as 24/192 . i do n't think i own equipment that could reveal the difference , even i could hear it . by goodtroll . on 12.03.17 7:32 pm . why not link to the service ? by vaneynde . on 12.03.17 4:14 pm . put his money where his mouth was and kickstarted ... i think you meant to say `` put other people 's money where his mouth was ...
