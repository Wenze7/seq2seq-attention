        "you read `` cat person . '' you were confused about whether there are actually cats in it or not . you debated the short story , which went viral last week , with your friends . you read the responses . you thought about the bad sex you 'd had , or considered having . you resolved never to go out with someone who joked about murdering you . and it looks like you 'll soon be able to read a whole book of stories just like it . kristen roupenian , who wrote the buzzy story , has sold her debut collection of short stories , you know you want this , in the uk for `` a high five-figure sum . '' ",
        "according to the guardian , the collection is also the subject of a frenzied auction in the united states , which has hit the $ 1 million mark . roupenian 's depiction of a courtship via texts , the awkward subsequent irl interactions , and a decidedly ambivalent sexual encounter seized attention online ; many readers related to the young female protagonist 's experience . the author told the new yorker , where `` cat person '' was also originally published , that the story was based on a real-life event : `` i was shocked by the way this person treated me , and then immediately surprised by my own shock . '' ",
        "given the huge public response to the story and the heated industry interest , roupenian 's book is likely to be one of the most anticipated released in the literary calendar . in the meantime , if she would like to design a t-shirt that says , `` this is the worst life decision i have ever made ! '' i would immediately put in a bulk order . just saying !   "
