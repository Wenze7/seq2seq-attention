        "what happens when former employees of google , tesla , and uber get together ? they found aurora , an autonomous car startup that is now being courted by volkswagen and hyundai . the two automakers and the tech company have come together with the goal of putting autonomous vehicles on the road in three years `` quickly , broadly , and safely . '' as part of the agreement , aurora will develop the sensors for both automakers that use the company 's artificial intelligence in an effort to produce millions of cars every year . hyundai expects to have self-driving cars available by 2021 , and volkswagen sees autonomous vehicles as part of the `` reinvention of mobility '' in the coming years . ",
        "aurora certainly has a leg up on the business . the company founders each led previous av efforts . ceo chris urmson was the cto at alphabet , chief technical officer drew bagnell helped found uber 's advanced technology center , and chief product officer sterling anderson directed tesla 's autopilot program . aurora 's goal is to develop `` fully self-driving pods , shuttles or delivery vans as well as self-driving trucks without a cabin ... '' urmson said . the goal of creating both public and private transportation tracks side by side is intentional .   ",
        "according to volkswagen chief digital officer johann jungwirth : `` in the future , we anticipate that people will be able to use our mobility app or digital virtual assistant to hail a self-driving electric vehicle to drive them conveniently door-to-door , or use our volkswagen onebutton which has gps , connectivity and a compass , as a small beautiful key fob with maximum convenience ... '' the automakers ' main goal in this cooperative effort is to leapfrog ahead in their current autonomous research , getting well beyond the need to have a `` driver '' monitoring the vehicle at all times , especially on streets and highways .",
        "the goal is at least level 4 on the society of automotive engineer 's chart , a level which describes vehicles that not only steer , brake and accelerate properly but also respond to other conditions , even when the driver fails to do so . it 's one thing to develop the technology , but these companies will also have to generate consumer buy-in . right now , fully automated vehicles feel a bit too much like science fiction to too many people . they do n't yet trust that vehicles can have this much sophistication in their controls . ",
        "that perception will have to change if the automakers want to have a receptive audience when the time comes to put their vehicles on the market . as of now , that winning narrative is on the clock . ronn torossian is the founder and ceo of the new york based public relations firm 5wpr : one of the 20 largest pr firms in the united states .
