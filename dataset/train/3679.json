        "retail colocation may be the right fit if you need a small space for a limited period of time and do n't have the requirement to go for a bigger and better one . it is also the right choice if you do n't have the time or the required personnel to take care of it . on the other hand , wholesale colocation may just do the job for you if you need a lot of space and require more than one megawatt of power . size is just one of the many factors that come into play while choosing the right data center for the enterprise .

        "retail providers are a good option for small customers who require less power and a small space . • autonomy : autonomy is another important issue that needs to be taken care of when opting for a data center . customers opt for wholesale as they want to have complete control on the infrastructure in place . they have all the resources at their disposal to take care of their equipments and space . • amount of cash required : the amount of cash required is also an important consideration while opting for the right data center . if there 's a need to keep the investment factor down and go for a smaller environment , then retail is an ideal deal for you . ",
        "whereas , wholesale requires a much bigger sum of money to buy the space and build your own footprint . wholesale vs retail data centers .   "
