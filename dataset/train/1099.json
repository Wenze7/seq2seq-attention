        "pakistan will continue to use the rupee domestically , according to iqbal . the ltp includes cooperation between the countries in energy , information network infrastructure , road and rail connections , trade and industrial parks , tourism , agriculture , and poverty alleviation . the plan will be implemented in three phases , the first ending in 2020 , followed by another in 2025 , with completion in 2030 . under the plan , the countries intend to develop multi-level cooperation and strengthen policy coordination , as well as establish and improve the cross-border credit system and financial services .
