        "big things have small beginnings , and south korean 3d and gaming software firm minkonet 's delivery of 3d replay technology to global gaming smash hit playerunknown 's battlegrounds seems to be just that . pubg is , of course , already a global phenomenon . an online `` battle royale '' game , it throws teams of players onto an island to kill each other , with the last surviving team winning . the game launched in steam early access in march , and has since garnered 30 million players . minkonet is now offering 3d replay and death cam features for the game , with the former allowing players to record everything around them in a 1-kilometre radius . ",
        "the recorded replay can then be viewed from any angle , observed from other players ' views , and seen in slow motion . the latter feature provides a 20-second recording following a player 's death . the reaction from the gaming community has been enthusiastic , and many have caught on to what 3d replay brings . in south korea , where the game is published by kakao games , many are welcoming the feature as an anti-cheat tool , and many are posting recordings of their gameplay , edited in multiple angles like a mini movie . here are some of the things this kind of technology will revolutionise , even beyond pubg .

        "video content revolution that videos are the future of media is no secret , especially in streaming and sharing . take , for example , youtube . it has more than 1.5 billion users watching an average of 60 minutes of videos every day . in october , ceo sundar pichai said the platform was clocking 100 million hours of watch time on living room devices every single day . taking the cue , samsung has already repositioned its smart tvs as content hubs . gaming videos are a big part of that . warner brothers ' acquisition of machinima , a digital studio focused on gaming , for an alleged $ 100 million , shows how lucrative this niche is . ",
        "sharing and streaming videos in gaming is crucial , as players want insight and learning opportunities from other players , and also just the pure fun of watching them -- hence , esports . the appetite to share and stream videos on facebook , twitch , and youtube is only growing . but the market has also matured , and advances in technology , hardware , software , and network speed are making people demand more than cute cat videos ; they want high-quality , sophisticated content . enter 3d , virtual reality , augmented reality , mixed realities , and cross-platforms . ",
        "new techs like 3d , vr , and ar have been much talked about , but widespread applications previously seemed far off . i have seen some interesting applications , such as gear vr on legoland 's roller coaster , but none of these really offered fundamental changes or had a wide reach for industries until minkonet 's 3d replay . simply put , the 3d feature on pubg sets a new standard of replay in the gaming industry . players can basically churn out their own mini movies or montages of the recorded replay using the feature 's wide option of angles and editing tools . ",
        "after toying with it for a few hours , i found the experience as engaging as the gameplay itself . i wish the 1-kilometre radius was even wider , and i 'm confident that this empowering feature will engage players further , and have them wanting more . backed by pubg 's 30 million players and more in the same genre , we will likely see increasing numbers of interactive videos being shared , especially frag movies on gaming channels on social media . outside of gaming , we may also see more kinds of videos , so-called cross-platforms , which marry different mediums . ",
        "advertisements will , of course , follow ; there is a reason why facebook is taking the long view with vr . epic games -- the owner of the unreal engine that is needed for all shooting games , and which publishes fortnite battle royale , pubg 's main competitor -- and other industry giants do n't yet have a matching feature , but i am sure they will have no choice but to get on the bandwagon . `` our multi-camera technology is designed by gamers to ensure optimal design for capturing the most epic , sharable moments . ",
        "based on the tremendous response already received in the market , we estimate our technology will inspire at least 1 million hours per day of gaming video content in the coming year , '' minkonet co-founder and ceo peter kim said . an end to cheating ? in the beginning , there were video games . then came cheating . cheating has been a perennial , serious problem for the gaming industry as a whole ; rampant hacking in games can shorten their lifespan , and developers are heavily pressured to catch them . the malpractice is enough to have game publishers file multimillion-dollar lawsuits against alleged hackers . ",
        "pubg is no exception , and has suffered its share of hacking . a simple search of `` pubg hack '' on google brings out numerous results that offer players blatant hacking tools . 3d replay seems a practical , fundamental way to prevent hacking . as it offers the view of other players , users can simply view the player who killed them to make sure there was no foul play . death cam then captures that exact moment . will it curb hacking for good ? of course not . but 3d replay and death cam are innovative in that they allow players to police themselves and give immediate proof via recording . ",
        "by being able to view the entire gameplay , and not just the last 10 or so seconds as in other games , one can track the entirety of the cheater 's moves . there will be no way around for hackers who are caught red handed . for online and competitive games , then , 3d replay could serve as a new policing tool that could potentially save millions of dollars that game developers are forced to spend on anti-hack measures , and could instead be spent on improving gameplay and content . the inclusion of new technologies like 3d replay will not only make esports more exciting and profitable ; they will also change the way we consume digital content .

        "` digitisation ' of esportslast year in march , intel surprised by announcing a reported $ 175 million deal to buy israel-based startup replay technologies , which offers 3d and 360-degree video for sporting events . the tremendous live sport market is already embracing 360-degree viewing to `` digitise '' their offerings . ironically , esports broadcasting remains , frankly , two dimensional . digitisation is long overdue , but can now be achieved more easily through technologies like those provided by minkonet : the replay technology provided to pubg can be easily emulated to offer practically endless camera angles during live game feeds in contests , in comparison to the 20 to 30 physical cameras required at live sporting events . ",
        "esports has remained small compared to live sports , but it is showing exceptional growth -- according to newzoo , the market will be worth almost $ 1.5 billion in 2020 , over double that of this year 's $ 696 million . the south korean firm has its own proprietary data-recording technology ; it can upload data in ultra-small packets and stream them in any resolution and format required for any device , including 4k , which means it can basically handle any uptake in current hardware or massive data required for live broadcasting esports on the big screen . ",
        "placement of advertisements have proven a challenge as well , but technology like in-game native ads , with the advancement of software and hardware , will only grow to give additional incentive for advertisers . in all , as more and more games like pubg adopt 360-degree viewing , advertisers may find new revenue streams in esports while die-hard fans will finally get the viewing experience they deserve . related coveragevideo : how gaming pushes business technology innovation to solve complex saas , cybersecurity , and monetization challenges cloud-based enterprise companies should turn to game developers for inspiration , says crowfall co-founder j. todd coleman .
