        "our team conducted some research surrounding the percentage of women working in the stem field . we were shocked by the lack of female participation in technical fields . men overpower the field and women are discouraged from joining . they are intimidated by the staggering difference in the number of men and women . this leads to a big lack in ideas and creativity from women who tend to suppress their thoughts during meetings . some statistics are shown here : out of all the available jobs surrounding mechanical engineering , only 7.9 % are occupied by women . ",
        "only 11.1 % of physicists and astronomers are womenwomen make up only 22.7 % of the chemical engineering fieldthis is an excerpt from the results of a survey we took regarding the representation of women in the stem fields : statistics also prove that women who take up leading positions help improve a company 's overall revenue . for example , women leading fortune 500 companies help improve return in equity , sales , and invested capital greatly . even with this , women do not get enough support to shine in their field of work . the fast company published an article that showed that women tend to quit their jobs when they reach their mid-ages because they do not receive enough encouragement or help . ",
        "it is critical that we do everything in our power to inspire women to join stem fields . every company would benefit from the input provided by females as it presents an alternative perspective on the topic . all the bright women in the world deserve to make use of their talents .   "
