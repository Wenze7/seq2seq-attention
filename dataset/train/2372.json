        "connecticut 's economy closed out 2017 on a postive note , adding 6,000 jobs in december , officials with the state department of labor said monday . the increase in employment last month , when compared december 2016 , resulted in connecticut adding just 7,700 jobs over the entirety of 2017 . state labor officials said november employment data , which initially had showed connecticut losing 3,500 jobs , was revised to a loss of 1,800 jobs for the month . `` this is actually better than the 5,000 average annual growth seen in 2016 , '' andy condon , director of the state agency 's office of research , said in a statement . ",
        "`` also noteworthy is the annual growth in the strategic manufacturing sector which has not seen an employment increase since 2010 and before that in 1997 . '' connecticut 's unemployment rate remained unchanged in december at 4.6 percent . the national unemployment rate is at 4.1 percent . pete gioia , an economist with the connecticut business & industry association , said monday 's employment report `` is the first good news we 've gotten in a long while . '' `` if those numbers hold up when the final report comes out in march , it will be a stark change from where we ended up in 2016 , losing 200 jobs , '' gioia said in a statement . ",
        "`` manufacturing , which has struggled to gain jobs in at least 30 years , ended up adding 4,100 jobs year-over-year . '' donald klepper-smith , chief economist and director of research for new haven-based datacore partners , was less enthusiastic about december 's employment numbers for the state , calling the data a `` welcome reprieve given job losses in four of the last six months . '' `` nothing has fundamentally changed with the state 's labor markets , '' klepper-smith said . `` the broad aggregate comprehensive data indicates that labor markets are still soft , losing 7,600 jobs since june 2017 with connecticut being the only new england state that has yet to realize full job recovery . ",
        "we 're still lying at the edge of recession , in my professional opinion . '' half of the 10 major employment sectors that are tracked in the state 's monthly labor data showed employment gains . the largest gain came in the professional and business services sector where 2,700 new jobs were added compared to december 2016 . one of the largest areas of job losses in december came in the construction sector , which saw a decline of 1,000 workers . connecticut still has not recovered all of the jobs it lost during the last recession . the state lost 119,100 jobs between march 2008 and february 2010 and has recovered only 91,000 with the december employment numbers factored in . ",
        "the new haven labor market area lost 100 jobs in december compared to the same period a year ago . the hartford labor market area led the state in job growth , adding 1,400 new workers last month compared to december 2016 . gioia said the state 's december employment numbers were a good first step to righting connecticut 's economic ship . `` but we need to sustain it , and we have a long way to go , '' he said . luther . turmelle@hearstmediact . com .
