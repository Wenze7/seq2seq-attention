        "twitter has rebuffed claims by a conservative media outlet that its staff monitor users ' private data , including direct messages sent over the social network . earlier this week , project veritas , which hosts sting operation-style videos produced by self-proclaimed `` guerrilla journalist '' james o'keefe , posted footage that appears to show twitter engineers admitting that teams of employees access users ' data . in one brief clip , a senior network security engineer appears to say that the social media company would be able hand over president donald trump 's data , including deleted tweets and direct messages , to the department of justice , subject to a subpoena . ",
        "last week , twitter criticized project veritas in a public statement for its `` deceptive '' and `` selectively edited '' report . we deplore the deceptive and underhanded tactics by which this footage was obtained and selectively edited to fit a pre-determined narrative . twitter only responds to valid legal requests and does not share any user information with law enforcement without such a request . referencing its privacy policies and terms of service which explain how it holds and stores information that users choose to share , twitter said it is `` committed to enforcing our rules without bias and empowering every voice on our platform , in accordance with the twitter rules '' . ",
        "project veritas has been criticized in the past for using underhand and deceitful methods in its investigations . in november last year , one of its undercover employees was caught trying to bait reporters at the washington post by falsely claiming to be a sexual assault victim of republican u. s. senate candidate roy moore . twitter regularly reveals the number of legal requests it receives and responds to in its biannual transparency report . the company received 2,111 government information requests in the u. s. and produced at least some information for 77 percent of them during the period between january 1 and june 30 , 2017 .
