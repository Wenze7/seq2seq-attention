        "the past couple weeks for james harrison have been hectic . it all started last saturday , when the longtime steelers linebacker was released with just two games to go in the regular season . then harrison gave pittsburgh fans nightmares . he signed with the new england patriots . with the promise of playing time and a great chance at another ring , the fit was obvious . but this move spurned some steelers fans , as they felt betrayed by his quick signing with the enemy . some current players , like center maurkice pouncey , blamed harrison for his conduct before the release ever happened . ",
        "after the signing , more steelers players such as bud depree and vince williams called harrison out for his antics . on friday , harrison put out a statement on instagram to clear the air and set things straight . he also took several shots at his former team for the way they handled his requests for playing time this season . it 's only his side of the story , but it seems to fit in with the rumors that had circulated throughout the week . we 'll see how much he brings to new england and their defense , and it 'll be one hell of a game if the teams match up in the afc championship once again .
