        "the tax cut debate in michigan is set to reignite . lansing -- the long-running debate over a state income tax cut could be about to re-ignite . this time , it 's the recently approved federal tax cut that is triggering the issue . though not all economists agree , state officials expect president donald trump 's tax cut , approved by congress in december , to result in a $ 1.4-billion tax windfall for the state of michigan , because of higher personal income taxes for most michigan residents . the federal plan merges the personal exemption , which is reduced from $ 4,050 to zero , into a larger standard deduction , which is increased from $ 6,350 to $ 12,000 for individuals and from $ 12,700 to $ 24,000 for married couples . ",
        "that change could have implications for state taxpayers , who currently are able to take a $ 4,000 exemption for each federal exemption they claim . individuals will lose a $ 4,000 deduction from their taxable income , and a family of four will lose a $ 16,000 deduction , house fiscal agency senior economist jim stansell told the free press . that equates to a $ 170 state tax hike for an individual and a $ 680 hike for a family of four -- both of which would apply to income earned in 2018 . gov. rick snyder has already promised legislation to eliminate what would be an unplanned tax hike and make the change revenue-neutral at the state level . ",
        "snyder told the associated press `` the federal tax reform is going to cause people 's michigan taxes to go up , '' and `` we should figure out how to give that back to the hardworking taxpayers . '' snyder is expected to propose a new $ 4,000 exemption or some other change to counter those increases . `` we are awaiting a comprehensive analysis from treasury before making any decisions or proposals , '' said snyder spokeswoman anna heaton . `` that is expected in early january . `` but it 's an election year and many republicans who control the legislature want to go further than that and pass a deeper personal income tax cut . ",
        "among them is state rep. jim runestad , r-white lake . `` certainly , i do n't want tax increases -- i 'm about tax decreases , '' runestad said . runestad was one of the house republicans who in february voted to cut the state 's income tax rate from 4.25 % to 3.9 % over four years , only to see the measure -- which snyder and some republicans opposed -- fall short . democrats opposed the measure , saying they wanted tax relief targeted more at the middle class . house speaker tom leonard , r-dewitt , who is term-limited and running for attorney general , may now revisit the issue . ",
        "`` i have always been in favor of lowering the tax burden on michigan families , and i am glad to see the governor is now willing to come to the table and talk about ways to help our hard-working taxpayer , '' leonard said through his spokesman , gideon d'assandro . `` he and i have not had a chance to talk about this issue yet , but we are reviewing the changes and we will talk about how to handle it soon . `` still , not everyone is convinced the state should even give up the extra revenues the state would gain if it did not adjust for the federal tax cut , since many expect trump 's cut to be followed by cuts in federal payments to the states . ",
        "gilda jacobs , president and ceo of the michigan league for public policy , said snyder and the legislature should proceed cautiously . `` we want to be sure we really protect the vulnerable people in this state , '' jacobs said . `` michigan really needs more revenues to improve people 's lives . `` the state already faces uncertainty over paying for health care and the massive federal tax cut could result in further reductions in federal transfers to states such as michigan , she said . `` people need to understand that 42 % of our state budget comes from the feds -- that 's huge . ",
        "`` at least one economist says snyder and state officials have misinterpreted the effects of the federal tax changes . patrick anderson , ceo of anderson economic group said the federal personal exemption has been reduced to zero for the purposes of calculating personal federal income taxes , but it has not been eliminated and is explicitly preserved for other purposes . anderson , whose firm has played a significant role in past michigan tax legislation , said in a friday letter to treasurer nick khouri that no legislative action is needed and `` michigan 's income tax payers will not lose their state income tax exemptions ... and will not be subjected to a large income tax hike . ",
        "`` he advised the treasury department to issue an interpretive statement . contact paul egan : 517-372-8660 or pegan@freepress . com . follow him on twitter @paulegan4 . the associated press contributed to this report .   "
