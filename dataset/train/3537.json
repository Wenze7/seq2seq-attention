        "at least one worker was killed and 11 others injured in an explosion and fire that broke out friday at a chemical factory just a few kilometres from mount fuji in central japan . residents living within 100 metres of the factory were ordered to evacuate as 17 fire engines and nearly 60 firefighters battled the blaze . plumes of thick black smoke billowed into the sky from the factory belonging to arakawa chemical industries , which manufactures chemicals for the paper industry . `` a 64-year-old worker , who had earlier been missing , was found dead , '' takahiro suzuki , a fire service official from fuji city , told afp . ",
        "eleven other workers were hurt , three seriously , he said , updating an earlier announcement that 14 people had been injured . the casualties were all male and aged in their 20s to 60s . fuji city is located in the foothills of the world-famous mount fuji , around 100 kilometres west of the capital tokyo . officials said it was not immediately clear exactly what was burning but the factory operator denied risks of potential contamination or pollution . `` there is no concern '' that chemicals in the plant could pollute the environment in the neighbourhood , said a company official who declined to give his name . ",
        "the factory produces resin for printer inks and chemicals used for making paper , added the official .   "
