        "the human rights commission says transgender weightlifter laurel hubbard is not masquerading as a woman to win medals and critics are wrong to question her commonwealth games debut . hubbard was confirmed last week in the new zealand team to contest the 2018 commonwealth games on the gold coast in april and will compete in the world championships on wednesday . the 39-year-old - who previously competed in elite weightlifting competitions as gavin hubbard - is new zealand 's first transgender commonwealth games representative . hubbard , who meets the eligibility criteria , was unavailable for comment - stuff has had several interview requests rebuffed since october . ",
        "new zealand olympic committee spokesperson lewis hampton said that followed negativity around her inclusion in women 's weightlifting . read more : * transgender athletes have advantage - professor * hubbard 's games selection defended * transgender athlete named for comm games australian weightlifting federation chief executive michael keelan hit out at her selection last month , saying she had an unfair mental advantage over other female competitors because she had previously competed as a man and knew she was capable of lifting higher weights . however , the human rights commission new zealand has said hubbard 's selection and participation in the women 's weightlifting section at the 2018 games is the correct decision and those questioning it were wrong . ",
        "taine polkinghorne , human rights advisor for sexual orientation , gender identity , and sex characteristics , said hubbard or any transgender athlete is selected on merit of performance and background should make no difference . `` there is no valid reason to exclude trans women from competitive women 's sports . laurel is a woman - not a man masquerading as a woman to gain medals or glory . `` she is an incredible athlete , who has met the international olympic committee regulations related to acceptable testosterone levels that enable her to compete in sporting competitions . `` participation in sport and physical activity is a human right . '' ",
        "polkinghorne said there was enormous diversity among women athletes anyway . `` so long as their testosterone levels are consistent with those of athletes assigned female at birth , trans women do not pose an unfair advantage in sports . '' hubbard will compete in the women 's 90 kg + category , introduced by the international weightlifting federation at the start of the year . the international olympic committee acknowledges athletes only as male or female with no transgender category . keelan , australia 's weightlifting chief , told aap this week that hubbard 's inclusion was unfair . ",
        "`` we 're in a power sport which is normally related to masculine tendencies ... where you 've got that aggression , you 've got the right hormones , then you can lift bigger weights , '' he said . `` if you 've been a male and you 've lifted certain weights and then you suddenly transition to a female , then psychologically you know you 've lifted those weights before . `` i personally do n't think it 's a level playing field . that 's my personal view and i think it 's shared by a lot of people in the sporting world . '' ",
        "however hubbard does meet the commonwealth games , international federation and nzoc eligibility criteria . she also meets the guidelines outlined in the ioc consensus statement - last updated in 2015 . this states that those who transition from male to female are eligible to compete in the female category under the condition they declare their gender identity is female and total testosterone level in serum has been below 10 nano molar per litre for at least 12 months prior to first competition - as well as during . hubbard 's fellow weightlifting teammate tracey lambrechs has disagreed with hubbard taking another female competitor 's position on the new zealand team as she had an advantage of being a former male competitor . ",
        "lambrechs reportedly lost 17kgs to fit under the 90 kg category because she knew she would have no chance against hubbard in the 90 kg + category . `` personally i think should be able to compete , but they should n't be able to take spots from other female athletes , '' lambrechs told radio new zealand last week . `` i personally do n't think it 's very fair that laurel has weight lifting history and was one of our top male lifters for a long time , '' she said . nzoc stands by its decision to include hubbard . ",
        "chief executive kereyn smith said hubbard would be strongly supported throughout her campaign . `` as is the case with all athletes , particularly those heading to their first games , we will work with laurel and the wider weightlifting team to make sure she has the environment and resources she needs to represent new zealand with honour and pride at gold coast 2018 . '' hubbard won both the australia weightlifting open and commonwealth weightlifting championships this year . she will compete at the iwf world senior championships in anaheim this month . new zealand has won 39 weightlifting medals at past commonwealth games . ",
        "at a glance : ioc guidelines to determine eligibility to compete in male and female competition : - those who transition from female to male are eligible to compete in the male category without restriction . - those who transition from male to female are eligible to compete in the female category under the following conditions : a -rrb- the athlete has declared that her gender identity is female . the declaration can not be changed , for sporting purposes , for a minimum of four years . b -rrb- . the athlete must demonstrate that her total testosterone level in serum has been below 10 nmol/l for at least 12 months prior to her first competitionc -rrb- the athlete 's total testosterone level must remain below 10 nmol/l throughout the competition periodd -rrb- compliance with these conditions may be monitored by testing . ",
        "in the event of non-compliance , the athlete 's eligibility for female competition will be suspended for 12 months .   "
