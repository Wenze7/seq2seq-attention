        "opinion : back in 1997 the world wide web was just six years old , but the youngster looked promising . email was really catching on and wellington businessman shane cole , together with a gifted geek by the name of harry galanakis , started an internet service provider they called paradise . initially they offered a dial-up service in wellington , but expanded nationwide by 1999 . they entered into a reselling agreement with telstra saturn and not long afterwards became one of the first adsl providers . the company enjoyed big growth and got a reputation for two things -- fantastic consistency of bandwidth and humanistic customer support . ",
        "i became a customer about then and every time i called their support helpline , i ended up wanting to date the effulgent person on the end of the phone . in mid-2000 , paradise was sold to telstra saturn , and moved from bohemian digs on victoria st to a flash new call centre located on wellington 's waterfront . telstra saturn then became telstra clear , which was acquired by vodafone in 2012 for $ 840 million . about that time the paradise brand disappeared , but for a bunch of internet dinosaurs like me having a paradise email address remained a badge of honour . ",
        "kind of an anthropological datapoint for the few that remembered when the local web was wet with afterbirth . two days ago that internet address and the history that went with it disappeared as vodafone euthanised its various email businesses . a quarter of a million new zealanders had their vodafone powered email closed in november . this was not just paradise but also clear , ihug , telstra and vodafone . it was the right call of course . email has become complicated and laden with obligations . isps themselves are arguably outdated in a time of free wifi . ",
        "and outfits like google can innovate faster with gmail than mere mortals , while simultaneously producing a business model that enables them to offer it for no monetary charge . so a very good call by russell stanners and the vodafone web warriors . however the history of the internet in new zealand is not full of good calls . in fact there have been some dreadful ones . many of which date back to the time of the paradise sale . probably the single biggest lost opportunity was nz post failing to seize the day in the late 90s and launch a full service isp business . ",
        "with email use quadrupling you did n't have to be a rocket scientist to work out that physical mail was going to be hit hard . why pay $ 1 and wait two days when you can pay nothing and wait two seconds ? as kiwis cautiously started dipping their toes into the digital soup there would have been no company more trusted to escort them into the online world of email than nz post . and from what i hear a business went in front of the then leadership team . but for reasons unknown it never got the tick . ",
        "nz post 's decision not to migrate its hold from physical mail to online mail back in the 90s was an unconscionably bad call . certainly i would have trusted them more than the default incumbent telecom . talking of telecom , another example of an epically bad call is when the telco had the chance to buy trade me at a bargain price . it was 2001 and trade me has been going two years . a young sam morgan , together with early investor richard abbott , were enjoying great traffic and user engagement , but were running out of money . ",
        "they hit the road talking to investors and media companies , in search of investment or distribution ability or both . morgan went to see telecom 's digital division , xtra , which ran the largest website in the country . inevitably the question of valuation came up . `` so , what do you think you are you worth ? '' was the question from the head of xtra . ten million , morgan said without blinking . according to morgan he was literally laughed out of the room by the telecom team . a few years later morgan got his own back . ",
        "theresa gattung the head of telecom offered him $ 50 million for trade me . it was , he was assured , a generous price . this time it was morgan who laughed them out of the room . less than two years later the company sold for $ 750 million to fairfax , and later listed on the stock market for $ 1.5 billion . so potentially not a bad return if xtra had chosen to shell out that $ 10 million . two examples -- a wasted opportunity to own the local isp market and poor judgement about valuation . ",
        "both diabolically bad calls in hindsight , but barely thought of at the time . coincidentally it 's exactly 350 years since english poet john milton published his epic work paradise lost . the lengthy poem tells the biblical story of the fall of mankind , and is full of anecdotes of individual calls that together provide a litmus test of broader judgement . a fitting metaphor for life and death in business and the internet . mike `` mod '' o'donnell is a e-commerce manager and professional director . his twitter handle is @modsta and he 's a little fragile about losing his paradise email .
