        "englewood , colo. . -- todd davis has grown accustomed to following fellow inside linebacker brandon marshall 's lead . like marshall , davis has excelled in denver after getting cut multiple times by another nfl team . like marshall , davis is the team 's ed block courage award recipient , winning it this year , two years after marshall . like marshall , davis is positioned to cash in on free agency , too . `` i 'm definitely rooting for him . i know he will , '' marshall said . `` it just depends on where and how much . '' ",
        "marshall , the broncos ' 2015 ed block recipient , signed a four-year , $ 32,000 deal as a restricted free agent before last season . davis is heading to unrestricted free agency this offseason . although the players are expecting massive roster turnover following their second straight season without a playoff berth , marshall is pulling for davis to stay in denver . the two have developed a great chemistry together . marshall leads the team in tackles this year with 101 and davis is second with 78 despite missing two games with injuries . `` i hope he stays , but it 's a tough league , '' marshall said . ",
        "`` we 've been losing , so that makes it even tougher . so , we 'll see what happens . '' added davis : `` i love denver , we 'll see how everything goes . '' while players would rather be high draft picks than afterthoughts , marshall said it means more to sign a lucrative second contract than a big rookie deal because those are based on potential instead of performance . `` yeah , on what we 've done , '' marshall said . `` absolutely , we 've proven ourselves and they pay us as such . ",
        "so , it 's definitely better to happen in your second contract that your first . '' davis was cut several times by the new orleans saints before coming to denver , just like marshall was cut many times by the jacksonville jaguars before making a name for himself with the broncos . `` i think that 's one of the things that bonds us together so close , '' davis said . `` i think that his story is very similar to mine and we definitely both know what it means to be sitting at home or unsure of your football future . ",
        "i think that 's why we work so hard together and work so well together , it 's because we really understand each other . '' marshall concurs , saying , `` absolutely , we have things in common and that definitely helps . todd 's a hard-working guy , he 's tough . he exhibits everything that an ed block courage award winner would exhibit . '' marshall was drafted in the fifth round out of nevada in 2012 but still had to make his way up from the practice squads in jacksonville and denver . davis went undrafted out of sacramento state and joined the saints in june of 2014 . ",
        "five months later , the broncos claimed him off waivers from new orleans and he played in six games for denver down the stretch . he played in all 16 games the next two years and led the team in tackles last year . `` it 's been an amazing journey and i really feel blessed to be here , '' davis said . `` i think one of my biggest defining moments was being cut four or five times and then finally making it on a squad . i made a promise to myself that i would never be cut again . ",
        "i never wanted to go back there , it was tough times . i 've just been blessed and now i 'm here . '' that perseverance and determination shows in his play , coach vance joseph said . `` todd is special . todd is one of our best leaders , '' joseph said . `` todd plays with injuries . todd never complains . todd is the same guy every day . todd is an example of being a great pro . `` through the good times and through the bad times , todd has never changed . ",
        "his work ethic has never changed . if it 's a walkthrough , todd is full speed . todd is what i want all of our guys to aspire to be . '' by arnie stapleton , ap pro football writer .   "
