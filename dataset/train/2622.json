        "proving that her branding is second-to-none , kim kardashian and family announced today the name of their newest addition . chicago west joins brother saint , 2 , and sister north , 4 , in walking into a notorious family and wildly speculated fortune . what exactly is chicago west 's net worth ? start your clocks at $ 10 million , and then keep walking . i 'll tell you when to stop . baby chicago west was born on january 15 , martin luther king jr. . day , to a surrogate who has not been named . ",
        "the girl was reportedly delivered at cedars-sinai hospital with mother kim kardashian and father kanye west present . kim is said by tmz to have had the first skin-to-skin contact with the tiny heir to the family 's fortune . almost as soon as the news hit on january 16 , people began speculating at the net worth of child number three for the kardashian-west family . kanye west 's net worth has been estimated at about $ 145 million by instyle , in spite of previous tweets that suggested he was all dried up and required crowd-funding to see his dreams come to reality . ",
        "kim kardashian 's wealth reportedly outstrips that of her husband , at a net worth of $ 175 million according to time . she made a reported $ 45 million of revenue in 2017 alone , per forbes , and has been widely reported to make a hefty $ 500,000 per episode of keeping up with the kardashians . each of the `` lead '' cast members receive that fee for their gif-able performances on the show about their lives , so the family wealth at large is clearly immense . and there is nothing like knowing that a five-day-old baby already has more money than you would see in five lifetimes . ",
        "but what exactly is chicago west 's cut of the financial pie ? we know that kanye west and kim kardashian set aside $ 10 million for a trust fund for north west , accessible when she turns 21 per their interview with hollywood life , and can assume from their parenting style -- devoted to each of their children -- that they repeated this financial plan for each of their offspring . further , the simple act of being born will usher in a windfall of money from magazines keen to secure `` access '' to the family of five . ",
        "the viewership for the upcoming episode of keeping up with the kardashians in which kim and kanye meet their third child will surely be among the series ' most-watched episodes of all time . that means that royalties from the show will flow into their coffers . and , should they choose to do a family photo shoot exclusive , they could be paid as much as us$ 10.4 million , as was angelina jolie and then-husband brad pitt in 2008 for photos of their newborn twins , per the daily mail . in the reality tv game , interest in the stars equates to an increase in revenue . ",
        "that helps explain how kim can spend $ 100,000 on a purse , and kanye $ 200,000 on a car , without worrying about their liquidity . kim has been known to wear outfits worth as much as $ 11,000 and to dress her firstborn , nori , as is her nickname , in identical outfits . so it 's safe to say that each of their children not only stand to inherit a substantial fortune , but to enjoy the fruits of their enviable cashflow while young . so the ongoing ratings boost that young chicago 's life translates to is sure to result in a bit of a money shower , on top of which , chicago 's grandmother , kris jenner is worth a reported $ 60 million .
