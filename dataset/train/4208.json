        "as if the deep freeze that 's sent temperatures plunging to all-time lows across the eastern half of the u. s. were n't enough , the region may get hit with a snow bomb . now that boston has tied a 100-year-old record with seven days of highs below 20 degrees fahrenheit , new york 's airports have registered new lows and chicago has enjoyed its coldest new year 's day ever , a storm is set to race up the u. s. east coast on thursday and dump snow along the way . boston may see as much as 11 inches , manhattan could get 3 , and brooklyn and queens are set for 4 . ",
        "this storm may end up being worse than your average nor ' easter . it could turn into a bomb , short for bombogenesis , a phenomenon that occurs when a system 's central pressure drops steeply -- 24 millibars or more -- in 24 hours . if current computer models hold , that 'll start to happen somewhere off cape hatteras , north carolina , and continue as the storm moves north . hurricane-force wind warnings have been posted off the coast where ships could encounter winds of 80 miles an hour and waves as high as 26 feet on thursday . ",
        "`` the real apex , the peak of the storm , will be cape cod to nova scotia , '' said gregg gallina , a forecaster at the u. s. weather prediction center in college park , maryland . on its current track , the storm will scrape the east coast and dump snow from south carolina to maine and into canada , with boston and parts of maine bearing the brunt . georgia governor nathan deal has already declared a state of emergency for 28 counties . the weather stands to wreak havoc on markets for longer , as electricity prices have already surged to the highest level in years and natural gas demand hit a record high . ",
        "`` on long island , out by the hamptons and montauk , it could be 4 to 6 inches , then we start talking about the really big numbers , '' gallina said . `` the main action is the eastern third of massachusetts . '' there 's a silver lining : the storm will offer some respite from the bone-rattling cold that triggered wind chill advisories and freeze warnings across the central u. s. and winter storm watches from massachusetts to florida on tuesday . but the relief will only be temporary as the arctic chill is set to make a comeback by the end of the week . ",
        "temperatures will rise out of the teens and single digits from philadelphia to boston before slipping back again by friday and saturday . `` this is only the appetizer -- the main meal comes over the weekend , '' said judah cohen , director of seasonal forecasting for atmospheric and environmental research , a verisk analytics inc. . business in lexington , massachusetts . `` this is about as intense a cold as i can remember . '' the storm will probably cause blizzard conditions in new england and eastern long island as high winds accompany the snow , said paul walker , a meteorologist with accuweather inc. . ",
        "and that 's not where the bad news stops : another round of bitterly cold air is forecast to blast across the u. s. by the middle of next week . the chill could linger through jan. . 16 .   "
