        "beatles legend ringo starr and the bee gees ' barry gibb have been awarded knighthoods in queen elizabeth ii 's new year 's honours list . ringo was recently reported to be among those set to receive top honors in 2018 , and on friday , the news was confirmed . the rocker , who became a member of the most excellent order of the british empire in 1965 , joins his old bandmate paul mccartney in being recognized with a knighthood , albeit 20 years after the mull of kintyre star was celebrated as a ` sir ' . ",
        "reacting to the official announcement , ringo shared in a statement , `` it 's great ! it 's an honor and a pleasure to be considered and acknowledged for my music and my charity work , both of which i love . '' gibb , the last surviving member of the bee gees , was equally as thrilled with the award , insisting he was `` deeply honored , humbled and very proud '' to be selected for the title for his contributions to the arts . `` this is a moment in life to be treasured and never forgotten , '' he said , as he remembered his late bandmates and siblings robin gibb and maurice gibb . ",
        "`` i want to acknowledge how responsible my brothers are for this honor . it is as much theirs as it is mine . '' meanwhile , retired ballet icon darcey bussell has been made a dame , soft cell singer marc almond has been named the recipient of an officer of the most excellent order of the british empire medal , and rapper wiley has been chosen to pick up an mbe . `` it feels like the school grade i wanted and did n't get but now i 'm finally there , '' the grime star exclaimed . ",
