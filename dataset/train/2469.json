        "as we head to the close of yet another year , we celebrate our accomplishments and plan for future successes with the hope that a new year brings . the truth is that we might have been on the brink of nuclear destruction several times this year . global warming and the world political scene is in crisis mode . basically every movie with an `` end of the world scenario '' is playing out in real time before our eyes . fear is running the show and that is just too much for our psyche to handle , so we shut down . ",
        "when overloaded we go into survival mode . we look for safety and certainty and tend to contract . every day , we are bombarded with so much negative information , it has sucked the joy out of life , causing us to reach saturation and enter a zombie-like state . energetically and consciously , we go into a lower vibration ; auto-pilot ; a form of waking sleep . all life has vibrational frequencies ; even the earth has its own unique vibration . what does being in a low vibrational frequency look and feel like ? focusing only on work , rushing from one activity to the next , piling on more and more , numbing out with our electronics , binge watching t. v. , not sleeping well , feeling like we ca n't catch up and there is never enough time . ",
        "obligation , overwhelm and general dissatisfaction . in these states we tend to make poor decisions about our future , and even worse , we may not recognize an opportunity to make our life better . it 's not that we do n't know what we need to do , when we are in a negative spin , we just ca n't get positive enough to believe we will get out , so we stay stuck . this is because our whole self is affected , all the way to our nervous system . one of the big consequences is health ; we experience fatigue , fuzzy thinking or memory loss , poor sleep , headaches , poor digestion , recurring colds or sinus infections , tight neck and shoulders , and mild depression ... . ",
        "functioning , but not well . these are signs of being in a low vibrational frequency , and we need to get out of it . what does functioning at a higher vibrational frequency look and feel like ? it 's an awareness of the beauty around us , of our evolving life experience , and what we share with others . it is expansion , curiosity and gratitude . we have energy and mental clarity , emotional calm , optimism , creativity and happiness . we feel alive and well , connected to all that is , in our greatest state of health , vitality . ",
        "it 's awareness of our thoughts , emotions and attitude , the choices we make , and we are responsible for our well-being , and not victims of circumstance . it is awakening to our unlimited potential . if you 've had that feeling like there is nothing good left , or to look forward to , that is a sign energetically that you have been living in a lower vibrational state . what is the solution ? raising your vibrational frequency . the ancient chinese practiced self cultivation to improve their health and longevity . it was crucial to address the whole person , physically , energetically , emotionally and spiritually . ",
        "there were 8 practices the ancients would utilize to achieve optimal levels of health : acupuncture , herbal medicine , bodywork , dietary , exercise , meditation , feng shui and cosmology . be mindful of the information you 're exposed to . especially when reading , listening to and watching the news . practice being present for several minutes a day . notice your thoughts and feelings . do they tend to be negative ? release them . it may seem cheesy but find inspirational quotes and post them where you can see them daily . connect with people in person and agree to put your phones away . ",
        "listen to music that makes you feel happy . dance ! practice saying `` no '' . people can be toxic too ... especially around the holidays , where you may feel obligated to spend time with people you do n't like or who drain your energy . notice the beauty in everything . you are not alone and the whole world is supporting you on your journey . nurture your health , eat fresh and healthy foods , and drink plenty of water . your attitude and mindset are a representation of how you navigate the world physically , energetically , emotionally and spiritually . ",
        "commit to being the best version of yourself , and take action to address your whole health daily , not waiting until you 're sick and in pain . make it a priority , make it a habit . now , more than ever , is the time to commit to your health and well-being , and the new year means you have the opportunity to become the best version of yourself . imagine what it would feel like to be more energized , motivated , and inspired . what would your life be like if you tapped into your unlimited potential ?
