        "montreal -- while montreal 's city council has passed a motion looking to ban sugary drinks in municipal buildings , not all borough bosses believe it 's a workable measure . some veteran councillors who voted against it earlier this month wo n't be drafting those types of rules for their own districts , saying they go beyond their competency as municipal politicians and would prove difficult to enforce . `` i 'm for prevention , i 'm for an excise tax where it would help fund the health system like tobacco , '' said luis miranda , mayor of the eastern montreal borough of anjou . ",
        "`` but to start patrolling what goes into my arenas , what goes into my parks in the summertime when there 's a baseball tournament , i do n't agree . '' a working group is expected to look at how to phase the ban on sports drinks , energy drinks and flavoured water into the city 's 19 boroughs . miranda said such restrictions would create problems for different groups -- youth sports teams , for example , which often have sponsorships with drink companies . councillors from the borough of lasalle also voted against the ban , with mayor manon barbe saying she 'd rather see education for citizens instead of having decisions imposed on them . ",
        "lasalle introduced a health policy in 2008 that required 30 per cent of menu items in public buildings to reflect healthy choices , but nothing was banned . snack bars in lasalle 's two municipal arenas shuttered after operators said the menu requirements made them unprofitable . they 've since been replaced with vending machines that offer healthy alternatives as well as the usual fare . `` i do n't want to have to choose for citizens , '' barbe said . `` when i do my groceries , no one tells me what to put in my shopping cart . '' ",
        "the motion presented at montreal council began as one that called on ottawa to introduce a national excise tax on sugary drinks -- something all montreal councillors supported . several public health groups have also pushed the idea of an excise tax . in may , organizations including the heart and stroke foundation , the canadian cancer society and the childhood obesity foundation touted the `` health and economic benefits of a sugary drink levy '' after having commissioned a study by the university of waterloo . researchers at the university of toronto also came out in favour of a tax on sugary drinks in canada , among other measures , to improve eating habits . ",
        "the world health organization recommended a tax of at least 20 per cent in a 2016 report . in canada , the northwest territories government said this year it was considering a sugar drink tax to help fight obesity . the federal government has looked at the pros and cons of such a tax , but did n't include it in its 2016 budget , finance department briefing documents suggested . but the canadian beverage association has called the montreal excise tax motion disappointing , noting that studies demonstrate the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverage calories has dropped by at least 30 per cent since 2004 without a tax , even as obesity rates have risen . ",
        "barbe said the fact she and some colleagues voted against the motion does n't mean they 're against health initiatives -- just that they believe it 's a job for the provincial and federal governments . `` where is it going to end ? i do n't want to find myself in a position where i 'm playing the part of the sugar police , '' barbe said . sidhartha banerjee , the canadian press .
