        "cash is quickly becoming obsolete in china . mobile payments have become much more convenient . they have surged to $ 5 trillion in the mainland . the electronic payment method has revolutionized commerce in china . hundreds and thousands of small-scale shops including restaurants , grocery stores and tea houses , as well as wet markets , now accept them . in major chinese cities , paying by paper money is all but dead thanks to the convenience of mobile payment , which has now surged to us$ 5 trillion in the mainland . ask lin nianbao , owner of ruyi restaurant that sells noodles , dumplings and rice dishes on shanghai 's lancun road . ",
        "lin is now a firm supporter of the country 's rapid pace of digitalization , where e-payment and online food delivery services have helped his business grow and thrive . `` cash is no longer needed in running the restaurant , '' he said . `` it is a fast-changing business world as mobile phones begin to dominate people 's life . `` until 2015 , ruyi used to collect cash from all its customers , but e-payments through wechat pay and alipay now account for more than 70 per cent of its total transactions , or about 10,000 yuan a day . ",
        "`` this is a typical disruptive technology , '' lin said . `` it forces us to learn how to better use the apps to develop our businesses . `` small restaurants like ruyi operate in a cutthroat fast-food sector , where each dish costs 10 to 20 yuan , and operators are hit with a host of other constraints such as steep rents . the restaurant is big enough for about 20 tables that can sit around 50 people at any one time . it was among the first food businesses on its street to adopt e-payment early last year . ",
        "`` we thought it was worth a try when the payment service firms approached us , '' lin said . `` the rapid increase in the use of mobile payment at small restaurants like ours is a surprise . `` he said e-payment service was no longer a nice-to-have option , but a necessity to attract new customers and retain regulars . `` some people come in and ask whether we accept alipay or wechat , '' lin said . `` those restaurants on the street , which insisted on cash payments have lost their businesses to us . `` digital payments had helped drive the restaurant 's revenue up by about 10 per cent , he said . ",
        "ruyi is one of numerous mainland businesses benefiting from the digitalization drive . third-party payment services by internet giants alibaba group , owner of the south china morning post , and tencent holdings , which offers tenpay service via its instant messaging app wechat , have found their way into hundreds and thousands of small-scale shops including restaurants , grocery stores and tea houses , as well as wet markets which previously shun bank cards for payment . third-party payment refers to the retail transactions through services outside the banking system . globally , china takes a 42 per cent share of the world 's e-commerce transactions , processing 11 times more mobile payments than the united states , according to global consultancy mckinsey . ",
        "for restaurant owner lin , there is a need to further digitalize his business . `` the apps collected a big amount of data through the payments and they know exactly who our customers are and what they want , '' he said . `` i am prepared to work closely with them in future when they offer other fee-based services to help promote shops ' businesses . `` ruyi is already a client of koubei , an online-to-offline local services platform under alipay , which locates merchants who are offering discounts and promotions for users . `` i am addicted to mobile apps because of their increased influence and creative ways of doing businesses , '' lin said . ",
        "`` it 's not just about improving business . i have a nasty feeling that we will fail if we do n't follow their models . ''   "
