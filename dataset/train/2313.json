        "the nebraska basketball team entered friday 's game as a team on the rise , then they fell to earth . the game on friday night is exactly the kind of game the nebraska basketball has to win if it wants to be on the ncaa bubble . despite entering an eight-point dog , the huskers knew they had the talent to take the nittany lions down . unfortunately , the team played one of it 's worst games of the season and lost in overtime . how bad was bad ? when the huskers took a three-point lead late in the game , it was the first time in 30 minutes of game time . ",
        "how bad was it ? they immediately coughed up the lead . despite trailing by as many as 13 for most of the second half , the huskers had a chance to win . with 19 seconds left and the game tied , the cornhuskers put the game in glynn watson 's hands . he proceeded to stand still , well outside the three-point line for 16 of those seconds , then chucked up an off-balance shot . this was out of a timeout mind you . in overtime , the huskers kept punching back and the nittany lions kept counter punching . ",
        "late in the extra period , watson again had the ball with a chance for a potential dagger . once again , watson stood well behind the three-point line for 16 seconds and chucked up an off-balance `` 3 '' . in other news , it might be time for the huskers to start looking to someone else to come up with the big shot at the end of the game . watson , after starting out 5 for his first 6 , went 2 for 14 the rest of the way . that 's a follow up from when he went 0 for 6 against wisconsin , which was a follow up to 2 for 10 against purdue and 5-14 against northwestern . ",
        "it 's a credit that the huskers have managed to go 2-2 in their last four , considering their `` go-to '' player has had a pretty rough season . when watson is on , he 's among the best . he has n't been on very much this year . he was definitely off at the end of the game against penn state . so were the rest of the huskers who also reverted to past seasons , when standing around and waiting for someone to `` do something '' was far too prevalent . if it was n't for isaac copeland and his 21 points , nebraska would have blown out . ",
        "james palmer was also a complete non-factor , hitting just one of nine shots . it was a performance the huskers could not afford . not only does it drop them to 12-7 and 3-3 in the league , but it erases a chance to get some daylight in the middle of the pack . the nebraska basketball team still has a legit chance at going to the ncaa tournament . in order to take advantage of that opportunity , they 're going to need to win some of these close games down the stretch . nebraska football : kicking the tires on drew barker as a huskerthey 'll try again against an illinois team that is reeling after blowing a big lead to iowa thursday night . ",
        "that 's the kind of situation that should be a `` get right '' game for nebraska basketball , but after friday 's performance , husker fans are likely a bit nervous . more from husker corner nebraska football : huskers offer top ranked defensive back target9h ago nebraska football : lavonte david named one of nfl 's top linebackers11h ago nebraska football : scott frost throws some shade nick saban 's way2d ago ucf 's ap vote tallies were all over the board , sometimes downright silly2d ago nebraska basketball : huskers reaction to victory shows maturity2d ago the nebraska basketball team entered friday 's game as a team on the rise , then they fell to earth .
