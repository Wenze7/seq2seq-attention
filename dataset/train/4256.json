        "when treasury secretary steven mnuchin was asked at his confirmation hearing what he thought about using private companies to collect money owed to the government , he replied that it `` seems like a very obvious thing to do . '' it may have been obvious , but it certainly was not economical . private debt collectors cost the irs $ 20 million in the past fiscal year but brought in only $ 6.7 million in back taxes , the agency 's taxpayer advocate reported wednesday . that was less than 1 percent of the amount assigned for collection . ",
        "what 's more , private contractors in some cases were paid 25 percent commissions on collections that the irs made without their help , according to the annual report by nina e. olson , who heads the taxpayer advocate service , an independent office within the irs . despite the pointed failure of similar efforts in the past , congress passed a law in 2015 requiring the irs to use outside contractors to make a dent in the $ 138 billion that taxpayers owe the government . the outsourcing began in april 2017 . since then , the report stated , `` the irs has implemented the program in a manner that causes excessive financial harm to taxpayers and constitutes an end run around taxpayer rights protections . '' ",
        "the irs excuses hardship cases from collection efforts to ensure that households can still pay for basic living expenses , but the private collectors apparently are not following those rules . an analysis of the collections by the advocate 's office found that 45 percent were from taxpayers whose incomes fell below the minimum threshold , including those who received social security disability payments . the report underscored olson 's repeated complaints that congress is underfunding the agency , warning that the new tax law will bring added pressures that will further impair its ability to respond to taxpayers , update technology and maintain compliance programs . ",
        "since 2010 , funding for the irs has shrunk by a fifth , after taking inflation into account . olson said in the report that `` the discussion about irs funding has largely proceeded based on false choices -- either ` you ca n't trust the irs to administer the tax system , so do n't fund it ' or ` because the irs does n't have enough funding , it ca n't do the things it needs to do to administer the tax system . ' '' both added funding and service improvements are needed , she said . "
