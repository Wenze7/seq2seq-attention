        "the acid attacker ex-boyfriend of reality tv star ferne mccann has admitted hiding a mobile phone inside a crutch he was using while in prison . arthur collins , 25 , secreted the phone , two sim cards and two usb sticks inside the walking aid while held on pre-trial remand at hmp thameside in september . he was being held there ahead of his trial over the acid attack at a london nightclub in april , for which he was last week jailed for 20 years . he admitted one charge of possession of a prohibited item while in prison when he appeared via video link at bromley magistrates ' court in london on wednesday . ",
        "the court heard he wanted to use the phone to make private calls to mccann . she was pregnant with their child at the time the mobile was discovered in a search of his cell . collins appeared from the maximum security hmp belmarsh in south east london , where he is serving his sentence . wearing a prison-issue yellow and blue tracksuit he spoke only to confirm his identity . the court heard the banned items were found when a prison officer removed the rubber stopper from the bottom of the crutch in his private shower during a cell search . ",
        "collins had been using the aid after hurting his feet trying to evade police while on the run for the acid attack at mangle e8 in dalston , east london . the court heard evidence was later found on the phone of calls and messages to family and friends . collins 's lawyer , audrey mogan , said he obtained the phone so he could make private calls to mccann . she said : `` he did not have the phone for any sinister purpose . his partner at the time was heavily pregnant and gave birth the following november . ",
        "he had this phone because he and his partner had been hounded by the media . `` he knows there was a phone in the cell but he knows the calls are recorded . because of that he was afraid that information would get out to the media . `` she added that his acid attack trial and subsequent imprisonment had been a `` difficult and trying time for him '' . the district judge , robert hunter , committed collins 's case to woolwich crown court for sentencing on a date to be fixed .
