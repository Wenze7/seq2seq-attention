        "each and everything , dead or alive , realistic or materialistic , can act in many different ways . time , one such thing , is the most powerful and even the most devastating thing of all time , and is the ultimate controller of our lives . from birth to death , from study to job , everything is controlled by time . scientifically , time is considered as any point of time which can be measured in terms of hours and minutes . it is also defined as an indefinite continuous progress of existence and events of past , present and future which can be considered as a whole . ",
        "but , in terms of literature , time is considered as one of the best creations existing in this huge world which is a union of several living and non-living entities . but again , we have come up with another question standing in front of us . why the so-clever and extra ordinary human minds consider time as even more powerful than themselves ? let 's search for our answer with the upcoming words . generally , people say that their destiny and luck were the soul driving forces of their lives but they forget to notice the enormous game which time played with them in due course of their life . ",
        "and , in most of the cases , this gameplayer becomes the game-changer and plays the deciding role in the simple lives of number of people . in most of the cases , the simple lives become the most devastated ones and some of the exceptional cases come up which finally end up producing leaders who lead this world of highly confused people . only time is known as the friendly evil because of its exceptional powers to create as well as destroy this humongous world . our earth came into existence because of its cooling in a long duration of time . ",
        "we may end up diluting ourselves in a time-controlled space because of our over-elaborated and over-powered existence . over-confident and over-egoistic nature of the human race will also come in way of keeping the race to exist on earth . time is the greatest creation of god and is equipped with enormous powers in its hand . it is the only saviour of this beautiful creation of god whenever the extra-clever mind of human comes up with the plans to destroy it . it acts a punisher in several different ways to every culprit of nature , whatsoever be the time and condition . ",
        "time is also equipped with several other powers which can make it to be the most helpful imaginary power in our lives . it can change the direction of our destiny and can take us all the way to new heights . even if we have had started from trash at a particular moment . we have been talking about the great powers of time since a long time , but there is still one important question which has remained unanswered . what 's importance of time in our lives ? why is it the power behind the way this nature moves ? ",
        "why one should fear from time in case they want to be successful enough in their lives ? while trying to finish up this article , my mind started to ponder over a hypothetical question , what if someone can evolve science to an extent so that the person can control the flow of time ? what if someone becomes self-reliable enough to change the direction of destiny ? what if time becomes an entity which can be frozen ? and , when i was trying to answer my own question , i came up with the words like mass-destruction . ",
        "everything may end up becoming up a mess , finally diluting itself in its own horizon . control over time will end up making this beautiful world a scribbled massacre . we will end up engulfing our happiness into horrific truth . till the time my imagination concludes to a real scenario , let 's try to be with time instead of attempting to control it . just enjoy this magnificent and mesmerizing surrounding but do n't try to destroy it .
