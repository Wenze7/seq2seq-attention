        "though the original apple watch was seemingly positioned as a high-tech fashion accessory , it 's since become overwhelmingly clear that the device 's health and fitness features are what many consumers enjoy most about apple 's wearable . as a result , apple has continued to invest heavily in the apple watch as part of a concerted effort to make it an even more appealing and helpful health and fitness monitor . that said , a new report from bloomberg relays that future iterations of the apple watch may include advanced heart-monitoring technology better equipped at detecting and alerting users to potentially serious heart conditions . ",
        "specifically , apple is said to be working on a feature that would effectively enable users to take quick ekg and ecg measurements directly from their wrist . do n't miss : your cable company is going to be so angry when you get this $ 40 box `` a version being tested requires users to squeeze the frame of the apple watch with two fingers from the hand that 's not wearing the device , '' the report reads . `` it then passes an imperceptible current across the person 's chest to track electrical signals in the heart and detect any abnormalities like irregular heart rates . '' ",
        "of course , the current version of the apple watch already boasts a heart rate sensor , and we 've already seen a number of stories highlighting how the feature has helped save lives . most recently , a user keeping track of his heart rate via the apple watch noticed that his heart rate was abnormally high , ultimately prompting him to seek medical attention . doctors soon discovered that he was suffering from a blood clot in the lungs , otherwise known as a pulmonary embolism . had he not been wearing the apple watch , the condition would have been fatal . ",
        "so what 's the advantage in apple incorporating more advanced technologies to track and measure user heart rates ? well , the technology apple is working on would be better at anticipating heart problems as opposed to just alerting users to when something is currently amiss . `` an ekg would make it easier to establish the health of a user 's heart , and potentially spot some cardiac problems early , '' the report adds . there 's no telling when or if the aforementioned feature will actually appear in a shipping version of the apple watch , but it 's clear that apple views health monitoring as a cornerstone feature of the apple watch user experience .
