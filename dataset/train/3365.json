        "the all-star captains have been released and to no one 's surprise , lebron is the captain of the east . the other four starters in the east are giannis antetokounmpo , demar derozan , joel embiid , and kyrie irving . the west captain is n't undeserving , though many believed it would be kevin durant . but it 's two-time mvp steph curry that was voted as captain of the west , and he reacted to the news on his twitter account with a funny response . like many people , curry was surprised by the captain bid . ",
        "both james and curry are more than warranted to be captains , as they have won multiple mvp awards and championships . the voted-in western starters will be kevin durant , james harden , anthony davis , and demarcus cousins . in the new format , the all-star captains and starters are voted in while the rest of the team is picked by the captains . with the imbalance of talent from the west to the east , the format sets up for a more exciting game . there will be 14 reserves to be picked from and it will be interesting to see where russell westbrook , draymond green , and other superstars end up . ",
        "it 's a safe bet that steph will try to get his warriors teammates on the west team as soon as he can .   "
