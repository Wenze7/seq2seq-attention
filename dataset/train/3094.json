        "in 1980 organ transplants gained immense popularity with the masses in india , but the breakthrough also resulted in a surge in organ trade . this is a perfect example of how laws made with good intentions can become problematic for certain sections of the society . stories of poor people being paid a pittance for their organs , or of people being abducted and their organs stolen had become quite common . the business was booming thanks to the collusion between doctors and hospitals . eventually the situation got so bad that the government was forced to intervene . ",
        "in 1994 , india passed a law to regulate organ transplants and organ donations . this law made it easier for close family members to donate organs . it was done to encourage organ donations among families ; it also put a stop to the trade in organs to a certain extent . but this law had a negative effect too . after the law came into force , instances of family members donating organs for transplants grew , but statistics show that the majority of these donors are women . researchers collected data from aiims , pgi chandigarh , narayanan hospital in hyderabad and other premier institutions , they found : about 85 percent of all familial organ donors were women , while only 10 percent of the recipients were women . ",
        "in transplants between spouses , 90-95 percent of the donors were wives , while instances of husbands donating organs to the wife were found to be rare . when women donate and men receivemedical experts say that kidney diseases do not discriminate between genders . both men and women have an equal chance of developing renal issues , and consequently instances of them requiring a kidney transplant are also the same . but the chances of a man finding a kidney donor in their family are much higher , and often the donor is a woman from their family . ",
        "women , meanwhile , do not enjoy that privilege and chances of them getting a donor are low . men seldom come forward to donate a kidney to a female relative . ever since the organ transplant law came into effect , it has become another burden on women , who are already in an unfavourable position in society and are struggling to gain their rights . the organ transplant law has become a pain for women . larger presence of woman donors has more reasons than onethe larger presence of women in organ donors has a lot to do with the specific situations of indian society . ",
        "economic factors also play a role . women often step forward to donate an organ to save a male family member 's life because the primary breadwinners are usually men . this also shows that economic parity , in terms of gender , is still a distant dream . in europe , where disparity between genders is relatively lower , gender difference among organ donors also is n't there . there have also been cases where women have donated kidneys or other organs due to social and family pressure . it is possible that instances of such cases are much higher but they never come out . ",
        "the readiness of women to donate organs to a male relative also comes from a mindset which teaches them from childhood that women are supposed to sacrifice all for husband , brother and son . this is a part of women 's cultural training . it is why we see stories like `` woman donates kidney to husband on karwa chauth , giving him gift of life . '' no one ever asks why a husband does n't give the `` gift of life '' to his wife . while doctors do n't name people , they do tell stories of marriages where blood groups and organ compatibility are tested before the wedding , and later , once the wife has done her bit by donating an organ to the husband , she is divorced . ",
        "transplantation of human organs act : key aspectslet us take a look at the key aspects of the transplantation of human organs act that have led to such an increase in female organ donors . according to the transplantation of human organs act 1994 and its 2011 amendments , and regulations based upon it , if a living person wishes to donate an organ there are two categories under which permission for it is given -- if it is a near relative then permission for the transplant is given by the hospital 's ` competent authority . ` living organ donation can save lives -- it 's time to step up ` competent authority ' in this instance would be the hospital itself . ",
        "if the donor is n't a near relative then permission for the transplant will be given by the government-appointed authorisation committee . the many ordeals of obtaining permissionobtaining permission from the authorisation committee is a long and laborious process . the committee grants permission only after conducting a thorough investigation to ensure that there is no instance of money or coercion involved . since competent authority is a committee appointed by the hospital and the people making the decision on it are representatives of the institute doing the transplant , getting permission from them is much easier . especially in the case of private hospitals and organ transplant centres , it makes sense , in terms of business , for them to have more and more organ transplants . ",
        "in such a situation they are unlikely to investigate if a woman is being emotionally blackmailed and pressurised into donating an organ . the most problematic section in this law is article 9 . in a nutshell , it states that if any donor authorises the removal of any of his human organs before his death for transplantation into the body of a recipient who is not a near relative , such a human organ shall not be removed and transplanted without the prior approval of the authorisation committee . if this act is amended to ensure approval from the authorisation committee in all cases , even where the donor is a near relative , then the welfare of women would be much better protected . ",
        "if a woman is under pressure to donate an organ , then the authorisation committee is much more likely to discover this in its investigation . it is also quite possible that if a family knows the case is going to go to the authorisation committee they might refrain from trying to pressure a female relative to donate . interactive : be an organ donor -- be a superhero ! although this will bring in challenges to the relatively simple process of organ transplant among family members , and will increase the amount of time taken for a procedure , if a patient is serious then the amount of time can become quite significant . ",
        "these are factors that need to be provided for when making changes to the law , and ensure a time-bound process is in place . how can the pressures faced by women organ donors be tackled ? finally , to stop the discrimination and pressures being faced by women in organ transplants these steps need to be taken . the transplantation of human organs act be amended to provide that even an organ donation by a family member be referred to the government appointed authorisation committee for investigation and approval . for instances of a near relative organ donor , a mandatory provision be made for the opinion of the donor , especially if a female , to be obtained by the doctor in person ; and when she is asked no other relative should be present . ",
        "in cases of divorce following a quick marriage and organ donation , a law needs to be put in place ensuring proper alimony and maintenance allowance by the husband or his family . if the recipient of the organ dies , then responsibility for the donor 's maintenance be taken up by his heirs . in addition , the legal proceedings for this be made easier , to ensure that women are able to get the compensation quickly . unlike in usual instances of divorce where getting their due amount can take forever . organ donation gap : less than 1 % indians donate organsthere can be many other remedies as well . ",
        "there needs to be a national debate on the issue . but the first step would be acceptance of the fact that the significantly larger presence of women among organ donors is an issue .   "
