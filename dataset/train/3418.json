        "back in january , a local point-in-time count found that 11,643 were experiencing homelessness in king county . nearly half of them were living unsheltered . a recent report by the department of housing and urban development , reported by the seattle times , found that those numbers are among the highest in the united states . out of all jurisdictions that are required to report counts to receive federal funding , king county ranked third both in homelessness -- behind only new york city and los angeles county -- and in people living unsheltered . hud also had the fifth-highest rate of homeless families with children in the country . ",
        "it 's hard to pinpoint exactly how much our local homeless population has grown . our count was conducted differently this year : the county brought in a research firm and volunteers were paired with formerly-homeless people to help with the count , so the new numbers are n't directly comparable to past counts . that said , the results of our count did grow at a higher rate than the rest of the united states , with the unsheltered count going up 21 percent and overall count of people experiencing homelessness growing by around 8.5 percent . nationwide , the homeless population grew about 1 percent . ",
        "in response to seattle 's growing homelessness crisis , the city declared a state of emergency two years ago -- but clearly , the problem is still severe . in an attempt to better-serve the homeless population , the city recently overhauled its homeless services contracts . while this led to new providers getting funding and a greater emphasis on housing , many longtime providers , especially those who provide emergency beds , are slated to lose their city backing .
