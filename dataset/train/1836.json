        "brasilia - brazil expects the world organisation for animal health to declare the country free from foot-and-mouth disease with vaccinations at a meeting in may , according to a government statement on friday . the declaration will bolster the country 's prospects to export meat to new markets , the statement said . the oie already considers most of brazil to be free of foot-and-mouth but the declaration would extend certification to the remote states of amazonas , roraima and amapa . oie did not immediately respond to a request for comment . brazil is the world 's largest exporter of beef but its access to many top-tier markets remains limited by concerns over the introduction of the disease which causes fever , mouth blisters and foot ruptures in cows and other animals . ",
        "the disease , often fatal to animals , can infect humans , although it is extremely rare . the government is next starting on a project to be certified free of foot-and-mouth without vaccination by 2022 or 2023 , agriculture minister blairo maggi told government-run news service agencia brasil in a broadcast late on thursday . `` it will open up a very large market . and not only for the beef market , but also for pork , '' maggi told the broadcaster . japan , for example , does not buy meat from brazil and the united states will not allow meat with the bone , due to risk of the disease , he said .
