        "monthly premiums for verizon 's total mobile protection device insurance are going upin return , verizon lowered the deductible for certain phone models and buffed up its screen repair prowessthe changes go into effect january 25for those of us worried about physically damaging our phones in any way , insurance is usually a good way to put the mind at ease . one such option , verizon 's total mobile protection , recently saw some changes , and they actually are n't all that bad . let 's get the bad stuff out of the way first : verizon customers will have to pay more each month for total mobile protection . ",
        "new customers will see the hike from $ 11 to $ 13 each month starting january 25 , while existing customers will see the same hike starting march 6 . the price increase may have something to do with the increasing costs of replacing and repairing smartphones . to balance that out , verizon is lowering the deductible for lost or damaged smartphones to $ 89 for over 150 models . big red did n't say which phones will fall under that threshold -- the galaxy note 8 's and iphone x 's deductibles are $ 199 -- but it 's good news for those who do n't often walk down the flagship road . ",
        "editor 's pickthese are the phones that support verizon 's gigabit lte network update : a previous version of this article noted that the galaxy s7 , s7 edge , pixel 2 , and pixel 2 xl are gigabit-class lte ready , though they are not . we regret the error and have updated ... verizon also said there are 300 authorized repair locations , as well as 170 u. s. cities where a technician will meet with you regarding your phone 's cracked screen . with that , along with the $ 29 deductible for cracked screen repairs , as well as the ability to file a claim for reimbursement if the display gets busted while flying internationally , verizon seems to have this whole `` cracked screen repair '' business down . ",
        "overall , the changes verizon made to total mobile protection actually look good . price increases are never fun , but at least this time it seems to be bringing improvements . expect the changes to go into effect january 25 .   "
