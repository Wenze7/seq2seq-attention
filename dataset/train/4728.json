        "file photo : a fleet of uber 's ford fusion self driving cars are shown in pittsburgh , pennsylvania , u. s. september 13 , 2016 . reuters/aaron josefczyk/file photoby liana b. baker and heather somerville - a consortium led by softbank group corp will buy a large number of shares of uber technologies inc in a deal that values the ride-services firm at $ 48 billion , uber said on thursday , in a victory for new chief executive dara khosrowshahi . the price is a roughly 30 percent discount to uber 's most recent valuation of $ 68 billion . ",
        "the deal will trigger a number of changes in the way the board oversees the company , which is dealing with federal criminal probes , a high-stakes lawsuit and an overhaul of its workplace culture . softbank and the rest of the consortium , which includes dragoneer investment group , will own approximately 17.5 percent of uber , a person familiar with the matter said . that stake includes a share purchase , through a tender offer , from earlier investors and employees at the $ 48 billion valuation , as well as a $ 1.25 billion investment of fresh funding at the $ 68 billion level . ",
        "uber said the deal will close early next year . on thursday it said that existing investors had agreed to sell enough shares for softbank to go through with the transaction . softbank itself will keep a 15 percent stake , while the rest of the consortium will own approximately 3 percent , according to a second person familiar with the matter . private equity group tpg was part of the consortium of buyers , a source familiar with the matter said . khosrowshahi , who took the top job in august after travis kalanick was forced to step down in june , helped negotiate the deal . ",
        "uber is losing more than $ 1 billion each quarter , and a new cash infusion is critical . the company is also planning an initial public offering in 2019 . uber will use the investment `` to support our technology investments , fuel our growth , and strengthen our corporate governance , '' a spokesperson , who declined to be named , said . when the deal is completed , the company will make governance changes , expanding uber 's board from 11 to 17 members including four independent directors , limiting some early shareholders ' voting power and cutting the control wielded by kalanick , who remains on the board and is still one of the largest stakeholders . ",
        "` smart thing ' `` the stockholders did the smart thing . the price is less important than locking in the governance changes and securing the support of the world 's most powerful technology investor , '' said erik gordon an entrepreneurship expert at the university of michigan 's ross school of business . rajeev misra , chief executive of softbank 's vision fund , a $ 98 billion tech investment vehicle , will join the uber board , the wall street journal reported . softbank will get two seats on the expanded board , a source told reuters . ",
        "misra said in a statement that softbank has `` tremendous confidence in uber 's leadership and employees . '' uber board members agreed in early november to governance changes to pave the way for the softbank deal . some initial investors in the consortium , including general atlantic , dropped out over disagreement about the price offered to shareholders , reuters previously reported . softbank founder masayoshi son has taken a keen interest in ride-hailing companies around the world , and already has sizeable stakes in china 's didi , brazil-based 99 , india 's ola and singapore grab , all of which have competed with uber . ",
        "didi last week raised $ 4 billion , including some investment from softbank . the uber investment comes after a year of troubles for the company , including a lawsuit by alphabet inc 's self-driving car unit waymo that alleges trade-secrets theft and federal investigations that span possible bribery of foreign officials in asian countries and the use of software to evade regulators . over the past year , a former employee 's charges of endemic sexual harassment led to an internal review , london said it is stripping uber of its license and uber revealed it had covered up a major hack . ",
        "venture capital firms benchmark , which owns 13 percent of uber , had indicated that it would sell a portion of its shares , softbank said last month . menlo ventures , another large shareholder , would tender shares , managing director shawn carolan said at the time . carolan on thursday praised the deal without describing menlo 's participation . benchmark did not respond to a request for comment .
