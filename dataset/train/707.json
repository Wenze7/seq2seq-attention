        "new york -- north and south korea could soon be ready to talk things out , ahead of the south hosting the winter olympics . this comes as president donald trump takes to twitter to talk nuclear weapons . on tuesday night , trump responded to north korean dictator kim jong un 's warning that he now has a nuclear button on his desk , tweeting , `` i too have a nuclear button , but it is a much bigger and more powerful one than his , and my button works . '' when asked about the tweet , homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen said , `` the president speaks for himself . ",
        "i think we have to continue , as he said , to take the threat from north korea very seriously . '' meanwhile , north and south korea have a new way to communicate . a north korean spokesperson announced on state tv that a hotline in korea 's demilitarized zone has been restored for the first time in nearly two years . north korean leader kim jong un also says he 's open to talks about allowing north korean athletes to compete at the upcoming winter games . trump to kim jong-un : my nuclear button is ` much bigger & more powerful ` south korean president moon jae-in says he 's open to meeting with the north , without any preconditions . ",
        "the white house is opposed to talks unless the north first abandons its nuclear program . `` kim jong un may be trying to drive a wedge of some sort between the two nations , between our nation and the republic of korea . i can assure you that will not happen , '' said state department spokesperson heath nauert . the united states says it will not oppose the talks but doubts kim jon un 's sincerity . pentagon officials say there 's evidence north korea is preparing for another test of its intercontinental ballistic missiles . u.s. ambassador to the united nations nikki haley says the u. s. could seek even more sanctions against north korea if it goes through with another missile test .
