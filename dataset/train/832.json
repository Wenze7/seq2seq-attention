        "washington - congress put the us government back in business monday by voting to end a three-day shutdown , as president donald trump claimed victory in his standoff with democrats in washington . the house voted 266 to 150 to extend federal funding , hours after senate democrats dropped their opposition to the plan after winning republican assurances of a vote on immigration in the coming weeks . `` i know there 's great relief that this episode is coming to an end , '' house speaker paul ryan told colleagues on the house floor . `` but this is not a moment to pat ourselves on the back . ",
        "not even close . `` the stalemate consumed washington for the better part of a week , as lawmakers and the white house feuded over immigration policy and the nation 's two main political parties exchanged bitter barbs before finally reaching a deal . `` i am pleased democrats in congress have come to their senses , '' trump said in a defiant statement , as lawmakers moved to get hundreds of thousands of federal government employees back to work . trump was expected to sign the measure into law later monday , with government operations essentially returning to normal on tuesday . ",
        "democrats decided to end the three-day shutdown after making progress with ruling republicans toward securing the fate of hundreds of thousands of so-called `` dreamers '' brought to america as children , many of them illegally . with democratic support , a bill keeping the government funded until february 8 easily passed the senate , where different versions of the funding had languished for days . word of the compromise deal struck in washington sent us stocks surging to new highs . but the white house appeared in no mood for bipartisanship or magnanimity after a shutdown that overshadowed trump 's first anniversary in office . ",
        "trump moved to undercut democrats , saying he would only accept a comprehensive immigration reform -- one that notably addresses his demands for a border wall with mexico as well as the fate of the `` dreamers . '' `` we will make a long-term deal on immigration if , and only if , it is good for our country , '' he said . top senate democrat chuck schumer earlier announced his party would vote with republicans to end the shutdown , but in a sign of the poisoned politics of washington he pilloried trump in the process . ",
        "`` the white house refused to engage in negotiations over the weekend . the great deal-making president sat on the sidelines , '' schumer said . trump spent the weekend stewing at the white house when he had planned to be among friends and family at his home in mar-a-lago , florida for his anniversary bash . and with the fundamental row on immigration and funding of trump 's border wall unresolved , republicans and democrats may very well find themselves back in a similar stalemate come february 9 . - high-profile holdouts - schumer told senate majority leader mitch mcconnell that he expected republicans to make good on a pledge to address democrat concerns over the deferred action on child arrivals program that shields immigrants brought to the country as children from deportation , but expires on march 5 . ",
        "there are an estimated 700,000 `` dreamers '' whose fates are up in the air . `` if he does not , of course , and i expect he will , he will have breached the trust of not only the democratic senators but members of his own party as well , '' schumer said . trump has staked his political fortunes on taking a hard line on immigrants , painting them as criminals and scroungers . senator tim kaine summed up the view of the more optimistic democrats : `` we got a commitment that i feel very , very good about . ",
        "`` but if no progress is made on an immigration bill , molly reynolds of the brookings institution warned , `` democrats still have the ability to potentially force another shutdown over the issue . `` the house is under no obligation to pass any senate bill generated as a result of mcconnell 's pledge to cooperate with democrats -- although speaker ryan did say his chamber needs to `` move forward in good faith '' on daca and immigration . notably , many of the senate democrats who voted against the funding agreement included a litany of potential 2020 presidential candidates , including kamala harris , bernie sanders , kirsten gillibrand and elizabeth warren . ",
        "- dealmaker on sidelines - ahead of the deal , trump had goaded democrats from the sidelines , accusing them of shutting down the government to win concessions on immigration , in service of `` their far left base . `` there have been four government shutdowns since 1990 . during the last one , in october 2013 , more than 800,000 government workers were put on temporary leave . essential federal services and the military were operational monday , but even active-duty troops will not be paid until a deal is formally sealed .
