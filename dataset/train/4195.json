        "hartford , conn. . _ uconn coach geno auriemma was happy to see gabby williams back to her all-american form sunday . the huskies senior forward scored 20 points , hit all 10 of her shots , dished out seven assists and had four steals as uconn routed memphis 97-49 in the conference opener for both teams . kia nurse had 16 points and napheesa collier added 14 for the huskies who have never lost in 83 american athletic conference games , winning every regular season and conference tournament title . six players scored in double figures and uconn coach geno auriemma said it was a perfect opportunity to help build the confidence of williams , who had scored a total of 28 points over her previous four games . ",
        "`` hopefully , we can put together two or three weeks of this , '' he said . `` we got gabby going in a good direction . '' brea elmore had 20 points for memphis , which came into the game on a four-game winning streak , but falls to 0-8 all-time against the huskies . jasmine james chipped in with 13 points for the tigers . williams hit a layup to open the game and the huskies never trailed . memphis shot 50 percent from the floor in the first quarter , but was behind 29-15 after uconn hit 14 of its 21 shots . ",
        "elmore tried to keep the tigers close . she scored 15 points in the first half . but williams and collier had 12 points each and the huskies led 54-29 at the break , with a 30-point advantage in the lane . a 3-pointer by kia nurse from the left baseline gave the huskies their first 20-point lead at 38-18 . another gave the huskies their first 30-point lead at 67-36 in the third quarter . uconn scored 24 points off 18 memphis turnovers and outscored the tigers 62-18 in the paint . `` a lot of it was offensive rebounding , we had a lot in transition , '' williams said . ",
        "`` that 's something that we 've been emphasizing because we have n't been looking for it as much . so , i 'm glad we got some penetration today . '' big picture : memphis : the loss snaps a four-game winning streak for the tigers , who opened the year 1-8 . memphis falls to 0-3 against ranked teams , with losses to ohio state and depaul . uconn : the 71st straight regular-season conference win moves the huskies into third place on the all-time list , passing stanford , which won 70 straight pac-12 games between january , 2009 and september , 2013 . ",
        "... the win also was the huskies 70th straight at home , giving them the third longest winning streak in division i history , behind an 82 game streak from stanford and their own 99 game home winning streak , which ran between 2007-2012 . the gapauriemma acknowledged that there remains a large gap between his program and the rest of the league , but said the other teams are getting better . memphis coach melissa mcferrin said she believes there are a couple of programs that can give uconn a game . `` i think at this point in time it 's either temple or usf right now that are really going to challenge them , '' she said . ",
        "`` i think uconn probably has a different mindset when they go against those two teams , they know they are capable of playing them close . although tulane has probably played them the closest of anybody . how long is it going to take ? i do n't know . '' missinguconn freshman andra espinoza-hunter was not with the team , an absence that coincides with the end of her first academic semester . auriemma said she went home to deal with some personal issues . `` until she can handle those things , it 's going to be hard for her to play , '' auriemma said . ",
        "`` we might have more of an update in a couple of days . '' up next : memphis : the tigers have five days off before a home game next saturday against east carolina . uconn : the huskies will also face ecu in their next game , which will come wednesday on the road . copyright 2017 the associated press . all rights reserved . this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten or redistributed .
