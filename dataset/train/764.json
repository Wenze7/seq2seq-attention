        "soon after one stripe of accumulating snow extends from oklahoma to ohio into saturday , another storm is likely to coat roads from denver to cleveland prior to christmas morning . the snow from the next storm will roughly parallel interstate 70 along a 1,200-mile-long swath from colorado to kansas , missouri , illinois , indiana and ohio . while a heavy snowfall is not expected , just enough snow is likely to fall to make roads slippery and whiten the landscape for a time . snow is forecast to spread southward from the northern rockies to the central rockies and high plains on saturday and saturday night . ",
        "the storm will then turn eastward across the central plains during the day on christmas eve then the ohio valley during christmas eve night . delays related to aircraft deicing are likely from denver to kansas city , missouri , st. louis , indianapolis , cincinnati , cleveland and pittsburgh . steady snow from the fast-moving storm is likely to slip just south of milwaukee and chicago . however , as the storm presses into the eastern third of the nation , it is forecast to grow in size and interact with a storm near the atlantic coast . at least a small accumulation of snow is anticipated as far to the south as charleston , west virginia , and as far to the north as bay city , michigan . ",
        "depending on how quickly the storm strengthens , there may be enough snow on the ground to sleigh ride in parts of ohio by christmas morning . this is where snow from a storm about 24 hours earlier may overlap . this storm marks the leading edge of the first blast of arctic air in a weather pattern that is likely to deliver not only the lowest temperatures of the season so far but perhaps lower temperatures than of all of last winter for parts of the north central states . where rain falls south of the snow area , over parts of the middle mississippi and tennessee valleys and southern appalachians , wet surfaces may freeze in spots , before becoming dry .
