        "being in 2017 , we all are fully aware of the importance of natural fibres in our diet plans and how they play an important role in our overall well-being . because of this , it has been noticed in the past one decade that people have been turning more and more towards dietary supplements that are indeed very good , but have some drawbacks too . the good thing is that our mother nature has still not stopped supplying them to us that thankfully have a long history of safe use . moreover , most of them have proven their capabilities and competency level really well in whatever tasks they were assigned in our bodies . ",
        "in this post , we will know some more facts and details regarding three of the most powerful natural fibres and the names are -- psyllium husk , inulin and glucomannan . psyllium husk · according to the dieticians and fitness experts across the globe , psyllium husk is perhaps the most well-known supplementary source of natural dietary fibre . · moreover , it is an active ingredient in popular fibre supplements like metamucil , fybogel and serutan . · doctors and other medical experts have been using it to treat a wide range of common digestive ailments like diarrhoea , irritable bowel syndrome , etc. · moreover , it is also very commonly used to assist daily digestion in healthy individuals by providing the gastrointestinal tract with a steady volume of bulky matter .

        "· this husk is harvested from the seeds of psyllium plant that is also called `` plantago ovato '' . · they are made up of water soluble material that becomes large and slimy when contacted with water . · this fact makes it an excellent source of dietary fibre that is considered equally good and effective , regardless of what 's the person 's diet is and what 's his current medical condition is . inulin · the next thing we are going to discuss in this post is `` inulin '' that is totally different from the one discussed above . ",
        "· while psyllium is harvested from just one kind of plant , this one is a relatively common fibre found in the roots and tubers of several plants . · this component is actually used by plants to store energy throughout the year and is only found in starch-free plants . · this is basically a source of water soluble material that comes with a huge plethora of useful health related benefits . · the best part is that unlike others , it has a really little impact on the body 's blood sugar . · this makes it an excellent natural supplement for those having complaints like diabetes , high blood sugar , etc. · moreover , inulin also has properties that help the metabolism absorb calcium and magnesium more effectively .

        "glucomannan · unlike those two discussed above , this one is a somewhat less common source of dietary fibre . · you will see it being marketed by several different companies under different brand names as remedies for many different conditions . · basically , it is harvested from the roots of konjac plant that is a hardy perennial native to southeast asia . · moreover , it is used in a whole plethora of regional cuisines as a matter of fact that it has numerous purported health related benefits . · the dietary fibre found in glucomannan is soluble in water , but this material does not dissolve in water as quickly as other natural fibres .
