        "john fordhamjazz cd of the monthmusic is `` essentially powerless to express anything at all '' wrote igor stravinsky in 1935 . it 's a sentiment that appeals to the many who reckon that draping verbal backstories over the detours and dances of abstract sound is just clutching at existential straws . it also fits with the work of prizewinning young british pianist/composer elliot galvin -- contemporary jazz that moves between inviting lyricism and explosive edginess , much like that of his musical soulmate and most famous associate , trumpeter laura jurd . galvin 's music rattles along just fine as a fascinating sonic tumult without the need for any explanations -- but he likes his non-musical inspirations to be hovering in the background nonetheless . ",
        "childhood memories of margate 's famous amusement park featured on his debut album , dreamland , and its successor punch -- and on his new release the spark is the chequered life and trailblazing illness of 18th-century double agent , philosopher , polymath and first-recorded paranoid schizophrenic james tilly matthews . galvin takes his title , the influencing machine , from contemporary writer mike jay 's account of tilly matthews ' life . tilly matthews believed his life was being controlled by machines , and , in a 21st century on the brink of ai , galvin wanted his project to reflect `` the parallels between the life and times of james tilly matthews and the modern world '' . ",
        "robotic struttings mingle with cool jazz-making from galvin on piano , synths and childrens ' toy instruments , with his long-running trio of tom mccredie and simon roth . ringing , rubbed-wineglass sounds usher in sombrely harmonious piano moods and bleepy old-school electronic patterns contrast with keith jarrett-like piano eloquence , often spun off wacky rhythms . hi-life guitar vamps , early sci-fi analogue synth sounds , or vocal clips such as vintage bbc radio announcements pepper free-improv streams , while the triumphantly funky red and yellow shows just how irresistibly galvin can generate grooves to dance to , and monster mind is scary madness-mimicry in its alternations of snaredrum-slamming bravura and skidding-violins paranoia . ",
        "the constant juggling of catchy grooves and jagged improv becomes a slightly overfamiliar device , but the set is right in elliot galvin 's ballpark of brilliantly executed bright ideas and witty diversions . best of the resta reminder of the enduring class of eminent reeds-playing british composer john surman appears this month with invisible threads -- featuring a new trio with oslo-based us vibraphonist rob waring and south american pianist nelson ayres in seductive segues of soft brazilian rhythms , cantering marimba sounds , and the warm-sunset swing of surman 's smoky baritone sax on the title track . ",
        "more accessibly worldly but just as subtly wrought is the radio . string . quartet cellist asja valcic 's and accordionist klaus paier 's cinema scenes -- a luxurious movie-music mix of heated tangos , cool swaying on astor piazzolla 's inspired tale , and playful walking swing on griet 's theme , from girl with a pearl earring . valcic 's warmth and paier 's scything drive make a captivating match .
