        "the announcement by congressman darrell issa on wednesday that he is retiring brings to 31 the number of open seats held by republicans in the 2018 midterm elections . democrats need to win 25 seats to take control of the house of representatives . the unprecedented number of republican retirements , which includes the sitting chairmen of eight different congressional committees , is a bad omen for the speaker , paul ryan , as he seeks to keep control of the lower chamber . so far , five republicans representing districts where hillary clinton won in 2016 are not seeking re-election this year . ",
        "four of them , including issa , are retiring . the fifth , martha mcsally of arizona , is seeking the state 's open senate seat in a competitive primary against tea partier kelli ward and controversial former sheriff joe arpaio . issa had the closest race of any member of congress in 2016 . he beat his democratic opponent doug applegate by 1,600 votes in a district that swung heavily against republicans in the presidential race . clinton won by seven points in a district that republican mitt romney won by a similar margin in 2012 . issa 's retirement is a major blow to house republicans in a district that analysts had considered a toss-up . ",
        "not only was issa a nine-term incumbent but as one of the richest members of congress , he was able to self-fund his campaign . his decision not to seek another term makes him the second swing-district california republican to retire in the past week . on monday , ed royce , the chairman of the house foreign relations committee , announced he too would retire . royce , a 13-term incumbent , represents a district where clinton won by nearly 10 points in 2016 . both california republicans are victims of the changing political demographics of the state . ",
        "they both represent parts of orange county , the once deep-red bastion of suburban conservatism that has undergone a transformation in recent years . in 2016 , clinton became the first democrat to win there since franklin roosevelt in 1936 . however , republicans see a silver lining in the sheer number of democratic challengers in some of these races . as the washington post reported earlier in january , there are more republican-held districts with eight democratic hopefuls than with only one . republicans hope to take advantage of democratic infighting to win . in a statement following issa 's retirement , steve stivers , the head of the national republican congressional committee , said : `` in the 49th district , democrats are locked in what is fast becoming one of the bloodiest primaries in america . ",
        "while democrats fight with each other , republicans will focus on fighting democrats -- and that 's how we plan to win . we look forward to facing whoever limps out of the democrats ' battle royale : black and blue , and broke . '' in contrast , democrats saw opportunity in the golden state 's changing politics . `` california republicans clearly see the writing on the wall and realize that their party and its priorities are toxic to their re-election chances in 2018 , '' said drew godinich , a spokesman for the democratic congressional campaign committee in a statement .
