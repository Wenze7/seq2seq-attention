        "the biggest breakout star in star wars : the last jedi is also one of the smallest : the porg . the wide-eyed avian creatures , which are native to luke skywalker 's planet ahch-to , became an internet sensation after making their galactic debut in the first trailer for the upcoming film . in people 's new special issue star wars : the ultimate guide to the last jedi and an exclusive peopletv special , people spoke with creature supervisor neal scanlan to learn anything and everything we can about the cutest new members of the galaxy , far , far away . ",
        "here are 5 things to know about the porgs ahead of the dec. . 15 release of the last jedi : 1 . they were inspired by a cross between a puffin , seal and pug dog -- and stand 10 inches tall . `` riann johnson had already written them into the script and named them porgs , '' says scanlan . `` when you say the word ` porg ' it sort of suggests something to you . it 's a lovely rounded name . riann told us they were supposed to be very puffin-like , they 're a cross between a puffin , a seal and a pug dog . '' ",
        "`` we did many , many drawings and eventually one of our concept designers literally drew a sort of little potato with a pair of legs and some big eyes on it -- very little detail other than that , just a little tail at the back , '' he continued . `` we all felt ` wow , that 's gorgeous . ' when riann saw it he said , ` that 's it . that 's what was in my mind . ' `` 2 . one of the porgs befriends chewbacca . `` the last jedi is a film about friendship as much as anything else . ",
        "there 's a wonderful friendship that we have n't really seen before and it involves chewbacca . along comes this little character and i think presses a few emotional button in chewie that we have n't seen before . there 's a wonderful moment in the film where they meet . '' `` the porg that befriends chewbacca is actually very wookie-inspired . his feathers and his coat are very similar to chewie 's and we tried to put some little subtle changes into that particular porg to make you kind of go , ` oh my gosh that 's a little bit like chewy ! ' ",
        "so we called him the chewie porg . 3 . they are known for being ` overly inquisitive ' and ` mischievous . ' `` the porgs were designed to be almost slightly irritating in the sense that they are numerous and they tend to be overly inquisitive , they 're mischievous , '' says scanlan . `` this film is i 'm sure going to be quite an emotional and visual rollercoaster and the porgs can provide a moment of respite , a little moment where you can reset yourself , ready for what is about to come and enjoy them on that pure level . '' ",
        "4 . it was porg-mania on set . `` for every porg that you see on the screen there was probably ten or so porgs made in order to be able to achieve that , '' says scanlan . `` because of the limitations of the size of the porg , we could only do so many things . so for instance , if we see in one moment a little porg pulling one expression , we can vary that expression to some extent but if there 's an extreme change in the next cut , that will probably be a new porg . '' ",
        "5 . everyone loves the porgs ! `` i 'm over the moon that they 've been so warmly received and tthat they 've been welcomed into the world and star wars family by everybody , '' he says . `` i mean , honestly , you have n't seen anything yet . they are absolutely going to win everybody 's hearts . '' star wars : the last jedi hits theaters dec. . 15 .   "
