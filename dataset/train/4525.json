        "the eu on friday ordered the international skating union to change rules that prevent speed skaters competing in non-isu competitions , in a decision that could set a precedent for other sports . the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , said the isu must scrap `` disproportionately punitive '' penalties aimed at preventing athletes from taking part in lucrative events not under its own jurisdiction . the decision has been compared to the landmark 1995 ruling involving belgian footballer jean-marc bosman , which allowed players to move more freely between clubs in the european union and is largely credited with inflating transfer fees . ",
        "the isu hit back , saying it strongly disagreed with the commission 's ruling , adding : `` the decision fails to consider the specific nature of sport by putting commercial interests ahead of the principles of integrity , health and safety that protect fair play in sport . `` but european commissioner margrethe vestager , in charge of competition policy , said while international sports federations did have an important role to play protecting competitors ' health and safety , their behaviour was restrictive . `` the severe penalties the international skating union imposes on skaters also serve to protect its own commercial interests and prevent others from setting up their own events , '' she said . ",
        "`` the isu now has to comply with our decision , modify its rules , and open up new opportunities for athletes and competing organisers , to the benefit of all ice skating fans . `` the skating federation also argued that it did not ban independent bodies from organising events `` provided the organisers adhere to the isu 's relevant standards '' . the focus of the issue is competitions organised by companies from south korea , the host nation of the 2018 winter olympics where speed skating is extremely popular . the commission ruling followed a complaint by dutch olympic gold medal-winning speed skater mark tuitert and international teammate niels kerstholt who were threatened with a ban for life if they took part in events run by a south korean company . ",
        "the commission said the isu 's policy `` has limited the development of alternative and innovative speed skating competitions , and deprived ice-skating fans from following other events '' .   "
