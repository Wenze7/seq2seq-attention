        "travel chaos is expected due to a large fire at nottingham train station - this is what you should doaston villa fans have been warned not to travel by train to tomorrow 's clash with nottingham foresta huge fire at the station caused chaos on friday and the facility , as well as nearby roads , were closed . police are now saying that there will be serious disruptions at the station tomorrow and have warned all travellers to avoid it . villa take on nottingham forest at the city ground at 5:30 pm on saturday and a large chunk of the away supporters were planning to travel by train . ",
        "but the station is unlikely to be open by tomorrow , and even if it does open , there will not be a full service operating . getty images europesupt sandra england said : `` due to the ongoing emergency response to the fire at nottingham railway station , there are unlikely to be trains running to and from the station tomorrow . `` even if some trains are running by tomorrow , there will be an extremely limited service with many delays , cancellations and overcrowding . `` rather than taking a chance and heading to the station to pack yourself onto a crowded train , or worse , find that you ca n't travel at all , please make alternative travel arrangements in advance . ",
        "`` we want everyone to be able to get to the football without the stress of a difficult journey . please start making alternative travel plans now so that you can enjoy your weekend . '' the blaze caused major disruption on friday and at its peak 10 fire crews were tackling the fire , which began at about 6:30 am . flames were seen coming from the station 's roof and smoke filled the foyer , prompting the building 's evacuation . transfer newsaston villa are hoping to seal a deal for manchester united youngster axel tuanzebe . the 20-year-old is equally comfortable playing in defence or midfield and manager steve bruce is understood to have been tracking him for a number of weeks . ",
        "bruce confirmed during his press conference this morning that he was close to completing his first signing of the transfer window and tuanzebe is believed to be his man . `` until we 've got them over the line , out of respect for the clubs we 're talking to i ca n't really reveal it , '' he said . tuanzebe has made three appearances for united this season in wins over swansea city , cska moscow and everton and has a further five appearances to his name dating back to his united debut last season . bruce enjoys a fantastic working relationship with united boss jose mourinho and already has goalkeeper sam johnstone on loan from old trafford . ",
        "if villa can force the tuanzebe deal through he will become bruce 's fourth loan signing this term following on from johnstone , josh onomah and robert snodgrass ' summer arrivals . transfer rumour : tottenham hotspur chasing aston villa acemore transfer newssteve bruce ` will listen to offers ' for midfielder aaron tshibola as clubs prepare to make their move for aston villa 's forgotten man . the 23-year-old has only played 10 times for villa since arriving for Â£ 5million from reading in 2016 and is expected to depart this month and the club are understood to have fielded enquiries . ",
        "tshibola was sent back from a loan spell at mk dons in november having failed to make a lasting impression at stadium mk . his stint with the league one side follows another unsuccessful loan with nottingham forest where he only played four times in five months . and villa are now looking to offload tshibola once again with another temporary move most likely . asked specifically about tshibola 's situation , bruce told us : `` he needs to go and play , that 's for sure . we will listen to offers for him . there 's one or two things bubbling away . '' ",
        "tshibola started bruce 's first game in charge at villa park against wolves before spending the next three months on the peripheries . the former royals man made a rare outing for vila 's under-23s on monday as they were defeated 3-1 by fulham , but it 's first team minutes he needs . `` it has n't gone well for him at mk dons , '' bruce added . `` he will say , to be fair to him , that he played out of position . we 're not making excuses for that . however , he 's still only young and the burden of a big money move to aston villa possibly was too big for him . ",
        "`` he 's got to go and establish himself . it 's a waste of time him playing under-23 football so if there 's a club out there for somebody like him , we 'll take it . ''   "
