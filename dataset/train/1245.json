        "jonathan huberdeau nets his fourth goal in three games as the panthers go on to defeat the flyers 3-2 . sunrise , fla. . -- the philadelphia flyers and florida panthers , both only five games from the halfway point of the regular season , already find themselves in trouble in the eastern conference standings . the flyers have lost three of their past four games and sit six points out of playoff position . florida has won three games in a row , but the panthers have dug themselves a serious hole in the standings . they are nine points out of playoff position . ",
        "on thursday night , the panthers will host the flyers at the bb&t center in a game between teams desperate for points . the panthers , at least , have played well lately , and much of the credit goes to backup goalie james reimer , who has started nine consecutive games in place of injured starter roberto luongo . `` i think it 's a matter of settling in , '' reimer said after florida beat the ottawa senators 1-0 on saturday night . that was the last game played by the panthers , who took off for the holidays knowing they finally hit their stride . ",
        "in the two games prior to ottawa , florida beat the arizona coyotes 3-2 and the minnesota wild 4-2 . add it up , and reimer has allowed just five goals in his past three games . for the season , he is 9-9-4 with a 3.15 goals-against average and a . 908 save percentage . `` i 've tried to keep it simple , and i think that 's helped me , '' reimer said . `` i 've felt good the past couple of games , seeing the puck . `` the ottawa game was reimer 's first shutout of the season , and he said there was a certain amount of good fortune involved . ",
        "`` there were a couple of posts and a couple of big blocks when had open nets , '' reimer said . `` anytime you get a shutout , it 's indicative of how hard your teammates work in front of you . `` the panthers enter the thursday game fairly healthy , although two players are questionable to suit up against the flyers : defenseman ian mccoshen and forward jamie mcginn . both missed the past two games because of upper-body injuries . other than reimer , the three hottest panthers at the moment are centers vincent trocheck and jonathan huberdeau , who are tied for the team lead with 35 points , and aleksander barkov . ",
        "huberdeau and trocheck , who plays on the second line , lead florida with 14 goals . as for the flyers , goalie brian elliott is expected to start thursday , and he has been solid with a 13-8-7 record , a 2.59 gaa and . 916 save percentage . in philadelphia 's most recent game , elliott made 35 saves but lost 2-1 in a shootout at the columbus blue jackets on saturday . the only goal allowed by elliott was on a power play . much like reimer , elliott has been playing heavy minutes with 11 straight starts . ",
        "his main backup , michal neuvirth , is out with an injury . flyers coach dave hakstol seemed satisfied with not just elliott but everyone on his roster after the tough loss to columbus . `` we got a real good effort , '' hakstol said . true , the flyers picked up a point , but they also will need to pick up the pace if they are to get into the postseason . the flyers ' top three scorers are right winger jakub voracek , center claude giroux and center sean couturier . giroux has been particularly hot with 14 points , including 12 assists , in his past nine games . ",
        "in addition to those veterans , the flyers are also breaking in three rookies this season : center nolan patrick and defensemen robert hagg and travis sanheim . patrick , the second overall pick in the 2017 draft , has two goals and five assists in 27 games .   "
