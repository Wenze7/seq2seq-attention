        "we begin where left off last week : two friends pitted against one another . wes describes the game before the elimination as pull ups for fat people as he only has to go down . in the elimination , wes beats romeo because he weighs more and because he is smarter . wes stiffens his body and shifts his weight one side when he tries to make his moves or when romeo pulls against him . by putting all his weight to one side , romeo now has to try and pull wes 's entire weight and the force of his grip holding down . ",
        "it is a quick and easy win for wes . he is a 4 -- 0 in spin-off eliminations with wins against bananas , jordan , a silver medal olympian , and a college basketball player . post elimtori shows up as a replacement for camila , ashley , and jenna . since the champs only had six players , adding her makes sense . adding her episode four of what is supposedly a six or eight episode series is head-scratching . the stars deal with the aftermath of riff raff ditching elimination . he plays off dumb in order to avoid any serious discussion , saying amnesia runs in his family . ",
        "the challengethey are playing soccer with a gigantic ball similar to a big rubber medicine ball , and then you multiply the size of it by ten . the games gets heated as players getting whacked by the ball like it is a car coming at them . one of the funny moments in the game is matt complaining about taking a forearm to a face . he says he is used to coming from regulated sports with rules ... sorry , if you ever played real sports , hits like that come natural to the game , any complaints are usually excuses . ",
        "there are two main x factors for the champs , one being they have an extra male competitor , and the second one being zach as the strongest , fastest , and tallest guy on the field . zach has easily been the greatest addition to this champs vs pros team compared to the first series . darrell/ct overlap when it comes to skills , so by adding zach who gives them an anchor of someone who is the biggest/fastest guy in any game they play is massive . the champs were playing with two power forwards , and now they have a power forward and a center . ",
        "after holding a 3 -- 0 lead in the first half against the stars , the champs turned up the heat to win the game 8 -- 0 . the champs award aneesa mvp as she was the only female competitor to score a goal . pre-nominationsaneesa decides to nominate tori as it is only fair she play catch up , after they head for the pool . while at the pool , the champs get in the ear of justina and tell her she has been their best player and they have no team comradery . meanwhile , alliances between the stars team are emerging . ",
        "josh , kim , and shawn align themselves as they see each other as their best players , they also dislike justin associating herself so much with the champs . in retaliation to their alliance , michelle/justina/ariane all align . both groups attempt to recruit matt to their alliance . in the voting , the two alliances split into a 3 -- 3 vote for shawn and ariane . riff `` wes bergmann 2.0 '' raff throws out a burn vote on kim in hilarious fashion . josh murray shows his inner tool self when he gets mad at michelle for voting for shawn , saying she is afraid . ",
        "with the final deciding vote , matt choose shawn , looking out for himself and the alliance that can take him far . wes is incredibly proud of the stars playing the game . the elimination is tori deal vs shawn johnson . eliminationhere is the game , the players get two rings , and they have to wrap their hoop over an opponent 's body . tori is 5 ' 8 , while shawn is 5 ' 0 . it 's not even a battle as tori is bigger , faster , stronger , and has the longer reach . ",
        "she takes the 3 -- 0 win . it looks like the champs might actually lose next week .   "
