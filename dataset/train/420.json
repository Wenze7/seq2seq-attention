        "bitcoin has seen an amazing rise in 2017 , handily beating returns from all other asset classes as the value of 1 bitcoin has risen from a $ 992.95 closing price on january 1 , 2017 to the current value of $ 12,875 on december 6 , 2017 . that 's better than 1,200 % in one year , and since the year is n't over yet we could see additional gains by december 31 , 2017 . by contrast , the s&p 500 is up by just 17 % and the value of gold is up just 9.9 % . ",
        "bitcoin has been known to gain that much in a single weekend , indeed in a single day in some cases . given the spectacular gains from bitcoin , it 's no surprise that investors are increasingly turning their attention to bitcoin . the search term `` bitcoin '' is now the most search for on google , and we are on the verge of seeing bitcoin futures contracts being traded on the cboe and cme , with similar plans for bitcoin futures coming from japan , and from the nasdaq . all of this interest from institutional investors is certain to have a huge impact on bitcoin and the overall cryptocurrency markets . ",
        "let 's look deeper . bitcoin becoming a mainstream investmentcertainly the emergence of bitcoin futures highlights its move into the mainstream of the financial world as an investment . while media recently has focused on the launch of bitcoin futures , it 's not as well known that 2017 saw the emergence of dozens of cryptocurrency focused hedge funds . according to autonomous next , a financial technology research house , 84 so-called crypto hedge funds have been launched this year , taking the total to 110 with about $ 2.2 billion in assets altogether . private banks are also showing interest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as an investment alternative for their high-net-worth clients . ",
        "leading this charge are the private swiss banks , with falcon bank beginning to provide bitcoin asset management to clients this past july , and swissquote launching an actively managed bitcoin fund in november . november also saw europe get its first bitcoin mutual fund after french investment firm tobam launched the tobam bitcoin fund on november 22 . it 's hard to imagine that the u. s. and japan will be far behind in launching their own bitcoin focused mutual funds , and once bitcoin has become accepted as a mainstream financial asset , it ca n't be long until funds begin investing in the smaller , and more volatile , altcoins such as ethereum , litecoin , monero , dash , neo , iota and hundreds of others . ",
        "driving all of this will be the bitcoin futures products to be released this month , which will allow these types of hedge funds , mutual funds , and other investment vehicles to hedge their risks in the cryptocurrency markets . this is actually the most interesting aspect of the release of bitcoin futures , and i imagine it will open the floodgates of retail and institutional money into bitcoin in the coming years . in fact , td ameritrade , with nearly 7 million funded trading accounts , has already announced they will begin offering bitcoin futures trading to their customers immediately . ",
        "`` what 's exciting to us about it is it provides a two-sided market . with natural buyers and sellers , that helps to put a more reasonable volatility on the product . '' -- jj kinahan , chief market strategist at td ameritradeinstitutional money in bitcoinit 's hard to say how much money institutional investors have put into cryptocurrencies to date . it 's very likely that bitcoin has seen billions of institutional money flowing in over the past week in anticipation of the launch of bitcoin futures . i do n't think the massive run-up in price can be explained in any other way , as i do n't believe individuals have been putting that much additional capital into cryptocurrencies . ",
        "we can make a good estimate of the holdings of the current crop of cryptocurrency hedge funds though . based on estimates from autonomous research , the current 110 cryptocurrency hedge funds have a combined $ 2.2 billion in assets under management . that means with bitcoin 's current market cap of $ 232 billion these funds have just a bit less than 1 % of the bitcoin in circulation . there are other funds that have publically stated they are adding bitcoin to their portfolio allocations throughout 2017 . these funds more than likely do n't make up more than another 1 % of the total supply of bitcoin . ",
        "and even if the total investment by hedge funds and the like equals $ 20 billion , that 's still less than 10 % of the current supply of bitcoins , and far less than these funds have at their disposal . the upshot of that is that there is a mountain of money that could still come into bitcoin and cryptocurrencies . mainstream media may be crying about a bitcoin bubble , but the truth of the matter is that bitcoin likely is just getting started , with such a small amount of institutional money currently involved with cryptocurrencies . ",
        "consider this 2011 study by the london bullion market association showing the daily trading volume in gold only on the london exchange is roughly $ 240 billion -- the same as the market cap of bitcoin currently . daily trading volume in bitcoin is currently a bit over $ 5 billion per day . what if the trading volume in bitcoin matched that of gold ? i think that says all that needs to be said about the coming power of institutional money and bitcoin . originally published at coinbeginners . com on december 7 , 2017 .
