        "vancouver -- the st. louis blues put a damper on brock boeser 's milestone night . kyle brodziak scored the winner and added an assist as st. louis snapped a three-game losing streak with saturday 's 3-1 victory over the slumping vancouver canucks . patrik berglund and alex steen , into an empty net , had the other goals for st. louis , which got 30 saves from jake allen . boeser , with his team-leading 20th of the season , replied for vancouver , which has lost four in a row , and is just 1-7-1 over its last nine . ",
        "the 20-year-old boeser leads all nhl rookies in goals , and became the fastest canucks rookie to reach the 20-goal mark , doing it in just his 34th game . `` it means a lot , but it 's obviously a lot better if we 're getting the results we want , '' said boeser , who has 24 goals in 43 career games after his cameo at the tail end of last season . `` it 's a tough stretch right now . this break will be nice to regroup . '' it took pavel bure 49 games to reach 20 goals in his rookie season with vancouver in 1991-92 . ",
        "to put boeser 's impressive start another way , canucks no . 1 centre bo horvat -- currently out with a broken foot -- led the team with 20 goals in 81 games last season . boeser is also fifth in the nhl in goals so far in 2017-18 , trailing just nikita kucherov , alex ovechkin , anders lee and john tavares . `` it 's impressive , '' said vancouver head coach travis green . `` his details away from the puck are a big part of why he 's having success . '' jacob markstrom stopped 31 shots for the canucks , but allowed suspect goals to berglund and brodziak -- a trend that 's plagued the club during its current slide . ",
        "`` it 's tough when you lose a game ... and you want both goals back , '' said markstrom . `` i 've got to be better . '' the blues , meanwhile , head into the break with a much-needed win after dropping three straight in regulation on a road trip through western canada . `` we knew we were n't far off , '' said st. louis head coach mike yeo . `` it 's been a grind . i 'm glad the guys get a little time to rest up physically and mentally . '' tied 1-1 late in the second , brodziak put the blues ahead after firing a puck from the bottom of the face-off circle that somehow slipped past markstrom shortside with 90 seconds left in the period for his sixth . ",
        "`` he had a couple that he 'd like to have back , '' green said of his goalie . `` he 's played really well at times this year . he 's fighting that one goal here and there . '' markstrom was stellar for most of the period otherwise , stopping both steen and paul stastny on breakaways before again thwarting steen with a nice save moments after his gaffe on brodziak . st. louis hit the post three times in third period , while boeser had two good chances off the rush that had rogers arena buzzing , but allen was there to make the save both times -- including the second one where the blues netminder just got a piece of the puck with his left shoulder . ",
        "`` watching some tape , he 's got such a hard and good release that i do n't think it 's a reactionary save , '' said allen . `` it 's a positional save . if you try to wave your glove at it , he 's probably going to beat you most of the time . `` there are guys like that in the league that you more or less have to be positioned , and he 's one of those guys . he 's got a bunch of goals for a reason . he 's got a great shot . '' ",
        "the canucks continued to push , but could n't find a way through before steen scored into an empty net with 52.3 seconds left as st. louis improved to 19-0-0 this season when leading after 40 minutes . down 1-0 after the first , boeser evened things at 1:46 of the second on a slick passing play where sam gagner fed thomas vanek , who went back against the grain to find the wide-open phenom . '' is such a good playmaker , '' said boeser . `` i knew he was going to pass it to me there because i skate with him in the summers . ",
        "`` i 've just got to learn from him now and make some of those passes . '' the blues opened the scoring at 11:17 of a sleepy first when berglund wheeled out of the corner and let go a fluttering backhand from the high slot that beat markstrom for his fifth . `` i just kind of fanned on it , '' said markstrom . `` it 's on me . '' vancouver had another great opportunity later in the period , but alex biega found iron on a shot from the point , and markus granlund hit the other post on the rebound before allen smothered the puck on the goal line . ",
        "`` it 's a fine line between winning and losing , '' said green . `` that was a hard-fought game . '' probably could have gone either way , and we 're on the wrong side of it . '' -- . follow @jclipperton_cp on twitter . joshua clipperton , the canadian press .   "
