        "star wars : the last jedi has officially crossed the $ 1bn mark . deadline has reported the film grossed $ 1.04 bn through last sunday , making it the 32nd film to have ever landed the achievement , and the fourth to have done so this year , alongside the likes of beauty and the beast , the fate of the furious , and despicable me 3 . comparatively to the rest of the franchise , it 's currently running 36 % ahead of last year 's rogue one , but 35 % behind the force awakens . this is likely close to what disney was expecting ; the last jedi running behind its predecessor makes sense considering what a unique cinematic event it was , the first star wars in a decade . ",
        "whether the last jedi was expected to lag less behind the force awakens is up for debate , however , making it harder to discern exactly how much of success the film is . it 's certainly holding up well , dipping just 12 % from last weekend and with several markets even seeing increases , including france and germany . the film 's done particularly well in the uk , where it 's approaching a milestone with its significant $ 91.5 m . the film also passed the $ 100m global mark in imax box office , becoming the 8th film ever to do so and the second fastest to reach that number , after the force awakens .
