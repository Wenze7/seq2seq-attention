        "an inmate at the u. s. detention facility at guantanamo bay is still being tortured , the un special rapporteur on torture nils melzer said in a statement wednesday . former president barack obama ended the use of `` enhanced interrogation techniques '' with an executive order in january 2009 , but melzer said the historic use of torture in cia custody had not yet led to prosecutions or compensation for victims . `` by failing to prosecute the crime of torture in cia custody , the u. s. is in clear violation of the convention against torture and is sending a dangerous message of complacency and impunity to officials in the u. s. and around the world , '' melzer said in the statement . ",
        "the statement cited the case of ammar al-baluchi , an inmate at the u. s.-controlled centre at guantanamo bay , cuba , `` where his torture and ill-treatment are reported to continue . '' it said al-baluchi was named 153 times in the u. s. senate 's 2014 `` torture report , '' the result of a six-year investigation into so-called enhanced interrogation techniques used by the cia after the sept. . 11 , 2001 , attacks . he was said to have suffered relentless torture for 3 1/2 years at cia `` black sites '' before being moved to guantanamo , the un statement said . ",
        "it did not give details of the source of the information about the continuing torture of al-baluchi , who had been in isolation at a severely restricted-access facility at guantanamo bay for more than a decade . `` in addition to the long-term effects of past torture , noise and vibrations are reportedly still being used against him , resulting in constant sleep deprivation and related physical and mental disorders , for which he allegedly does not receive adequate medical attention . '' melzer said the ban on torture and ill-treatment was one of the most fundamental norms of international law and could not be justified in any circumstances . ",
        "he said he had renewed a long-standing request to visit guantanamo bay to interview inmates , but he and his predecessors in the role had consistently been denied access . there was no immediate comment from u. s. officials in geneva . there are just over 40 detainees being held at the facility after several were deported in the final years of obama 's second term . president donald trump , in contrast to obama , has expressed enthusiasm for holding militants charged in attacks at guantanamo as opposed to prosecuting them through u. s. criminal courts . al-baluchi , from yemen , is the nephew of 9/11 plotter khalid sheikh mohammed . ",
        "he was among those detainees whose artwork was recently displayed at a midtown manhattan gallery , the result of a department of defence initiative established in 2009 to help prevent further radicalization .   "
