        "liam payne admits performing on stage as a solo artist is more challenging than being in a group . the 24-year-old singer is currently pursuing a career as a solo performer , having first found fame as part of one direction , and liam has acknowledged the differences in an instagram post . liam - who starred at wembley stadium in london earlier this year - wrote on the photo-sharing website : `` i 've got to perform to some amazing crowds this year , starting with 80,000 people at wembley stadium ! with the boys you had the chance to bounce off each other , when you 're on your own it 's just you and you have to get out and just do it ! ",
        "each venue was different but the crowds brought it and helped me give the best performances i could ! `` this comes shortly after liam admitted to being proud of his fellow one direction members , all of whom have pursued solo projects since the band announced they were taking a break . the ` strip that down ' hitmaker also suggested he was surprised by the success that he and his fellow bandmates had enjoyed since they went their separate ways . liam - who also revealed he 's looking forward to eventually being reunited with his bandmates - previously said : `` i ca n't believe the band are breaking records nearly every week while we 're on hiatus . ",
        "it 's quite insane . `` but it makes me more proud to be a part of it and i ca n't wait for the comeback . ''   "
