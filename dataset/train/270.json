        "the first fully-certified electric taxis can now be flagged down on the streets on london . the rollout of the so-called tx ecity london taxi from the london electric vehicle company will be gradual , with only a handful of the new taxis on the road today . but the levc hopes the number of electric taxis operating across london will grow to the hundreds by january . i was able to drive and ride as a passenger in the tx taxi on a trip around london . the difference between the tx and london 's traditional black cabs is stark . ",
        "london taxis are known for being loud . partly because they are noisy diesels , and partly due to the clanging vibrations . they 're so loud that it can be difficult to hold a conversation . in contrast , the tx taxi is quiet and smooth . four of us seated in the back were able to talk without once raising our voices . the taxi is spacious and is bigger than it looks from the outside . it has six seats and is wheelchair accessible . the best part of being a passenger in one of these taxis is the panoramic sunroof , which , when you look up , lets you peer at the skyline . ",
        "it 's a nice touch and makes me realize how much detail of the world you miss out on when you have the usual blank canvas roof over your head . there 's a usb charging port for your smartphone , a full-size power socket if you need to work on your laptop , and free wi-fi . you control how warm or cool you want the taxi with the climate controls near the door handle , and there 's a button you press to speak with the driver , which can be switched off for privacy . payment can be made via cash or card and fares are the same as diesel taxis . ",
        "after riding , it was my turn to drive on a quiet street in regent 's park . i 've never driven a taxi before , so i did n't know what to expect . it was somewhat intuitive , because everything is automatic . the steering is super smooth and you barely feel the vehicle 's bulk . it 's easily the biggest car i 've ever driven , but also the smoothest . the steering is light , even possibly lighter than the toyota corolla i 'm used to driving . the driver also has access to a central console that has a satellite navigation system , and includes options to check road information like speed limits , lane departure warnings , and car stats -- everything is literally at your fingertips . ",
        "there are sensors mounted on the windshield to identify potential dangers , parking sensors , a rear camera , and a warning system with the aeb that activates brakes to avoid collision . with a 50kw rapid charge , the battery powers up to 80 percent in 25 minutes . the tx also has the option for a range extender 1.5-liter petrol engine for use when the driver wants to conserve the battery . it has three different modes -- smart , pure ev , and save that adjust the usage of battery and gasoline power . levc 's taxi allows for a range of over 650 km , including over 120 km using battery power . ",
        "lecv says driving a tx taxi equates to £ 100 in fuel cost savings per week . the taxis were also tested in the sweltering heat of the arizona desert and in frigid , icy conditions in the arctic circle . `` we 're trying to take them to all these extremes to make sure the vehicle is good and does everything it needs to do , wherever it 's sold in the world , '' eddie martin , development manager for the tx program , says . `` more and more cities want electric-only vehicles so that there 's no emissions in the city itself , and that 's one of the things this vehicle is capable of doing . '' ",
        "the urgency to meet regulatory demands that combat pollution is driving the push for greener taxis in london . the transport for london has a january 1st , 2018 deadline for all newly licensed taxis to be zero-emission capable . tfl has committed to installing 150 rapid charge points for taxis by the end of 2018 . levc opened a £ 325 million plant in coventry where the electric taxi is being manufactured , and it 's the first of its kind in the uk . the taxis are on sale now in london , and will roll out to overseas markets in early 2018 . ",
        "the netherlands has already ordered 225 vehicles . during my passenger experience , i met john dowd , a taxi driver with nearly a decade of experience . six weeks ago , dowd began to test out levc 's new zero-emission taxi on his route . he says he 's been blown away by the driving experience in comparison to his regular diesel cab . `` the driving position , the power , the silence , the smoothness of the delivery and just the ease of use is just incomparable with anything i 've ever driven before , '' dowd says . ",
        "`` navigating traffic on london 's roads , it 's a piece of cake . it 's easier . '' he says the experience has changed his perspective . `` when i got into and started it up , i could n't understand what had happened . it was like getting back into a tractor , '' dowd says . `` talk about coming back down to earth with a bang ! it was just a vast , vast difference .
