        "i was a bad girl last year . i 'm no stranger to the pull of minimalism ; i went through a purge of my belongings in 2014 , embraced the 100 thing challenge since 2015 , flirted with the idea of a tiny home or living in an airstream , derek shepherd-style , and have constantly been mesmerized by the idea of a capsule wardrobe and owning fewer things that i love more . i suppose i was able to thrive with so little on the road because i 'd been trained to live with less . it was easy to wear the same clothing everyday , but i could tell my brain craved a sprinkle of variety . ",
        "having lived out of essentially one t-shirt for the bulk of 2016 and early 2017 , i was eager to freshen up my wardrobe upon my return to regular life . it was going to be a fresh start : no longer sporting the bum-athleisure-backpacker look , i was going to appear normal at last ! and so i went on a bit of a shopping spree ; first in japan , picking up four new tops all at once , quickly followed by a pair of high waisted black jeans , then deciding i needed a summer jacket for sf , a winter parka for chicago , tights for dresses in the winter , a pair of black booties so i would n't have to take off my riding boots going through tsa , plus winter accessories such as a balaclava mask . ",
        "not to mention all of my skincare hauls ; my 3-item sunscreen-olive oil-moisturizer routine rapidly expanded into 1 facial oil , 2 watery lotions , 1 aha , 1 bha , 1 clay mask , 1 fte , and 5 packages of hydrocolloid patches . looking at this summary , which captures all of my major purchases during the year , it does n't seem like that much , but i still feel like i 'm spiraling out of control . as 2017 came to an end , i 've noticed this habit has gotten much worse : i found myself spending a terrible amount of time window shopping online , endlessly browsing catalogs and bookmarking items that i tricked myself into thinking that i needed . ",
        "ignoring the dollar amount spent for a moment , i am more concerned with why i have this self-cultivated need to shop . i think i 've pinpointed it down to two reasons : i 'm rebelling against my single t-shirt wardrobe and we 've `` nested '' into a single spot , thus becoming less mobile . i think much less about the weight of my possessions when i 'm not carrying the weight of them everyday in a backpack . and on my last trip , i used a carry-on suitcase . * gasp * in the spirit of new year 's resolutions , i want to nip this habit in the bud . ",
        "so i placed my last online order on december 29 and resolve to make 2018 a no-buy year for our household with the following rules : no new wardrobe additions . if a core item needs to be replaced , then i can replace it . no new skincare products , unless i run out of one of my core three . i do n't foresee that happening any time soon . consumables are fine as long as not made in excess . no new gadgets . i 'm terrified i will succumb to `` gadget acquisition syndrome '' . ",
        "again , if my primary phone or laptop stops working , obviously replace it , but i do n't need a new pair of bose qc20 headphones no matter how much i want one -- i have 3 perfectly functioning earbuds in my stash . and i definitely do n't need an amazon echo show to eavesdrop on everything i say . freebies are allowed , but in moderation . i also do n't trust myself at all to last the entire year , so i 've added all of my usual online shopping sites to my list of blocked websites and unsubscribed from all retail email ads that have been coming through . ",
        "removing temptation is half the battle ; the phrase `` out of sight , out of mind '' comes to play here . so far , it 's been 10 days into the year and i 'm still on the wagon ! only 355 more days to go : -rrb- it 's still my favorite t-shirt .   "
