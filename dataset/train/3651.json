        "some hair products smell so pungent , you find yourself coughing in a cloud of hairspray fumes every morning . on the other hand , there are also plenty of pomades , creams , and finishing sprays that smell so damn good , you wish you could wear it as a fragrance . luckily for us , our longtime obsession over one particular product scent has finally come to fruition in the form of three individual perfumes by celebrity hairstylist jen atkin . the hair maestro to stars like chrissy teigen , kendall jenner , and bella hadid first launched her haircare line ouai back in 2016 , leaving customers raving about the distinct scents in each of the formulas . ",
        "fast forward to this week , and atkin finally gave us what the the world has been asking for : perfumes inspired by those exact products . sold as a trio in rollerball form , atkin offers three recognizable scents that wo n't only remind you of her famous hair oil and texture spray , but also give you a few iconic locations the hairstylist hangs out with her a-list clientele . mercer st is the same scent you 'd find in the ouai shampoo ; melrose place is a similar aroma to the ouai treatment masque ; and rue st. honor√© is the most decadent of 'em all , mimicking the fragrance of ouai hair oil .
