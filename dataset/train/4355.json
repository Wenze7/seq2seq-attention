        "the yankees ' attempt to land pittsburgh right-hander gerrit cole might be more complicated now that the astros have reportedly also talked to the pirates about trading for the 27-year-old , but if cole does come to the bronx , the catcher who has been behind the plate the most during his career believes it would be an ideal match . `` it would absolutely be a good fit , '' said chris stewart , cole 's teammate for the last four years in pittsburgh following stewart 's two seasons with the yankees . `` he wants the ball and relishes the attention , so the new york spotlight wo n't get to him . ",
        "he enjoys it . if he does end up going to the yankees , not much will change for him . he 'll still be a bulldog . '' a bulldog who tied for the national league lead with 33 starts last season after dealing with elbow inflammation in 2016 . the biggest concern with cole , however , is the fact that he also gave up a career-high 31 homers last year -- a number only exceeded in the national league by the cubs ' john lackey . stewart , while glowing in his praise of cole , acknowledged the home run ball was a problem they could n't figure out . ",
        "`` i ca n't pinpoint anything , '' said stewart , who is now a free agent . `` people said the ball was harder and obviously there were more home runs everywhere last season . i do n't know if it 's because there 's more emphasis on the launch angle and maybe those things affected more than some other pitchers . we talked at the end of the year about how if he could eliminate half the home runs , he would have had a good season . '' instead , he finished with the worst era of his career and has been unable to match the effectiveness he had in 2015 , when he made his lone all-star team . ",
        "`` i 'm sure he can make some changes going into next season , '' stewart said . `` but the fact that he was able to take the mound every start is so valuable . he 's able to grasp what you tell him . the combination of stuff and understanding how to be successful is what sets him apart . '' in some ways , stewart said , cole reminded him of cc sabathia -- at least when it came to his approach to the game . `` he 's a lot like cc in that he 's going to give you everything he has , all the time , '' stewart said . ",
        "`` he 's into the game and he 'll be a good example to younger players in the clubhouse with his work ethic . he 's experienced the playoffs and just wants to win . i do n't think he 's gon na be happy until he wins a world series . '' and with the pirates seemingly on the verge of an overhaul , cole figures to be headed elsewhere , along with andrew mccutchen and josh harrison , so his best chances of winning appear to be elsewhere . the yankees can afford to be patient , with a rotation that already includes sabathia , masahiro tanaka , luis severino , sonny gray and jordan montgomery . ",
        "`` sometimes a change in environment can help , '' said stewart , who caught cole 48 times . the next two catchers on that list are also ex-yankees , francisco cervelli and russell martin . `` he 's been in a smaller market where you have to grind it out and battle to produce wins , '' stewart said . `` pittsburgh does n't have the yankees ' payroll . with the lineup the yankees have , you know the offense can pick you up . i think he would like playing in new york .
