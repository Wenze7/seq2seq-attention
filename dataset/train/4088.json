        "it was n't until later klavano found out that was a side effect of the drug . two decades later , her son still has it . `` we returned to the doctor who said , ` oh , well , we can discontinue it . i did n't think he really needed it anyway , ' '' said klavano , who is now an advocate for patient safety . `` i think i was of that generation , i was a young mom . the doctor says to do this , and so you do it . i did n't think to question .
