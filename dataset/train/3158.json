        "diego esparza-arcienega , a beloved figure in houston 's indie rock scene , died sunday night in a car accident during sunday 's rains -- he was exiting i-45 to allen parkway when he lost control of his truck and struck a concrete pole . he was 31 . facebook and instagram accounts were flooded monday and tuesday with tributes from members of bands like the tontons , the wild moccasins , young mammals and numerous others for the man , who played keyboards in the band giant princess . giant princess released a vibrant garage punk record in `` zip zop wow '' in 2008 . ",
        "and arcienega was difficult to miss in the band : mustachioed , bespectacled and beaming . but he was more than just an instrumentalist in a band . arcienega was an energy force that pulled together a music scene and keep it vital . his apartment at 1816 calumet became an epicenter where all sorts of local music was nurtured . artists like the tontons , the wild moccasins , buxton and b l a c k i e found their way there . `` there are multiple people in this city with 1816 calumet tattoos , '' says joe folladori , who made some of his mathletes recordings at arcienega 's place . ",
        "`` i ca n't overstate the importance of that place . the thing about a house show , there has to be a guy who enables that : somebody who sets up the pa , breaks everything down at the end of the night , talks to the cops when they show up . he was always doing those things at that house . that was vital , and he was vital . `` giant princess took more formal shape at san jacinto college , where pasadena native arcienega played music with singer/guitarist collin hedrick and drummer jaime nava . ",
        "arcienega grew up in pasadena in a family of five . his sister marlen esparza is a bronze medal-winning olympic boxer . he described his father as a mexican immigrant who worked in welding . in 2010 arcienega told the chronicle , the band 's members bonded over being outcasts from refinery towns . `` all our dads work at plants , '' he said . `` and we 're in a band called giant princess . `` folladori credits arcienega with helping giant princess transform from kids dabbling in music to a proper band . `` dating back to high school those guys had bands and recorded things , but just for themselves , '' he says . ",
        "`` but diego became serious about it . he was like , ` listen , if we 're going to play music in front of people , if we want to get out of the garage and play for more than 15 people , we need to do this right . collin was the ideal frontman for that band . but the band would n't have been the band without diego . he was the heart and soul of it . `` after distributing `` zip zop wow '' as a cdr in 2008 the group made an ep , `` mexican easter , '' in 2009 . ",
        "in 2010 indie houston -- a music blog that occasionally released music -- bankrolled a proper vinyl release for `` zip zop wow . `` the band 's shows were always spirited , high-energy events , with fans stirred into a frenzy . `` man , giant princess to me was the best band in texas for that period , around 2008 to 2012 , '' folladori says . `` they were the best band in texas , yet they did not give a about it . they just wanted to make music and play shows . `` arcienega kept recording equipment set up at the calumet house so friends could drop by without notice if they wanted to record songs . ",
        "he also proved able in other capacities . he was a journeyman electrician , a capable welder and the guy local musicians would call when their cars would n't start . `` there are people who just make things happen , '' folladori says . `` special people who are engines . he 's a big part of why we had this community . `` and he continued making music of his own , even if it never saw release . `` he was one of the hardest working dudes i ever knew , '' folladori says . `` he had all sorts of stuff he recorded on his own in his room . ",
        "there 's a hard drive full of it . hopefully at some point we can finally find out what 's on it . ''   "
