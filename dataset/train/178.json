        "las vegas -- marc-andre fleury has been thinking about one game for quite a while . and thursday night he rose to the challenge . fleury stopped 24 shots against his former team and jon merrill 's first goal of the season snapped a third-period tie as the vegas golden knights beat the pittsburgh penguins 2-1 . james neal scored his 15th goal of the season for vegas , while ian cole scored pittsburgh 's goal . it was the first meeting between the defending stanley cup champions and vegas , which acquired fleury from pittsburgh during the nhl expansion draft on june 21 . ",
        "`` a little relieving a bit , '' fleury said after beating the team that took him with the no . 1 pick in the 2003 draft . `` ending up with the two points , it 's big . still got another one to go . i 'm glad it 's over and we got the win . '' the matchup between the penguins and fleury was arguably the most anticipated game against a former penguin since jaromir jagr played against pittsburgh on dec. . 11 , 2001 , for the first time after his trade to washington . ",
        "fleury , who returned to the ice tuesday in a loss to carolina after missing 25 games , wasted no time in reminding pittsburgh what it let get away . he bolted from the crease early in the first period , skated to the blue line , and dove head first to poke the puck away from the streaking penguins . the 13-year veteran goaltender looked sharp throughout the night , with several more spectacular saves , including a lunging stop with his chest that thwarted brian dumoulin 's wrist shot late in the second period . `` i thought the goaltending at both ends of the rink was really good , '' pittsburgh coach mike sullivan said . ",
        "`` it seems like those are the types of games that we 're in night in and night out and we have n't found ways to win those . and that 's what we have to do . '' after missing six straight games due to a lower-body injury , the penguins activated goalie matt murray off injured reserve in time to face his mentor , fleury . murray , who stopped 24 shots , had his personal regulation losing streak extend to four games , the longest of his career . `` they just work so hard and that 's where they caught us by surprise , especially on the forecheck , '' murray said . ",
        "`` they 're definitely a hard-working team and fast team , good in transition . i do n't think they do anything special , but they just work extremely hard and i think that 's why they 're having success . '' meanwhile , two-time hart memorial recipient sidney crosby acknowledged it was strange taking shots at his close friend fleury , after the two played together for 12 seasons . `` you see him there , it 's a little different but once get into play , you 're playing , '' crosby said . `` it 's the first time playing against each other and that 's to be expected . ",
        "both goalies were good , it was just one of those games and they found a way to get that last one in the third . '' vegas wasted no time in giving fleury an early lead , when neal 's rebound off colin miller 's wrist shot found its way past murray less than two minutes into the game . the penguins tied it later in the period when carl hagelin found cole , who beat fleury top shelf from just behind the goal line for his second goal of the season . merrill 's one-timer put the knights ahead with 11 minutes left in the game , slapping erik haula 's pass between murray 's glove and left pad . ",
        "`` i kept telling myself i 've got to score , i 've got to do something , '' said merrill , who was playing in just his sixth game this season . `` i made a presence for myself and i 'm really happy i was able to do that tonight . '' merrill 's goal before a crowd of 18,029 helped the golden knights improve to 12-2-1 at home , while moving them one point behind los angeles in the pacific division , 43-42 . `` he 's been a real soldier for us , and to get that goal , everyone was real happy for him , '' vegas coach gerard gallant said . ",
        "`` i think from the drop of the puck to the end of the game , it was a fairly even game . we played a good hockey game . great goaltending on both ends . it 's fun , and the guys played hard . our guys showed up for it . '' notesthe golden knights became the fastest team to 20 wins in nhl history . ... vegas d deryk engelland 's next game will be the 500th of his career . ... engelland , fleury , james neal , and david perron have all played for the penguins during their careers . ",
        "... crosby is five goals away from notching the 400th in his career . ... crosby has at least one point in 10 of his last 14 games , with eight goals and 11 assists . ... thursday was the first road game of a three-game trip for pittsburgh , and first since dec. . 1 . ... the penguins dropped to 4-8-1 on the highway this season . up nextpittsburgh : visits arizona on saturday . vegas : hosts florida on sunday .
