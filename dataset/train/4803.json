        "manteca -- a retired educator who served our country as a marine and helped run the city of manteca is now eyeing the office of california governor . there 's already a long list of people wanting to succeed current gov. jerry brown when his term ends . dr. albert mezzetti , 91 , of manteca wants to be the next governor of california . mezzetti says he 's qualified for the job and has the stamina to be a great leader . `` i run three miles , every morning , 4 a. m. , '' he said . ",
        "as a united states marine , mezzetti battled in three wars . he served on the manteca city council and holds degrees and teaching credentials from the state of california . `` i worry about what 's going to happen to the children . i do n't have to do this , but there is something in me that is very protective , '' he said . if elected , mezzetti would protect the second amendment , fight for women 's rights and work to keep drugs like marijuana far away from young people . but he does have some competition ahead . ",
        "`` it 's a big state , and the governor of california is actually pretty powerful . the governor of california can do a lot , '' said keith smith , associate professor of the university of pacific . more than 60 people have already filed statements of their intent to run for governor . smith says the number will likely grow in the next month . `` there are still a number of people that are being discussed as potential candidates , and both of the major parties are hoping will throw their hats in the ring to contest their gubernatorial election . ",
        "so , the field is not set by any means yet , '' said smith . like previous campaigns , mezzetti is not seeking monetary contributions . instead , he 's asking for people 's support and vote . `` i want what they think is i 'm doing the right thing , and i 'm the guy they are going to vote for , '' said mezzetti . mezetti will be celebrating his 92nd birthday on saturday , most likely collecting signatures for his bid , he said . california 's primaries are in june .
