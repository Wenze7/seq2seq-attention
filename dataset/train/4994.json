        "beijing - china 's central bank suspended open market operations for the fourth working day wednesday , citing sufficient liquidity in the banking system . `` the rising fiscal spending near year-end is sufficient to offset the influence from factors such as maturing reverse repos and to keep liquidity stable within the banking system , '' the people 's bank of china said on its website . on wednesday , 40 billion yuan of reverse repos matured , meaning that market liquidity would drop by the same amount . a reverse repo is a process by which the central bank purchases securities from commercial banks through bidding , with an agreement to sell them back in the future . ",
        "the pboc said earlier that it would conduct open market operations in a flexible way to meet the seasonal liquidity needs of banks near year-end . china has decided to maintain a prudent and neutral monetary policy in 2018 as the world 's second-largest economy strives to balance growth and risk prevention . `` prudent monetary policy should be kept neutral , the floodgates of monetary supply should be controlled , and credit and social financing should see reasonable growth , '' said a statement released after the central economic work conference , which concluded last week .
