        "tehran - iran saw another day of large pro-regime rallies thursday after authorities declared the end of deadly unrest and turned attention to addressing economic concerns that fuelled protests . a week after the demonstrations broke out , there were no reports of fresh protests in local media overnight , while videos on social media suggested only limited unrest in provincial towns which could not be immediately verified . as washington suggested it may be looking to impose fresh sanctions on tehran , iranian authorities were weighing options including blocking unpopular measures in president hassan rouhani 's recent budget . ",
        "state television showed huge crowds marching in support of the government across 10 cities early thursday , including isfahan , ardebil and mashhad , where the protests first erupted last thursday . `` we are together behind the leader , '' chanted the crowds , in reference to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei . `` the revolutionary iranian people have responded in time to the enemies and trouble-makers by coming out on the streets , '' ali akbar velayati , an advisor to khamenei , told the semi-official isna news agency . `` the people 's main demand now is for the government and officials to deal with the economic problems , '' he added . ",
        "general mohammad ali jafari , the head of iran 's powerful revolutionary guards , on wednesday announced the `` end of the sedition '' . a total of 21 people died in five days of unrest that began on december 28 as protests against economic grievances quickly turned against the regime as a whole , with attacks on government buildings and police stations . jafari told state television that `` a large number of the troublemakers '' were behind the unrest , saying many had been arrested and would face `` firm action '' . - ` grotesque intervention ' - the unrest -- the biggest challenge to iran 's islamic regime since mass protests in 2009 -- caused international concern , with the united states in particular accusing authorities of a crackdown on dissent . ",
        "a white house official , who asked for anonymity , said wednesday that washington would look for `` actionable information '' to try to bring fresh sanctions on those responsible . us president donald trump , who has repeatedly tweeted his backing for iranian protesters , wrote : `` you will see great support from the united states at the appropriate time ! `` the question now is whether trump will continue to waive nuclear-related sanctions that were suspended under the 2015 nuclear deal between iran and world powers . under the deal , trump must actively waive certain sanctions every few months and the next deadline falls on january 12 . ",
        "iran -- which has long accused the united states and sunni arab rivals led by saudi arabia of interference in its affairs -- said external `` enemies '' were behind recent unrest . its un ambassador gholamali khoshroo said in a letter that the us government had `` stepped up its acts of intervention in a grotesque way in iran 's internal affairs '' and accused washington of violating international law and the principles of the un charter . online messaging and photo sharing platforms telegram and instagram remained blocked on mobile phones , having been interrupted soon after protests began . ",
        "telecoms minister mohammad-javad azari jahromi said telegram would only be unblocked if it removed `` terrorist '' content . - parliament responds - iran 's political establishment has closed ranks against the unrest , with even reformists condemning the violence . but many have also called on rouhani to address the economic grievances that drove the initial protests . there have already been moves in parliament to block the unpopular budget measures announced last month , which included cuts to welfare and fuel price hikes . `` as concerns petrol prices , we must absolutely take into account the situation of the people because the tensions are absolutely not in the interests of the country , '' parliament speaker ali larijani said on wednesday . ",
        "rouhani came to power in 2013 promising to mend the economy and ease social tensions , but high living costs and unemployment have left many feeling that progress is too slow . rural areas , hit by years of drought and under-investment , are particularly hard-hit . on the streets of the capital , there is widespread sympathy with the economic grievances driving the unrest , particularly an unemployment rate as high as 40 percent for young people . `` people have reached a stage where they can no longer tolerate this pressure from the authorities , '' said soraya saadaat , a 54-year-old jobless woman . ",
        "but some tehranis said claims from the us that they were desperate for freedom were overblown . `` we do have some freedom in iran , '' hamid rahimi , a 33-year-old bank employee told afp . `` if the people of iran have something to say , it 's about economic problems . they want to see their demands , what they voted for , fulfilled .
