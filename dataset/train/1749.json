        "paris - paris saint-germain coach unai emery shrugged off concerns about next week 's champions league clash with bayern munich after his side fell to their first ligue 1 defeat of the season at lowly strasbourg on saturday . neymar 's psg travel to munich knowing that they will top group b as long as they do n't lose 4-0 to bayern , and asked by reporters if he was worried about his team ahead of the clash , emery replied `` no '' . `` tuesday 's match is a big test against a team that also wants to go far in the champions league . ",
        "we want to show that we want to have a good season , '' he said . psg face having their lead at the top of ligue 1 cut ahead of their trip to germany , with marseille and lyon taking the field on sunday looking to close the gap on the runaway leaders ' after their shock slip in alsace . but emery insisted that his team deserved to win and was n't worried about the display . `` we had plenty of opportunities to score and not lose the game , but we were n't clinical in front of goal , '' said emery . ",
        "`` we deserved to win so i 'm not worried . `` stephane bahoken downed psg with a bullet finish in the 65th minute to drag the lowly home side away from relegation trouble and up to 14th . the exhausted strasbourg players charged over to their gobsmacked fans at the final whistle of a breathless encounter which saw the hosts hold off a bombardment from their all-star guests that lasted right to the end of the nine minutes of stoppage time . `` to beat a team like that you need all the planets to align and you need to go above and beyond , '' said strasbourg coach thierry laurey . ",
        "`` they fought like lions out there . i am very proud of this team . '' - final flurry - striker bahoken struck just as emery 's side looked primed to snatch the three points , with kylian mbappe cancelling out nuno da costa 's 13th-minute headed opener three minutes before the break and psg piling on the pressure . but with the capital city club camped in strasbourg 's half and the rested edinson cavani readying himself to come on to push for the win , bahoken raced onto da costa 's flick-on and thumped his winner past alphonse areola . ",
        "they kept the away side at bay in a frantic final flurry that saw the baying home fans bite their nails as they counted down the nine minutes of added time , and it was a mixture of dogged defending and outstanding keeping from substitute keeper alexandre oukidja that staved off the assault . the french algerian , who replaced the injured kamara in the strasbourg goal , made an incredible reaction save from cavani 's last gasp header , tipping the ball over the bar just as the uruguayan looked certain to snatch what would have been a heartbreaking point . ",
        "`` we missed out tonight . we created chances but we were n't able to convert them . we conceded two silly goals , we lacked a bit of concentration , '' psg defender marquinhos told canal + . `` we will learn from this . we have a very important match coming up and we need to think about that already . `` radamel falcao closed in on ligue 1 top scorer cavani with his 14th goal of the season as monaco took advantage of psg 's defeat with their first win in four games to move second , nine points behind the leaders . ",
        "the colombian 's second-minute strike was enough for leonardo jardim 's team to scrape past second-bottom angiers 1-0 to close the gap ahead of third-placed marseille 's short trip to montpellier on sunday and lyon , in fourth , travelling to caen . mario balotelli was on target as nice beat bottom club metz 3-1 to move four points clear of the relegation zone .
