        "the `` tragedy of the horizons , '' a term coined by canada 's mark carney , governor of the bank of england , has been haunting the financial sector ever since climate change began posing serious threats to the planet . as carney put it : can the financial sector address long-term climate change problems when most investments are made for the short term ? behavioural economics has shown us that people lack the ability to think long term , and this has been the achilles heel in our fight against climate change . however , there 's now evidence that the `` tragedy of the horizons '' could be overcome due to changes in both our behaviour and our financial system . ",
        "over the past few years , the idea of business-as-usual in the financial sector has been questioned by many . the wisdom so far has been to invest in what provides us with the lowest risk and has long-term stability . however , in the age of climate change , notions of risk and stability are constantly changing . today , investors assess risk not just in terms of financial risk , but also social , environmental and governance issues that may be critical to financial returns . investors are demanding that investment firms start to factor in esg components . ",
        "green bonds changing financial sectorgreen bonds , debt finance tools that have traditionally been used to raise long-term capital with low risk , may be answering the call for behavioural change in the financial sector . ever since the industrial revolution , bonds have played a critical role in financing infrastructure in cities and towns . a green bond transforms these infrastructure-related investments into low-carbon , climate change-resilient alternatives . green bonds do n't just have the capacity to address risk and stability in a way that considers the long-term impact of climate change -- they can also change the way we think about money and returns as well . ",
        "with us$ 100 billion invested in green projects in 2017 alone , socially responsible investment products like green bonds have the potential to create massive change . green bonds not only provide similar financial returns as regular bonds , but also allow for a bonus `` green '' return from their investments . these bonus moral incentives could finally be starting to create a social and environmental conscience in the financial sector . indeed , as more investors push for green bonds , climate change awareness continues to grow . that means investors , and the financial sector as an extension , are starting to think long term about climate change . ",
        "what 's even more exciting is that the transformation to a low-carbon financial system is happening simultaneously around the world . several countries are issuing what are known as green economy road maps . private sector green bonds are on the rise , and the process of divestment from fossil fuels has begun . impact on global financial systemthere is now momentum for innovation in the financial sector , and it 's changing how we think about our traditional investment portfolios , banking , credit and even fintech . for a long time , socially responsible investing and its products were a niche market . ",
        "however , with the advent of the green bond , this niche market is transitioning to the mainstream . according to the climate bonds initiative , the market has surpassed the us$ 100 billion mark , with $ 116.8 billion being issued in 2017 alone . that 's substantially more than the money that flows across global borders as official developmental aid for tackling climate change . to really understand the magnitude of the impact of green bonds , let 's look at the size of the market . currently , climate-aligned bonds are estimated to total us$ 895 billion , which is a $ 201 billion increase from the previous year . ",
        "out of that $ 895 billion , approximately $ 221 billion are labelled as green bonds . this growth is encouraging , but there 's room for a much larger market given the increasing number of extreme weather events linked to climate change . as those major floods and monster hurricanes continue , industries like the insurance sector will be less likely to take on clients or insure assets that do not meet climate change resilience standards . this is where having low-carbon , infrastructure-related investments from green bonds in a climate-resilient economy will make a big difference . interestingly , governments and public institutions account for almost 68 per cent of this amount , and developing countries such as china are currently leading the market . ",
        "this exponential growth points to two things : governments have a key role to play in the transitioning of this market , and perhaps this transition will be driven by emerging economies like china 's . the regulatory impactso how much of an impact can government pressure have on the shift to a low-carbon economy ? looking at china as an example , our previous study at the university of waterloo shows such pressure has indeed resulted in creating both financial and sustainability improvements in the credit businesses of chinese banks . under the chinese green credit guideline policy , banks reduced how much environmental risk they were exposing themselves to , especially when lending to their clients . ",
        "the guidelines forced banks to become financially and environmentally prudent in addressing climate change risks . the study found that there were improvements in both financial and sustainability performances , and the common linkage was the institutional impact of the chinese public policy . if such regulatory pressure can be replicated in the green bond market , it could bring about a low-carbon economy . furthermore , green bonds could soon be subject to standardizations and certifications . with increasing fears of `` green-washing '' and concerns from investors about being misled by the green label , regulating the market would be beneficial -- and could ensure green bonds continue to play an important role in fighting climate change .
