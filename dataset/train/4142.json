        "yangon - myanmar 's military said soldiers and villagers were responsible for the deaths of 10 rohingya muslims found in a grave last month in restive rakhine state . ethnic rakhine villagers and security forces admitted to killing `` bengali terrorists '' in inn dinn village on september 2 last year and would be punished in line with the law , according to a statement posted to the commander in chief 's facebook page . `` bengalis '' is the preferred term for rohingya muslims in myanmar , inferring they are illegal immigrants from bangladesh , although many have lived in myanmar for generations . ",
        "more than 650,000 rohingya muslims have fled security operations launched in august last year after rohingya militants attacked border guard posts in northern rakhine state , killing 11 government personnel . the myanmar government -- headed by one-time democracy icon aung san suu kyi -- has since been accused of `` ethnic cleansing '' by the united states and the united nations . the military denied all accusations of significant human rights abuses in a report released november last year after an investigation . wednesday 's statement said the 10 rohingya men were captured on september 1 when some 200 militants attacked security forces in inn dinn and interrogated by the military . ",
        "the statement said that due to ongoing attacks , security forces deemed it impossible to bring the 10 men to the police station , and decided instead to execute the suspects at the village cemetery the following morning . an ethnic rakhine buddhist mob dug a grave before setting upon the rohingya with knives and farm tools , according to the military 's report . four members of the security forces also opened fire . the military launched an investigation into the incident last month after the mass grave was found in the village 's cemetery . the myanmar government spokesperson was not available to comment .
