        "northern iraq 's yazidi community that suffered so terribly under islamic state group persecution celebrated on friday as it inaugurated a restored temple to the sound of traditional drums and flutes . overlooked by conical domes of polished stone , hundreds of men in dishdasha robes and women veiled in white gathered at the site which was blown up by the rampaging jihadists in 2014 . the temple at bashiqa was one of 68 yazidi temples destroyed by is , officials said -- and one of the last of 23 in the region to be restored . iraq 's kurdish-speaking yazidis adhere to a faith that emerged in mesopotamia more than 4,000 years ago . ",
        "it is rooted in zoroastrianism but has over time integrated elements of both islam and christianity . yazidis pray to god facing the sun and worship his seven angels -- the most important of which is melek taus , or peacock angel . the yazidi community in iraq comprised some 550,000 people before it was scattered by the is offensive . orthodox muslims consider the peacock to be a demon figure and refer to yazidis as devil-worshippers . the jihadists murdered yazidis in their thousands in 2014 and abducted thousands of women and teenage girls to make them sex slaves . ",
        "according to the religious affairs ministry in iraqi kurdistan , some 360,000 yazidis were displaced by the fighting with 100,000 leaving the country . of 6,417 yazidis reported kidnapped by the jihadists , just 3,207 have been rescued or managed to escape their captors . half of those still missing are women and girls , the ministry said . it also said that to date 47 mass graves of yazidis massacred by is have been discovered . un investigators have said the is assault on the yazidis was a premeditated effort to exterminate an entire community -- crimes that amount to genocide . ",
        "friday 's ceremony at the temple in the bashiqa area some 15 kilometres east of iraq 's second city mosul was an act of both revival and defiance . `` this ceremony shows that life has returned despite the terrorism of is and its bloody attacks , '' said 21-year-old jihan sinan . around her , families posed for pictures as traditional dishes and sweets were handed out and celebrants danced to the tunes of traditional flutes . religious leader ali rashwakari , 72 , urged the international community to help `` rebuild the temples and yazidi regions '' of iraq .
