        "pep guardiola lavished praise on kevin de bruyne 's and says his incredible work off the ball as well as that on it makes it easier to manage manchester city . de bruyne was in sensational form as city hammered tottenham 4-1 at the etihad stadium to extend their winning premier league run to 16 matches and stretch their lead at the top of the table to 14 points . ilkay gundogan opened the scoring with a 14th-minute header , while raheem sterling continued his impressive form in front of goal with two close-range finishes in the closing stages . ",
        "however , it was de bruyne who bagged the all-important second for city in the 70th minute , his left-footed drive capping a fine personal performance that had his manager purring in his post-match interview . `` it was solid , good , against one team demanding to be intense without the ball , '' guardiola told bt sport . `` they have good quality , but we played really good to beat one of the strongest teams in the premier league . `` we are such a humble team , as you can see in the performance today from kevin de bruyne . ",
        "you can not imagine how well he plays with the ball , but you also see how he runs . `` he gives us the chance to show others how one of the best players runs like a player in the conference , and when this happens it 's easier for the manager of the club . `` guardiola also spoke glowingly about gundogan , with the midfielder slotting seamlessly into the team to make sure the absent david silva was not missed . the germany international - who sat out the second half of last season after damaging cruciate ligaments in his right knee - lost his marker to head the hosts in front , stooping low to convert leroy sane 's corner . ",
        "`` he 's a special guy in terms of having the ball , but he 's also someone who arrives really well in the box , as he did for the goal today , '' guardiola said of gundogan . `` i 'm so happy for him , because he made an outstanding performance . ''   "
