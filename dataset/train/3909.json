        "tehran , iran -- as iranians take to the streets in the biggest demonstrations in nearly a decade , residents of the increasingly tense capital say they sympathize with the protesters ' economic grievances and anger at official corruption . the associated press spoke to iranians in tehran on tuesday , the sixth day of protests that have seen at least 21 people killed and hundreds arrested across the country . the protests , which have erupted in several cities , are the largest since those that followed the disputed 2009 presidential election . residents cast nervous looks at the growing street presence of police and basij , a volunteer force that played a key role in the government crackdown that ended the demonstrations nine years ago . ",
        "but many residents said the country 's soaring unemployment and rising prices had driven people to the point of desperation . `` if authorities do not fight protesters , then they will have peaceful protests , '' said rahim guravand , a 34-year-old construction worker . `` i 've been out of work for months . who is accountable for this ? the government should stop spending money on unnecessary things in syria , iraq and other places and allocate it for creating jobs here , '' he said , referring to iran 's support for the syrian government and regional militant groups . ",
        "iranian president hassan rouhani , a relative moderate who was re-elected last year , has expressed sympathy for peaceful protesters worried about how to make ends meet amid high unemployment and 10-percent inflation . but his support appears to be slipping as many iranians fail to see any gains from his 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers , under which iran curbed its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some international sanctions . iran has made billion-dollar airplane orders and resumed selling its crude oil on the international market , but the benefits have yet to trickle down . ",
        "`` i voted for rouhani , but i see his hands are tied and he can not fulfill his promises , '' said parisa masoudi , a 23-year-old student at tehran 's azad university . `` the government should open the political sphere if it intends to keep the people 's support . `` nasrollah mohammadi , a mechanic near tehran 's enghelab square , the site of many past protests , said he supports the demonstrators ' demands . `` they are right . corruption is high and opportunities are given to their own friends , '' mohammadi said , referring to government officials . ",
        "`` i have two sons , 27 and 30 , at home without jobs years after graduation . `` in 2009 the protests were largely centered in tehran , led by middle and upper class supporters of reformist candidates who lost to the hard-liner mahmoud ahmadinejad in an election best by allegations of fraud . the latest protests began in mashhad , the country 's second largest city , and have flared across the provinces , with no clear leadership or political platform beyond anger at the government . tehran has also seen protests , but the most violent clashes have been elsewhere . ",
        "not everyone in tehran supports the latest demonstrations . farnaz asadi , a 31-year-old who sells goods via the popular messaging app telegram , expressed anger at the government 's decision to shut down the service after protesters used it to organize rallies and share photos and video . the app is used by an estimated 40 million people a day in iran -- half the country 's population . `` it is not fair . some protesters went into the streets , but why i should pay the price ? '' she asked . `` the government shut down telegram and my store was shut down too . ",
        "`` another university student , 21-year-old reza nezami , described the telegram shutdown as another promise broken by the government . `` rouhani had said his administration would not restrict social networks , '' he said . for others , the protests represent just another hardship . `` i am not happy . some protesters broke windows and damaged public property , '' said abbas ostadi , a 45-year-old electrician . `` they burned my friend 's taxi . who is going to compensate him ? how will he take home some bread for his family ?
