        "interpreters for syrian refugees should be given psychological support as a `` priority '' due to the stress the work causes , according to a study . researchers looked at how the syrian vulnerable person resettlement programme was rolled out in edinburgh , as a way to provide guidance for other authorities . welcoming arrangements were found to have exceeded the expectations of refugees , however concerns were raised about support given to interpreters . the paper highlights how the workers were often the `` only available staff '' to families , which saw them build close relationships . interpreters reported breaking into tears during meetings and suffering bouts of depression as a result of what they were dealing with , often providing help out-of-hours . ",
        "nhs lothian consultant dermot gorman , co-author of study , said : `` it 's always variable with each worker ... it could be stressful for interpreters . they were hearing stories that perhaps had resonance with their own lives . `` one of the interpreters said in the study : `` i just feel down and depressed because every day you are hearing what they 've been through and it brings back memories to me , because we 've been through this as well in my country - i was crying with them . `` another added : `` i 've done quite a lot of work with the police , hospitals and courts , but the fact that you establish a relationship with the families , things affect you .

        "`` svprp is a programme which commits the uk government to resettling 20,000 syrian refugees . it was announced on monday , 18 december , that scotland had taken in its target of 2,000 refugees three years ahead of schedule . problems identified include language problems for the new arrivals and difficulties with navigating nhs services , which led to them using interpreters as a first point-of-call for assistance . the svprp : evaluation of edinburgh 's reception arrangements study focused on the city as it was one of the first in scotland to take in large numbers through the resettlement scheme . ",
        "it reviewed the successes and downfalls of the programme through the experience and opinions of interpreters during 2015 and 2016 . concerns over worker stress resulted in the study , led by the university of edinburgh 's katherine weir , calling on a number of recommendations to be implemented . in its conclusion it said psychological support for them should be `` prioritised '' . counselling is available for staff , but the paper said its availability should be reinforced in training for interpreters . it adds that management should consider the workers ' own histories when giving them jobs . ",
        "prof alison mccallum , nhs lothian 's director of public health and public policy , said : `` we are committed to ensuring all our staff , especially those who experience stressful situations through their work , have access to a range of occupational health support services to help them deal with stress and trauma . `` these services are made available to all our staff , including our interpreters , so that they are able to seek help when they need it .
