        "with the hot stove season about three-quarters of the way done , it 's time to address what the padres have done this offseason . with yesterday 's contract extension to brad hand , the team 's front office has done everything possible to make the major league team better for the 2018 season . from being in on the shohei ohtani sweepstakes , being mentioned as the front-runners for eric hosmer , and actually addressing their ghosts of shortstop pasts by acquiring freddy galvis . a.j. preller and company have had a solid off-season to date . he wanted to add starting pitching depth . ",
        "check . he wanted to add bullpen depth . check . he wanted to acquire a starting shortstop . check . the aforementioned hosmer would only make this off-season that much better . although the longer the `` hosmer watch '' goes on , the more likely it seems he will not become a padre . at least that 's what my gut tells me . this team still has unfinished business . finding a backup catcher is still on the agenda . finding some depth in triple-aaa would be helpful too . and there is still a surplus of outfielders and infielders to make decisions on as well . ",
        "the first part of the off-season report card will be on the starting pitching . needing to add depth to an unproven rotation , the front office set out to add enough arms to have some intriguing battles for what looks like will be the last two spots in the rotation . with clayton richard , dinelson lamet , and luis perdomo all but locks for the first three spots , the battle for the last two spots could be the most exciting part of spring training . more from friars on base would you trade padres ' renfroe in deal for marlins ' yelich ?

        "3d ago could makita signing lead to padres adding another japanese star ? 4d ago can san diego padres ' gm a. j. preller stick to the plan ? 4d ago the san diego padres are smart to stack up on bullpen talent1 w ago an alternative to the eric hosmer signing for the san diego padres1 w ago there are three pitchers returning from injury in robbie erlin , colin rea , and matt strahm . two free agents signed to minor league deals in former friars tyson ross and chris young . a re-sign from last year in jordan lyles . ",
        "and one more acquired via trade in bryan mitchell . while none of the names listed will make fans dream of world series titles , there is some decent depth and lots of upside here . plus with prospects in the minor leagues only being a year off at best , some of these players could be used for trade bait at the deadline . off-season starting pitching grade : a-projected starting five with a sixth starter as a spot starter/long man : 1 -rrb- dinelson lamet2 -rrb- tyson ross3 -rrb- clayton richard4 -rrb- luis perdomo5 -rrb- bryan mitchell6 -rrb- jordan lyleswith the way the team is now constructed , this rotation makes the most sense . ",
        "it also gives them real depth to choose should someone suffer an injury or have a slow start to the season . it also lets the pitchers recovering from injury get their feet underneath them again without having the pressure of having to make the club out of camp . heck on paper , it looks like the - aaa staff at el paso will be the best it 's been since becoming an affiliate of the franchise . it could go five to six deep too . an a - grade might seem generous to some . but not when the bar was never set very high to begin with . ",
        "this team may not end up with a winning record , but it will be better than last years version . this is not a team expected to tank . not when you add the pieces they have added . with a little more than a month to spring training starting , there is still time to upgrade and put some finishing touches to it too . the `` hosmer watch '' is still ongoing until it is n't . and a backup catcher and the surplus of infielders and outfielders still need some sorting out too . lots of work done with lots still undetermined . ",
        "it has been a slow simmering hot stove season so far . but between now and the time pitchers and catchers report next month we should see a flurry of movement that will chang that considerably . for this article on the san diego padre starting pitching off-season report card . we see the plan the front office had in place all along . adding small pieces to the rotation while waiting for the first wave of prospects to get another year of development . what grade would you give the san diego padre starting pitcher additions . next : multiple padres top prospects will be in mlb spring training with the hot stove season about three-quarters of the way done , it 's time to address what the padres have done this offseason .
