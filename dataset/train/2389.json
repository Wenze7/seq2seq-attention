        "the mad scientists at starbucks 's holiday drink lab buried deep beneath the city of seattle have released their latest sugary monster into the wild : the christmas tree latte . like its sibling , the zombie frapp , this one employs some bright green goo and a creme frappucino base . the hillock of cream is also adorned with caramel sauce , and studded with candied cranberries and sliced strawberries , for a bit of fruity kick . with this melange of creams and sugars and dried fruit and matcha , this drink might just taste like the lovechild of a panettone and a japanese green tea kit-kat -- which might be marvelous or repulsive , depending on your opinions about those two divisive sweet treats . ",
        "judging by the early photos creeping onto twitter and instagram , this drink looks kind of like an avocado toast crammed into a glass of chocolate milk ... . or a bright green volcano erupting in a sea of cocoa . the top part , at least , looks like how a kindergartner might draw a christmas tree , so ... mission accomplished . the drink officially goes on stale tomorrow , december 7 , and it will be available until next monday , december 11 . in typical ` bucks fashion , news of the beverage 's arrival leaked earlier this week , and some locations started mixing the christmas tree frapps early . ",
        "will this new liquid demogorgon become the starbucks legend , a la the unicorn frapp ? or will it be relegated to the dustbin of history , like the pepper nitro with a jerky twist ? only time will tell . but for now , here 's how the drink ranks on eater 's ridiculous novelty beverage scale : . pluses + 3 points for a really leaning into a bizarre flavor combination + 5 points for emulating the shape of an actual holiday object , even shoddily + 2.7 points for the craisin factor + 3 points for appearing during prime holiday beverage season + 1 points for verticality . ",
        "minusus - 2.3 points for including matcha , one of the most over-used ingredients in the novelty beverage kingdom - 2 points for looking like something that would slime the original ghostbusters - 1 point for not containing any coffee - 4 point for repeating the green motif established by the zombie frapp . a candy cane-striped or aurora borealis-themed aesthetic would have been cooler . official eater ridiculous novelty beverage rating : 5.4 . the newsletter for people who want to order takeout and watch tv . delivered every friday .
