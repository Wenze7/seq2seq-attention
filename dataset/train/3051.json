        "the cost of having a city region mayor will not be adding to your tax bill - unlike in greater manchestermetro mayor steve rotheram has confirmed that he will be not charging residents of the liverpool city region an extra council tax charge to pay for him and his operation this year . the new city region leader - who was elected in june - said there will be no ` mayoral precept ' on council tax bills across the six city region council areas in the next financial year . this contrasts with the mayor of greater manchester , andy burnham , who is set to add a new ` mayoral charge ' of between £ 9 and £ 10 , according to the manchester evening news . ",
        "this weekend the echo reported how merseyside 's police and crime commissioner is asking residents to pay a little extra in tax to cover swingeing government cuts to police budgets . and local authorities across merseyside are expected to raise council tax when they set their budgets in the coming weeks in a bid to make-up for shortfalls in areas like social care . but mayor rotheram said he will not be adding to the burden being placed on household incomes from the government 's austerity agenda . he said : `` thanks to investment from the six local councils in the city region , the combined authority will be able to support its core expenditure for 12 months without a precept . ",
        "these are the 10 pledges metro mayor steve rotheram has made `` over the next year further work will be done to identify a sustainable funding model for the long term . `` our devolution deal guaranteed £ 900 million of additional public money into our city region over 30 years and we have been investing that in projects that will create more jobs , apprenticeships and economic growth . '' he added : `` since my election we have been successful in attracting nearly half a billion pounds in additional money to support investment in roads , transport and combating homelessness . ",
        "`` devolution is delivering a massive net financial gain to our area and as long as there is no need to add to the size of local tax bills , we will avoid doing that . '' most people do n't know what metro mayor steve rotheram does , echo poll revealsthe government allows elected mayors to add their own charges to council tax bills in order to pay for certain costs related to their position - and unlike local authorities , there is no ceiling to the amount that metro mayor 's can add on to resident 's tax bills .
