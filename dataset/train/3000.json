        "blake bortles completed 64 percent of his passes for 293 yards in the afc championship . tom brady completed 68 percent for 290 yards . statistically , the difference between the play of the quarterbacks of the jacksonville jaguars and new england patriots on sunday was miniscule . there 's context that helps explain the similar stats , though . the jaguars are exceptional defending the pass , rob gronkowski suffered a concussion in the second quarter , and the new england defense loaded up to stop running back leonard fournette , allowing more room for bortles to throw . ",
        "but altogether , it was a good day for bortles and it was n't the most prolific performance from brady . in the biggest moments , though , brady reminded everyone why he 's a future hall of famer and why the lack of a franchise quarterback was destined to be the achilles heel of the jaguars all along . the jaguars played like they were terrified of bortles messing up . with just over two minutes left in the first half , the patriots faced a 14-3 deficit . without using a timeout , brady led the patriots down the field for an 85-yard touchdown drive that took just 67 seconds and pulled new england close before halftime . ",
        "the drive was aided by two penalties on the jaguars -- a helmet-to-helmet penalty against barry church , and a highly questionable pass interference call on a. j. bouye . but the flags were thrown because the patriots took shots downfield . when the jaguars were afforded a similar situation on the ensuing possession , the team elected to kneel . jacksonville had 55 seconds , two timeouts and started on the 25-yard line , but decided to play it safe . the reason was simple : the jaguars did n't trust bortles . it 's not surprising given jacksonville built its entire offensive identity around a leonard fournette-led ground attack . ",
        "no team ran more often than the jaguars , even finishing a game earlier in the year with 19 consecutive running plays against the steelers . but the ultra-conservative approach was as safe as any team has played that situation all year . the patriots relish the opportunity to drive the field without much time to work with . for the jaguars , battling the clock for a touchdown drive felt daunting all season and was avoided sunday . only 1 quarterback pulled off a game-winning drive . against the best pass defense in the nfl , brady led the patriots on two touchdown drives in the fourth quarter . ",
        "the latter was capped with a touchdown in the back of the end zone that gave the patriots a lead with just under three minutes remaining . it left the jaguars needing a touchdown drive of their own to take back the lead . the drive started strong for bortles , but ended after he missed fournette streaking down the left sideline and was sacked on the next play to push the jaguars into a third-and-19 situation . a short completion set up a fourth-down pass that was knocked away by patriots cornerback stephon gilmore . it was n't a bad throw from bortles , but at the end of the day , one quarterback got it done and the other could n't . ",
        "one has fully earned his team 's faith and the other was n't trusted to keep the pedal to the floor . brady -- with a lesser defense and lesser rushing attack than bortles -- rose to the occasion and led a team back from a deficit . it was the 11th game-winning drive for brady in the postseason and the result everyone saw coming with the patriots getting the ball in the final minutes . even jaguars linebacker myles jack had to tip his hat to brady doing what he 's done so many times before . bortles played fine sunday . ",
        "but when the jaguars needed a quarterback to put the team on his back , they did n't have one . the patriots did . 3 quarterbacks have dominated the afc . with the victory over the jaguars , brady earned an eighth trip to the super bowl . no other passer in nfl history has been there more than five times . it 's nothing new in the afc , where three quarterbacks -- brady , peyton manning and ben roethlisberger -- have dominated the field for 17 years : . over that span , 13 different quarterbacks have started in the super bowl for the nfc with nick foles now set to be the 14th . ",
        "only eli manning , kurt warner and russell wilson each made two starts . maybe in a different era or a different conference , the jaguars ' construction of a team around a questionable quarterback could 've resulted in a super bowl . it was enough to get by the roethlisberger-led steelers in the divisional round . it was almost enough to beat the patriots too . but brady is the best quarterback of all time and when the game was on the line , bortles was n't enough for the jaguars .
