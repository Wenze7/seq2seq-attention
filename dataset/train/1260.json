        "in case you missed the rage-inducing news , it was recently revealed that mark wahlberg was paid 1,500 times more than michelle williams during reshoots for all the money in the world . in other words he was paid $ 1.5 million and she was paid less than $ 1,000 . we 'll give you a quick moment to spiral . obviously this is completely unacceptable and proof that the wage gap is still going strong in hollywood - so olivia munn and niecy nash went ahead and threw some shade during the critics ' choice awards . the hosts gave a `` toast '' to the `` good guys of hollywood , '' with munn saying : `` i want to say ` thank you ' to the producers for paying niecy and i the same amount of money and mark wahlberg a million dollars . ",
        "he took a pay cut , so that 's really nice and generous of him . thank you so much . `` to quote twitter : also shoutout to this shade from nash : `` thank you to all of the men for speaking up at the golden globes . '' ðŸ‘€ . and another shoutout to munn for this moment : .   "
