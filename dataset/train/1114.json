        "now might not be the best time to bring up how well we are doing . president donald trump and the republicans are poised to pass a $ 1.5 trillion tax cut . they call it tax reform , but it 's not ; the bill siphons off seas of wealth , sending it to the gop 's elite and forcing the rest of us , over time , to finance it . as the new york times ' david leonhardt wrote , the bill takes inequality , which is already bad , and turbocharges it , making it far worse . ",
        "public opinion is opaque and unlikely to get clearer . all things considered , however , we are doing well , better than i feared in the miasmic days after the election . i do n't mean we do n't face immense challenges , and i do n't mean to trivialize injustice and trauma resulting from this administration 's shameful policies and these republicans ' cruel laws . but i do think it 's healthy to curb left-of-center voices of doom . democracies can make terrible mistakes . the key is learning from them , and we seem to be doing that . ",
        "i wo n't recite old news : polls showing trump is the most unpopular president of the modern era ; democrats mobilizing for special elections , especially in alabama 's senate race ; and the ongoing investigation into president 's clear ties to russia , a possible crime that could bring down his presidency as well as the legitimacy of laws and policies that sprung from his white house . instead , let 's take my thesis -- that the electorate is learning -- and test it . actually , i ca n't test it , but the president can . ",
        "i 'm talking about growing speculation that he might fire special counsel robert mueller , the man investigating the president 's possible crimes . fox news , breitbart news network and at least one high-profile republican senator have questioned and eroded mueller 's credibility over the last week . when asked if he 'd accept as legitimate mueller 's findings , texas republican sen. john cornyn said on twitter : `` makes sense to me to wait to see what they are first . '' we expect authoritarian reaction from breitbart , but a sitting senator ? this inspired sober minds to say trump will sack mueller , and the republicans will back him . ",
        "but it 's not clear trump will or wo n't fire him . he is indeed capable of the inconceivable ; this president is a moral black hole . sean hannity would approve , i presume , and most of the president 's shrinking base would hoot and holler . but so far , there is n't hard evidence suggesting he will or wo n't beyond what the right-wing media echo chamber is doing . that a president is hollow enough to inflame constitutional crises is not , in and of itself , reason to panic . what if he does ? ",
        "is that reason to panic ? well , we should be stunned and horrified and all the emotions that go with witnessing the baldfaced corruption , impunity and sheer audacity of an american president holding himself above the law . but it does n't signal the end of the republic -- yet . i 'm not so much worried about trump doing something terrible -- after all , he is who he is . i 'm more panicked by the prospect of his firing mueller , and the electorate shrugging with indifference . that would mean the america i know no longer exists . ",
        "that would mean the america i love is more like russia . we are not like russia , thank god . if trump fired mueller , he would spark not only a constitutional crisis but a blistering storm of press leaks . republicans who dared stand idly by , or even defended trump 's lawlessness , would face scorching public scrutiny , and a democratic party too happy to stab deeply at their self-inflicted wounds . special counsel robert mueller leaves a closed meeting at the capitol in washington , dc . on june 21 . gettythose leaks , moreover , would harden what two-thirds of the electorate already believe : that trump did something prior to the election that was at the very least unethical . ",
        "if , after firing mueller , it were proven beyond a doubt trump did nothing wrong , i 'm not sure it would matter . firing mueller would be proof enough for most . recall how much the republicans squirmed after trump sacked james comey , the former fbi director . between his firing and mueller 's appointment , they were buffeted daily with leaks , including from comey himself . those leaks threatened to derail everything they hoped to achieve . after mueller rose to the task , the leaks slowed to a trickle . you 'd think the republicans would hold deputy attorney general rod rosenstein in honor for appointing him . ",
        "only after the leaks stopped was congress able to move on to tax cuts . we read about fake news , propaganda and a public square poisoned by polarization . but the republic has always dealt with these , one way or another . some political scientists believe polarization is the norm , historically speaking . the majoritarian impulse defining the decades after world war ii was anomalous . if we were like russia , no one would know if anything were true , and few would have faith in self-government . if america were heading toward fascism , polls would find more people in favor of the president than opposed . ",
        "the founding generation knew democracies were vulnerable to fits of passion and error . the 2016 election and trump 's presidency are a case in point . but as long as the electorate learns from its mistakes , democracies can find their way back to good health . i could be wrong , of course , but if trump fires mueller , we 'll find out . john stoehr is a fellow at the yale journalism initiative , a contributing writer for the washington monthly , an essayist for the new haven register and a u. s. news & world report contributing editor .
