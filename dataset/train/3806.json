        "harvard researchers have developed a novel , flat lens they say can focus `` all the colors of the rainbow . '' this is a significant departure from the camera lenses made today , which are curved , bulkier , and take up more space . but there 's a catch : the researchers successfully focused light with this lens , which they call a `` metalens , '' but on an extremely small , nanoparticle scale . while an impressive feat , major tech companies like apple and samsung are n't anywhere close to putting this technology into forthcoming phones and cameras . ",
        "this laboratory research was published on monday in the journal nature nanotechnology , and might one day allow cameras , phones , and vr headsets to incorporate larger lenses that take up less space . this could allow for devices to exploit this added room for other purposes -- like hardware and batteries -- or add larger lenses without requiring a larger , heavier device . some forms of visible light have long wavelengths and other much shorter . so to capture all these colors at once , cameras today use curved lenses to focus all the incoming light simultaneously to capture an image . ",
        "this precise process has served us well for over a century , but these lenses inherently take up more space . `` metalenses have advantages over traditional lenses , '' harvard physicist federico capasso , the study 's senior author , said in a statement . `` metalenses are thin , easy to fabricate , and cost-effective . this breakthrough extends those advantages across the whole visible range of light . this is the next big step . `` these minuscule metalenses contain even smaller `` nanofins , '' structures that control the speed of the different types of light as they enter the essentially flat lens . ",
        "in a statement , harvard said they `` licensed '' this lens innovation `` to a startup for commercial development . '' and back in their harvard lab the researchers plan to do more work , scaling up their nanoparticle lens to something exponentially larger at one centimeter in diameter . for now , this metalens may only exist in a microscopic world , but the researchers envision bigger things in the years ahead -- though how long remains uncertain . `` this brings us one step closer to the goal of incorporating them into common optical devices such as cameras , '' said study co-author alexander zhu .
