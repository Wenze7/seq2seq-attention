        "sick of gummy , gluey rice ? there 's a simple trick to getting a pot full of light and fluffy yet separate grains every time . and this tip works for any type of rice cooked on the stovetop , from basmati to brown . once you have cooked the rice according to the package directions , cover the pot with a lid and move the pot off of the heat so that the rice can continue to steam for about five minutes . do n't uncover the pot and let out the trapped steam ; it will help the rice finish cooking . ",
        "after a few minutes , uncover the pot and let the rice sit , uncovered , for another minute . this will allow the rice to `` dry out '' a bit , which prevents it from turning gummy and sticky . watch : how to make chicken bog -- an easy and tasty weeknight supper finally , use a fork to gently fluff up the grains , then serve . that 's it ! these simple steps also work for other types of cooked grains like farro and quinoa and steamed starches , like couscous . there is one caveat : this trick works if you cook your rice correctly in the first place , so be sure to read the package directions .

        "if you add too much water or do not cover the lid while the rice is cooking , you 're likely to mess up the rice and no amount of fluffing will be able to save it . if you 're looking for new ways to use your perfectly steamed pot of rice , we 've got plenty of delicious ideas . this endlessly versatile pantry staple can take center stage in a hearty dinner bowl or satisfying casserole or play a back-up role in a stir-fry or jambalaya . and of course , leftover rice can be put to good use in a bowl of fried rice or creamy rice pudding .
