        "late tuesday evening , social media chatter quickly turned from speculation to facts when six-year arizona football coach rich rodriguez was fired . while many fans and those following the arizona football program knew coach rodriguez was on a short leash , few were ready for the accusations which followed the administration 's announcement . little did we know , in late october an investigation into sexual harassment allegations had commenced when a previous athletic department employee leveled accusations against him . oh , yes , those dreaded words -- sexual harassment . ironically , this is about the same time arizona football 's stellar success during october started to decline . ",
        "breaking : arizona fires head football coach rich rodriguez on the same day a report surfaced that he would be the subject of a multi-million dollar lawsuit pic . twitter . com/sarbkddjxy -- sports illustrated january 3 , 2018 . according to the statement by athletic director dave heeke , the investigation concluded on december 28 , 2017 , which was less than one day after arizona 's loss to purdue in the foster farms bowl game . the university determined there was not enough evidence to back the charges by the former employee , but fired rodriguez for other reasons uncovered in the investigation on and off the field . ",
        "the timing is suspect to the arizona fan . if the firing had occurred the day after losing to arizona state in november , there would have been a plethora of coaches to seek out for the arizona job . now , the athletic department is six weeks behind , and it remains to be seen how many recruits will jump ship while the coaching search continues . arizona fans were more than entertained by asu 's head football coach `` search '' and the results that followed . now we are witnessing our own coaching drama . if there was n't evidence backing the rodriguez accuser , why not give the coach one more season with quarterback khalil tate and a more experienced and talented defense ? ",
        "were the words `` sexual harassment '' enough of a black mark to warrant a change , whether true or not ? initially , there was a collective sigh of relief -- finally , women can speak up without fear of repercussions . nobody can argue with that , and we feel for any woman who is still in a situation where she does not feel comfortable expressing the truth . but have these accusations gone too far in some instances ? gradually , more information came out , and more comes out about every day . soon we heard coach rodriguez was informed of his termination by email . ",
        "email ? one of the faces of arizona athletics gets an email ? that in itself warranted some amount of empathy . at the university of arizona , the fallout on social media was fast and furious . every hour another angle to the rodriguez mystery aired in public . in no time the former coach was hated and vilified . of course , rich rodriguez haters pulled out all the stops on twitter . those are not worth repeating here for reasons i will share later . some on twitter took the opportunity to wish the coach well . ",
        "thank you coach rich rodriguez for an awesome 6 years , 5 bowl games in 6 seasons and a fiesta bowl , thank you for making arizona a force to be reckoned with . your still a wildcat for life and we appreciate all you did for our @arizonafball program . #beardown #wildcat4life #btfd pic . twitter . com/yoagtgaxf7 -- 1885 apparel january 3 , 2018 . according to michael mccann , sports illustrated 's legal analyst , the legal web is just starting for the coach , the university , and the state of arizona . there will be no happy ending and rest assured arizona taxpayers are in no mood to foot a huge legal bill . ",
        "this article by mccann is informative and would be a good practice case for the law students at arizona 's james e. rogers college of law . amidst all the accusations on the night of january 2 , 2018 , rodriguez vehemently denied all of them except one , that he had cheated on his wife . maybe that was enough for the administration to not include a cause in the termination and pay him . maybe they feel cheating is not a good example for the student-athletes . and maybe there is more than the affair that has been uncovered .

        "hollywood 's golden globes theme on sunday night was `` times up '' about giving women equality and not be harassed in the workplace . everyone wore black . these are very sensitive times , and leaders in public institutions such as universities , have to be cognizant of the public feelings . after all , the decision makers are paid with tax dollars . arizona athletics needs to run a tight ship and rise above all other public institutions where education and safety of their students and employees have to come first above all else . soon after the announcement , coach rodriguez 's daughter , a university of arizona student and cheerleader , came to her dad 's defense . ",
        "back to the trial by social media . it 's gone too far in my opinion . it 's easy for all of us to succumb to throwing allegations on a keyboard to a faceless screen and then wait for that like , retweet , or on-line debate which keeps the allegations hanging in the air , whether true or not . maybe everything rich rodriguez is accused of is true . maybe everything al franken is accused of is true . maybe everything arizona congressman trent franks is accused of is true . or maybe not . rich rodriguez 's daughter comes out swinging ... -- paul zeise january 5 , 2018 . ",
        "and then there was this tweet from his son , quarterback rhett rodriguez . a woman allegedly so uncomfortable , constantly stressed and suffering migraines that she recommended to multiple people the poor unfortunate soul who should be her replacement was none other than . . her own sister ðŸ¤¨ -- rhett rodriguez january 5 , 2018 . rich rodriguez 's children are adults , but they are the reason we have to stop trying celebrities in social media . all of the accused are entitled to the same rights as the rest of us , and that includes the sixth amendment to the constitution . ",
        "coach rodriguez is due his day in court -- not the court of public opinion , but our legal system . our society has reverted to throwing stones without realizing the fallout not just for the accused , but for his or her family . whether mrs. rita rodriguez and the kids knew about the affair before or after it came to light , it is their business . if the rodriguez 's can work through this huge burden and stay together , and we hope they can , more power to them . some of us would run from the marriage immediately , but the words `` for better or for worse '' do have meaning for many couples . ",
        "we hope the rodriguez 's get the help and support they need to move forward together . children normally think highly of their parents , however imperfect they may be . now raquel and rhett are in the middle of the firestorm . sure , they gave up privacy long ago , but let 's have some respect for them . those of us who do not have all the facts , which is most of us , do n't need to be adding more harmful words in tweets and posts about their dad . even adult children take their parents ' problems very hard . ",
        "we hope they stay strong and we admire their love for their dad . yes , public figures who make a lot of money are subject to public scrutiny , i just think that rushing to judgment when you do n't have all the facts hurts innocent people . we should all think twice before lashing out . this has nothing to do with whether or not i think heeke did the right thing ; he has to do what is right for the school and the student-athletes . next : arizona football players and their coaching choicesthanks to the entire rodriguez family for sharing so much of their lives and talents with the university of arizona . ",
        "as always , good luck and bear down . late tuesday evening , social media chatter quickly turned from speculation to facts when six-year arizona football coach rich rodriguez was fired . while many fans and those following the arizona football program knew coach rodriguez was on a short leash , few were ready for the accusations which f. . .
