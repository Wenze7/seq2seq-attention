        "eddie howe said he was bitterly disappointed for the 500 or so cherries fans who made the trip to the dw stadium for wednesday night 's 3-0 fa cup replay defeat to wigan . goals from morsy , burn and elder condemned afc bournemouth to an fa cup exit at the third round stage to league one opposition for the second year running . eddie howe told the daily echo : ` i feel bitterly disappointed for them . it was never our intention , of course , to lose and lose in the manner we did . i feel for them and the money and time they spent , as i always do with the away fans . ",
        "` after a poor half when howe felt the cherries were wasteful in possession , they wasted good chances after half time . ` i thought we were a lot better in the second half and created a number of chances , at 1-0 and with the number of opportunities we had , we should have found a way back into the game but did n`t and got punished at the end ' he said . `` at that stage of the game , we were 1-0 down and i thought we were much better . we had a better look about us and created so many chances that we did n`t take and got caught with two quick goals which was hugely frustrating because i felt we were going to go on and win the game .
