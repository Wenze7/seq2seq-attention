        "the agony of defeat is tough for anyone to process , and maybe more so for a 19-year-old who just lost the biggest game of his life . after a heartbreaking 3-1 loss to canada in the 2018 world junior final , team sweden captain lias andersson tossed the silver medal he received into the stands after removing it from his neck in the medal line . andersson tossed the medal into the crowd at a canadian fan , who was clearly perplexed at what to do with the hardware . the swedish captain did get the silver medal back from the hockey fan in the stands , thankfully , before the team left the ice after the medal ceremony . ",
        "as for andersson 's reasoning as to why he tossed the silver medal ? in part , frustration from the 19-year-old who wo n't get a chance to play for another world junior gold medal . the latest nhl news and links , delivered on weekdays . your email address . by signing up , you agree to our privacy policy and european users agree to the data transfer policy .
