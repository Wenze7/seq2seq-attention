        "the uaw claims it wo n't result in fewer jobs -- even though it 's more offshoring nicole karlis2017-12-08t12 : 16:46 z • 2017-12-08t12:16:46z • 0 commentsford 's exploration into the world of self-driving vehicles wo n't take place in the u. s. as speculated . instead , the company announced it will move production to mexico . the announcement came months after the company said it would n't build a new plant in mexico , after president donald trump threatened to remove the u. s. from the north american free trade agreement . the uaw said the change in plans to move production from their facility in flat rock , michigan , to mexico wo n't result in fewer jobs , affect current ones or dismantle the anticipated economic boom in the michigan community , according to the detroit free press . ",
        "`` during the 2015 negotiations with ford , we secured significant product investment for our members at the flat rock assembly plant and other manufacturing facilities in the u. s. , '' said uaw vice president jimmy settles . `` yesterday 's announcement by ford to expand production of autonomous vehicles at flat rock , and move a low-volume electric suv to mexico does not affect our jobs or economic investment commitments . '' it 's still unclear if this fleet of electric vehicles will be for consumer or commercial purposes . in the announcement , farley reportedly remained quiet about the details , but the vehicle in question will reportedly be a gas-electric hybrid model that can operate 20 hours a day . ",
        "`` while others are focusing on a-v 's for ride-hailing , our business model will be much more diverse , '' farley said . `` we 'll move people and goods . `` trump , who was publicly critical of ford 's initial plans to move production to mexico , has yet to share his thoughts about the matter on twitter . according to the cnbc report , farley declined to comment when asked if the change in plans will `` sit well '' with trump . `` this is not a trade-off . we are hiring and investing in the u. s. , '' he said .
