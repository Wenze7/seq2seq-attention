        "a san antonio police officer who was fired last year for dating a woman convicted of prostitution was investigated for possible criminal acts , including possession of child pornography and a possible illegal substance , according to records obtained by the san antonio express-news . the documents , which describe interviews by internal affairs investigators with multiple official and unofficial sources , portray former officer mark walaski as a man who used his job as a police officer to control his then-girlfriend , check on her whereabouts , and possibly try to thwart an investigation of his actions . walaski , who had been with the department for nearly 22 years , has appealed the firing , which was effective in june . ",
        "his employment record shows an earlier suspension , for three days in april , for lesser infractions . the internal affairs investigation that led to his firing began in march last year after the police department received an anonymous tip . the tipster was concerned walaski was `` targeting haven for hope , approaching women and offering help , '' the records state . walaski , a patrol officer in the central district , had a permit to work off-duty at haven for hope , the city 's biggest shelter for people who are homeless , since 2014 . for the last three years , court records show , walaski has been the caretaker for a different ex-girlfriend 's 17-year-old daughter , and she was living at his house at least as of last fall . ",
        "he tried to informally adopt the girl 's younger sister , but child protective services denied the request . contacted by investigators , walaski 's girlfriend , the one who was busted for prostitution , told them that walaski had watched through a hole in a wall in his house while the teenager showered . she also said he stored child pornography on his private computer and had a plastic bag of what could be an illegal powder . she also alleged that walaski had hit her twice . walaski denied the allegations during interviews with internal affairs investigators . ",
        "when san antonio police chief william mcmanus indefinitely suspended walaski in june , these additional allegations were not cited as reasons for his termination . it is not clear why . walaski 's lawyer from cleat , a state police union , did not respond to a call seeking comment . the investigators with internal affairs based their report on interviews with walaski , two fellow police officers , the woman , the woman 's mother and sister , a cps caseworker and two center for health care services employees . they describe how walaski met the woman while on patrol in mid-2016 , then appeared at her home a few hours later and gave her money and his phone number . ",
        "according to walaski , he went to her home because she told him to stop by and he wanted to try to get the woman help . about that same time , the woman 's mother got a call from walaski telling her he was taking care of her daughter . he told the mother to no longer give her daughter money and that he would call occasionally and provide updates , the records state . after their first conversation , the mother said she called walaski several times but he never answered . `` when mark had finally returned one of her calls , said he told her , ` i 'm taking care of her and that 's all you need to know , ' '' the records state . ",
        "in october 2016 , after their relationship grew intimate , walaski said the woman admitted she had two warrants out for her arrest . he said and he encouraged her to turn herself in . he paid her $ 530 bail , records show . the woman , meanwhile , began seeing sonya ramos , a peer support specialist at the center for health care services . ramos said the woman began expressing concerns about her boyfriend , a san antonio police officer who had recently become more controlling . the woman `` described the relationship as controlling and abusive , reporting he has left bruising on her on multiple occasions and choking her on another occasion , '' ramos said in a statement . ",
        "the woman began receiving in-patient treatment at the center . caseworkers there said walaski would continually call asking if she was staying in the facility . on march 8 , walaski leased an apartment for six months where the woman could stay , the records state . it was around that same time that internal affairs employees began their investigation . roughly a month later , walaski contacted haven for hope and asked an employee if they could admit the woman to the department 's wellness program for mental health services . the employee said she would help , but the woman did n't show up to several appointments . ",
        "on april 12 , the woman spoke to internal affairs investigators . she `` was distraught and afraid for her life , '' the report states . she gave a statement to investigators , who then transported her to a shelter and checked her in . two days later , police were called to walaski 's home for a disturbance around 11:30 p. m . when police officers arrived , the woman told them : `` he just wants me to go into haven avoid talking to internal affairs . '' she also told police walaski warned her if she said anything , she could get him in trouble . ",
