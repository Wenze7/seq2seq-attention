        "jobs , jobs , jobs , '' donald trump tweets out to the world . `` this is all about the make america great again agenda , '' he trills in praise of the stock market 's latest record high . `` six trillion dollars in value created ! '' the president is not shy about his promises to the american people . his popularity ratings are plummeting and he is fighting back on the economy . growth is strong . stock markets are soaring . bill clinton campaigned with the maxim `` the economy , stupid '' and trump has taken the message to heart . ",
        "after all , the other problems tend to pale into insignificance beside unemployment . look at the way the us president bellows each time the stock market hits a new high . `` the stock market has been creating tremendous benefits for our country in the form of not only record-setting stock prices , but present and future jobs , jobs , jobs , '' he wrote last week . `` seven trillion dollars of value created since our big election win . '' it riles trump 's many opponents no end , generating tens of thousands of often mocking or derisive replies . ",
        "`` what goes up must come down '' , other doom-mongers warn , calling the record highs evidence of a bubble . the market has been rising since 2009 , others note , arguing this proves it is nothing to do with trump . the president may have been lucky in his inheritance , but that does not mean his policies have had no effect . in the years immediately after the financial crisis markets were driven by ultra-loose monetary policy . but that support is drying up . the fed is cutting back its stock of assets and interest rates are on the up . ",
        "so far markets are also taking this as good news . it looks like a return to a benign normality -- strong economic performance combined with low inflation means only gentle rises in interest rates and so sustained rising stock markets . this is being supercharged by trump 's tax cuts , and his moves to cut old red tape and limit the introduction of new regulations . `` the us passed its tax reform package -- we were always a bit on the fence as to whether or not it would pass -- and the details of it are pretty positive , '' says jim mccormick at natwest markets , noting that the benefits to firms come right at the start of the programme , indicating an immediate boost to profits . ",
        "analysts at bnp paribas estimate the tax package combined with extra government spending in the us could add 0.7 percentage points to gdp growth in 2018 . it should keep boosting stocks as the reforms were not completely priced into markets . `` the bill itself will provide a boost to earnings , and if you layer on top of that another firm year of economic growth , you 've got another 15pc earnings growth over 12 months , '' says macquarie economist david doyle . with a supportive global economic environment there is no reason to think these market gains can not continue , as firms make the most of trump 's policies . ",
        "even as the fed gradually tightens policy , quantitative easing globally is pumping more money into the markets and credit conditions are improving , so the backdrop remains supportive for stocks . `` it is very difficult from an analytical perspective to be anything but positive , '' says mccormick 's colleague andrew roberts . `` and you 've just taken off the big risk to the world which was china turning the tap off . so you 've taken away that risk . i think that is behind a lot of the spurt we 've seen in equity markets . '' ",
        "better still , strong stock markets create positive sentiment among businesses , investors and shareholding households . that confidence encourages more investment , more hiring and more consumer spending , boosting shares in a positive cycle . `` there are feedback loops and causality which run in both directions . rising equity markets and the fall in the cost of capital for firms is probably a factor which is contributing to one element of the improvement in economic activity , namely a greater willingness of the corporate sector to invest , '' says larry hatheway at asset manager gam investments . ",
        "roger farmer , professor of economics at the university of warwick , at the university of california , los angeles , and research director at niesr , has studied more than 60 years ' worth of data on the stock market 's effect on jobs and growth . this weight of evidence convinces him that optimism increases demand which directly leads to higher employment . us unemployment is already at 4.1 pc , the lowest level in 18 years , and he believes the strong market will pull more people into work . `` the market went up 25pc last year and if it keeps going , which i expect it will , i am expecting at least 15-20pc gains from the market this year . ",
        "unemployment can not go a huge amount lower but it can keep going down , '' he says , adding that people who are not even looking for work at the moment will come into the market . `` labour force participation is still very low compared to , say , uk standards . as long as the market keeps going up i think you can expect the real economy to keep growing . '' he fears the midterm elections could `` derail the whole thing '' if it results in a strong showing for the democrats and impeachment proceedings against the president . ",
        "`` short of that , i am very bullish on growth , i am very bullish on the stock market . even though the market is high , it has still not reached the peaks it had in the dotcom boom around 2000 . i do n't see any upper bound to where it could potentially go , '' he says . `` i think the substance to trump 's statements about fuelling growth in the economy through deregulation and through tax cuts -- that is certainly not going to reduce inequality , so if that is something you are concerned about it is not a good thing . ",
        "but if all you are concerned about is increasing employment , real growth and increases in the stock market , i do n't see that slowing in the near term . '' this leads him to conclusions which are rarely voiced among economists : trump is right on at least one topic . `` there are detractors who , anything he says , sling mud at the man . although there is much to sling mud at , i think here is right , '' says farmer . the professor expects a market crash at some point , but sees the broad upward trend of prices across history as evidence that this fear is no reason to stop investing . ",
        "the cause of a crash could echo those of the eighties and nineties when inflation bubbled up , forcing central bankers to hike rates rapidly , sending stocks tumbling and slamming the brakes on economic growth . so far the fed has avoided that fate , putting the us and its markets into a `` goldilocks theme '' , in roberts ' words . hatheway believes markets may be complacent , underestimating both the risk of inflation and the risk of the fed responding sharply to any rise in prices . trump 's own tax plan contains another risk too -- it is not just made up of giveaways . ",
        "`` in the tax reform legislation , there are incremental negatives for earnings growth into 2019 and beyond '' , says doyle , fearing the celebrations might grind to a halt after a 2018 of stronger earnings `` as some of the deductions and loopholes in corporate tax start to close '' . he adds : `` that could present an issue for the markets . '' trump 's other policies too could end up haunting the markets . a key fear when the president was elected was that he would trash the global trade system and impose taxes and barriers on international transactions . ",
        "so far relatively little from those risks has emerged , but nafta renegotiations are coming up which could change that . `` protectionism could artificially bring inflation back , '' says natwest 's roberts , as it takes the global market out of the equation , forcing up prices either through border taxes or more expensive domestic production . it could cause interest rates to shoot up , crashing the market and making finance more expensive at a slower pace of growth . that would mean a drive for `` jobs , jobs , jobs '' could be scotched , creating quite the opposite result .
