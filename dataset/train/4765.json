        "we all know it . the advertising and promotional storm that preludes the release of a film accredited : timothy adamthe word ` junket ' was an unfamiliar term to me , but after seeing it crop up a few times whilst looking for interviews for films before their release , the term intrigued me . also known as the ` press junket ' , it involves the films in question parading their actors and actresses around a frenzy of publications , both traditional and online formats -- as well as the increasing number of youtubers , bloggers and other non-traditional forms of publishing . ",
        "now , the problem with this cycle is that it is repetitive advertising . there is no chance of insights into what actors/actresses actually think about their film other than surface level information . it really is just a chance for film companies to advertise their film to the fullest extent , and by now it is normal for publicists to regulate these ` junket ' interviews as much as possible . `` you might spend an hour alone in a pub with ed sheeran , but only get 15 minutes with the sixth most famous star in a new marvel film , while a publicist breathes down your neck , making sure you do n't ask what the actor really thinks of the movie . '' ",
        "-- hannah ewens , vicewhich usually involves the ` junket ' interview taking place in a hotel room with a massive promo poster of the film set up nicely behind them , as shown in the example below . now , bearing in mind the quantity of interviewers is increasing with the likes of youtubers interviewing president obama for example , it could be said that the non-traditional forms of publishing attract more young people . this builds on a previous blog post of mine about the future of film journalism when it comes to equality , women and ethnicity . ",
        "if the non-traditional publishing methods are attracting more young people that could be another way the industry of film journalism can take another step forward by working with people that are dubbed as ` social influencers ' . the term i believe has some wrongly attributed negatives to it , for the most part people working as ` social influencers ' tend to have a large following and know their style and values inside out . the ` influencing ' power they hold could be a breathe of fresh air for the actors/actresses as well , as they get bored of the repetitive cycle of ` junkets ' . ",
        "it could be interesting , and there would most likely be a few kinks to iron out along the way . if the film companies chose wisely which influencer to work with the exposure for their film could multiple more than through traditional ` junket ' means . as shown a few years ago by krishnan guru-murthy when he interviewed robert downey-jr , for channel 4 news , downey famously walked out of the interview after krishnan asked him about his past bringing the interview to an abrupt end . `` the bottom line is that : junkets are not suited to insightful conversation . '' ",
        "-- hannah ewens , vicethis is where the likes of youtubers and other non-traditional publishers with their quirky values and large follwing could lend a helping hand not just for the viewer but for the actors/actresses as well . everyone is bored of the infrastructure . it is time for change in how the film companies market their films before their release for the sake of film journalists and fans everywhere to enhance the overall film experience . accredited : timothy adamaccredited : vice interview with christopher nolan at ` dunkirk ' junket .
