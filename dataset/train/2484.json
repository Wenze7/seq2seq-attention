        "the head of england 's exams watchdog has told mps that a surge in the number of gcse grade changes this year was the fault of exam boards that failed to follow new rules on re-marking . sally collier , chief regulator at ofqual , said she was `` very disappointed '' with the 52 % increase in grade changes this summer , which followed reforms aimed at tightening up re-marking , and she promised action to ensure it did n't happen again . giving evidence to the commons education select committee , collier said ofqual was currently in discussion with exam boards about what went wrong , but an investigation had already shown there were no problems with the original marking . ",
        "`` we 've had a look at marking consistency metrics across all of the exam boards and the level of consistency in that marking was very similar to last year . so nothing happened in the original quality of marking that suggests there was a problem , '' she said . `` there has been a problem with the reviewing , '' she continued . `` that problem is not consistent across the exam boards . some exam boards have implemented it very well , and some exam boards have n't . `` previously , exam results that were challenged were re-marked in detail , with higher marks often the result of minor differences in opinion between markers . ",
        "under ofqual 's reforms , marks are only supposed to be changed if a clear marking or procedural error is discovered . teachers ' leaders last week accused exam boards of creating a `` massive muddle '' after ofqual data revealed that almost 74,000 gcse grades were changed this summer , compared with just over 48,000 last year . of particular concern was the number of appeals that resulted in increases by two or more grades , which also rose significantly from 401 in 2016 to nearly 2,000 in 2017 . collier told mps : `` i would not be able to talk about the specific regulatory action that we are taking with those exam boards that did not follow our rules , but we will ensure that it does not happen again in subsequent series . ",
        "`` during the hearing on tuesday , mps also expressed concern about the potential `` unfairness '' of the current exam appeals system , which they said put wealthier schools and parents who could afford to request a re-mark at an unfair advantage . if the mark is changed there is no cost , but many schools will choose not to run that risk . mps called for the introduction of a deprivation measure to provide additional funding for children from deprived backgrounds to seek exam re-marks . they also raised concerns about a 40 % increase in the number of unconditional offers made by universities . ",
        "figures released last week by the universities and colleges admissions service revealed that almost 52,000 unconditional offers were made to students seeking places this year . the chair of ofqual , roger taylor , told mps : `` from ofqual 's point of view , it becomes particularly concerning at the point that it dramatically affects pupils ' motivation and the way that they approach qualifications . `` that can actually undermine the validity of the qualification . i do n't think we are at that point yet , but it 's something we need to keep a close eye on .
