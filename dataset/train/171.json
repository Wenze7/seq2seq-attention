",
        "`` the 29-year-old killinarden ` creaghsy horse ' has been busy training under former pro eddie hyland ahead of what he hopes will be a busy 2018 . `` i 've had two fights with eddie and everything 's going great , i 'm improving all the time . i love it there and everyday in the gym is like a school day , '' said creagh , who is hoping to book some domestic dust-ups early in the new year . `` hopefully at the start of the new year we 'll get cracking and start chasing titles , '' he said . ",
        "`` i 'm looking at ` shorty ' carroll or jake hanney - i 'd fight either one of them , but i 'll leave that to the team . i think we 'll meet at some point . `` stephen ` shorty ' carrollballyfermot 's carroll is also keen on competing for local and national bragging rights when he makes his return to the ring in 2018 , having last boxed in may when he defeated hungarian journeyman ferenc jarko . the 25-year-old plans on campaigning at welterweight but he is open to the idea of taking on his domestic rivals . ",
        "`` i 'd definitely be interested in those fights , '' said carroll . `` a fight between myself and seán has been long in the making , so that could definitely happen and hopefully a title will be on the line when it does , '' continued the undefeated 7-0 fighter , who is looking forward to getting back in action after linking up with new trainer brian guy at the colosseum gym . `` i 'm over the moon to sign with mtk , '' said carroll . `` i retired a while ago because i was n't busy and i was n't active . ",
        "i was n't paying bills as they say , so i 'm happy to be with mtk now and hopefully i 'll get to box on some big fight nights in dublin in the future . `` i 'm looking to be busy , get a couple of fights within the first few months of the year and hopefully by this time next year i 'll be ready to go for a title .
