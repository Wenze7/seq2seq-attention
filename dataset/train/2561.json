        "score a victory for common sense . it was announced monday that beginning in 2018 , golf 's major professional tours will no longer allow viewer call-ins to dictate potential rules violations captured on television broadcasts . this is a triumph for the purists , for fans of the game who never believed the intricacies of the rule book should be enforced and litigated in the aftermath of such activity -- and certainly not from a couch potato with a remote control in one hand and a phone dialing some clandestine number in the other . this is a win for those who witnessed tiger woods ' post-round `` witch hunt '' at the 2013 masters or lexi thompson 's called-in penalty at this year 's ana inspiration and felt queasy about the eventual result . ",
        "after all , try calling in an nfl pass interference penalty or an nba traveling violation from the comforts of home . your opinion will be treated to nothing more than a lusty dial tone . tiger woods lost two strokes after a viewer called in to say woods made a bad drop after finding water on augusta 's 15th hole during the second round of the 2013 masters . mike ehrmann/getty imagesostensibly , golf will now feature a similar lack of democracy , with on-site video officials charged with serving as the last line of defense in protecting the rules . ",
        "the worst part of the previous system was n't even the fact that random fans could adversely impact the very proceedings taking place inside a box mounted to their living room walls . it was that this was never a level playing field . until the time when every golfer 's entire round was beamed live to spectators around the globe , this was always going to affect those being shown on camera more than their less visible counterparts . or perhaps more importantly : it was always going to impact a sunday afternoon contender more than a thursday morning competitor . ",
        "just eight months ago , thompson was nabbed by the gotcha-police when she was found to have improperly marked her ball on the green . she lost two strokes due to the violation , another two for signing an incorrect scorecard and wound up losing that major championship . on monday , she took to twitter to address the revised rule : `` i applaud the usga and the r&a for their willingness to revise the rules of golf to address certain unfortunate situations that have arisen several times in the game of golf . in my case , i am thankful no one else will have to deal with an outcome such as mine in the future . ",
        "`` it 's safe to say that thompson 's result was n't the sole rationale for this decision , but golf 's powers-that-be should be commended for realizing that it was a perilous final straw . `` all involved with administering the game are concerned with the impact that these types of rulings were continuing to have , '' explained thomas pagel , the usga 's senior director for rules of golf and amateur status . '' new set of video review protocols are not a direct result of the lexi thompson ruling , but it is safe to say that it was the last of several similar rulings that highlighted the need to act quickly on the matter . ",
        "`` the genesis of viewer call-ins dates to the 1987 andy williams open , in the landmark case of craig stadler vs. building a stance . in contention during the third round at torrey pines , the man known as the walrus was forced to play a shot on his knees from under a tree . he placed a towel on the ground , later explaining , `` i did n't want to finish the round looking like a gardener . '' one day later , a viewer called in from iowa to point out the transgression . since he 'd already signed the card , a share of second place was deemed a disqualification . ",
        "since then , golf 's caretakers have endured three decades of allowing unaffected observers to affect potential outcomes . all of which is why monday 's announcement is being hailed as a celebration of the game 's long-awaited realization that self-enforcement beats citizen arrests . of course , like any unanimous call to action , the notable pros instantly outweigh the inscrutable cons . they do exist , though . just wait until the first time a professional golfer unknowingly commits a violation that is n't captured by the on-site video official , either . it wo n't take long before the social media masses raise their figurative pitchforks , wondering why their voices can no longer be heard . ",
        "that day might come , but for now , the celebration continues . too often , golf tournaments have been decided on something less than rational thinking . common sense has prevailed in this match , even if it was long overdue .   "
