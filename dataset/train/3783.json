        "boston -- just a guess , but given his turbulent presidency , checkered past and interesting diet , president donald trump might occasionally have some interesting nightmares . but could mitt romney be his worst nightmare yet ? the former massachusetts governor is considered odds-on favorite to win the seat being vacated by the retirement at year 's end of utah sen. orrin hatch . and to say the least , there 's no love lost between romney and the president . during the campaign , trump repeatedly disparaged romney , claiming at one point that the 2012 gop presidential nominee had `` choked like a dog . ",
        "'' `` fraud '' was one of the tamer adjectives romney used to describe trump . and after the 2016 election , trump gratuitously humiliated romney by summoning him to new york to be interviewed for secretary of state before snubbing him . since then , romney has n't hesitated to express his low opinion of trump 's leadership . mitt romney walks to speak to the press as president-elect donald trump gives the thumbs up after their meeting at trump international golf club , november 19 , 2016 in bedminster township , new jersey . but the dc landscape romney may enter a year from now could have a very different balance of power . ",
        "if the republicans do retain control of the senate , it will likely be by a narrow margin ; romney 's vote could be instantly pivotal . and while romney is unlikely to be adversarial to most of the conservative gop agenda , he might well be a more reliable vote against trumpism than the outgoing likes of bob corker and jeff flake . plus , should trump 's approval ratings continue to flounder in negative territory , is it impossible to imagine romney , only a vigorous 73 years old by 2020 , emerging as a top challenger to a trump second term ? ",
        "what goes around comes around , and trump may come to regret his attacks on romney . and for all of his midwestern aw-shucks-ness , do n't forget that romney spent most of his adult life living in massachusetts , where there are three major pastimes : sports , politics and revenge .   "
