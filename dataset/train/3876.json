        "there is literally zero reason to believe trump had anything to do with 2017 being a good year in aviationmatthew rozsa2018-01-02t16 : 45:29 z • 2018-01-02t16:45:29z • 0 commentspresident donald trump is the target of criticism and ridicule for erroneously claiming that the lack of commercial aviation deaths in 2017 was somehow due to his administration . trump may have been responding to a recent report by the dutch affiliate of the u. s.-based nonprofit flight safety foundation that there were no fatalities from passenger jet crashes in 2017 , according to the wall street journal . but in the united states , the trend showed that air travel was consistently safe ; except for a 2013 asiana airlines crash that killed three in san francisco , you have to go back to a 2009 crash in a suburb of buffalo , new york , to find a deadly air crash according to the national transportation safety board . ",
        "none of these positive statistics have anything to do with trump . for one thing , trump can hardly be credited for the lack of crash-related fatalities outside of the united states . within this country , however , trump has done absolutely nothing to increase restrictions on airlines for the sake of promoting safety . his claim is completely without merit . twitter users have noticed this fact and drawn attention to it . the final tweet referenced an embarrassing debacle from trump 's business career , one reported by the boston globe last year . after creating trump shuttle as a competitor to companies like pan am , trump was humiliated when within the first three months of trump shuttle , the nose gear failed on one of his jets , forcing a crash landing at logan airport .
