        "missouri gov. eric greitens , a republican who stands accused of blackmailing a woman with whom he admitted to having an affair , worked closely during his campaign with two other men accused of sexual misconduct . jimmy soni and kaj larsen provided communications and campaign support for greitens , respectively . the political newcomer defeated democratic candidate for governor chris koster in 2016 largely on a platform of ethics reform . soni , a former huffpost managing editor , worked for greitens as his administration 's top communications adviser for around three months in early 2017 , leaving his post quietly with no announcement . ",
        "months later , he drew subsequent checks for communications work from greitens ' campaign fund totaling about $ 8,000 , riverfront times reported . soni began working at huffpost in 2012 before leaving the company in may 2014 following an investigation into alleged sexual misconduct involving multiple women , two sources familiar with the situation said . a gawker report published in september of that year referenced an exchange between soni and several editors , as told by a former staffer , in which soni joked about using the publication 's editorial fellowship program to `` find myself a wife . '' ",
        "in another report , a woman said she had a consensual sexual relationship with soni when she was an 18-year-old intern and he had already been made managing editor . other women said he had a habit of flirting with young female staffers . his appointment to greitens ' administration in late 2016 drew sharp criticism from democrats over the accusations . larsen , greitens ' best friend during their service as navy seals , campaigned for his friend during the tail end of missouri 's 2016 gubernatorial race , speaking about their work on the veterans nonprofit the mission continues . ",
        "the pair helped launch the group in 2007 . in late 2017 , sexual misconduct allegations against him surfaced from his time at vice news , where he worked as the company 's los angeles bureau chief . a vice producer , phoebe barghouty , told the daily beast about a series of unwanted sexual advances , saying larsen would touch her on her lower back or bare thigh and asked her to accompany him to parties in hollywood hills . once , he passed out in her car after becoming very drunk and bringing up sex , she said . ",
        "kmov , a st. louis cbs affiliate , obtained a recording of a woman saying she had a sexual encounter with greitens and that he had threatened to use a naked photograph of her as blackmail in 2015 . according to the woman , who remains anonymous , greitens taped her hands and blindfolded her before taking the picture . the station says the woman 's ex-husband provided the recording , but she has not confirmed its authenticity . the couple divorced in 2016 . the ex-husband 's lawyer , albert watkins , confirmed to huffpost another claim his client has made against the governor : watkins ' client says his ex-wife told him greitens slapped her after she told him she had sex with her then-husband . ",
        "greitens admitted to being `` unfaithful '' in his marriage on wednesday night through a statement issued jointly with his wife , sheena . `` a few years ago , before eric was elected governor , there was a time when he was unfaithful in our marriage , '' the statement read . `` this was a deeply personal mistake . eric took responsibility , and we dealt with this together honestly and privately . `` through an attorney , however , the governor denied any blackmail attempt or violence , calling the claims made in kmov 's story `` outrageous . '' ",
        "`` any allegation of violence is completely false . it never happened , '' attorney james bennett said in a statement . `` there was never any violence . anything reported otherwise is untrue and we will explore pursuing all legal action . this was a consensual relationship that lasted multiple months and was years ago before eric was elected governor . `` this story has been updated with additional information . correction : a previous version of this story stated kaj larsen was fired after sexual assault accusations were published by the daily beast , but he had already left the company . ",
        "whether his departure was related to alleged misconduct is unclear . this article originally appeared on huffpost .   "
