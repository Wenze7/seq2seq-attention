        "the house is rejecting a measure to impose stiff restrictions on how the fbi uses information on americans ' communications inadvertently swept up in the collection of foreign intelligence . the measure would have required the fbi to get a probable cause warrant to continue even querying the database of intelligence collected on foreign targets abroad . thursday 's vote was 233 to 183 against the measure . those opposed said it would prevent u. s. law enforcement and intelligence agencies from uncovering potential threats to national security . those who backed the measure argued that the fbi should not be able to query americans ' information in the database without a warrant . ",
        "the house is still scheduled to vote later on a bill that would reauthorize the program , set to expire jan. . 19 . that bill would require the fbi to get a warrant only if it wants to actually view the contents of americans ' communications in the foreign intelligence database and use it to investigate domestic crimes .
