        "albanythe secret is out . david nichols is n't going to catch any america east conference opponents by surprise this season . nichols , the university at albany point guard , was the first sophomore in school history to earn first-team all-conference , ranking in the top 10 in scoring , steals and assists a year ago . whether it 's because opposing defenses are focusing on him , or if a nagging wrist injury is affecting him , or if it 's just a junior jinx , nichols is in a slump . if its point guard is struggling , ualbany often is , too , and it may take nichols to figure things out to reverse their current trend . ",
        "the great danes have lost four of their past six games and need a victory wednesday night over stony brook to avoid matching last january 's 0-3 conference start . `` something 's going to have to change , '' nichols said . `` i ca n't keep going 3-for-15 and expecting us to win . there 's going to be a change . `` nichols , though averaging 15.5 points , is shooting only 39.0 percent from the field , lowest among america east players with at least five field goals per game . no one in the conference has attempted more field goals than nichols , and no one has missed more . ",
        "he was 3-for-15 saturday in the danes ' 64-61 loss at new hampshire and has made more than half of his shots only three times in 17 games . `` it 's just more me missing easy shots , shots that i normally make , '' nichols said . `` most of the inefficient nights i have , i 'll shoot 2-for-10 , 2-for-12 , and it 's from two , not because i 'm chucking up threes or chucking up bad shots . i 'm in the lane on most of those shots . i 've got to get in there and finish . '' ",
        "`` his wrist is bothering him , '' ualbany coach will brown said . `` he does n't talk much about that . and he 's thinking too much . i do n't think he 's playing loose . he 's hoping that every shot goes in instead of knowing that every shot 's going in . `` although he has capable backups in ahmad clark and costa anderson , nichols is averaging 34.4 minutes , second on the team . brown said he would like to rest him more but knows his all-conference player needs to be on the court whenever possible . ",
        "`` i 'm a big believer that he 's a game away from breaking out , '' brown said . `` if he is struggling , there 's many other ways that he can impact a game . he might have to take less shots one night and get joe and travis more touches , and be more aggressive and active defensively . or maybe he gets in the lane and gets guys shots instead of him being the guy that 's taking 15 , 18 shots a night . `` cremo , who leads the danes at 18.0 points per game , has been spared the duty of backing up nichols at point guard because of clark , a junior college transfer from st. petersburg . ",
        "clark was benched last game because he was late for a team bus . `` we 've got to keep him aggressive , '' cremo said of nichols . `` if he 's struggling a little bit , let the offense come to you . we 've been talking to him about that . for the most part , we 're not really changing anything with him . '' `` i 've put more emphasis on being a true point guard over more of a scorer , '' nichols said . `` i felt last year , i would have kept shooting until i found my shot . ",
        "i took 15 shots and had five assists . last year that might have been 4-for-20 with two assists . `` if it 's going to take me taking five less shots and getting seven or eight assists to win , that 's what is going to happen . `` regardless of how , the danes recognize the urgency to snap out of their current tailspin . stony brook shares the conference lead with vermont , the preseason favorite . `` if we lose that game , we ca n't win the league . it 's that simple , '' nichols said . ",
        "`` we could win the league , but at that point it 's out of our hands . i hope we respond well . i think we will respond . '' `` we need to stop the bleeding , '' brown said . `` if you drop another game this early in conference play , you might as well start focusing on the conference tournament and getting ready for that because you 're not going to win the regular season . `` pdougherty@timesunion . com • 518-454-5416 • @pete_dougherty .
