        "the video-game retailer 's holiday update paired a growth acceleration with hints of declining profit margins . you ca n't please all of the people all of the time . gamestop 's holiday sales update this week was a case of a retailer meeting management 's expectations while falling short of the higher hopes that investors had assigned to the business . let 's take a closer look at the results . solid sales growthcomparable-store sales growth shot up to a 12 % pace during the critical holiday shopping season to mark a big improvement over the 2 % rate gamestop had managed in each of the last three quarters . ",
        "the boost was driven by surging demand for popular new gaming devices like the nintendo switch and xbox one x and a packed calendar of software releases that sent new video-game sales up 7 % . gains in these segments more than offset the 8 % slump the company recorded in its pre-owned game segment . image source : getty images . they also kept gamestop right on pace to expand comps by about 5 % for the full 2017 fiscal year in what 's turning out to be a sharp rebound from the prior year 's 11 % decline . ",
        "management in late november boosted its sales growth guidance , and this week 's holiday update delivered on those expectations of improved operating trends . profit questionsgamestop 's update did n't include details on profitability , but it 's likely that its margins shrank . the fastest-growing product segment was new video-game hardware , which is by far its least profitable . in the third quarter , for example , this division delivered just 11.9 % gross margin compared to the retailer 's broader margin of 35 % of sales . at the same time , the pre-owned gaming segment shrank by 8 % -- a worsening from the prior quarter 's 2.4 % slump -- and that unit is responsible for much of gamestop 's earnings power , having delivered gross margin of 44 % of sales last quarter . ",
        "finally , in the press release , management referenced price cuts , or in their words , `` strategically targeted promotions , '' as key support for the increased customer traffic over the holidays . gme operating margin data by ycharts . gamestop 's new business lines were a mixed bag . the collectibles unit saw healthy sales growth , while the technology brands division retreated due to limited supply of apple 's flagship smartphone . executives warned investors back in november that holiday results would be `` highly dependent '' on the availability of the iphone x , and apparently , gamestop could n't get its hands on enough units , so sales fell 19 % in the tech brands line . ",
        "looking aheadmanagement still believes this consumer tech business will produce adjusted earnings of between $ 75 million and $ 90 million , which would mark a positive step in their plan to diversify away from the shrinking physical video-game market . that also means gamestop 's overall 2017 earnings will be right within previous guidance , touching $ 3.25 per share compared to the prior year 's $ 3.40 per share result . thus , income investors do n't have to worry about a surprise dividend cut since the payout is on track to account for less than half of annual profits . ",
        "the bigger picture takeaway is that gamestop is giving up profitability as its sales mix shifts away from the lucrative buy-sell-trade model that it built its retailing empire upon . yet these results also demonstrate that the change does n't have to mean collapsing revenue or a transition period that 's marked by net losses . instead , gamestop is on pace for improving sales and only a modest earnings decline in fiscal 2017 .
