        "while people are appreciating the trailer of rani mukherji 's hichki , writer nishant kaushik has been left less than impressed . he took to twitter to share how he was given a one-liner brief by the film 's director siddharth p malhotra two-and-a-half years back . he submitted a story that 's startlingly familiar to what rani mukerji 's comeback film looks like . malhotra has however , rubbished the claims . the quint got in touch with the melbourne-based nishant , who is now visiting mumbai , to find out what exactly happened . what are you planning to do ? ",
        "are you planning to file a case ? nishant kaushik : my objective of letting my voice be heard has been met . i do n't plan to file a case , at least at this stage . i was supposed to be in mumbai on annual holiday with my family and was not prepared for this surprising turn of events . i look forward to a relaxed time for the remainder of my india trip . hichki 's director siddharth malhotra has said that they acquired the rights to remake front of the class . was your story inspired from that film ? ",
        "until yesterday i had never even heard of front of the class . when siddharth and i spoke in ' 15 , he did not tell me he had acquired such rights or that he intended to make an adaptation . if he had , i would not have worked on the project because i do n't personally enjoy writing stories that already exist in the market . did you call siddharth malhotra after watching the trailer of hitchki ? nk : no , i did not . what are you demands right now ? nk : no demands , only a request . ",
        "writers need a little more respect than what they seem to be getting today . they are not artists you can get to work for you free of cost or acknowledgement , and then trample over their work to deliver your film to the country . when filmmakers engage with writers , there needs to be better terms of engagement . watching your work , or even part contribution being made into a film , without you even being informed about it , is very demotivating and upsetting .
