        "as much as the new york jets might want to find a franchise quarterback in an nfl draft filled with plenty of promising signal callers , this offseason might be one where the team finds their solution under center in free agency , not with a draft pick . this is n't because of where the jets pick , after all , their 5-11 record was good enough -- or rather bad enough -- to land them the sixth pick . a top quarterback will still be there , even if the jets choose to trade back should they miss out on the presumed top three of sam darnold , josh rosen or josh allen . ",
        "but it has more to do with where this team is at right now and the state of the organization 's leadership over the past three years . this is the jets second rebuild in what will be a fourth season under the duo of general manager mike maccagnan and head coach todd bowles . they began this past season presumably on the hot seat , not shocking given 2016 's fall from grace . if they have another year like the past two , they wo n't be getting to a fifth season with the jets . that means that a rookie starting quarterback is too great a gamble , a decision that in all likelihood would mean the rebuild could take a collective step sideways and not forward . ",
        "that kind of season would cost maccagnan and bowles their jobs . a rookie starting quarterback poses a risk of more lost games , something management and bowles simply ca n't gamble on . that 's not to say that the jets , who own two picks in the second round thanks to the trade of defensive linemen sheldon richardson , wo n't take a quarterback this draft . given how christian hackenberg has developed and the status of backup quarterback bryce petty 's future with the team unclear , the jets would be wise to draft a quarterback at some point ... even if only to develop the player for depth purposes . ",
        "but taking a quarterback in the first round means committing to starting him at some point in 2018 , something that a brain trust on the hot seat might not want to commit to at this juncture . no matter what and where the jets decide to go in free agency , should that be kirk cousins or case keenum or obtain a veteran in a trade , that is likely a better fit for this team . in the here and now , the jets are closer to a `` win now '' mentality than stalling their progression . ",
        "the jets , after all , are entering the second year of a rebuild . they will have plenty of flexibility with regards to the salary cap , a number that could hover somewhere around $ 90 million heading into this offseason . there is a good defense in place and some interesting components on an offense that needs some star power but is n't far off . this team is further along than many expected it would be and truthfully , the jets as a team were far from the unmitigated disaster most envisioned this time a year ago . ",
        "seven of their losses this season were by eight points or fewer . two wins could have been had if the officials have made the right call . all of which says that this team is n't far away from being competitive , from being a playoff-caliber team . to entice free agents , especially the playmakers needed on offense to jumpstart this thing , the jets have to show they are n't far from winning , that the rebuilding phase is mostly over . a rookie quarterback and an ensuing learning curve wo n't sell free agents on the immediate viability of this team , and most veterans looking to sign with a team want to win and not just sign massive deals . ",
        "although the millions upon millions the jets can throw at prospective free agents are awfully convincing arguments to join a team . still , this points to another offseason where the jets wo n't be drafting the joe namath to take them to the promised land . not this year at least . and frankly , that may not be a bad thing .
