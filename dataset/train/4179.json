        "originally posted on my blog www . simpleandproductive . comso , it 's december 17th and right about now many of you are in full freak-out mode ! rushing around to get that last minute shopping done , planning all the details for your holiday dinners , parties and gatherings . what is your planning process ? do you just `` wing it '' and hope everything will come together on the day of the event ? do you have sticky notes everywhere with lists and notes and phone numbers ? do you use a paper notebook to write it all down , only to find when you get to the grocery store to shop for supplies that darn notebook is at home ? ",
        "i 'd like to suggest my two favorite tools for planning events these tools will save you time and hassle and be with you anywhere you go . 1 . google keepgoogle keep is a very stripped down and simple tool , so much so that it is often overlooked among other shinier , slicker tools , but the fact is that it is simple and effective . keep allows you to create notes , lists , agendas and more and easily insert links and pictures . you can even color code your notes so that all notes for a certain project are the same color and easily recognizable . ",
        "you can also add tags for custom searching and easily copy a note into a google doc if you need more functions and room . google keep is also a collaborative tool meaning that you can add collaborators via email who can see and edit the notes as well . this feature is perfect for planning holiday events with family members who live in other parts of the country . here is a great article on using google keep to plan events : 2 . evernotei should start out this section by saying that i personally believe that evernote is the best app to organize just about anything ! ",
        "no , i do n't work for them in anyway , just have been an evernote premium user for a long time and find the tool highly adaptable to whatever uses you might have . but back to the task at hand , evernote is the perfect tool for organizing your holiday functions and daily activities . i 've used evernote for years to track my holiday gift shopping as i can encrypt the note so that if prying eyes try and peek at my `` shopping list '' they ca n't actually open it ... but when i 'm out shopping i can open it and easily update my list . ",
        "evernote recently published a blog post sharing how even the big man himself uses evernote with some never before shared information . you can view it here : but for those of us with less weighty holiday agenda 's than santa , evernote is perfect for organizing your holiday parties and gatherings . they 've even created some holiday specific templates you can use for christmas and other special events . you can take a look at them here on the evernote blog : new to evernote ? oh boy , are you in for a wonderful surprise ! you can click on this link to set up your evernote account : if you need help setting up your evernote account , feel free to contact me through this site , or on twitter and i 'll be happy to help you out . ",
        "while it is true that there are many other productivity applications out there these days besides google keep and evernote , as the name of my site suggests i like to keep things simple and productive and it 's my honest belief that these two programs are the easiest and most effective way to do that and reduce the amount of stress we have to deal with this holiday season . best wishes to you and yours for a merry christmas and happy new year from simple and productive !
