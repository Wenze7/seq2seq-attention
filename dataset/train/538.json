        "in a turn of events that is just begging to be described as orwellian , the centers for disease control has told employees to refrain from using a list of seven words in upcoming budget proposals , according to a washington post report . the words are : transgender , diversity , abortion , fetus , vulnerable , entitlement , evidence-based , and science-based -- you know , the kind of terms authoritarians tend to embrace wholeheartedly . a cdc analyst told the post that the word-ban order came down at a meeting led by alison kelly , a senior official in the office of financial services . ",
        "but kelly said she was merely passing along the information , and it 's not clear whether the mandate originated from someone at the cdc , or from the office of management and budget , which will review the cdc 's proposals . the cdc does all kinds of work that is likely to include the forbidden expressions , from fighting aids in africa to preventing hiv among transgender people . the analyst told the post that cdc staffers were `` incredulous '' that they would be forced to edit themselves . but perhaps they should n't have been so surprised , since the trump administration has been eliding sensitive language to advance its conservative , anti-fact agenda for months . ",
        "over the past several months , for instance , it has steadily erased mentions of climate change from government websites . just this week , interior secretary ryan zinke dressed down the leader of a california park for deigning to represent scientific consensus on the matter in a tweet . two words that have n't yet been banned by any government agency : `` safe space .
