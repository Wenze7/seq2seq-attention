        "in the us , we expect the labour market report for december to be strong , due partly to some catch-up effects from previous months . in the minutes from the december fomc meeting , we will look for clues as to whether other members other than charles evans and neel kashkari came close to dissenting . we expect euro-area headline inflation to decline in december on weaker energy price inflation , while core inflation is expected to increase only slightly . we expect headline inflation to remain in the range of 1.1-1.4 % throughout 2018 , as long as underlying inflation pressure remains muted . ",
        "in scandinavia , the housing market remains in focus , particularly in sweden where property prices are now falling . in norway , households have remained resilient to uncertainty on the housing market and we expect retail sales to rebound somewhat . global macro and market themes . with the us tax reform , they have adopted an expansionary fiscal policy for next year at a time when the economy is operating close to full employment . relatively strong us economic growth and a further boost from the tax reform underscores our overweight us equities and creates upside risk for our forecast for us 10-year rates .
