        "jerusalem -- the israeli army said on wednesday that it raided the nablus city area in the west bank after an israeli was killed in a drive-by shooting by suspected palestinian assailants . a military statement said the army beefed up its presence in the area of the attack overnight , with soldiers canvassing the area to locate the suspected gunmen . the forces also cordoned off the villages and set up roadblocks . `` entrances and exits to and from the villages surrounding nablus will be possible only after security checks , '' the statement read . on wednesday morning , israeli chief of staff gadi eizenkot arrived at the scene in havat gilad , an illegal outpost near nablus . ",
        "he received a briefing on the attack and the efforts to find the perpetrators . eizenkot said the army believes the shooting was carried out by a palestinian terror cell . `` the main mission at the moment is to locate the cell , to stop it and to prevent further terror events , and also to prepare for further activity in the area over the weekend , '' he said in a statement released by the military . on tuesday night , rabbi raziel shevah , a 35-year-old man , was shot multiple times from a passing car . ",
        "he was rushed to hospital in a critical condition but died of his wounds later . shevah was identified by local media as a resident of the havat gilad and a father of six . israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu released a statement declaring that security services `` would do everything possible in order to apprehend the despicable murderer and the state of israel will carry out justice against him . '' defense minister avigdor liberman said he had instructed his office to examine the legalization of havat gilad , an outpost built by ultra-nationalist settlers without israeli permits . ",
        "nickolay mladenov , un special coordinator for the middle east peace process , condemned the attack . `` there is no justification for terror and those who condone it , praise it or glorify it , '' he said on his twitter account . `` the perpetrators of yesterday 's attack must be brought to justice . '' us ambassador to israel david friedman accused the palestinian authority of providing financial support to attackers . `` hamas praises the killers and pa laws will provide them financial rewards , '' he tweeted . `` look no further to why there is no peace . '' ",
        "violence in the region has soared since us president donald trump recognized jerusalem as israel 's capital , reversing a long-held white house policy . the statement triggered protests in the west bank and along the fence between israel and the gaza strip , leading to at least 13 palestinians killed , according to local media . israel captured east jerusalem together with the rest of the west bank and gaza in the 1967 middle east war . shortly afterward , israel annexed east jerusalem , claiming it part of its `` indivisible capital . '' the move was never recognized internationally . ",
        "the us-brokered peace talks between israel and the palestinians reached an impasse in 2014 . following trump 's jerusalem recognition , palestinian president mahmoud abbas said the us can no longer act as an unbiased mediator .   "
