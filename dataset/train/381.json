        "this stuff is fun for me but it is also a great mental exercise to go through . it forces me to reflect , think , and focus on what is/was most important . there is so much that blogging does for my brain . i am not sure how i would do my work without it . the daily routine of writing something for public consumption is a discipline that brings clarity in a confusing time . the bigger posts that come every now and then , and the year end ones , are particularly valuable to write .

        "i caught a lot of good trends this year in bitcoin , ethereum , financial stocks and large cap technology . it was hard not to with this strong tape . but i also missed big opportunities and made my share of investing mistakes . for example : every time i sold any bitcoin and ethereum i should have bought it . i did not invest enough time , energy and money in tokens and ico 's . the returns were astronomical for those that did the work and followed the right crowd . i ditched my $ lulu way too early and held my underarmor too long .
