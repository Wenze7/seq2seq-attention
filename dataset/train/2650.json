        "worldcrunch . com / le figarokrasnohorivka -- the sound of canon fire has become more distant of late in krasnohorivka . but the war continues to haunt lioudmila sidonnka . the young mother 's stories are those of soldiers running in all directions , of smoking tanks , never-ending detonations , nights spent in her building 's basement , houses on fire . little wonder that so many residents in this hamlet , on the ukrainian side of the frontline , have left . after three years of conflict , only about 100 people -- a third of the ghost village 's pre-war population -- remain . ",
        "lioudmila and her family are among the holdouts . her 14-year-old son , vadim , shows us shell fragments that he 's collected . he also shows us around his school , the only connection he still has to real life . life before the war . before the fighting began , most of krasnohorivka 's inhabitants worked in donetsk , the main city in eastern ukraine 's donbass region , now controlled by the separatists and therefore inaccessible . lioudmila , 35 , dwells on the living nightmares she and her family have to endure . `` the father is very scared . ",
        "if something unexpected happens , he starts shouting , ` run to the basement ! ' and the boy screams in his sleep sometimes . then he wakes up and hides . the sense of panic has never left him . `` relying on russiathe main public utilities are gone from almost every hamlet we visit . north of donetsk , in avdiivka -- where most of the fighting is taking place -- a recent strike on a gas pipeline has ruined all hope of the heating being restored quickly . `` hundreds of thousands of people risk spending the winter without water or heating while temperatures can drop to -20 degrees celsius , '' a group of ngos warned in late november . ",
        "the local economy is in tatters , leaving those who were n't able to flee -- an estimated 4 million people -- all the more destitute . since it began , in the spring of 2014 , the war in donbass has killed more than 10,000 people . this year , the rhythm of deaths and injuries subsided , though ceasefire violations happen on a daily basis . ten days before our arrival , two ukrainian soldiers were killed and 17 others wounded . but the rebel authorities only publish civilian statistics . `` there are still deaths but nobody talks about it anymore , '' says mathias eick , spokesman for echo , the european commission 's humanitarian aid program . ",
        "for several months , the separatist authorities have been refusing access to most western journalists and , in 2015 , they expelled the main foreign ngos . the oligarch and donbass steel magnate rinat akhmetov , who was helping some 100,000 people , had to close his fund for fear of having his assets seized . today , the two self-proclaimed republics of donetsk and luhansk `` could not live without humanitarian aid from russia , '' says alain aeschlimann , head of the international committee of the red cross in ukraine , one of the very few international organizations working on both sides of the front line . ",
        "huge white trucks bearing the russian eagle continue to cross the border from east to west , albeit at an irregular frequency , but the western powers do n't know what the contents are . `` people here have developed a certain form of resilience , but i do not know how long they will endure all of that , '' the icrc official says . to reach the mobile clinic set up by the ngo doctors of the world in zolotoe , a village that has experienced a surge of tension since mid-november , it sometimes takes patients a whole day . ",
        "they come for comfort as much as for medicine . `` if i 'm still alive today , i owe it to chance , '' says tatiana grigorievna , 83 , before bursting into tears . she lives near the front line , in a house in the forest with her asthmatic son . in a corridor , a psychologist -- a profession that , before the war , was seen as basically useless -- offers advice to stupefied men and women : do not watch `` agitating '' television programs before bedtime , check your blood pressure daily , etc. . ",
        "since it began , the war in donbass has killed more than 10,000 people -- photo : celestino arce/zuma wireexhausted by three years of constant stress , civilians who are in closest contact with the fighting no longer care about how or why it started , or which of its protagonists bear the most responsibility . they just worry about how the conflict affects food supplies and their health . `` people sort of got used to it , '' says valery konovalov , the director of a badly damaged water distribution plant in avdiivka . `` they keep on working despite the shooting and the explosions . '' ",
        "` nothing changes ` the only tangible link that connects so-called eastern ukrainians to their country is the retirement pension from the state . under a law deemed worrisome by the country 's european sponsors , kiev requires citizens to justify that they live west of the front line to be able to claim their pension on the 20th of each month . to verify the information , ukrainian officials make surprise visits , and so a lot of people have to shuttle back and forth . everyday these border dwellers gather at the mayorsk border post , the main crossing point between the two territories . ",
        "last year , 1.1 million people were counted up there , sometimes having to wait eight hours in the summer periods before being able to cross . since the end of october , a new problem has added to the chronic issue of traffic jams . in a show of allegiance to moscow , the rebel republics did n't change their clocks for the winter . meanwhile , west of the border , the period of time the checkpoint is open each day was moved back an hour -- for security reasons . under cover of darkness , the two warring sides take up arms again almost routinely , without the osce observers being able to identify which side violates the truce first . ",
        "`` i bless my daughter for having emigrated to germany and escaping all of this , '' tamara sighs . `` here , nothing 's changing . '' in her 60s , the woman officially lives with her sister west of the frontline . but in fact , she lives to the east , in horlivka -- alone , she says , with her cats and her fish . `` i do n't talk to anyone over there , '' tamara adds before rushing into a minibus with her meager pension . to improve the situation , the un refugee agency -- the unhcr -- has financed the construction of an additional checkpoint in mayorsk , which the organization controls . ",
        "but in doing so , the agency is being accused of validating the territory 's separation , which is contrary to the minsk agreements that then french president francois hollande , german chancellor angela merkel , russian president vladimir putin and ukrainian leader petro poroshenko signed in february 2015 . `` in fact , the conflict is frozen , and this situation benefits everybody , '' a humanitarian worker posted on the front line explains . the man goes on to say that the ukrainian government `` discriminates against its own population '' by imposing administrative restrictions on ukrainians living to the east . ",
        "officially , the purpose of these measures is to encourage people to flee to the west and thus to indirectly weaken the eastern territories . but their application has been chaotic , and it has paved the way for rampant corruption . meanwhile , moscow is launching a diplomatic offensive aimed at deploying its own brand of blue helmet peacekeepers in the region , but the scope of their mandate has the russians and westerners opposing each other at the un security council . `` the only way to make the situation evolve would be to allow them to patrol along the border between russia and the occupied territories , '' says igor sarudnev , the ukrainian officer overseeing the mayorsk checkpoint . ",
        "but moscow has rejected this prospect . more recently , vladimir putin promised to exert his `` influence '' on rebel leaders to facilitate a prisoner exchange . `` the russians are trying to stabilize the conflict , but without changing the currently prevailing status quo , '' says georgiy tuka , ukraine 's deputy minister for refugees . the liberal politician criticizes the residency justifications imposed by his own government on eastern ukrainians . but among the hawks surrounding president poroshenko , his voice is virtually inaudible . please continue reading on worldcrunch . com - donbass blues , the forgotten conflict in eastern ukraine .
