        "copenhagen , denmark -- inventor peter madsen was charged tuesday with killing swedish journalist kim wall during a trip on his private submarine , with prosecutors saying he either cut her throat or strangled her . prosecutor jakob buch-jepsen said the case is `` very unusual and extremely disturbing . `` madsen is charged with murder as well as indecent handling of a corpse for the way he disposed of wall 's body . madsen claimed wall died accidentally inside the submarine while he was on deck during the excursion in august . however , he later admitted throwing her body parts into the sea . ",
        "madsen and wall had gone on a trip in madsen 's submarine on aug. . 10 . wall , who was working on a story about madsen , was last seen aboard the vessel as it left copenhagen . the next day , madsen -- an entrepreneur who once dreamed of launching a manned space mission -- was rescued from the sinking submarine without wall . police believe he deliberately sank the vessel . madsen has offered a shifting variety of explanations for wall 's death . initially , he told authorities he had dropped wall off on an island several hours after their voyage began . ",
        "later , he said she had died in an accident on board and he had `` buried '' her at sea . her dismembered , naked torso was found on a southern copenhagen coast in late august and her head , legs and clothes were discovered in bags at sea in october . heavy metal objects were designed to take them to the ocean floor . the trial starts march 8 and a verdict is expected on april 25 .
