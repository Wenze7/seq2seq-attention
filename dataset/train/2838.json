' € the president ' € ™ s vulgar slur ' € `` during an oval office meeting with members of congress to discuss immigration , he called some african countries ' € shitholes ' € and questioned why the united states needed ' € more haitians ' € ' € `` has drawn continuing responses from hollywood celebrities and beltway pundits . ",
        "now his former rival for the white house is weighing in . ' € the anniversary of the devastating earthquake 8 years ago is a day to remember the tragedy , honor the resilient people of haiti , & affirm america ' € ™ s commitment to helping our neighbors . instead , we ' € ™ re subjected to trump ' € ™ s ignorant , racist views of anyone who doesn ' € ™ t look like him .
