",
        "so scroll down and join the growing ranks of laptop gaming adherents -- here 's our list of the best gaming laptops on the market today . our pick acer predator 17 x bill roberson/digital trendswhy should you buy this : you want to play the latest games at the highest settings while you 're on the go . our score the best acer predator 17 g9-791-79y3 the acer predator 17 is n't just a great gaming laptop ; it 's a great laptop . $ 2,599.99 from acer $ 2,547.63 from amazon who 's it for : gamers who do n't mind spending a little extra to snag the best performance on the market . ",
        "how much will it cost : $ 2,500 why we picked the acer predator 17 x : what is the predator 17 x doing right ? perhaps the better question is `` what is n't it doing right ? '' its performance , powered by an intel core i7-7820hk , 32 gb of ram , and nvidia gtx 1080 graphics , makes it one of the most powerful gaming laptops you can buy . with a gtx 1080 graphics card and that monster of a processor , which is unlocked and overclock-ready , the predator 17 x will make short work of just about anything you throw at it . ",
        "yes , even destiny 2 -- crank up those detail settings , guardian . it 's just what 's under the hood that counts . acer has taken the time to rethink its predator gaming series , and the new machines it introduced in 2017 are more impressive than ever . it does look a bit on the conventional side , but acer supplements its stereotypical matte black and red with a sturdy , spacious layout that includes a full-sized numpad . it 's a more subdued look than the asus g752 , and one that 's sure to please the users who find the asus too garish . ",
        "like most high-end gaming laptops , the predator 17 x starts at $ 2,500 for the base model , but for that price you get a system with top-of-the-line hardware , lightning-fast performance , and a rock-solid chassis . that 's why the predator 17 x remains at the top of our list . our full review the best portable gaming laptop razer blade bill roberson/digital trends bill roberson/digital trendswhy should you buy this : you want a gaming powerhouse with macbook style . our score the best portable gaming laptop razer blade the razer blade provides a perfect balance of portability and power , it 's the ultimate ultra-light gaming laptop . ",
        "$ 1,500.00 from razer $ 1,375.95 from newegg . com who 's it for : gamers who need something small and light that can still pack a punch . how much will it cost : starts at $ 1,700 why we picked the razer blade : the razer blade offers serious gaming performance in a slim package . the newest version packs an intel core i7-7700hq in with an nvidia geforce gtx 1060 , despite the system 's slim profile . the system bolsters its slim design with an attractive , matte black exterior . the result is a system that looks a lot like the black macbooks of yore . ",
        "with its slick design and impressive , chroma-lit keyboard and trackpad , it stands out in the crowd . and razer packs in performance to match . the gtx 1060 is incredibly quick , roughly equivalent to the outgoing gtx 980m . though there are faster laptops , there are very few of similar size with similar hardware . the alienware 13 is the most obvious alternative , but it 's not as slick as the razer blade . though it has many strengths , the blade does fall victim to the limitations of its own footprint . it runs hotter and louder than competitors , and it ca n't be had with an optional gtx 1070 or 1080 graphics chip . ",
        "the price is also high , starting at $ 1,700 for a model with a 256 gb hard drive . our full reviewthe best cheap gaming laptop dell inspiron 15 7000 gaming dan baker/digital trendswhy should you buy this : it 's the best gaming machine you can buy for less than $ 1,000 . our score the best cheap gaming laptop dell inspiron 15 7577 fast and affordable , the dell inspiron 15 gaming is a solid do-it-all pc . $ 899.99 from dell $ 949.99 from jet who 's it for : students , gamers , anyone who wants a gaming laptop but does n't want to break the bank . ",
        "how much will it cost : starts at $ 900why we picked the dell inspiron 15 gaming : this budget-friendly laptop may not seem like a gaming powerhouse , but as one of the cheapest systems with a dedicated gpu , it ca n't be ignored . it 's more modest than the other systems here , coming standard with an intel core i5-7300hq and 8 gb of ram . the real star of the show is its graphics card , an nvidia geforce gtx 1060 graphics card with max-q design . during our tests it nearly kept up with more expensive and laptops like the razer blade . ",
        "it does n't look quite as sharp , but it has more than enough horsepower to run the latest games at high detail settings . our review unit hit 65 frames per second while running battlefield 1 on ultra at 1080p . the razer blade , which starts at $ 1,800 , hit 67 fps at ultra in battlefield 1 . even running deux ex : mankind divided at ultra , the frame rate holds at around 37 fps , a very playable score which rises considerably with the settings turned down a bit . both games are easily playable at medium to high settings and 1080p resolution . ",
        "unfortunately , the inspiron 15 gaming does look like a budget system . it 's a bit too thick , clad in an abundance of less-than-sturdy plastic . the screen 's bezel bends , as does the system 's touchpad . all that extra plastic means it 's a bit bigger than it should be , even for a 15-inch gaming laptop . in addition , its display is one of the weakest we 've tested in years , getting progressively worse than even in previous versions . it 's not without its compromises , but at just $ 900 to start , it 's much less expensive than other laptops that can handle modern games . ",
        "our full reviewthe best stealth gaming laptop asus zenbook 13 ux331un mark coppock/digital trendswhy should you buy this : it 's a gaming laptop you can carry around at work . our score the best stealth gaming laptop asus zenbook 13 stylish and slick , the asus zenbook 13 is a surprisingly robust gaming platform . $ 1,000.00 from asus who 's it for : anyone who wants to be able to game on the go without carrying around a black-and-red behemoth . how much will it cost : starts at $ 1,000 why we picked the asus zenbook 13 ux331un : the latest asus zenbook 13 might not seem like a gaming laptop , and to be fair it really is n't one , but that 's the key of the category of `` stealth gaming laptop , '' which is becoming more and more possible . ",
        "the zenbook features an intel core i5-8250u processor , 8 gb of ram , a 256 gb ssd , a 1080p display , and an nvidia mx150 discrete gpu . unlike typical gaming laptops , the asus zenbook 13 is remarkably thin and light , despite carrying a bit more gaming hardware than an average work laptop . coupled with a sharp , atypical design , the zenbook 13 is an appealing laptop overall and a surprisingly robust platform for some gaming-on-the-go . plus , at just $ 1,000 it undercuts most of the laptops on this list , with the exception of the dell inspiron 15 gaming . ",
        "our review unit hit an average of 27 fps in battlefield 1 at medium settings , and 33 fps on average in civilization vi . those are n't the most inspiring framerates in the world , but the mx150 is much capable when playing older games , esports games , or less demanding games at medium or low settings . it 's about the equivalent of the desktop nvidia geforce 1030 graphics card , so it 's not blazing fast , but it 's much , much better than not having a discrete gpu . there are other good options as a stealth gaming laptop in the 15-inch category that offer a bit more power , most notably the surface book 2 , the dell xps 15 , and the dell xps 15 2-in-1 . ",
        "while those options will push some faster framerates , nothing is as stealthy playing games on this super-thin , 13-inch laptop . our full reviewhow we testwhen we test a laptop , particularly a gaming laptop , we leave no spec un-tested . starting from look-and-feel and running all the way through individual hardware tests , laptops that enter our lab do n't leave until they 're put through their paces in every conceivable way . on top of formal testing , we spend a lot of time with the laptops that come through out offices . we 'll use them for everyday work and web browsing , in hopes of catching any elusive issues that evaded our earlier testing . ",
        "for more information on how we test laptops , you can read a full run-down over here . what to expect out of a gaming laptopgaming laptops have come a long way in the last couple years . while some are still the big led-clad behemoths we 've come to know and love , it 's become easier and easier for manufacturers to cram some serious performance into small packages . just look at the razer blade . it 's no bigger than other non-gaming laptops , but it 's able to deliver some seriously impressive performance . that said , can you expect desktop-level performance out of a notebook ? ",
        "well , almost . the best gaming laptops on the market come close , but there are a few areas that desktops still have an edge . first up , desktop gaming rigs are bigger , so they 're more spacious inside . that extra space is important for heat diffusion . even the most high-efficiency gaming laptop will still have some issues when it comes to heat accumulation . inside a laptop 's chassis , everything is crammed together so tight there is n't much manufacturers can do to reduce heat , other than just pump it out as fast as possible . ",
        "similarly , gaming desktops will almost always have better processors because they do n't need to worry about battery life or the aforementioned heat issue . they can suck down as much power as they need to run those 4.0 ghz octa-core processors without batting an eye . in the process , they 'll generate a massive amount of heat which is easily dispersed with air cooling . so , when it comes to performance , a great gaming laptop will come close to a desktop gaming experience in all but those areas . it 's going to run hotter , and it 's going to run a little slower . ",
        "the desktop is faster , but if you only want a laptop , you can make it work .   "
