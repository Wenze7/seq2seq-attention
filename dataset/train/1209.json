        "the winter meetings are halfway over , and the dodgers have not yet made a move . the market for relievers appears to be the hot ticket so the dodgers will need to find a setup man soon . the second day of the winter meetings offered plenty of rumors although only one of them was linked to the dodgers . the dodgers had interest in tommy hunter , but he later ended up signing with the phillies . the rockies also signed a reliever as they agreed to a three year deal with bryan shaw . the contracts for relievers are flying , and if the dodgers are going to sign a reliever , they need to pick one up soon as they are flying off the shelf . ",
        "the one problem with the free agent contracts for relievers is that they have been very pricey . if the dodgers plan to once again bargain shop for an eighth-inning reliever they are going to have trouble finding a suitable option . hunter received eight million a year , and shaw received nine million a year which is a pretty big chunk of change for a middle reliever . if the dodgers let brandon morrow go for approximately ten million a season , then they are not going to offer a lesser option eight to nine million dollars a season . ",
        "the best non-closer left on the reliever market is addison reed , and he is probably going to get a three-year deal for eight to nine million dollars a season . that would appear to price him out of the dodgers range . if the dodgers are going to find their seventh or eighth inning reliever in free agency , they are going to have to find an underrated option like joe smith or anthony swarzak . those options would be solid , but it would be settling for a team that has a big need to upgrade their bullpen . ",
        "more from dodgers way dodgers rumors : could la be a trade destination for manny machado ? 5h ago dodgers : pedro baez will be a key member of the pen in 201810h ago dodgers : will it be a blue christmas for the dodgers ? 14h ago dodgers offseason is off to a very quiet start in the winter meetings1 d ago dodgers : lay low at winter meetings , except for one move1 d ago the trade market offers much better relievers for a better price like kelvin herrera , brad hand , and zach britton . out of those three , the priciest would be britton who is projected to get near 14 million in arbitration . ",
        "however , he is an elite closer when healthy and would give the dodgers the best 1-2 bullpen punch in baseball . he would also check the box of needing another lefty reliever since tony watson could leave in free agency . although trading for one of the aforementioned relievers would cost a couple of decent prospects , the salary for each of them is very reasonable . herrera and hand are still in arbitration , and both will make most likely make under eight million next season which is less than hunter and shaw received on their new deals . ",
        "herrera is a flame thrower who reaches 100 miles per hour and hand is a lights-out reliever who became the padres closer as the season progressed . either of them would be an upgrade on morrow and an option that would be less injury prone . while britton , hand , and herrera are options that are definitely on the trading block , there are plenty of other top-tier relievers that could be had like felipe rivero , and alex colome . rivero would take a ton to get , but the pirates are desperate for cheap young talent and could budge if the dodgers offer a package of players like alex verdugo , yadier alvarez , and keibert ruiz . ",
        "for a rebuilding team like the pirates , a reliever does n't have as much value to them . colome is in the same boat as he is the closer for a team that is projected to finish in last place . especially now that the yankees are once again title contenders and the red sox will make counter moves , the rays have fallen even further back . colome is a sure bet to provide the dodgers with a strong bridge to kenley jansen if they could swing a deal for him . regardless of which way the dodgers decide to pursue a reliever , the relief trade market offers the higher upside arms .
