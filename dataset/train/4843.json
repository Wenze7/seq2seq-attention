        "mad masque : it was a night on the tiles at the mus√©e rodin , as dior celebrated the surrealist collection maria grazia chiuri presented earlier in the day with an extravagant masked ball . after a rainy week in paris , it was clear skies despite the late hour as blue skies and fluffy white clouds reminiscent of magritte 's famous imagery were projected on the facade of the museum . on a marquee at the entrance , trompe-l'oeil views of the building had been printed . they moved gently as guests passed through `` walls '' to enter . ",
        "in the gardens , a life-size chessboard awaited , with a guard of honor of anthropomorphic chess pieces who , despite their best efforts , barely managed to keep their serious demeanor . had the queen of hearts walked past at that moment , she might have wanted off with their heads -- it would have been easy , they were already laughing them off . among the creatures of wit and whimsy who stepped in under the lips , ears and torsos hanging from the mirrored ceiling , some could still be recognized . sasha pivovarova , wore a wire frame 3-d sketch of her face ; ever flamboyant , casey spooner looked right at home ; kris van assche had decked himself out with elegant , blackened roses ; luka sabbat had gone for a swipe of black across his eyes , and bernard arnault , chairman and chief executive officer of luxury conglomerate lvmh , slipped by , almost anonymous under a black venetian mask . ",
        "`` we had a lot of fun before we even got here , as we were getting dressed , so that 's the beginning of a good party , '' said stella tennant , who had painted blue eyes on her eyelids and wore a sleep mask as a hair band . `` i had it on my flight from new york last week , and thought it was a very balenciaga thing . if there are speeches , i 'm definitely putting the mask on . '' `` i love a dress-up party , '' enthused photographer ellen von unwerth . ",
        "`` it 's nice to be a bit undercover , it 's like playing . `` along one wall emblazoned with `` le futur sera comestible ou ne sera pas , '' plaster arms held treats -- and lo ! -- some of them moved . guests snagged champagne flutes from well-behaved slices of sky as edible clouds floated past on trays . performers played in cages or were ensnared in sheer fabric . `` it 's not a place for boredom . you could possibly not have a conversation all night and still have a great time by being a happy observer , '' said erin o'connor , whose tulle voilette figured the barest wisp of a cloud . ",
        "well-accustomed to wearing the faces and lives of others , few actors donned masks . the crowd -- which included gabriel-kane day-lewis , monica bellucci and `` yves saint laurent '' actor pierre niney -- was treated to a performance by willow smith , who had changed out of her plumetis skirt and rocked trousers and canvas sneakers . `` when you 're an actor , a lot of things are surreal , '' mused gemma arterton , who had come with sister and fellow actress hannah . having doffed her lacy one , the british actress revealed her favorite mask was `` the really happy joyful one who is happy to be at things and perform . '' ",
        "she will soon appear onscreen as vita sackville-west in `` vita and virginia , '' a biographical drama on the poet 's friendship and love affair with virginia woolf . `` so many people to see , it 's great to see everybody , '' said stephen jones , who wore a silver rectangle that left his eyes visible . `` of course , i wo n't recognize any of them ! '' the star milliner is working on a yet-unnamed exhibition at brighton pavilion , set for later this year and centered around celebrities and designers he has worked with through the years . ",
        "`` in fashion , we 're all wearing a mask of our own choice . i 'm always interested in being the other person . so everything is a bit surreal in my world . that 's the way it should be . what 's real and what 's fake ? i never know . '' what if no else did ? `` thank god , '' he joked . launch gallery : dior ball partyget more from wwd : follow us on twitter , facebook , newsletter .   "
