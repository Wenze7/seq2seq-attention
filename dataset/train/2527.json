        "jericho , n. y. -- one day after congressional leaders hammered out a tax reform agreement , tri-state area residents are calculating what the loss of key deductions will cost them . as cbs2 's carolyn gusoff reported , some experts are advising people to use their deductions now -- before they lose them . holiday shoppers said they are expecting no christmas gift from washington , with tax reform looming that slashes valuable deductions . `` i 'm very concerned , because money is tight , and everybody needs money , '' one woman said . `` we do n't want to give more money to the government . '' ",
        "`` i think it 's going to affect everybody -- anyone who owns property and you pay taxes , '' another woman said . the current form of the bill allows taxpayers to deduct only $ 10,000 in state and local tax -- far below the average on long island . so experts urge residents to act now before deductions disappear . `` these changes they 're making in washington d. c. , look , they 're an assault on all residents across the tri-state area , '' said town of hempstead tax receiver donald clavin . clavin urges residents to pay the second half of the school tax bill now , before the new year . ",
        "`` pay it now . do n't wait . if you can afford it , make that payment before december 31 so you can have that deduction , '' he said . officials also advised that you check with your local government to see which local taxes you can prepay , and also consider estimating and pre-paying next year 's state income taxes . robert spielman , a partner at marcum -- long island largest accounting firm -- said even if you have to borrow from a low-interest line of credit , you 'll come out ahead . `` the after-tax return on paying them now is going to exceed any cost of borrowing the monies , '' spielman said . ",
        "as accountants crunch the numbers with each incarnation of the tax bill , they also say consider paying now for any vanishing deductible expenses -- such as unreimbursed employee expenses , meals and entertainment , and accounting fees . experts say you should check with your tax preparer first to make sure you are eligible for , and will benefit from , pre-paying . anything can change until the tax bill is signed . but experts said there is no downside to prepaying taxes and expenses , and you should plan ahead to make the most of the disappearing deductions . ",
        "because of the alternative minimum tax , not all the recommendations will benefit all local taxpayers . it is important to consult with a tax preparer .   "
