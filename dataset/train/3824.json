        "santiago , dec 14 - the chance to own a stake inchile 's sqm , one of the world 's top lithium producers , has attracted several potential suitors as prices for theso-called white gold - a key ingredient in electric carbatteries - have skyrocketed . but the buyer of the 32 percent of sqm being sold bycanadian potash corp of saskatchewan 's , which needs todivest the stake as part of a merger , will need to navigatetricky politics well before any deal is inked . with a presidential election in chile on sunday , conservative billionaire sebastian pinera has emerged as thefavorite with investors , but neither he nor his opponent in thesecond-round runoff , center-left candidate alejandro guillier , have expressed a favorable view of the scandal-plagued miner . ",
        "chilean authorities accuse sqm of underpaying royalties , environmental violations and illicit political financing , makingthe sale more complicated , raising the specter of delays or asteep price discount , according to analysts . the government has long had a frosty relationship with sqm ` scontrolling shareholder , julio ponce lerou , the formerson-in-law of ex-dictator augusto pinochet . sqm denies the allegations and maintains it is confident ahigh-stakes arbitration with the government over royalties inchile 's lithium-rich salar de atacama region - the source ofhalf of sqm 's revenue - will be resolved in its favor . but the company would still need to renegotiate itsproduction quota with an incoming government unlikely to holdthe miner in high esteem . ",
        "there is much at stake for potash corp , which purchased itsinterest in sqm piecemeal a decade ago and could stand to earnbillions of dollars in the transaction . with shares in sqm uparound 80 percent so far this year , potash 's shareholding isworth around $ 4.8 billion , according to reuters data . the price of lithium , an essential ingredient for batteriesused in electric vehicles , has surged as automakers likevolkswagen and general motors co haveunveiled plans to ramp up production over the next few years . `` there 's lots of action and lots of interest because it ` sthe sexiest commodity on the planet , '' said ben isaacson , ananalyst with scotiabank . ",
        "`` but if i 'm buying potash 's stake , icertainly would n't be spending four or five billion dollarswondering if sqm may have to stop producing in five years . `` sqm 's bitter relationship with authorities has put potash ina tight spot . indian regulators have given the fertilizer company untilapril 2019 to divest its stake as part of its proposed mergerwith canadian rival agrium inc. . sqm , however , has said a final judgment in the arbitrationcase could linger through next year , casting uncertainty overthe sale . meanwhile , the company 's stock has fallen over 7percent in the month since the country 's first-roundpresidential election , compared to a dip of 4.7 percent for thewider chilean market . ",
        "potash corp ceo jochen tilk last week met with eduardobitran , who heads chilean development agency corfo , in santiagoafter talks to resolve the royalty dispute between sqm and corfobroke down in october . potash corp spokesman randy burton declined to comment . acorfo spokesman told reuters that the two had discussed `` thecurrent state of the arbitration over serious contractualbreaches on the part of sqm . `` days later , bitran told reporters : `` because isobligated to sell , having this conflict is a problem . `` representatives of global miner rio tinto plc , u. s.lithium producer albemarle corp and chinese privateequity firm gsr capital have also met with corfo 's bitran inrecent weeks to discuss lithium , according to the chileangovernment 's transparency website . ",
        "while interest appears high , analysts say a deal is unlikelywithout assurances that corfo will extend the miner 's productionquota . ` little risk priced in ` investors are pricing in both a favorable arbitration rulingand a successful renegotiation of its production quota , saidseth goldstein , an equity analyst with morningstar in chicago . sqm 's shares traded in new york dipped after thefirst-round presidential vote on nov. . 19 , but last traded at $ 53.70 . `` there seems to be very little risk priced in , '' saidgoldstein , who estimates sqm 's fair value at $ 46 per share . ",
        "`` themarket appears to be assuming that they 're going to have asuccessful outcome of the dispute and then negotiate a new,longer-term lease . `` but a ruling allowing sqm to keep its lease would not spellthe end of the company 's troubles . at its current rate ofextracting brine , sqm would reach its quota by 2023 with sevenyears left on its lease . that means that sqm would need to cut a deal with corfo tokeep output steady . sqm has repeatedly clashed with presidentmichelle bachelet 's center-left government , so a victory byguillier , who has pledged continuity with bachelet 's policies , would bode poorly for the miner . ",
        "conversely , pinera 's recent statements attacking thecompany 's controlling shareholder mean his pro-business agendamay come as little solace to the lithium miner . `` i am not a friend of ponce lerou . quite theopposite , '' pinera said in a recent interview with localnewspaper la tercera . mending fences with chilean authorities may first meanreaching an agreement to buy out the mysterious ponce , whoresigned as sqm chairman last year after investigationsuncovered insider trading and illicit political financing . corfo 's bitran told reuters this year that developing a goodrelationship with sqm was impossible while ponce remained incontrol . ",
        "ponce in 2016 offered to sell an indirect stake valued at $ 1.5 billion , but ended the sale after receiving no suitableoffers . `` i think if you 're looking at buying the stake , youhave to have at least two conversations . the first is with thechilean government . the second is going to have to be withponce , '' isaacson said .
