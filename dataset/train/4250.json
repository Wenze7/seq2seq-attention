        "when inflation moves higher , fixed income investors often turn to treasury inflation-protected securities , a corner of the bond market easily accessible via exchange traded funds . tips , which are viewed as a low-risk investment , are indexed to inflation . the par value of tips rises with increases in the consumer price index . interest rates on tips are fixed and yields on these bonds and the related etfs are usually low relative to other fixed income assets . recent data from the commerce department indicates u. s. consumer prices are inching higher , meaning it could be time for investors to consider etfs such as the pimco 1-5 year u. s. tips index exchange-traded fund . ",
        "stpz , which is over eight years old , follows the bofa merrill lynch 1-5 year us inflation-linked treasury index . low durationstpz has a duration of just over three years and the effective maturity of the etf 's 12 holdings is just 2.94 years . `` the short maturity-focused mandate gives the portfolio a duration of 3.1 years , which mitigates interest rate risk and provides a strong hedge against immediate inflation , '' said morningstar in a recent note . `` gains and losses from price volatility are muted thanks to the strategy 's short duration . as a result , this fund more closely tracks the realized inflation fluctuations over the short run than its longer duration counterparts do . ",
        "`` the $ 1-billion stpz has a 30-day sec yield of 1.64 percent . the federal reserve 's gauge of inflation rose 0.2 percent in november and 1.8 percent year-over-year . the fed is targeting inflation of 2 percent , a mark that has been missed for several years . how stpz benefitsobviously , rising inflation benefits a fund such as stpz , but investors need to understand how those benefits are realized . `` break-even inflation is the rate that would equate the real return from regular u. s. treasuries and tips with the same maturity , '' according to morningstar . ",
        "at the end of november 2017 , the break-even inflation rate was 1.8 percent , which was 0.2 percent lower than the 10-year rolling break-even rate average of 2 percent . if actual inflation exceeds 1.8 percent , it would reward tips investors , but if it is lower than this threshold , u. s. treasury bonds would come out ahead . `` other pimco inflation etfs include the pimco broad u. s. tips index exchange-traded fund and the pimco 15 + year u. s. tips index exchange-traded fund . related links : loving leveraged oil etfssee more from benzinga .
