        "despite multiple attempts by senior aides to try and get him to accept the intelligence , president donald trump still , over a year after his election , does n't believe that russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election , according to a washington post report published thursday morning . the effort to try and convince trump of the intelligence community 's conclusion that russia meddled in the election began on jan. . 6 , two weeks before he took office , according to the washington post report . now , trump is hindering the u. s. from trying to prevent future russian election meddling attempts . ",
        "this extensive , detailed recap of year 1 of trump and the russian interference issue is a must-read -- aaron blake december 14 , 2017 . not one cabinet meeting to address the russian meddling has been held , and the state department has still yet to push to fight back against russian propaganda that seeks to influence american voters . meanwhile , there 's no government task force focused on finding ways to prevent future russian meddling , according to the post . in fact , in the months since , trump said publicly in november that he believes russian president vladimir putin 's denials over his own intelligence community -- though it was a comment trump was forced to walk back a day later . ",
        "that echoes what democratic lawmakers told mic in november . `` unfortunately , we 're hardly safer now from russian interference in our elections than we were last year , '' rep. eric swalwell , who is part of the house intelligence committee 's russia investigation , told mic . `` we 're still struggling to expose the breadth of russia 's meddling , and our lack of unity lets russia sharpen its knives as our midterm elections approach . '' in fact , as special counsel robert mueller investigates whether the trump campaign or trump himself had anything to do with the russian effort to influence the election , gop members have now started a campaign to delegitimize the probe , with a number of house republicans calling for another special counsel to investigate mueller 's investigation . ",
        "meanwhile , conservative groups are beginning to appear on republican-friendly media outlets like fox news to sow doubt in the fbi 's objectivity -- going as far as to comparing the top federal law enforcement agency to russian spy agencies . . @tomfitton : `` i think the fbi 's been compromised . forget about shutting down mr. mueller . do we need to shut down the @fbi because it was turned into a kgb-type operation by the obama administration ? '' pic . twitter . com/zbparru9qj -- fox news december 14 , 2017 . `` i think the fbi 's been compromised , '' tom fitton , a conservative activist and the president of conservative group judicial watch , which played a role in pushing the hillary clinton email investigation , said on fox news wednesday . ",
        "`` forget about shutting down mr. mueller . do we need to shut down the fbi because it was turned into a kgb-type operation by the obama administration ? '' he asked . it 's unclear what the government will do about the russian attempt to influence american politics going forward . but according to the post , trump is unlikely to fully accept the conclusion that russia interfered in the election . `` if you say ` russian interference , ' to him it 's all about him , '' a senior republican told the washington post . `` he judges everything as about him .
