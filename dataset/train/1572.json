        "wait , what ? ?? are you seriously about to tell me that there are downsides to owning nice headphones alex ? what is this ? some kind of terrible `` first world problems '' article ? well , a bit . but also no . more and more people are taking the plunge into the world of better audio gear every day , and headphones are the most common starting point . but i 've learned through several years of reviewing audio gear that there are all sorts of potential nightmares that nice headphones reveal . and these nightmares can end up costing you a lot of money if you 're not careful . ",
        "hearing the flaws in your equipmentnice headphones are better at exposing little details in your audio ... and at exposing all the issues the rest of your setup might have , ranging from hiss to imbalances and everything in-between . many users start out plugging their headphones into a computer . now , there 's usually a noticeable difference in quality between the average motherboard or laptop jack and a nice dedicated external dac/amplifier . so far , so good ! debates rage online about which dac/amp combo is the best of course ... but any decent external solution should do fine . ",
        "at least , that 's what i thought till last week . i own four different headphone dac/amp combos because i 'm a crazy person . the first one i bought was a soundblaster e1 , a nice cheap little battery-powered number that also has a great microphone built into it and components with solid reputations . it has been confined to my closet for about a year now . last week , i was checking out beyerdynamic 's dt770 headphones on a few different sources to answer a question for a reader , and i decided to dust off my good old e1 and give it another listen . ",
        "and then i heard it : a several decibel channel imbalance between the left and right sides . i swapped the headphones around on my head to confirm it and yup , the channel imbalance swapped sides . guess i should have left that amp in the closet . that imbalance could have been there all along , or it could have developed from all the dust i let get into the device . once you hear a flaw in your non-headphone equipment , the immediate temptation is to run out and buy something new . and many audio companies are all too happy to charge you a high price for their flashy new amp . ",
        "hearing the flaws in your music filessee above , but this time with your source files instead of your gear . digital audio compression is actually really good now . most of the big music streaming services use codecs that are virtually indistinguishable from cd audio , and only the most ardent of listeners could be disappointed . of course , if you have an old collection of low bit rate mp3s lying around , there 's only so much quality for your new headphones to render . and then there are the problems you ca n't control by buying a higher quality copy or subscribing to your streaming provider 's premium tier . ",
        "with a good pair of headphones , you 'll hear all the mistakes the musicians and studio engineers made when originally creating the track . you 'll hear bad edits . you 'll hear distortion . you 'll hear noises in the room . these things might make your music sound more `` authentic , '' or they might really frustrate you . `` upgradeitis '' this is the problem that all others inevitably lead to . `` oh , my pc 's motherboard did n't make my headphones loud enough , and there was some hiss . so i bought a new dedicated amp . ",
        "wow , this sounds so much better ! i ... i wonder how much better a more expensive amp could sound ? '' `` i deleted my old mp3 collection and went back to creating rips from my cds at a higher quality . oh ! this new streaming service offers hi-res files ! maybe i should subscribe and see how their more expensive versions of my favorite tracks sound ? '' `` wow , these new headphones sure do make everything sound great , especially now that i 've spent tons of money upgrading my other gear and my source files because i could n't get past the tiny problems those both had . ",
        "`` i ... i wonder how much better a different , even more expensive pair of headphones would sound ? '' the entire audio industry is subtly designed to keep extracting your hard-earned cash . that 's every industry of course , but it 's rare to see this so cleverly woven into the background . new headphones are an amazing thing , but they only push your brain 's `` better ! '' mechanisms into high gear ... and you 'll begin to wonder what else you 're missing out on out there in the audio world , and what more you could gain by spending more and more money . ",
        "watch out for this . be aware , and do n't forget to enjoy the things you bought ! assuming they do n't break , of course . paranoia about gear death aka come on apple , seriously ? i review a lot of studio headphones , and do n't review as many consumer-focused models . that 's because i 'm buying all this stuff on my own dime ... and i do n't like it when things break . i ca n't keep them in my collection or sell them to someone else if they 're broken . consumer headphones can get pretty expensive . ",
        "you 're paying to subsidize the massive marketing and licensing campaigns that are built up to promote them , in addition to all the other usual costs like manufacturing and research/development . the typical sweet spot for value in consumer headphones is $ 300 . that 's the price that companies want you to spend . by `` companies , '' i mostly mean apple , sony , and bose . the biggest downside of most consumer-focused headphones in this price range is a complete lack of user-replaceable parts . you 're lucky if they let you change the pads out . ",
        "beats does n't even do this . apple does n't want you to fix your headphones if a pad wears out or one speaker dies ... they want you to buy a brand new pair . beats headphones do n't have replaceable pads . they 're glued on . if the ear pads wear out , and you 're outside the warranty , they 'll charge you a `` repair '' fee that 's almost as much as buying a new pair of headphones ... and then they 'll hand you a new pair of headphones because they ca n't repair them either . ",
        "this is the standard policy for most repair claims on beats headphones . they 're a disposable $ 300 item . i hate this . studio headphones do n't usually have this problem . even though they can also get quite expensive , most of them are designed with a large amount of user-replaceable parts . you can often order the parts direct from the manufacturer and do the repairs yourself , or send them in for a nominal fee . warranties tend to be longer . and overall build quality tends to be higher . sure , studio headphones might not look as cool as all the flashy consumer models . ",
        "but when you 're spending a lot of money , do n't you want that investment to last more than a year ? i guess if you 're upgrading every few months it does n't matter . kilobuck headphones are ridiculousover the last few years , the `` kilobuck '' market has seen a lot of expansion . these models are paraded around as the top of the heap ... the pinnacle of audio that only the truly great among you can afford or aspire to . nine times out of ten ... they also do n't really perform that much better than the sub $ 300 headphones . ",
        "do n't buy kilobuck headphones unless you fully aware of their status as a luxury item . you 're not always getting better sound . you 're not always getting a better build . you can do just as well for a fraction of the money . the very studio audio companies i was praising above are as equally guilty of this as the consumer brands . i get that there 's a market for high-end items , and that 's fine ... but more money does not always equal more quality in the world of headphones . have fun ! ",
        "do n't forget that headphone listening is supposed to be fun ! it 's easy to be caught up in the nightmarish rabbit hole of `` finding the best '' and completely lose the joy of listening to music , or movies , or video games ... or whatever audio suits your fancy . take some breaths . take some time to enjoy your headphones and your music . and always sleep on big purchasing decisions for a day . there 's almost never a need to upgrade at this very instant , and if you wait a day you can make sure it 's something you really want .
