        "more than one parity gap exists in women 's college basketball . entering play tuesday , only baylor , connecticut and mississippi state remained unbeaten in conference play among teams in leagues ineligible for these rankings . by contrast , 24 teams that are eligible still have n't suffered a conference setback , even taking into account the far greater number of those teams overall . let 's get to sorting out that glut of mid-major success . 1 . florida gulf coast the atlantic sun looks to be one of the more top heavy conferences in the country this season . ",
        "only three of eight teams entered conference play with winning records , and those same three are now the only teams with winning records in conference play . florida gulf coast beat one of those teams , stetson , by 40 points not so long ago , which suggests the next week and a half is about the only good measure we 'll get of the eagles before the postseason . they play fellow conference unbeaten jacksonville twice in that stretch , first at home on saturday and then on the road feb. . 3 . jacksonville was one of only two a-sun teams to beat fgcu a season ago . ",
        "last week : no . 12 . south dakota state as a team , it 's a mixed bag of late . south dakota state took its time to put away some modest competition in recent weeks , yet beat summit contender western illinois by 36 points . but let 's not worry too much about that . let 's just enjoy macy miller for what the redshirt junior is doing on the basketball court . she scored 31 points in that rout of western illinois and averaged 24.5 points in the team 's four games since the last rankings . ",
        "she did that while shooting 56 percent from the field and averaging 7.3 rebounds and 4.3 assists . she has reached at least 20 points in seven of the past 11 games . there is n't a better mid-major player . last week : no . 23 . green bay in its first six games since a surprise loss at northern kentucky , green bay held opponents in the 20s more often than it allowed them to score as many as 50 points . so it 's back to business as usual for the phoenix . the aforementioned recent shutdown efforts against milwaukee and detroit , in addition to holding horizon contender iupui to 34 points last week , means they have held opponents to fewer than 40 points on six occasions this season . ",
        "that is already as many times as all of 2016-17 -- and last season matched the second-most times a team had done that since green bay moved to division i more than 30 years ago . last week : no . 34 . belmont it 's starting to feel like luck just is n't on belmont 's side this season . leading scorer kylee smith is back in the lineup after missing six games due to injury . but now jenny roy , who leads the team in rebounding and steals , ranks second in assists and nearly had a triple-double in her most recent appearance , has missed the past two games . ",
        "one of the nation 's most efficient offensive teams rolls on nonetheless . belmont ranks 15th nationally in field goal offense , second among mid-majors , and fourth nationally in assist-to-turnover ratio . last week : no . 65 . mercer the only mid-major with a better assist-to-turnover ratio than belmont this season ? it 's mercer , which also has a 15-game winning streak that began following a loss against western kentucky the day after thanksgiving . after matching the ncaa single-game record with 12 3-pointers , keke calloway did n't connect from long range in either of the next two games . ",
        "not only was that the first time that happened this season , it did n't happen at all last season , either . not to worry for someone who is still tied for sixth nationally in 3-pointers made this season . calloway hit five 3-pointers and scored 23 points in mercer 's most recent win against western carolina . a massive socon game looms saturday at chattanooga . last week : no . 76 . duquesne chassidy omogrosso , duquesne 's leading scorer , had a rough day in a big conference road game at george washington . as the clock ticked down inside a minute to play , omogrosso had made just 2-of-10 shots from the field and her team was in danger of losing its first a-10 game . ",
        "but fouled with three seconds to play and the score tied , omogrosso had a chance to save the day . except she missed the first free throw . with all of that frustration and all the weariness of 38 minutes on the court , she made the second and secured the win . she scored 23 points in her next game and a career-best 28 points the game after that , shooting 57 percent in the process , but neither was any more valuable than her resilience . last week : no . 87 . central michigan this is the second instance this week of a team ranked one spot ahead of a team it lost to earlier in the season . ",
        "that is awkward . the case for central michigan 's season-long body of work rests largely on an offense that ranks among national leaders in field goal percentage , effective field goal percentage and points per game , and the more subjective belief that the strength of the mac this season enhances all of the numbers presley hudson , tinara moore , reyna frost and the rest are accumulating . with fellow mac division leader buffalo visiting on jan. . 31 , the chippewas will need all of that offensive efficiency to remain unbeaten . last week : no . ",
        "98 . quinnipiac make it nine wins in a row since back-to-back losses in december dropped last year 's ncaa tournament revelation perilously close to . 500 . the bobcats have the most losses among any of the teams here , but they earned some leeway with the nonconference schedule . and so far they 've won more conference games by 30-plus points than by single digits . of many revealing stats about a team that does everything as an ensemble , quinnipiac trails only belmont in the percentage of field goals that generate an assist . in fact , quinnipiac records assists on a greater percentage of its field goals than even that other well-known team from connecticut . ",
        "last week : nr9 . rice all things considered , winning two out of three from the longest stretch of road games of the season is an acceptable outcome . but losing at fiu , which had five wins all season entering the jan. . 13 encounter was the unlikeliest stumble . the owls shot poorly from the 3-point line in that game , which highlights how important that shot is to their success . four teams here hit more 3-pointers per game than rice -- fgcu , belmont , central michigan and south dakota state -- but all of them also average considerably more points per game . ",
        "add it up and rice is arguably more dependent on that shot than any team here . last week : no . 410 . dayton dayton 's four losses came against teams that currently have a combined 60-18 record . only the first loss of the season against toledo in november was out of reach in the fourth quarter . so a program with a long history in these rankings makes its 2017-18 debut . the flyers score points in a lot of ways , twice reaching triple digits in january , but 3-point shooting has been instrumental to their a-10 form . ",
        "dayton shot just 33.2 percent from long distance out of conference but is hitting 45.8 percent of those shots through seven league games . surges from lauren cannatelli and jayla scaife are the primary movers . it does n't hurt that javonna layfield , eighth nationally in rebounding , has five 3-pointers in conference play after hitting 24 in her first 102 career games . dropped out : ball state , duquesne , new mexicoprevious polls : nov. . 15 | nov. . 29 | dec. . 13 | dec. . 28 | jan. . 13 .
