        "the director told how he picked the stars to voice his new characters . film maker nick park has told how he chose to cast tom hiddleston in his latest film after catching the actor impersonate robert de niro on television . the night manager star takes on the role of villainous french ruler lord nooth in aardman 's upcoming release , introducing viewers to a fresh set of prehistoric-themed stop-motion clay characters . eddie redmayne and maisie williams also star in the movie , which sees a tribe of unfortunate cavemen forced to play football to defend their land from the more advanced iron age newcomers . ",
        "williams has told how she watched videos by a norwegian youtuber to fine tune the accent of football enthusiast , goona . park explained how he was inspired by hiddleston -- known for playing quintessentially british characters -- when he showed off his mimicking skills on the graham norton show in 2015 , winning the approval of de niro himself at the other end of the sofa . speaking ahead of the film 's cinema release this month , park said : `` i saw tom doing robert de niro impressions on graham norton ... then i bumped into him a couple of times and he agreed to do it . ",
        "`` we did try him with an english accent , but that suave , superior voice was too typical , too much expected . `` i had seen him mimic voices so we tried that out and it was funny . when we tried english again , even studio canal were disappointed . '' hiddleston has previously told how his focus during the first recording sessions was `` basically to make nick laugh '' . park added that he was drawn to redmayne after watching his `` self-effacing and unconfident '' portrayal of novice monk osmund in black death and was struck by williams ' ability to be `` versatile and funny '' when working on game of thrones . ",
        "the creator of shaun the sheep and wallace and gromit also flexed his own acting muscles for the movie as the voice of hognob , porcine sidekick to lead character , dug . commenting on the role , which mainly involves a series of expressive grunts , he joked : `` it 's quite easy , really , i tend to go to a sort of scooby doo place . '' considering the bond between lovably clumsy dug and his quietly witty friend , he continued : `` it seems to have defaulted a bit to the wallace and gromit relationship . ",
        "`` we were conscious not to ... but i suppose one is going to make the comparisons . they are different characters but they have a similar relationship . '' : : early man is released in cinemas on january 26 .   "
