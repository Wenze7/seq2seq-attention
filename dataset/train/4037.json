        "gov. cuomo ended 2017 with a couple more parting shots for mayor de blasio , grousing sunday about the failure to address homelessness and the city 's inability to move more quickly to reform rikers island . `` we have severe challenges next year . there is nothing we can not do if we focus on it , '' he said . `` it is our apathy that stops us from solving these problems . there is no reason you have homeless people on the street in 2018 . there 's no reason , but you chose not to do anything about it . '' ",
        "cuomo was taking a victory lap sunday for an increase in the state minimum wage , paid family leave and a tax cut for the middle class -- initiatives that all go into effect on new year 's day . at the tail end of his remarks , given at the west side ymca , he touched on both homelessness and rikers -- two issues that dogged de blasio during his first term . `` there 's no reason why you leave young black men locked up in rikers island . seventy-five percent have n't even been convicted of a darn thing , '' cuomo continued . ",
        "`` none of these things have to be . we can change anything we want to change , and we 've proven it over and over and over again . '' cuomo offered the three policies that go into effect monday as a stark contrast , framing them as an antidote to the federal government 's recent tax overhaul . `` they played the audience , '' he said of the trump administration . `` it turned out to be a total scam . '' cuomo did not mention either trump or de blasio by name . de blasio spokeswoman natalie grybauskas defended his work on rikers and the homeless problem . ",
        "`` the mayor 's made dramatic progress in creating a corrections system that 's smaller and safer , and he 's following through on his commitment to close rikers island , '' she said . `` we 're pleased the governor is showing interest in this process . '' and , she said , '' the homelessness crisis in new york city is decades in the making . this is the first mayor who 's embarked on a real , comprehensive plan to change that . '' starting monday , new york city businesses that employ 11 or more workers will be required to pay $ 13 an hour , as opposed to the previous $ 11 hourly threshold . ",
        "all companies in the state will also have to allow paid leave for employees for the birth of a new born and when a worker 's family members are sick .   "
