        "week 10 : character prototypes , puppet warping & target audiencewanting to get some more visuals for my project underway , i went back to creating some character prototypes , and exploring how they could move . character design prototype -- girli got to work on creating a girl character . i want these characters to be in the same style to keep a sense of consistency throughout the design . i gave her a different expression , just to experiment with portraying emotion in preparation for designing facial expressions within the coming weeks . i added a little bit of depth to this illustration using shadows ; under her hair , jeans , jumper etc. . ",
        "as i develop these prototypes into the finalised characters i will refine the shadows further to make it look more realistic . girl character prototypeboth character designs so farpuppet warp toolwith the update to adobe illustrator a few months back , they added a new tool ; the puppet warp tool . i decided to give this a go to see how it would work for moving limbs on my character . i created three points in the arm , which is where the warp would pivot from . i chose the three natural places in the arm ; shoulder , elbow and wrist . ",
        "when i tried to take a screenshot , the pivot points disappear so i had to take a photo of the screen to show this : i was surprised with how simple using this tool was , and it 'll be a great help when creating different frames for my animations . the image below shows just a quick test , i did n't edit the hands to reflect their new position -- this was purely to test how the tool works . i can see this working well with close up illustrations of hands , as the fingers would also have three pivot points . ",
        "puppet warp tool pointstesting the puppet warp toolrough animation prototype i wanted to see how the puppet warp tool could be useful in creating frame by frame animation . you can see from the images below that i just did a quick prototype -- if i was to do frame by frame , the movement between each would need to be much smaller than i have done so here . i aligned all my characters in a row , then used the puppet tool to warp the arms , moving them to a different position with each ` frame ' . ",
        "i exported each character here separately , ensuring they were placed in the same position on the artboard each time . this would prevent the character jumping around or moving where it shouldnt . then simply for speed , i put each image into gifmaker . org , so i could see it moving . this sign means ` help ' , in the context of giving as it 's moving away from the signer . the reverse of this would mean to receive help . things to note : the movements between each need to be much smaller . ",
        "on the final frame the hand gets a little distorted -- this would be fixed by moving the thumb as it seems to ` stick ' . facial expressions and body movement needs added so it looks more natural . e. g. blinking , torso moving slightly . in the final animations , hands should start from same position -- naturally down by sides . character movement stagescharacter prototype signing ` help ' target audienceoriginally for this concept i was n't going to have a specific target audience , rather make a personalised experience so it could include kids , teens and adults . ",
        "however i 've decided to draw this back to my original target audience of children -- this is where i have the most research and it 'll make things clearer for creating a brand and deciding on illustration styles etc. . target audience : primary school children aged 6 -- 12 . with this target audience i could also look at the possibility of marketing it towards schools . this could be a good aspect to explore , especially when it comes to designing the touchpoints .
