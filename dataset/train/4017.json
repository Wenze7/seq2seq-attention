        "it 's the most wonderful time of the year , and also the most littered . inboxes overflow with direct marketing from purveyors of fine and unrefined goods you just know you did not sign up for . and sell side economists , strategists and analysts are all charged with producing reams upon reams of 2018 outlooks . the best thing about them is they no longer slay forests of trees and can be delightfully deleted . know more about russia than your friends : . my dear friend peter boockvar , who has garnered his fair share of the limelight for laying the cryptocurrency mania at the feet of central bankers , on twitter no less , had this to say this morning about the deluge of direction spewing from his verbose peers on the street . ",
        "`` as we hear about the sell side 2018 market predictions and viewpoints on next year from others , i am completely amazed at the nonchalance with monetary policy . some do not even mention it as a risk factor . let me know if you 've seen one forecast that includes a lower p/e multiple due to $ 1 trillion of liquidity that is being removed by the fed and ecb alone in 2018 on top of more fed rate hikes . i have n't seen any . '' for the record , neither have i . so do us a favor and let us know if you do . ",
        "ok , so it beats heroin . but they say methadone is no cake walk . being weaned off of it is even less fun . in the meantime , in my capacity of arbiter of all things federal reserve , i would be remiss to not weigh in on president trump 's latest nomination to the federal reserve board , dr. marvin goodfriend . you 'll note he is a phd in economics , which can be a good thing if it refers to a brilliant theoretician and practitioner who ensures his thinking changes with the times . by all accounts , dr. goodfriend has indeed evolved as his estimable career has afforded him a vast variety of posts and appointments . ",
        "so that 's a plus . not being intimately familiar with his work , i will chime in on the two areas with which i have studied . goodfriend is a fan of discipline in monetary policymaking . for that , i would grade him an a + . he has also advocated for negative interest rates . given negative interest rates ' terrible track record and the slippery slope they provide to monitored spending via electronic currencies , i 'm afraid i will have to hand out an f - . can we please just not go there ? ",
        "i must say i 'm intrigued by the mystery the financial media has ascribed to the violent rotation out of tech we 've seen . did anyone bother to note that the selloff in tech stocks started the very same moment bitcoin fell out of bed last week ? speculation is speculation . the entrance is always wide open until , that is , the exit is mobbed . with that , i must tip my hat to cnbc 's carl quintanilla . he had the wisdom to chuckle as he started an interview asking an analyst the reasoning behind his prediction that facebook 's stock would rise 30 percent in 2018 , all things considered . ",
        "i 'll paraphrase and spare you the fundamentals you can google to kingdom come -- monopolistic momentum plays are where you need to be . besides , mark zuckerberg is a visionary leader . not only does he run one of the white-hot fang stocks , he has dreams that can reshape our very society as it is challenged in the years to come by the inevitable march of progress . universal basic income anyone ? for more on our job market 's prospects , i invite you to read on to this week 's installment of the job mob : the societal impact of the next downturn .
