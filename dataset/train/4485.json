        "the bizarre message of `` the greatest showman , '' the new movie musical based on the life of famous trickster p. t. barnum : be yourself . a family film starring hugh jackman , it concludes that freak shows such as the one at barnum 's lower manhattan museum were a `` celebration of humanity '' rather than horrible exploitation . and like a pyongyang history book , `` showman '' director michael gracey has polished away real events , ignoring barnum 's dark past and the seediness of his 19th-century new york . the freak show looks more like a cirque du soleil vegas spectacular than the coney island circus sideshow . ",
        "and barnum is re-envisioned as a devoted family man fit for pg audiences , instead of the sleazebag huckster who proclaimed , `` nobody ever lost a dollar by underestimating the taste of the american public . '' the film follows jackman 's down-on-his-luck barnum as he struggles to support his family , including two daughters and a wife , charity . the crafty showman finally becomes the toast of the town when his museum draws hordes of visitors eager to see the likes of `` siamese twins '' chang and eng and 25-inch-tall tom thumb . a musical about barnum is n't a bad idea : broadway 's 1980 `` barnum '' was a hit that made a star of jim dale . ",
        "but the filmmakers need n't shamefully whitewash the real story to make it : `` moulin rouge ! '' the 2001 musical `` showman '' clearly wants to be , managed to romanticize that parisian den of sin without ever suggesting that being a high-end escort is a noble profession . the preachy `` showman '' argues that barnum should be celebrated for bringing `` freaks '' like the bearded lady and others out of the shadows and into his shows , but those characters are sketchily drawn . the choicest songs go to jackman , williams , zac efron and rebecca ferguson , save for the rousing `` this is me , '' belted by keala settle 's bearded lady . ",
        "for the most part , though , the pop songs from benj pasek and justin paul are haphazardly tacked onto this period-accurate musical like some drunk 's game of pin the tail on the donkey . among the film 's few joys is efron , who enjoys a scandalous romance with trapeze artist anne . a pity that this movie turns p. t. barnum into father teresa .
