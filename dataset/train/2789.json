        "montreal canadiens fans have an idea of the players who could be moved at the trade deadline , and they may have to add andrew shaw to that list . let 's play a quick little game . fill in the blank : there 's a chance that _______ is moved at the deadline . max pacioretty , tomas plekanec , and alex galchenyuk were most likely the names that came to mind . all make sense to some extent . pacioretty could fetch a lot for the habs and as some have mentioned already , would be the perfect two-year rental . ",
        "plekanec is a pending unrestricted free agent and trying to get something for him considering how the season has gone is the better option . and even though management has stressed that they do n't plan on giving up on galchenyuk , it would n't surprise me if marc bergevin moves him in an attempt to make a final push . desperation and optimism is a terrible combination . however , tsn 's latest trade bait list may have a new player added to the moving van in andrew shaw . frank seravalli had 20 players on his board , and three of them were from montreal . ",
        "pacioretty was 5th , galchenyuk 7th , and shaw 13th . some fans on social media have floated the idea of bergevin moving the 26-year-old , but it did n't really add up . keep in mind ; i 'm not saying that shaw being on seravalli 's list confirms that he always has one foot out the door , but it does give us something to talk about . similarly to gallagher , shaw has been one of the habs ' most consistent forwards . his play all season has made him a go-to option for claude julien as he makes his presence known on the ice no matter where he plays . ",
        "he is also great in the faceoff circle and has gotten the team on the board on several occasions by winning a draw . three of shea weber 's goals were directly from a shaw faceoff win . jeff petry also benefitted from it against the vancouver canucks in december . he also has a scoring touch of his own as he 's in a three-way tie for third on the habs in goals with ten . several teams who want to add experience , physicality and all-around reliable play could use someone like shaw in a deep playoff run . ",
        "players go into the post-season with the mindset of doing whatever it takes to win a stanley cup , and we 've seen how intense and willing he can be in key situations . there is a drawback , and it 's his contract . shaw will be making $ 3.9 million for the next four seasons , and although it 's not terrible for the habs themselves considering their cap situation , i could see other teams having a problem with it . it might be a different story if he was a pending ufa like plekanec because then montreal could just retain some salary . ",
        "that being said , i do n't think shaw should be the one to go . he brings a lot to the team is one of those heart and soul guys that every organization should have . if bergevin is given an offer on the belleville native that could help the habs in the future , he should do it , but that should be the only circumstance . the frustrating this is that you can never tell with a season like this . hopefully , bergevin can get a fair return for whoever the habs decide to move . ",
        "one thing they do n't need is to be on the other end of a fleecing . next : a playoff push may ruin the plando you think shaw is being made available ? if so , what could bergevin get for him ? let us know your thoughts in the comments . more from a winning habit montreal canadiens : the bye week is over and it 's time for action5h ago montreal canadiens : michael mccarron 's future role with the team23h ago montreal canadiens : carey price selected for the all-star game1 d ago montreal canadiens : alex kovalev 's reasons for the state of the team2d ago montreal canadiens : making a claim on cody franson3d ago montreal canadiens fans have an idea of the players who could be moved at the trade deadline , and they may have to add andrew shaw to that list .
