        "any individual living in human society get inspired by someone that he or she finds aligned with their thoughts . a role model is the one who inspires to become like himself . i too live in a society where i meet people and read people those have made a significant impact in his own life and then that has been noticed by the world . i do n't have one role models , but i have a set of people who have impacted my life deeply . i may not be able to become like them but when i look for some transformative changes in my life i see them as a bench mark . ",
        "it 's hard to cover all of them at one place but i talk about my father first when i look for a role model . i have never seen anyone in my life so organised in his/her life as my father is . the value for time and maintaining consistency in any work while managing all necessary day to day work are two things that i feel myself far apart . i have seen my father transforming his life drastically with the highest level of willpower and consistency . he was a sick person 15 year back . suffering from all diseases that are the result of modern lifestyle . ",
        "he was on medication for blood pressure , sugar and depression . those days our home was a hell to live in . doctors had prescribed him medicines that were creating an addiction for him and he was behaving like a drug addict . then he started doing morning walk after getting inspiration from one of his friends . i too started running and jogging those days . i started and ended this at least 15 times in past fifteen years but at the same time , i can claim he has not deviated from his schedule for more than fifteen days . ",
        "he understood the secret of being healthy and started doing yoga by following ` baba ramdev ' on the tv itself . many people started with him including me , but he is the one continuing with this practice since last 12 years . he wakes up 6 o'clock in the morning irrespective of the weather and schedule . he understands that consistency can only be achieved by managing own time in the way best suitable to him . so , he does not get carried away by any one 's suggestions to do yoga at 5:00 am in morning or doing morning walks at 4:00 o'clock in morning . ",
        "after 15 years when i look back to him i find him in completely changed person . he is always happy and free from all worries even after managing one coal mine running 24x7 with more than 300 workers . he is so passionate about yoga that he can do this even in train and public places . he is the one who does things that is important to him and never makes excuses . i am trying to get that level of commitment to the work i am doing . he is not only good at managing his time but also , he is having excellent skills in managing relations . ",
        "still , he is in touch with most of his friends from college . they do n't meet for ten years sometimes but when they meet they are very friendly and enjoy the days to its fullest . he is having a tremendous quality of respecting all people in the way one person is . so , he is having friends of a different personality . my father does n't drink but when it comes to the party he will seat with the people , talk to them . he manages his time so well not to miss any of the social functions related to him . ",
        "he even visits far villages where it is difficult to reach , and he can easily make an excuse for his busy schedule but attending social events is his priority and he is doing it at all costs . next quality that makes him my role model is he honesty . he is the person with high ethical values both in personal and professional life . working in coal india and being honest makes him an odd man out . even after facing all political and criminal challenges he is stick to his value and not compromising with work ethics . ",
        "very politely he deals with the situation and keeps himself aside from all such corruptions , at the same time he can maintain relationships with the person he is dealing with . this makes him a smart manager without attending any managerial lectures in business schools . he is very well prepared for all the situations in his life and never gets deviated from his principles in life . i do n't remember any moment in my life where my father is disrespecting the opinions of the mother . even is very critical and serious situation he can make the environment light . ",
        "in both personal and professional life , i have never met a person so well balanced and controlled even in adverse conditions . i believe yoga and exercise has given him a new way to look at his own life where he can have a space for everything that matters for him and he can manage it so well that it appears cakewalk for him but when others try it 's a challenging task even to adopt one of the practices that he is following . he is having equal mastery on technical as well as religious knowledge . his highest level of commitment , openness to learn , tremendous logical and analytical skills , perfectly planed physical and financial life , perfection in work , in-depth knowledge about all the fields of his of his concern , well managed personal and professional life makes him different and superior to anyone i have ever met in my life . ",
        "i have never seen whether people were tallying the clock timing with gandhi 's schedule , but i have seen my father practicing a life of consistent discipline since last 15 years , and i wish one day i will be like him .   "
