        "the seattle seahawks need a new offensive coordinator , and they reportedly have interest in a name that many new york jets fans will find familiar . could this be the man to replace darrell bevell ? brian schottenheimer , the son of former nfl head coach marty schottenheimer , is apparently being targeted by pete carroll . brian schotteneimer served as the jets offensive coordinator from 2006-2011 , and was the offensive mind that led the jets in their two afc championship appearances in 2009 and 2010 . schottenheimer then served as the st. louis rams offensive coordinator from 2012-2014 . ",
        "the younger schottenheimer is currently the quarterbacks coach of the indianapolis colts , and he has found success as an offensive coordinator in the past . being the seahawks offensive coordinator is a pretty appealing job , considering they have one of the best quarterbacks in the nfl in russell wilson , who continues to improve every year . the seahawks have developed a winning culture over the last few seasons , but fell just short of the playoffs in 2017 . whoever takes over as their offensive coordinator will need to find a way to get their running game going , which has been a struggle since marshawn lynch left seattle . ",
        "maybe brian schottenheimer is the answer .   "
