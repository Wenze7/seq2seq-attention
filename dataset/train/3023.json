        "a never-ending criticism of democrats is that they do n't have a plan of their own , that we 're simply opposed to republicans . while there 's plenty of platform issues that we can point to that show otherwise , i thought it was time to put ideas to paper about what a liberal personal and business tax reform and simplification act might look like . this may not be the most progressive tax bill possible . the goal here is to attain a simplified , more progressive tax code that seeks places of compromise with our republican counterparts . ",
        "the items are listed here with brief justifications written below . 1 . raise the social security tax ceiling to $ 200,000 in wages . 2 . eliminate the long-term capital gains tax for the first $ 35,000 in capital gains while the rest is treated as income . 3 . keep the personal exemption eliminated ; maintain deductions enacted in gop tax act . 4 . reduce the personal income tax brackets from 7 to 5 as follows : -- 0 % -- single -- up to $ 45,000 ; married -- up to $ 70,000 -- 25 % single $ 45,001 -- $ 100k ; married -- $ 70,001 -- $ 120,000 -- 35 % single $ 100,001 -- $ 200k ; married $ 120,001 -- $ 225k -- 40 % single $ 200k -- $ 999k ; married -- $ 225,001 -- $ 999k -- 45 % single & married -- $ 1,000,000 +5 . ",
        "$ 13/hour minimum wage for companies with more than 5 employees . 6 . re-instate the state , local , and property tax deduction . 7 . limit the mortgage interest deduction to first homes only . 8 . create estate tax marginal tax brackets as follows : -- 20 % -- $ 1,000,000 -- $ 3,000,000 in estate value -- 30 % -- $ 3,000,001 -- $ 10,000,001 in estate value -- 40 % -- $ 10,000,001 + in estate value -- this tax does not apply to farms . 9 . refinance all outstanding student loans to 3 % interest rate . ",
        "80 % of profits from the education department 's student loan portfolio are to be re-invested in expanded pell grants . 10 . raise the medicare tax from 2.9 % to 4 % while making enrollment eligible to all people in the first and second tax brackets . explanation and justifications : 1 . currently , the social security tax only applies to the first $ 130,000 in income . raising the ceiling to $ 200,000 increases the revenue going into the social security fund which will keep it solvent longer . the tax is paid half by employee and half by employer . ",
        "corporations got a pretty sweet tax break with that gop bill -- they can afford to help pay for senior citizens to live in dignity . 2 . capital gains is taxed at a separate rate . currently , the two lowest current tax brackets do n't pay long-term capital gains tax ; everyone but the top tax bracket pays 15 % and the highest tax bracket pays 20 % . i would argue that by eliminating the tax on the first $ 35,000 in gains we still incentivize the the middle class to invest their money while making sure that folks whose primary income is long-term capital gains are not paying too little in tax . ",
        "3 . having a personal exemption and a standard deduction is redundant : both limit the amount of taxable income a person has . keep it simple and call it a deduction . 4 . a common refrain is `` the complexity of the tax code '' . this is in large part due to taxes being `` marginal '' . another contributor , however , is how many tax brackets there are in total : 7 . we can effectively reduce it to 5 , with only 4 brackets actually paying tax at all . these new brackets are more reasonable insofar as people making below $ 45,000 in income are already stretched thin due to rising costs of healthcare , food , rent , and services . ",
        "these new brackets also insure a more fair distribution of taxes between the middle , upper middle , and wealthy -- no longer blurring the lines . for what it 's worth , a top marginal tax rate of 45 % is still far lower than what taxes were in 1980.5 . the progressive fight has been for $ 15/hour as a standard minimum wage , but plenty of research has shown that this number is in some place higher than a true necessary minimum while simultaneously too low in others . to split the difference , we can set the federal level at $ 13/hr to insure some semblance of fairness to low-cost jurisdictions while setting the trend in the right direction for higher cost jurisdictions . ",
        "local communities and states will continue to be responsible for setting a more locally-oriented minimum wage . 6 . cities and states drive america . places where residents have decided that they will spend more of their own money on taking care of their own should not be punished . as it stands currently , the highest local/state tax jurisdictions pay more in federal revenue than low-tax states . capping the state , local , and property tax deduction harms millions of middle class americans and drives no benefit to those not impacted by it . 7 . owning a home is a luxury that many people may never attain . ",
        "nobody needs a break for owning two . 8 . the estate tax or `` death tax '' as republicans fondly call it is set to apply to estates worth north of $ 10,000,000 . we can create a more equitable estate tax by treating it with marginal tax rates that scale upward the higher the estate 's value while also preventing certain high-appraisal , low-liquidity items from being taxed too heavily . 9 . education is good for society and good for the economy . the government is making an investment that does not need a large monetary return . ",
        "so long as inflation is low the government can set an interest rate that covers the cost of running a loan underwriting operation and keep its repayment closer pegged to inflation . a drop from 6.8 % to 3 % saves a $ 35k student loan with a 10 year term almost $ 70/month and a student $ 100k student loan with a 25 year term about $ 220/month . 10 . access to healthcare is essential for a good quality of life . we can simplify our byzantine aca-era insurance system by allowing americans to have a `` public option '' . ",
        "raising the medicare tax -- which is paid by every worker and employer and all incomes -- insures that we can fund and sustain affordable healthcare . the personal income tax code can be made progressive and simplified .   "
