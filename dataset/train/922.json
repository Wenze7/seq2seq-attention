        "a generalist . that 's what people usually call someone like me . some would even say `` dabbler '' . what people do n't understand is how something seemingly dilettantish can be an impetus for growth and self-actualization . my career path has been non-linear and i have worn `` many hats '' . i will not bore you with a list of my work experiences . i will mention though , that throughout my 15 year-career , i 've worked in industries such as advertising , marketing , sales , hr , it , bpo , health services , education , and retail . ",
        "i started from a rank-and-file position and worked my way up across these industries . allow me to provide you an insight on the psyche of a generalist . the cure for boredom is curiosityfor every role that i 've taken on , my average stay is more or less 24 months . some would frown upon it and would be skeptical about whether i 've learned anything at all or if i was effective . still , some would argue about how long it would take to achieve mastery on a particular field . i 'm not concerned with that because it 's for the specialists to do . ",
        "my vision is directed at how something is done ; how it works ; how to make it better ; and utilize a multi-disciplinary approach in the process . see , the thing about how my mind works is that when i do something new , i am genuinely interested in doing it . i commit . i go all-in . i initially study what i am to do from a macro level ; then study its constituent parts ; and then work from there . after application and execution , i experience an internal plateau . i 'm aware i 've reached that point when i get my existential episodes . ",
        "that 's my trigger that it is time to move on and experience/learn something new . there really is no cure for curiosity . suffering `` i 'm not the strongest , i 'm not the fastest , but i 'm really good at suffering '' - amelia boonethe most painful part about doing something new is being aware of how little you know about it . so you force yourself to consume knowledge and learn as much as you can within the time that you have , then apply it all at the same time . your processing power is on center stage . ",
        "you will be plagued with self-doubt at different points in the process . keep in mind though that performing a role well is a manifestation of intelligence and a test of will . values such as humility , resilience , persistence , and intuitiveness will carry you to completion . if you are risk-averse , then be a specialist . generalists always look for opportunities to suffer . nothing amazing ever happens inside one 's comfort zonethe way i see it is that the sooner you make a decision about anything in your life , the sooner you change its course to self-actualization . ",
        "you will never know your limits until you test if it even exists . be internally boundless . admittedly , not everyone has this kind of mindset and those who do have amazing stories to tell . if you are gifted with intellect , you are compelled to maximize it and spread yourself out because you know that you have limited time to use it . the insatiable desire to learn what you can and apply it for yourself or to make a difference in your sphere of influence , is growth in itself . a specializing generalist ? amassing a wide set of skills allows you versatility . ",
        "having a big picture orientation to industries/processes and having the capability to fluidly switch from one skill to another is convenient but limited . that 's where the specialists come in . as a generalist , knowing the moving parts makes it easy to identify and position the specialist for the task and how each one relates to the big picture . you acknowledge their value and this respect translates to synergy . i am specializing on being a generalist to ultimately build and run my own organization/company it comes down to a question of what and when . my true friends know me as jax and i 'm currently gearing up for taking on a new role in technology and engineering industry in the 1st quarter of 2018 .
