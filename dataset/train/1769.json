        "forget the bouquet that wilts within a week -- these miracle roses last for up to 12 months . red roses may be the quintessential valentine 's day gift , but if you 've ever spent $ 100 on a bouquet , only to see it wilt a few days later , it can be a heartbreaking present . to avoid the disappointment this year and give a gift that represents your everlasting love , our beauty director heather muir has found the perfect solution : eternity roses from venus et fleur . it may sound like something dreamed up in a disney movie , but this time , the beauty and the beast enchanted rose has come to life . ",
        "eternity roses look , feel , and smell like real roses -- because they are real roses . the difference is that they 've been cut during peak bloom , and then treated with venus et fleur 's special , top-secret solution and color pigmentation process so that they can last for much longer than your standard garden-variety blooms . all of the roses are sourced in ecuador , and are then fed the magic mix that makes them last . do n't believe that these blooms can actually outlive most of your houseplants ? neither did we -- that is , until heather muir , real simple 's beauty director , received them as a gift . ",
        "`` as a beauty editor , i 'm lucky to get the most beautiful bouquets , and while they 're so gorgeous in the moment , i 'm always a little sad when they wilt and it 's time to throw them away . so when a company sent me four white roses from venus et fleur over six months ago , i was so intrigued -- they look fresh and real yet require zero maintenance . i keep them on my desk and they look exactly like they did the day i first received them , '' says muir . ",
        "the true sign that these flowers are the perfect present ? muir was inspired to give them as a gift herself . `` i love them so much , i just sent a box to my best friend as a housewarming gift the day she moved into her new apartment . '' because these flowers are a little different than the roses you 'll find at the florist , you 'll need to follow special care instructions to make sure they thrive for a full year . the most important thing to remember : do n't water them . your first instinct may be to pop these beauties in a vase of fresh water , but according to venus et fleur 's care tips , keeping them in the original box and away from water and direct sunlight is ideal . ",
        "and if they start to get a little dusty after months on display ? just clean the petals gently with a duster . related : high-quality roses do n't come cheap -- and these eternity roses are even pricier -- but just consider it an investment in a gift that keeps on giving . choose from a single perfect rose in seven different colors , which comes in a petite parisian-style box , for $ 39 , or create a truly extravagant display with the 16-rose box for $ 299 . schedule an order for february 14 , then get ready for an entire year 's worth of valentine 's blooms .
