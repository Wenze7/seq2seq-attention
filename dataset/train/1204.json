        "i 'm not a doctor , but i played one on tv . really . 25 years ago , i sold consumer products , mostly luggage , to hsn and qvc . i hired a `` guest host '' to appear on-air , to work with the network `` show host '' and to demonstrate our products . one day the guest host was delayed , and i ended up with make-up on my face , a microphone up my shirt and an ifb in my ear . there 's only so much you can say about luggage . after over 100 guest appearances , i got bored . ",
        "my show producers and directors got bored . and , more important , my audience got bored . `` try something new , '' was suggested . back in the day , i was a pre-med student , studying neuroscience . i spent a summer working in a hospital . i still had my lab jacket and a stethoscope . the `` luggage doctor '' was born . our engineering team sawed a suitcase in half , and stitched it back together loosely , with a few light threads . i placed the `` stunt '' luggage on a gurney , covered it with a sheet , and rolled it onto the set . ",
        "`` let me show you , '' i would say , `` the anatomy of a healthy suitcase . '' i uncovered the suitcase , and proceeded to use a scalpel to peel back the outer skin , cut through the steel frame , reveal the components and lining , while describing the inner workings of luggage , rarely seen in public . these shows sold a lot of luggage . and , i got to play a doctor , on tv . when you 're on-air with these extraordinary networks , a director is shouting instructions in your ear through your ifb .

        "`` close-up on your right hand in 3 , 2 , 1 ... keep still . '' or , `` do n't forget to mention the self-mending zippers . '' or , `` did you hear the one about ... '' you have three , or more , large rolling cameras moving around you . some are robotic , operated from the control room , some are handheld and move in for close-ups on your face , products or surgical technique . and , there are monitors facing you , displaying a dizzying array of camera angles and , most important , graphs and statistics : customers online , callers on hold , available inventory , sold inventory , and more . ",
        "this data is updated in real-time . this is an invaluable tool , and a great distraction . lesson one : learn to pay no attention to the man behind the curtain , or the camera . imagine your customer is on set with you . speak to this virtual customer , off camera , and to your show host , on camera . make it real . lesson two : you meet some very odd people in the green room . sometimes , you 're the odd one . lesson three : it 's not about you . it 's about them . ",
        "it 's about the audience , the customer , understanding their needs , solving their problems . lesson four : different times of day there are different show hosts , and these hosts have distinct audiences who loyally tune in . each show host has a persona , and so does their fan base . play to the unique attributes of the audience . it may be about function , or fashion , or whimsy , or family ... it may be down home , or fast-paced , or educational . lesson five : use the monitors . the real-time stats are incredible tools . ",
        "the luggage doctor had to find a balance between `` entertaining '' and `` selling . '' some story-telling was great and captivating . i heard this from callers ... and i also saw the immediate drop-off in orders . the audience was so enthralled , they did n't call or click , they just watched . some features i demonstrated lit up the incoming order stats , and others fell flat , all live , in real-time . i adjusted my dialog , tempo and demonstrations to respond to the audience and the incoming data , to leverage the effect of `` stimulus and response . '' ",
        "these lessons have served me well as i work today with the world 's leading brands and retailers , in-stores and online ... and occasionally on tv . it 's about the customer , determining and satisfying their distinct needs . customers are not segments , they 're people . tune the brand , product and message to the customer . be entertaining , have fun . but not too much fun . different niches of consumers require unique targeted marketing . data is a valuable tool . embrace information , make fast informed decisions . when you wear a lab jacket , people pay attention .
