        "of all the caring professions , social workers probably have the blackest humour . and need it the most . so it feels appropriate that the beautifully observed and not-as-grim-as-expected kiri opens with a small dark laugh . the kind that tugs at the corners of the mouth where sadness also resides . senior social worker miriam , whose day begins with a nip of vodka in her cuppa and a visit to a young drug addict to drop off a packet of sausages , is shooting the breeze with a fellow dog walker about cancer , death and her nightmares . ",
        "`` which always involve blood ... never a nice clean soft death , '' she notes chirpily . she reels off her dog 's illnesses , which include gout , testicular cancer and depression . `` he 's got a lovely coat though , has n't he ? '' the hapless dog walker replies . it 's a very british moment , drenched in pathos and pollution from a circumambient flyover , perfectly setting the tone for this nuanced four-parter . the kiri of the title is one of miriam 's cases : a nine-year-old black girl on the brink of being adopted by her middle-class white foster family . ",
        "we meet her as her foster mother brushes her hair in the morning , comparing her slender neck to audrey hepburn 's iconic one ; the complexities of transracial adoption quietly playing out in a small private moment . kiri is full of clever scenes that gently tease out the knotty tangle of intersectional themes -- race , class , social care -- without threatening to strangle . miriam makes the decision to allow kiri an unsupervised visit with her grandparents before the adoption goes through . `` i 'm black , '' kiri says pointedly in miriam 's car on the way there . ",
        "`` i need to find out how black people live . i get it . '' during the visit , kiri is abducted by her birth father . by the end of the engrossing first episode , her body has been found on the bristol downs . kiri , though , is less a murder mystery and more a forensic examination of the fallout . the impact of the death on everyone from her grandparents to the social work department is the story . also , the way in which cases like this -- and writer jack thorne has said he intends to pen a drama about grenfell tower -- feast on , exploit and distort attitudes to race and social class . ",
        "`` did you allow unsupervised contact because she was black ? '' a reporter shouts at miriam . one of the difficult questions raised is whether she prioritised kiri 's cultural needs over her safety . really , though , this is about the forthright , passionate and criminally undervalued social worker who , years into the job and despite being scapegoated by everyone , has n't burnt out . for once , we get to occupy the point of view so rarely considered in real-life cases . miriam is the drama 's moral compass . `` poor girl , '' she whispers , stunned with grief and guilt , to her boss after kiri 's body is found . ",
        "`` poor us , '' is her manager 's terrified response . lancashire has a sheridan smith-like ability to disappear into her characters . her miriam has a dishevelled , weary-eyed gravitas that will be familiar to happy valley fans . she is an isolated figure , the carer in need of care , usually accompanied by nothing more than her gouty dog and a hip flask . and in a rare reference to her personal life , we discover that miriam harbours a terrible grief of her own . `` you remind me of my son , '' she says to the teenage birth child of kiri 's foster parents . ",
        "`` cancer . he was 13 . please do n't think any more about it . '' which , with writing as good as this , means that of course we will . the next episode of the four-part drama kiri is on wednesday at 9 pm this article originally appeared on the guardian .   "
