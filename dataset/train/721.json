        "so i am sitting here ... and this wave of hopelessness washes over me . i observe my mind that goes and tries on different memes to make sense of the feeling . `` no matter what i do ... . '' the whining voice says . `` it 's hopeless ... give it up ! '' says the authoritative voice . `` you are worthless ... who do you think you are to think that you are any better ? '' none of these are mine . the feeling comes from my next door neighbor who became a `` christian '' to feel better , but it 's not working for her . ",
        "i remember having a cartoon on my kitchen cupboard for a decade . dennis the menace standing on a kitchen stool tearing off today 's page off the calendar , hoping that that would change how it is . and the caption says : no matter where you go , you take yourself with you ... i think that over time it created a turning point for me : outside fixes do n't fix what is wrong inside . outside fixes do n't fix what is wrong insidethat is very significant . first off : you need to distinguish what is outside and what is inside ... not easy . ",
        "second : you need to stop trying to fix the outside ... by saying my favorite saying : it ai n't nothing till i call it ... it 's not right , it 's not wrong ... it 's nothing . and once i wrestled my power back from what the world says reality ... i can , in earnest , start to look around , inside , at all the things that make life sooooooo bad for me . the starting point measurements deals with your inside . this is why it does n't make sense for a lot of you . ",
        "you live your life wholly and fully on the horizontal plane , the outside . where you have no power , and all the shots are called by others ... not you . worthlessnessthe most fundamental feeling a person has , in my experience , is worthlessness . a version of powerlessness ... all worthlessness is an outside thing projected on the inside . on the inside no one is worthless . but on the outside , every time the world had a hope , an expectation , a pain , and you did n't fix it for them , you tune into the meme , the broadcasted voice that says the therefore you are worthless . ",
        "for the little girl whose sister was banished from home ... and she could not save her from it . for tesla who could not change that his brother , the brilliant one , was trampled to death . no amount of brilliance fixed that ! or you , whose mother hoped that having a child will make them whole and complete ... and you could not fix her ... or you , whose father was an unhappy alcoholic ... you could not fix it ... you could not fix that he , maybe , beat your mother ... all those things you could not fix ... and now you are tuned into the `` no matter what i do , i am worthless '' broadcast . ",
        "you can make millions . you can win the gold medal . you can marry the most beautiful woman everyone is in love with . but no matter what , you ca n't fix your worthlessness . why ? because it is an outside thing that you internalized . inside you are not worthless . inside you are just you . no requirements to save anyone ... people invented god to save them . people invented governments to save them . people invented positive thinking to save them . people invented mindmovies , visionboards to save them . but nothing can save you from your pain . ",
        "you just have to take it , and take it with you . assigning children , husbands , god , teachers to be your savior is unfair . especially because they will already view themselves in that role , even if it is `` i am not your savior '' role ... watch as you also perpetuate the savior meme ... blaming others for not saving you . or things for not saving you . you ca n't be saved ... pain is pain , misfortune is misfortune , tragedy is tragedy , loss is loss . you either get tripped by them , made stuck by them , or you take them in stride , and live a life worth living . ",
        "i do n't mean ignore them . i mean feel it all , grieve if you can , grieve if you must , and then move on , but take it with you . do n't deny it either . do n't lie , do n't pretend . allow bad experience to enrich your life . you do n't need a savior and you do n't need to be a savior . now , that worthlessness can be gone : who are you going to be ?
