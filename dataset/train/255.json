        "dear humans , ho ho ho ! -lrb- i 've never really understood why i 'm supposed to say this . christmas is almost upon us and as is usually the case , my elves and i have been hard at work , ensuring that your gifts are delivered to your kids on time . my job is to separate naughty from the nice but every year i find that all the kids are all actually very nice ... it 's their parents who need to be addressed . to begin with , i love all of you . but it 's time i remind you what this little thing called love means . ",
        "guys , here 's the memo : your latest phone does not matter . neither does your big home in or a bigger car , bitcoins and fidget spinners . what matters is this : celebrating life . let me tell you some of the letters i get . 8-year-old rhea writes that her father missed her classical singing performance at the school 's annual day for the 2nd year in a row in favour of going for his company retreat . or little aryan who has dinner in front of the tv on most nights because his parents are out . ",
        "no matter how much the world changes and how many apps are launched , the letters never change . life 's true gifts like family , friendships and a lot of dark chocolate binges . i know this sounds odd from a man who is revered for his `` gift giving skills '' but hey , i 'm wise so you 'd do well to listen to me . kids are really easy to please . i browse through their snapchats , facebooks and instagrams to know what is it that they long for but , i only plan for their christmas . ",
        "it is parents who plan for their life . i have a goal every christmas and that is to deliver joy on the morning of 25th december . on that day , it 's my job . for the rest of the year , it 's yours . to spend time with them , hold them , save for them , plan for their future , and have lots of fun with them . believe me , kids are fun . so , let me stop being sentimental and get back to planning my gifts . now , is n't that better than ho ho ho !
