        "`` wise men speak because they have something to say ; fools because they have to say something . '' -- platothe words that come out of our mouths can be interpreted in four ways : positive , negative , neutral , or unclear . smart , emotionally-mature folks tend to speak in a deliberate , transparent manner ; crafting their words to minimize a negative or enigmatic response . but the truth is that we 've all said something we 've regretted . perhaps our words deeply hurt someone , whether intentional or not . we 've all had to deal with the horrible `` i want to stick my dirty foot into my dirty mouth '' feeling . ",
        "yeah , it sucks . it really sucks . emotional intelligence is defined as `` the capacity to be aware of , control , and express one 's emotions , and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically . '' one 's level of eq is often determinative of how our words are interpreted by someone else . furthermore , it is this type of intelligence -- not `` book smarts '' or iq score -- that plays the predominant role in deciding what to say and , just as important , what not to say . eq is intrinsically linked with social awareness -- the ability to decipher the emotions and experiences of other people . ",
        "in other words , our ability to be empathetic . to avoid the dreaded thoughts and feelings that accompany an impulsive , erratic string of words , it helps to have a basic understanding of things not to say in public .   "
