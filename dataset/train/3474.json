        "kirklees urged to speed up repairs on lighting in the borough . lengthy delays in fixing broken street lights in kirklees is putting local residents and properties at risk , it has been claimed . statistics have shown that the average time taken by kirklees council to repair street lights in the borough that have been reported as faulty is 11 days . the national average is seven days . the figures were revealed after an investigation by the liberal democrats . faulty street lights were reported on 7,136 occasions . currently , there are more than 150 across kirklees #awaiting repair . ",
        "kirklees ' liberal democrat group leader , clr nicola turner , said the council was `` failing to do even the most basic job of keeping the lights on '' . she called on the labour-run authority to do more to safeguard homes and people . `` local streets plunged into darkness in the early evening through the winter . it is a gift to criminals and a threat to public safety . `` street lights are important to help cut crime , reduce the risk of road accidents and reassure people walking home at night . '' clr turner added that the use of led and low-energy bulbs would save money and help protect the environment . ",
        "it follows the council 's announcement that it would be installing 30,000 led street lights - which use as little as 35 % of the energy of traditional street lights - with dimming technology until 2020 . `` led lighting is more expensive up-front when compared to traditional street lighting but the energy use is much lower , so it results in savings over time . the cost of maintenance is also lower . i hope that the council will continue to install more led street lighting . '' this is why the river holme suddenly turned ` irn bru ' orangecalderdale council has already begun replacing old low-pressure sodium lamps with led , or light-emitting diode , lights . ",
        "the four-year project will involve the replacement of 11,000 lighting columns and 19,000 ` lanterns ' on existing columns . the council currently spends £ 1.3 m powering the street lights each year , and their carbon dioxide emissions cost the council £ 50,000 . it is estimated the new energy-efficient led street lighting , which sends most light down to the roadway , could save up to £ 900,000 a year in energy costs and other savings . a kirklees council spokesperson said : `` the council has over 52,00 streetlights and have agreed funding of £ 12.5 m to upgrade the street lighting stock to led over 5 years . ",
        "`` the council has invested £ 2.6 m this year as part of the programme to convert these to led . so far approximately 20,000 street lights have already been converted to led . `` this investment is saving over 50 % of the energy used compared to a more traditional streetlight and reducing the number of repairs needed to keep the streetlights working . `` the backlog of repairs is about at its highest at this time of year with a repair time of about 10 days and currently number of streetlights awaiting repair is less than 1 % of the total number . ",
        "`` however our repair teams and northern power grid are working hard to get all the lights working again . ''   "
