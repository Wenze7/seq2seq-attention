        "stephen andrew vincent has apologised for the drunken punch that felled a duty lawyer who was trying to help him . vincent happened to meet the same lawyer when he arrived at christchurch 's new justice and emergency services precinct on friday , and delivered the apology personally . the lawyer had declined to meet the 48-year-old at an official restorative justice conference , after he admitted the assault . but he received the apology as vincent arrived to be sentenced by christchurch district court judge brian callaghan for assault and for misusing a telephone . police said the victim was often at the court house where he was available as a duty lawyer , providing legal advice to people attending court . ",
        "at 11.20 am on september 11 , vincent was in an interview room with the lawyer who was giving him legal advice while they sat at a small table . vincent was drunk and smelt strongly of liquor . because of his state , the lawyer told him that he did not think he was fit to appear in court . vincent stood up and punched the lawyer in the side of his head , knocking him off his chair and onto the floor . the lawyer feared a further assault and got up and left the room . the lawyer received small cuts and bruising to his face , and his glasses were broken . ",
        "defence counsel ruth harcourt urged the judge to impose supervision to allow vincent to receive treatment for his alcohol abuse , which had been an issue for more than 20 years . he started drinking when he was 15 . she said the assault had not caused serious injury but she acknowledged it would have been upsetting for the lawyer . vincent had not committed it out of malice , but had been drinking that day . judge callaghan said vincent had convictions for nuisance offending and was very close to being jailed . it was concerning he had assaulted a duty lawyer who was only doing his job and trying to help him . ",
        "he had also made a nuisance of himself with an obnoxious telephone call to operators when he was not making any sense . the judge decided imposing home or community detention would only leave vincent at home drinking with associates , so imposed 18 months of intensive supervision , during which he must undergo treatment or counselling for alcohol abuse , and 140 hours of community work .
