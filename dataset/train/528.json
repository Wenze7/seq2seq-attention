        "companies such as sage and virgin money are among the first companies to report their gender pay gapbig divides in the amount earned by men and women at some of the north east 's top companies have been revealed . sage , virgin money and cundall are among some of the first companies in the country to release their gender pay gap , which reveal the difference in the average pay and bonuses for female and male employees . all uk firms with more than 250 employees will have to publish their pay gaps by april as part of efforts to close the divide between the sexes .

",
        "that 's why , as ceo , improving our gender diversity starts with me . and looking at gender pay is an important part of this . `` i 'm very pleased to say that - as you will see - sage fares better than the industry average in terms of both our gender pay data and the gender split of our people . `` however , it is not enough for sage to be the best of a bad bunch , and we want to continue to drive up the number of colleagues from diverse backgrounds at every level of the organisation . '' ",
        "pay gap data published by the government shows that the main reason for the gender pay gap is that far fewer women are employed in senior positions , but often dominate the lower ranks . this was the case with engineering firm cundall limited , which was found to pay the average woman 26 % less than men . female employees at cundall only made up 7.7 % of those in the top quarter of its payroll but 42.3 % of the lowest quarter . the journal has contacted cundall for comment , but has yet to receive a response .
