        "for those of you who have n't allowed winter 's shorter , colder , and darker days to stop you from getting in those early morning and/or post-work runs outside , i applaud you ! and also want to make sure you stay safe , which means being visible to everyone else on the road . the key here is reflective gear , whether you go for a no-frills safety vest or a #super #trendy pair of compression tights with neon rainbow stripes on the legs . you 'll definitely be able to find a handful of reflective pieces at any sporting goods store or from any activewear brand , but the options below are sure things regardless of your price range , style , or whatever else it is you 're looking for . ",
        "amazon : if you want no frills , low prices , and products that simply get the job done , there 's really no need to go anywhere else . amazon stocks reflective everything : vests , headlamps , compression tights and gloves , visibility belts -- you name it , they probably have it for less than you 'd find at popular sporting goods spots like rei or paragon . thanks to the brand variety on the site , there 's a good range of straight and plus-size offerings ; special shoutout goes to core 10 , which offers really cute , trendy pieces in sizes xs to 3x . ",
        "asics : the japanese activewear brand is known for its technical performance gear , so it 's no surprise that it makes plenty of good reflective pieces . the selection , ranging in size from xs to xl , includes arm sleeves , a handful of different compression-fit leggings , long - and short-sleeved shirts , and jackets . the big hit here , though , is the lite-show sneaker collection , including this highly reflective pink and blue pair for $ 170 . nike : tried and true . if brand names matter to you , nike obviously does n't disappoint . ",
        "the brand 's flash collection is a pretty tight edit that covers most of the necessary ground with jackets , short - and long-sleeved tops , shorts , and running tights and leggings . prices start at $ 40 for this dri-fit top and max out at $ 215 for this relatively intense aeroloft running vest . everything comes in at least a couple different color options and is available in sizes 0 through 18 . athleta : if you 're looking for something more trendy and stylized , you wo n't have a hard time finding it at athleta . ",
        "there 's a surprisingly big selection , including a dozen leggings options -- ranging from subtle reflective details to very in-your-face ones -- as well as jackets , vests , headbands , beanies , and neck warmers . sizes here generally range from xxs to xl , with prices between $ 24 and $ 178 . it 's not the cheapest option , but you know you 're getting quality . racked occasionally accepts products for research and reviewing purposes . for more information , see our ethics policy here . like what you 're reading ? get racked 's twice-weekly newsletter .
