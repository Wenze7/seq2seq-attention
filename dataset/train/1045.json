        "by ingrid gustafsondear #csedweek community , when i 'm asked how i came into my role as an instructional technology specialist , my response typically includes the facts that my mother is teacher and my father is an engineer . i was fortunate enough to grow up in a house filled with books , school supplies , computers , electronic bits and pieces , and tools . i remember taking things apart with no expectation of ever putting them back together as originally intended . i also have vivid memories of using technology throughout my educational experience . i spent hours messing around with banner mania and print shop deluxe , making my own icons . ",
        "i remember the first time i got the logo turtle to make a square , then a triangle , then a circle when my middle school math class visited our school computer lab . later in college , i remember messing around with digital media creation tools in my film classes and trying out every type of filter in photoshop and illustrator to push my artistic expression in a digital art class . these experiences shaped my perceptions around the purpose of computers , for the better . i believe that all students should have even a small taste of the playful side of programming and technology . ",
        "i recognize that i was fortunate enough to have several adults in my life who valued using technology in creative ways . my experiences have shaped my vision of how i would like to see education embracing technology in the classroom . i see creative computing as a way to provide exciting , engaging , transformational , and memorable educational experiences for both teachers and students . as an instructional technology specialist in cambridge public schools , my days would be rather uneventful if it were n't for teachers ' willingness to try something new . we do trial runs , pilots , beta testing , revisions , and then repeat , over and over again . ",
        "oftentimes , teachers learn technology tools on their own or in one-on-one sessions with a technology specialist like me . there always seems to be a shortage of time for teacher learning . these past few weeks i 've tried to create time for teachers to experience some creative computing -- the kind you can taste ! i 've asked teachers to step out of their comfort zones and try their hand at what i 'm calling `` code a cookie . '' yes , the word `` code '' is used loosely when you look at the activity , but the idea is to open up their ideas of what coding can be . ",
        "during prep and lunch periods , teachers and staff are invited to come together in a common space to decorate a cookie . a cookie has been pre-decorated , and their task is to follow the pseudocode directions to see if their cookie matches up . participants also have the option of decorating their own cookie first and then writing up their directions -- or code -- for others to follow . in addition to cookies , we provided lesson plans , unplugged computer science activities , and hour of code websites to encourage teachers to learn more about integrating computer science into their classes . ",
        "it 's been messy , colorful , and playful -- everything i would want in a programming experience . would i categorize this activity as creative computing ? absolutely . while i do n't expect all the participants to become as excited about computer science education as i am , i have been encouraged by the conversations that have come out of the event . a foreign language teacher learned about switching scratch into their language and creating dialogue between sprites . a social studies teacher remembered doing a similar peanut butter and jelly sandwich activity when he was younger . ",
        "a teacher spoke about wanted to doing an activity inspired by `` code a cookie '' with their students as a way to learn rotation , degrees , and directionals . many teachers discussed the importance of following -- and reading -- all instructions in order to be successful ! as new opportunities arise for us as teachers to share computer science and creative computing with our students , i hope we all continue to embrace a tinkering mindset -- experimenting and revising so all students can have a chance to see themselves as computer programmers . it starts with teachers being willing to learn something they might not be an expert at , but see the value in sharing with their students . ",
        "know that there is a very large and passionate community behind you , encouraging and cheering for you as you take that chance . what will you do to encourage taking chances ? sincerely , ingrid gustafsoningrid gustafson is an instructional technology specialist with cambridge public school district in massachusetts . ingrid also co-organizes and facilitates boston scratched meetups . in celebration of #teacherlearning this #csedweek , scratched is sharing a letter from a teacher to the #csedweek educator community each day , on the theme of `` creative computing : what ? why ? how ? '' join the conversation on facebook and twitter , using #csedweek and #teacherlearning ! "
