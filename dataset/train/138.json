        "monrovia - liberia went to the polls on tuesday for a presidential election that voters hope will mark the country 's first democratic transfer of power in over seven decades , despite it being tarnished by allegations of fraud . former world footballer of the year george weah is squaring up against vice president joseph boakai , with both men promising a break with a heritage of poverty and corruption in a country where most citizens have no reliable electricity or clean drinking water . they are bidding to succeed ellen johnson sirleaf in a run-off vote delayed for over a month after boakai and third-placed charles brumskine of the liberty party alleged widespread fraud in october 's first-round vote , a challenge that the supreme court rejected this month . ",
        "there were no early reports of violence as voting proceeded under sunny skies in the capital monrovia , with polling stations opening at 0800 gmt and election agents telling reuters first indications pointed to a lower turnout than in the first round . `` it is great day for liberia - a test day for democracy , '' said boakai after casting his vote in paynesville . `` we will accept the results provided they meet all the standards . `` johnson sirleaf 's 12-year rule cemented peace in the west african country after civil war ended in 2003 , and brought in much needed aid . ",
        "but critics , including much of the country 's youth , say her administration was marred by corruption and that she did little to raise most liberians out of dire poverty . liberia was also racked by the ebola crisis , which killed thousands in the country between 2014 and 2016 , while a drop in iron ore prices since 2014 has dented export revenues . tuesday 's poll follows a month of political tensions fueled by claims that the first-round poll was rigged in weah 's favor . weah , world footballer of the year in 1995 , won with 38 percent versus boakai 's 29 percent . ",
        "`` i voted george weah because i believe that he will do better for me and my country . i want change , '' said miama kamara , a 32-year-old businesswoman , before casting her ballot in the capital . boakai 's ruling unity party had accused johnson sirleaf , who is herself a member of the party , of interfering in the october vote by holding private meetings with election magistrates . boakai has found it harder to convince voters that he will bring change , given that he worked alongside johnson sirleaf for 12 years . weah , by contrast , has won the hearts of mostly young liberians through his star performances for europe 's biggest football teams in the 1990s . ",
        "his arrival at a polling station in paynesville was met with cheers by a crowd of supporters . `` my focus now is to win , '' he told reporters . `` from there , i am going to get on the drawing board with my team and then we 'll put a plan together to move our country forward . `` some however are wary of weah 's lack of political experience , education and concrete policy . `` boakai understands diplomacy , '' said mcarthur nuah kermah , a school registrar in paynesville . `` weah is not experienced and does n't know the workings of government .
