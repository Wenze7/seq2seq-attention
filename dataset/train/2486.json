        "2017 ! what a great year indeed ! i got married . moved to a different country . took a long-pending break from 9 -- 7 . i was eagerly looking forward to experiencing the new , definitely a new time zone ! but like we all know , life does n't always go as planned . i shifted to the uk in july and by august my ` much needed ' break seemed to start getting heavy on my chest . even though my partner has lived most of his life abroad and it was nothing new for him , i was in for a rollercoaster ride , at least for the initial months . ",
        "i could n't go out so often because i was n't used to the cold anymore after living in mumbai for almost five years . i could n't make new friends because i was n't going out . and i could n't experience any human interaction at all because i did n't make new friends . my whole idea of ` chilling ' started to give me chills in the bone . i was only happy during our trips , which thankfully were frequent enough . but then came monday , when he would be at work and i would be wondering what next ! ",
        "the pinching silence was getting louder and fewer to no knocks on the door made no sense . the only time i even had an unexpected guest was when a little girl rang the bell asking for ` trick or treat ' ! as if the silence was n't enough , the temperature started to drop to zero and soon to minus . this meant fewer opportunities to go out , fewer interactions even at grocery stores , and fewer humans in sight when you look outside the window . i never knew that even beautiful mountains , lush meadows , christmasy streets , flowers at every window without an exception and the sight of plenty of avacados for 80 pence each would n't be ` enough ' one day ! ",
        "and then it snowed ! i had never seen a snowfall in my life before this and that changed everything . it is hard to explain what i felt deep inside but it surely turned the sprinkler inside me on for sure . i made my own tricks to save myself from the harsh winter and homesickness . oversleeping is not great unless you are getting paid for it -- you might not be aware of this but you may be responding to stress by oversleeping . even though i had nothing explicit to stress about , the fact that i had moments of loneliness , i was sleeping excessively . ",
        "and of course , the changed time-zone would trick my body into sleeping when it actually is 4 pm but dark outside . and into being awake , when it is actually 9 pm but quite bright outside . according to a study , `` you can be driven to sleep simply by having a lot of emotional memories to process '' . of course , the first couple of months played havoc . as much as i was extremely happy to be in a new place as , as a person i am driven by change ; it was a long process before i made peace with homesickness . ",
        "over sleeping definitely does n't help . do n't do it . creativity will always save you -- we all are creative beings , i do n't need to explain that one . when i first started making origami flowers or coloring mandalas to kill time here , i realised how much i enjoyed doing that . that helped me ` stay ' in the present moment and i was able to take hold of my emotions . make no mistakes , i still cried tubs whenever i felt like , binge watched shows , binge read books , and did everything to fill my time . ",
        "but by expressing my creativity , i was able to do everything mindfully . and soon i was writing a commercial script , sketching my new designs , and baking . the more you express your creativity , the more you will want to accept and approve of yourself . and that makes everything better . there is no age for learning -- since i wanted to take a ` break ' , i did n't apply to any jobs because i wanted to just ` be ' . but soon i became desparate for one because i saw it as the only way to fill my time -- full time or part time , it did n't matter . ",
        "but staying in a beautiful town has its pros and cons . any job that i got a call from was at least 3 hours away from home , one way . did n't i come here to relax ? so , i started to study instead . finished a course in writing from stanford and am almost through another in digital marketing . that helped me not only gain a competitive edge in the new , unknown and inexperienced market but also made it ` worth ' all my time i did n't know what to do with . ",
        "why nobody talks about financial dependency ? -- we have all heard that it is fine to be emotionally dependent on your partner but it took a great deal of shunning my ` ego ' and ` independent ' past to understand that it is ok to be equally financially dependant on your partner when making money is actually not your priority . after a lot of inner talk and acceptance , i realised that only being financially dependent or independent does n't define me for who i am . so , i resumed my freelance work and even though i was earning in rupees , i was ok with it . ",
        "because i was able to save whatever i was making and was also building my portfolio . i was also learning for the first time about buying what i needed and not what i wanted , not because i felt guilty in using a credit card but because i genuinly wanted to learn to manage finances . win -- win i say ! meditation might be old but old is gold -- this infact should be the first point . as spiritually inclined , i always find meditation extremely calming and comforting . infact , when i increased my minutes , i realised it gave me more minutes to do other things . ",
        "let me explain . when i was n't meditating , i did n't know what to do with all my time . when i started meditating , i was mindful of how to split my day into different things i wanted to accomplish . so , when i meditated for 30 minutes , it actually gave me 100 more to do other stuff . i insist , whatever gives you peace of mind , hold it close and practice it more often . did you know you could keep a plant and be forever happy ? -- i have always been close to nature , to a point where when i was shifting back to delhi from mumbai for my wedding , with tons of luggage , i did n't take a flight but chose to spend 28 hours in the train because i did n't want to leave my plants behind . ",
        "the comprehension of psychological and social responses towards plants can , infact be , an important tool in improving the psychological , physical and social conditions , both of individuals and communities . so , i brought sand and seeds and grew my own sunflowers , roses , chillies , mint , and each week bought fresh flowers to keep in the house . it had a huge impact on my happiness levels because it felt great . if laughing is a medicine , why do we die laughing ' ? -- my partner is quite a knee-slapper and his wit can crack anyone up in seconds . ",
        "so , the more we laughed , the better it got , at a deeper level for me . it surely was like medicine but at times i laughed so much that i was on the verge of choking . yeah , i have n't quite understood this oxymoron either . but i do know that as long as you are laughing , you are living . and even though i can be very easily amused , it helped to be in company of someone who made me laugh ! lots ! everyday ! i now look forward to 2018 with double the laughter , adventure and soul-searching . ",
        "even though sometimes it does n't go the way you have planned life , know that it is bringing something better and preparing you so that you can welcome it with open arms ! even if that 's your own self : -rrb- to start with . it begins at home , after all .   "
