        "the app situation between iphones and macs is a bit of a mess . while mobile apps are updated regularly , the mac app store can often leave something to be desired . now , apple is finally tackling this chaos . according to bloomberg , apple may give developers the option to create a single app that will work across macs , ipads and iphones as early as next year . according to insider sources , the same app will be able to respond to a mouse , a touch pad or a touch screen , depending on the device it 's being run on . ",
        "right now , apps must be designed separately for the iphone and ipad versus for a computer , which explains why you can occasionally find tumbleweeds rolling across the screen when you pull up the mac app store . if developers must choose to devote resources to one or the other , the computer apps often get shortchanged . the change wo n't come immediately , though . it 's planned as part of next fall 's ios and mac os updates , according to bloomberg 's sources . because this is all so tentative , it 's also possible that the decision makers at apple could change their minds and cancel this endeavor entirely . ",
        "here 's hoping they do n't , though . this streamlining would likely be a popular move for mac users .   "
