        "dancing in the glory of monsters , jason k stearns , isbn 978 -- 1 -- 61039 -- 107 -- 8 . the congo war is sometimes compared to world war i , and the destructiveness and numerous actors do make the comparison somewhat attractive . but what it reminded me of was the us invasion of iraq and its sequelae : a rapid and successful invasion with a clear goal of toppling an unmitigatedly unpleasant dictator who at first barely apprehended a genuine threat , but unsupported by any realistic planning for the day after victory , and followed by years of conflict raging from terrorism to open warfare drawing in multiple neighbouring countries . ",
        "the origins of the conflict can be read back along a number of lines . the rwandan invasion of 1996 essentially represented the continuation of the rwandan civil war subsequent to regime change , with the new government going after still-militarized génocidaires camped out in eastern zaire ; the victors of that civil war had in turn learned their craft as exiles fighting in uganda 's previous internal conflict , something that explains ugandan cooperation . laurent kabila , used by the rwandans as a front-man to give the invasion the superficial air of an endogenous rebellion and chosen more because he was available than because he was well-suited to the role , on the other hand , was a classic cold-war superpower cats-paw , temporarily embarrassed by the end of the struggle that created him . ",
        "but it 's also necessary to consider the ridiculously high corruption , fragility and long-neglected infrastructure of mobutu 's zaire , without which the rwandan invasion might have been repulsed , or at least contained , or even completely avoided . and while it would certainly be wrong to let the kleptocratic mobutu escape blame for the parlous state of the country he ruled for more than three decades , his belgian colonial predecessors had left the country in an appalling institutional state , meaning that no good outcome was very likely in any case . and none of this is to mention the ethnic divisions in and near rwanda which drove both its own civil war and much of the brutality in congo itself , which although pre-existing were exacerbated by colonial meddling . ",
        "at any rate , this was a complex situation and stearns analyses it in exhaustive detail . stearns also traces the progress of the conflict , spending more time on interviews with and character studies of key protagonists than marches-and-battles history . in combination with analysis of the prevailing political system it 's clear that a lot of these actors were not acting particularly irrationally for the situations they found themselves in and the assumptions they had available . within congolese politics , for instance , anyone failing to play the game of corruption and patronage would simply lose out to those who did . ",
        "others were simply incompetent though : nothing in kabila 's background had prepared him to run a country and he did a terrible job of it when he had the opportunity . those assumptions were lethal . the invading rwandans plainly considered their initial targets to be an existential threat and accepted no obstacles to their destruction . mass killing bred not only mass killing , but also total disregard for the welfare of rwandan civilians either fleeing with the génocidaires or locals who got in the way . this negligence towards civilians repeated through the war ; another repeating pattern is that many of the books interviewees appear to be convinced that the war 's numerous atrocities were entirely one-sided , something the testimony of survivors shows to be false . ",
        "for all that hugely many of the deaths were not directly military in cause but rather less direct consequences of the war -- hunger and illness that could not be mitigated due to the destruction of infrastructure , the terrible security situation , the pressing need to flee fighting , and so on . a common analysis of the war starts from the looting of congo 's mineral wealth , both through corruptly awarded contracts from the congo government and by the country 's various invaders . there is indeed a sense in which it prolonged the war since much of it was simply a means to pay for continued military expenditure ; but it seems to be a mistake to see it as a cause of the war . ",
        "what is was not , though , was efficient ; it was associated with no real investment and stearns estimates that it put back the development of congo 's mineral resources by a decade . this was an interesting read ; i 'd been loosely aware of the war in its later phases but it was not well-reported in the western media , so the book was an education . but it is also rather depressing . congo was already in a terrible state in terms of infrastructure and institutions . the war took its toll on the former and did little to improve the latter . ",
        "with mobutu out of the way the country could have reversed its long-term decline from 1997 but instead the war meant it had to wait half a decade more . millions of people died and many of those directly and indirectly responsible have complete impunity . on the smaller scale , the book does not shy away from documenting both detailed violence and the lethal privations suffered by fleeing refugees .
