        "torrington -- naugatuck 's jean lukau was the difference in a 49-46 boys basketball win over torrington that was tight from start to finish at torrington high school tuesday night . both teams started with 7-2 records in the nvl and no iron division losses . torrington , the defending division champion , had n't lost an iron division game in two years . the greyhounds , 2-2 against waterbury schools this year , stood ready to change that , especially in the absence of a key torrington frontline player . despite a big loss at sacred heart last friday , the red raiders could n't miss from the outside the last time they played at home a week ago . ",
        "torrington forward joel villanueva started the raiders that way tuesday with a 3-pointer from the corner in the game 's first minute . lukau , a 6-foot-1 junior who is already hearing from division i schools , matched him immediately at the other end . raiders center kevin dixon played huge in the opening minutes , with back-to back baskets and a blocked shot . lukau grabbed the edge early with a steal , coast-to-coast basket and a 3 . villanueva and hunter murphy finished the quarter on a 10-3 run for a 17-11 lead , but this time the deadly support they got a week ago was absent as shot after shot missed the mark from other quarters . ",
        "torrington 's c. j. root and dontae thomas led the raiders to a slim 29-27 halftime lead . lukau , averaging 25 points a game , had 19 already , including a pair of dunks . `` he 's great on offense when he understands he has to play within our system , '' said naugatuck coach mike wilson . `` coach puts me in a position that 's best for me to score , '' lukau said . torrington was far from intimidated -- just a little tired looking at the beginning of the third period . `` we got pushed around and we did n't shoot well , '' torrington coach eric gamari said . ",
        "`` our chemistry was off tonight . '' lukau cooled off in the third quarter , but torrington , reverting to one-man efforts , scored just eight points for a 37-37 deadlock heading into the final period . naugatuck 's tiny stamina edge emerged with a steal and a coast-to-coast layup by derrick jagello for the lead at the start of the period , followed by a third lukau dunk . murphy wrenched the lead back with back-to-back hoops , giving torrington a 46-45 advantage . greyhound latrel deveaux got two layups in a row for a 49-46 lead on a pass from lukau .

        "with one final chance to tie it up on a 3 , torrington had five seconds left with an inbound pass . lukau stole the pass . game over . `` he makes a difference , '' smiled coach wilson . naugatuck 49 , torrington 46at torrington high schoolnaugatuck 11 16 10 12 - 49torrington 17 12 8 9 - 46naugatuck : derrick jahello 2-0-6 ; elijah robinson 1-0-2 ; jaden bennett 0-0-0 ; jesse lanci 3-2-9 ; jean lukau 10-2-26 ; caleb scott0-0-0 ; shane carey 1-0-2 ; latrel deveaux 2-0-4 ; totals : 19-4-49 . torrington : dontae thomas 4-1-11 ; richy rodriguez 0-1-1 ; chris jimenez 0-0-0 ; joel villanueva 4-3-13 ; c. j. root 2-0-4 ; hunter murphy 4-1-9 ; kevin dixon 3-0-6 ; adrian gonzalez 1-0-2 ; totals : 18-6-46.3-point goals : n - jagello 2 ; lanci ; lukau 4 .
