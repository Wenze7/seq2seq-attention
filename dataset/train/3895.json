        "an israeli parliamentary delegation will meet in dublin with palestinian authority officials . a delegation led by zionist union mk hilik bar , the head of the knesset 's two-state caucus , will meet in dublin next week with a group of palestinian authority officials . the palestinian delegation will include pa supreme shari'a court judge mahmoud habbash , who is an adviser to pa president mahmoud abbas , and former pa ministers ashraf al ajrami , tahani abu daqqa , anwar abu eisheh and samih al abed . the mks going besides bar are deputy finance minister yitzhak cohen , akram hasson and saleh sa'ad . ",
        "the organizers of the meeting from the british organization forward thinking invited 10 likud mks to attend , but they all said no , except for mk oren hazan . when the palestinians found out hazan was coming , they threatened to all cancel their participation , so the organization canceled hazan 's invitation . `` wow , i am really hurt , '' hazan responded on twitter . `` please , super-terrorists : do n't boycott me . seriously , when abu mouse boycotts you , it means one thing -- they are s-c-a-r-e-d ! '' bar said the cancellation of hazan 's participation was unfortunate . ",
        "he said it was important that right-wing mks such as hazan meet the palestinians , and that the palestinians meet mks like him . forward thinking has held two recent conferences in the west bank and the gaza strip and brought a delegation of palestinians to ireland to learn about the conflict between catholics and protestants . due to current conflicts with the palestinians , bar said maintaining ties with the most moderate among their officials was more important than ever . `` the goal of the meeting is not to reach understandings but to learn together about solutions to the irish conflict and learn lessons from it that can apply to the israeli-palestinian conflict , '' he said . ",
        "`` we will continue to do everything possible to end our long and bloody conflict and to separate from the palestinians via the two-state solution . it is still possible , it is in our hands , and it is our obligation to both populations and future generations . ''   "
