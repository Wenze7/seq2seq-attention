        "nintendo promised news on a new `` experience '' for switch , and it has indeed delivered -- albeit with a look at a strange new project called nintendo labo . it appears to be a sort of mini-game collection that involves creating real-life cardboard accessories that come with the game . details are still scant , but based on the debut trailer , you 'll take part in activities like fishing , playing piano , racing a bike , and wreaking havoc as a giant robot . this is all done by detaching the joy-cons from the switch itself and using cardboard to construct the aforementioned accessories , which take the form of a fishing pole , piano , camera , and so on . ",
        "instructions for building these are provided on-screen . yes , you literally are purchasing a game and actual cardboard to create what nintendo calls toy-cons . there are two separate bundles that have been announced : the variety kit and robot kit , which are outlined below . they 'll both be available on april 20 in the us and australia , or april 27 in europe . a separate , $ 10 / Â£ 9 customization set includes stencils , stickers , and colored tape to help you design your toy-cons . the official website for labo talks about being able to customize your creations by painting them or affixing stickers to them , but more intriguing is a line about `` dream up new ways to use your toy-con creations ... and bring them to life . '' ",
        "it 's unclear if there will be a way to create original games in labo or if nintendo 's simply talking about waving the accessories around and using your imagination . those eager to try labo out ahead of its launch will have the opportunity to do so in new york city or san francisco , provided you can make it there and have a child 6-12 years old . you can submit an application to attend here . below , you 'll find the different things that can be built with each of the two announced packs , with descriptions provided by nintendo . ",
        "variety kit toy-con rc car : insert the left and right joy-con into your newly built rc car and control its movement using touch screen controls on the nintendo switch console . the hd rumble feature in the joy-con controllers will cause vibrations that move the car in the direction you choose . materials to construct two rc cars are included . toy-con fishing rod : construct the fishing rod with an active , rotating reel that is attached by string to a cradle holding the nintendo switch console . catch one of many exotic fish shown swimming on the nintendo switch screen by casting your fishing rod and unwinding the reel to lower the hook . ",
        "once you feel a vibration from the joy-con inserted in the reel , you must tug the fishing rod upward and crank the reel quickly to try and complete the catch ! toy-con house : by inserting various assembled blocks into openings in the sides and bottom of the house , you can interact with , play games with and feed a cute creature on the front-facing nintendo switch screen . each differently shaped block is detected by the ir motion camera on the right joy-con inserted on top of the house . toy-con motorbike : insert each joy-con into an assembled set of handlebars to drive a motorbike on the nintendo switch screen . ",
        "pressing the ignition button starts the engine , while twisting the right handle activates the throttle . leaning your body or turning the handlebars left and right controls the motorbike . toy-con piano : after assembling a beautifully crafted 13-key piano and inserting the nintendo switch console and joy-con , you can experiment with your own musical creations by pressing different keys . you can even insert different assembled knobs to create new sound effects and tones ! robot kit toy-con robot : create a wearable robot suit , and insert the left and right joy-con into the designated slots on the backpack and visor to assume control of the robot , which is shown on the tv when the nintendo switch console is docked . ",
        "enjoy a variety of fun game-play experiences , including robot mode , in which you can destroy in-game buildings and ufos .   "
