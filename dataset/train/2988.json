        "melbourne - chung hyeon took up tennis after a doctor recommended that peering at a green court would help his weak eyesight , and the bespectacled south korean has never looked back . he is now in the quarter-finals of the australian open after the biggest win of his career against 12-time grand slam winner novak djokovic . nicknamed `` the professor '' due to his trademark thick white-rimmed glasses , the 21-year-old is in electric form , having dumped fourth seed alexander zverev out in the third round . it has been a gradual build-up for chung . he won the 2015 atp most improved player award , and signalled his intentions with a run to the semis in munich last year before his big breakthrough at the next gen atp finals in milan in november . ",
        "employing his trademark defensive speed and scything forehand , he upset top-seeded russian andrey rublev for his first title and has carried the form into melbourne after an off-season training in bangkok . he models his game on djokovic -- his idol -- and did his best impersonation of the serb to knock him out sensationally on monday . `` i 'm trying to copy novak because he 's my idol , '' he said , adding that he was keen to get a selfie with him after managing to get one with rafael nadal , `` i have picture taken with rafa last year . ",
        "so one by one , '' he added . chung is the first player -- man or woman -- from south korea to reach the last eight of a grand slam as his meteoric rise gathers pace . - rolling on bed - he started playing tennis aged six , encouraged by his father seok-jin -- a tennis coach . his brother hong is also a semi-professional player . struggling with poor eyesight from a young age , he would blink constantly and an optometrist diagnosed him with myopia and astigmatism , suggesting chung should play tennis as seeing the green court would help . ",
        "`` i always play with the glasses , '' he said this week . `` without the glasses , i can see guys , but i ca n't play the same tennis . `` chung has said he has no plans to get surgery to fix the problem because he would `` feel bare '' without his spectacles . it has clearly not been a hindrance as he zeroes in on a clash against another surprise packet , american tennys sandgren , on wednesday for a place in the semi-finals . `` i 'm just trying to focus on the moment , '' he said . ",
        "`` i have to be ready . `` chung trained at the img academy in florida for two years from the age of 13 , and also completed a month of military training in south korea . he shyly confided this week that he does n't have a girlfriend , and that he likes to eat chinese food before a match -- korean is too heavy apparently . and in an interview with a south korean news agency in november , he revealed his favourite activity . `` what i like to do most is just rolling on my bed . ",
        "i can do that for days , '' said the quirky korean , whose exploits are fast earning him a reputation as an emerging star .   "
