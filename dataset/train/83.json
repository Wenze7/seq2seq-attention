        "shaun whalley got the only goal of the game after a quarter of an hour , and despite oldham 's best efforts , they could n't find an equaliseroldham athletic suffered their third defeat in four games after a narrow loss against shrewsbury town at new meadow . shaun whalley got the only goal of the game after a quarter of an hour , and despite oldham 's best efforts , they could n't find an equaliser . the loss means that richie wellens ' side have now dropped to 20th place in the league one table , just one point clear of the relegation zone . ",
        "latics made four changes from the team that drew 1-1 with bristol rovers on saturday , with anthony gerrard , ryan flynn , jack byrne and craig davies coming in for peter clarke , queensy menig , gevaro nepomuceno and aaron holloway . shrewsbury had the first major chance of the game , with johny placide on hand to make a good stop and deny stefan payne . latics then threatened at the other end after good work from tope obadeyi , before byrne 's 25 yard effort forced a save out of dean henderson . oldham were then dealt a cruel blow as shrewsbury made the breakthrough on 16 minutes . ",
        "abu ogogo 's initial effort was parried out by placide but whalley reacted quickest to score the rebound and make it 1-0 to shrewsbury . the hosts went in search of another goal , with whalley hitting a free kick wide and then placide keeping out payne 's header from six yards out . shrewsbury carried their lead into the second half , but oldham almost got back on level terms shortly after the restart when anthony gerrard got on the end of a free kick from byrne , but henderson was equal to it . latics still had to be alert at the other end , as whalley 's corner was met by aristote nsiala but he fired over the crossbar from close range . ",
        "holloway came on for flynn just after the hour mark , and he almost made an immediate impact when he got on the end of a free kick from byrne , but he could n't direct the header goalwards and shrewsbury cleared the danger . latics were the better team in the closing stages as they tried to find an equaliser , with henderson making a superb save after byrne 's 25 yard strike . oldham then thought they should have had a penalty when davies looked to be brought down in the box by nsiala , but the referee controversially waved away the protests . ",
        "despite their best efforts , latics could n't find the net , and shrewsbury were able to hold on to condemn oldham to a 1-0 defeat . oldham : placide , dummigan , gerrard , bryan , hunt , gardner , fane , flynn , byrne , obadeyi , daviessubs not used : ben wilson , brian wilson , nepomuceno , maouche .
