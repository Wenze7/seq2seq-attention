        "sean couturier 's goal late in the third period gives the flyers the lead in an eventual 4-2 victory against the maple leafs . philadelphia -- there was n't anything fancy about sean couturier 's game-winning goal . claude giroux 's pass that set it up , though , was something special . couturier broke a tie with 2:55 left and the philadelphia flyers beat the toronto maple leafs 4-2 on tuesday night for their fourth straight victory . couturier and giroux each had a goal and an assist , and travis konecny also scored as philadelphia halted a six-game home losing streak . ",
        "scott laughton added an empty-netter , and brian elliott made 20 saves . couturier 's career high-tying 15th goal of the season gave the flyers a 3-2 lead . `` i just tried to shoot as hard as i could , '' he said . giroux set it up with a between-the-legs pass while facing the boards that couturier corralled and shot over goalie frederik andersen 's left shoulder . `` he 's so good , '' couturier said . `` you have to expect those plays from him . `` giroux could n't even describe the pass , saying he saw couturier and instinct took over . ",
        "`` that 's a pretty special play to get the puck to open ice , '' philadelphia coach dave hakstol said . the flyers opened a five-game homestand with their first victory on home ice since nov. . 9 against chicago . philadelphia had won three in a row -- all on the road -- to stop a 10-game skid , quieting calls for hakstol to be fired . `` the difference has been we 're taking advantage of our good play , '' hakstol said . patrick marleau and james van riemsdyk scored for the maple leafs , whose three-game winning streak was snapped in the opener of a three-game road trip . ",
        "the maple leafs played without star center auston matthews for the second consecutive game . matthews was injured late in the third period of saturday 's win over pittsburgh when he collided with teammate morgan rielly and is day to day . toronto dropped to 5-1 without him . `` i did n't like the third , '' coach mike babcock said . `` to me , we gifted two goals . `` konecny 's shot 5:36 into the third period tied it at 2 . konecny blocked andersen 's clearing attempt , keeping the puck in the toronto zone , and wheeled around at the blue line with a wrist shot that first hit the stick of the maple leafs ' dominic moore before deflecting over andersen . ",
        "`` it 's his tenacity , '' hakstol said , explaining the key to konecny 's strong play . it looked as though the flyers were going to return to their losing ways at home when van riemsdyk put the maple leafs ahead with 3:10 left in the second period on a power-play goal that made it 2-1 . after philadelphia 's jakub voracek went off for tripping , van riemsdyk netted his 15th of the season after deflecting rielly 's wrist shot from the point . giroux opened the scoring with a slap shot that beat andersen at 9:21 of the first . ",
        "couturier set up the goal by winning a faceoff , and giroux unleashed a hard one-timer to andersen 's blocker side . babcock was animated after the goal because he did n't like that marleau got kicked out of the faceoff by the linesman and was replaced by zach hyman . `` i did n't like it , '' babcock said . toronto tied it 27 seconds later when marleau 's wrist shot from a sharp angle went off elliott 's arm . it was the 1,100 th point of marleau 's career . game notesandersen finished with 35 saves .
