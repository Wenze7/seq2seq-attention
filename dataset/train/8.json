        "the toyota auris has many merits as a reliable second-hand family hatchback . you can get the lowdown on the specs , performances and prices of pre-loved second-generation models dating from 2012 and including the 2015 revamp here . the toyota auris might not be the most scintillating car to drive but it will last reliably for many years . and , let 's face it , that 's an attribute a lot of second-hand car buyers will be looking for in their family runaround . there are five-door hatch and estate versions in the second generation built by the japanese car makers from 2012 to the present day , so there 's a good choice for many buyers . ",
        "it 's a better looking car than the one that went before , it is also better dynamically , making it a good deal more fun to drive , and it has lower running costs . toyotapetrol engines are a 1.3-litre with 98bhp , although this offers pretty pedestrian performance , and a much quicker 1.6 with 130bhp . government economy for the 1.3 is a claimed 52mpg , while the 1.6 is 47 . there are two other engine options -- a 1.4 diesel with 89bhp but capable of 74mpg , and a petrol/electric hybrid , combining a 1.8 engine with an electric motor and automatic gearbox to develop 134bhp . ",
        "this is officially capable of 74mpg , too , and has low co2 emissions of just 87grammes per kilometre -- so you 'll certainly feel as if you 're doing your bit for the environment , if that 's important to you . toyotafrom 2015 , there was a raft of changes that included two new engines -- a 1.6 diesel with 110bhp and 67mpg , and a 1.2 turbo petrol with 114bhp and capable of 58mpg . at the same time , the design was updated to include new led lights and a wider front bumper , more luxurious materials inside and a new seven-inch touchscreen infotainment set-up with smart neon blue surrounding buttons as part of a 3d-looking dash .

        "used bmw 1 series review -- family hatchback 's one for funused mazda3 review -- three good reasons to buy this family hatchbacktoyotathe auris is more involving to drive than the first generation thanks to revised steering and suspension . meanwhile , there 's enough feel from the steering to give confidence in the corners and it is direct . it handles reasonably well , with plenty of grip , and roll is kept to a minimum . it always feels secure and safe even when pushed very hard . a range of safety systems come as standard and the all-round disc brakes are excellent . ",
        "comfort is very good over all surfaces , helped by excellent front seats , and road and wind noise are well subdued . toyotathe interior is spacious , with room for five , and there 's lots of leg and headroom . the boot , meanwhile , is a fairly handy 360 litres -- even in the hybrid as the battery pack lies under the floor in front of the rear seats . the original trim levels for the 2012 auris were active , icon , sport and range-topping excel . equipment in the active trim includes air con , usb and aux stereo , electric front windows and door mirrors , traction control and loads of airbags . ",
        "further up the range , sport adds parking sensors , alloys , sports seats and an alarm . top excel models get keyless entry and starting , a parking assist system and cruise control . toyotamodels from 2015 onwards saw improved levels of kit , with active getting bluetooth and led lights . icon adds the likes of multimedia control and a reversing camera . the design grade includes visual upgrades such as 17in alloys and rear privacy glass . business edition has a smart sat nav and heated seats , and excel includes a wi-fi hotspot . toyota reliability means second-hand prices hold up well but we found a 2014 14-plate 1.4 diesel active with 43,200 miles on the clock for a cracking £ 6500 . ",
        "meanwhile , a newer 2015 65-plate 1.6 diesel icon with a mileage of less than 18,000 had a price tag of just £ 9700 .   "
