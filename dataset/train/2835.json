        "san francisco -- just as california 's new sanctuary state status went into effect , mock signs were posted at the state border . `` official sanctuary state . felons , illegals and ms13 welcome ! democrats need the votes ! '' reads the fake sign , which was posted right below the official `` welcome to california '' sign . kpix 5 political reporter melissa caen explains the new law and how it prompted the prank . generally , california 's new law means that law enforcement in the state are banned from holding prisoners until ice can come and get them . ",
        "when ice sends detainer requests , they have to be ignored . but before we get into what the law does , let 's talk about what it does not do . first , it does not change the power of arrest warrants . warrants signed by a judge have to be honored . it does n't matter if a person is documented or not , law enforcement still has to follow judge 's orders . second , ice will continue to see who is arrested . during the booking process , people are fingerprinted , and those fingerprints go to the fbi which sends them to ice . ",
        "so , ice knows who is taken into custody and where . that has not changed . so , when can local law enforcement still talk to ice ? here , what matters most is a person 's criminal record . if they 're arrested and a background check shows a conviction for any one of the hundreds of offenses listed in the law , including many serious felonies -- rape , murder , robbery -- then law enforcement can notify ice about the person 's release date and when the day comes , they can transfer that person into ice custody . ",
        "not all crimes are created equal here , some convictions have to have been within the past 5 or 15 years . the more serious crimes do n't have a time limit . this overall list of crimes is very long , but the california sheriff 's association says it 's not enough . they wrote in a statement , `` ... repeat drunk drivers , persons who assault peace officers , serial thieves , animal abusers , known gang members and other serious offenders ... '' are not on the list . so people convicted of those crimes are effectively going to be shielded from ice . ",
        "for people who do n't have a criminal history -- if a judge says that there 's probable cause to believe they committed a serious or violent crime -- then law enforcement can notify ice when that person is being released so ice can be there to take them into custody . an effort to repeal this new sanctuary law started last year .
