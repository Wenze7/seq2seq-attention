        "it 's been a good innings for thelma luxton . for 48 summers , she has kept score for cricket matches for the taranaki cricket association , and has scored matches for everyone from waitara high school to the cricket world cup - along with her volunteer work . now in her eightieth year , luxton has been recognised with a queen 's service medal in the new year honours for services to the community and cricket . `` it was about the middle of the year i got a letter . i was quite surprised , '' she said . ",
        "`` i suppose it 's nice to be recognised . '' read more : she first picked up scoring at waitara high school , when they were struggling to find someone to come out on a saturday . `` i did n't ever play ; i just liked scoring and watching the game , and even when i had a young family i used to pack them up on the saturday morning and take them off to country cricket . '' she has been based at pukekura park , which she says is the best ground in the country , and one of the best in the world . ",
        "`` it 's no smaller than one of the boundaries at eden park and certainly no smaller than some of the grounds in the uk . `` sometimes you feel like yelling out to them and saying ` move the fielder ' . `` it 's a very strategic game . there 's also a lot of luck in it , as i think the west indies are finding out . `` it 's a thinking game . '' she has seen some changes in nearly five decades in the scorers ' box - including the arrival of ipads and fewer cricket clubs - and made a lot of memories too . ",
        "`` probably the most recent one was tom bruce in his first twenty20 game at pukekura park and putting the ball out of the ground . the people i 've met ; things that were done . even at one stage helping to dry a pitch in invercargill so we could have a game and helping to roll the wicket . '' she enjoyed watching ali jordan , ian snook , dean robinson and will young . `` it 's good to see these younger ones carrying on and doing so well . it was a pity that jordie barrett did n't stay playing cricket . '' ",
        "she thinks each format has a place , but personally she would prefer to go to a test match . `` i have been to the oval in the uk and i saw viv richards ' last test for the west indies . '' but it 's not all about the leather on willow - luxton has owned several businesses in waitara and invested a lot of hours in community volunteering from soroptimists international waitara to the north taranaki healthcare trust , leading the fundraising for the $ 1.5 million for the new health centre . she and her late husband , keith , have four children and five grandchildren . ",
        "`` society would not survive if it does n't have volunteers and there 's no use saying it 's up to them to do something . it 's up to you to do it . '' but looking back , she says the thing she is most proud of is her continuing involvement with waitara high school and the massey trust at the school , which was established from the leftover funds raised after the library fire in the 1980s . and she 's not slowing down yet - she 's got a challenge from taranaki cricket to score for them for 50 seasons . ",
        "`` i 've got another two seasons after this so we 'll see . ''   "
