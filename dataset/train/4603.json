        "spotify chose the sleepy week between christmas and new year 's to file confidential ipo documents with the securities and exchange commission , a move that signals the music streaming leader is ready to list its stock directly onto the new york stock exchange in the coming months . the filing was first reported by axios and further confirmed by bloomberg . spotify declined to comment on the reports , which arrive on the heels of a massive $ 1.6 billion copyright lawsuit brought by wixen music publishing . according to sources , spotify is planning to make its shares public via a direct listing , versus the more conventional initial public offering . ",
        "instead of hiring investment bankers to hype the offering and set the price , the stock simply becomes available on the public market -- with the price set by demand . further , employees will be able to sell their shares without spotify having to pay underwriters . bloomberg reports that spotify wants to begin listing its shares in the first quarter of this year . the swedish company 's valuation in private trades was reported to be around $ 16 billion as of september , an increase of $ 3 billion since may . at last count in the fall of 2017 , the service had 140 million regular users , with 60 million paying for it , numbers that are sure to be larger by now . ",
        "in preparation for its listing , spotify spent the last year securing direct licensing deals with all three major labels , universal music group , sony music and warner music group , along with independent label org merlin .   "
