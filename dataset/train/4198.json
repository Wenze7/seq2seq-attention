        "a bullet train emerges from a tunnel in the qinling mountains on wednesday . liu xiao/xinhua . a new bullet train service linking xi'an and chengdu went into operation on wednesday , reducing travel time between the two historic cities by almost two-thirds . the 658-kilometer high-speed line is the first to pass through the qinling mountains , the dividing line between china 's south and north , which boast a vast array of natural scenery and rare wildlife . thirty-eight trains will initially run along the railway , 19 each way , at speeds of up to 250 kilometers per hour , according to network operator china railway corp. . ",
        "travel by rail between xi'an , capital of shaanxi province , and chengdu , capital of sichuan province , is now just over four hours , down from 11 hours using the standard train services . this is expected to drop by another 30 minutes or so in coming weeks . however , faster travel comes at a cost . the cheapest ticket for a seat on the high-speed train costs 263 yuan , double the price of a slow train . the new line expands transportation capacity north of the sichuan-chongqing region , linking the yangtze river region and the bohai sea rim , said zhang zongwei , head of the sichuan section of the railway 's construction team . ",
        "the region comprising sichuan and chongqing , called shu in ancient china , is known for its challenging terrain . li bai , a poet of the tang dynasty , once wrote , `` a journey to shu is more difficult than a journey to climb to heaven '' . yet the unique geography was seen as an advantage during world war ii , and chongqing was chosen as a wartime capital because it was seen as easy to defend and extremely hard to invade . when the speed on the new line is increased , the travel time between chengdu and beijing will be cut to about eight hours , down from more than 14 hours , meaning the `` journey to shu '' will no longer be so difficult . ",
        "the new line is an important part of china 's high-speed railway network , linking three high-speed lines － xuzhou-lanzhou , datong-xi ` an and chengdu-chongqing － according to crc . the xuzhou-lanzhou line links eastern and western china , the datong-xi ` an line connects central and western china and the chengdu-chongqing line links two major cities in southwestern china . the new line also runs through poverty-stricken areas in the qinling mountains and the dabashan mountain region . `` the new line will boost the economy along the railroad and help carry out the regional development strategy , boosting economic and social development along the line and also improving local people 's well-being , '' said song ying , deputy head of the railway construction team 's shaanxi section . ",
        "china has a high-speed rail network with more than 22,000 km of track in use , accounting for 60 percent of the world 's high-speed railways . the nation issued an updated national railway development plan in november envisioning 30,000 km of high-speed railways by the end of 2020 . the plan also stated that more than 80 percent of big cities will be covered by high-speed railways by then . by the end of 2020 , railway travel time between beijing and most capital cities will be reduced to two to eight hours , the plan said .
