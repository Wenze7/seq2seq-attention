        "a friend and new mom asked me for parenting advice as i have an 11 year old . my knee jerk response was to go with the usual advice you would find in the countless parenting books and blogs . tips like nap when the baby naps or do n't bribe your kid with food . before i opened my mouth , i realized i tried to follow these rules but was often unsuccessful : as my son napped , i usually vacuumed or gulped a large glass of chardonnay . and , a black and white cookie successfully and happily distracted my son from having a foot-stomping tantrum as a playdate had been canceled . ",
        "you know what ? i eventually got sleep and he does not have food issues . but , when i thought about all the surprises and awkward moments throughout these years , some warning of what to expect would have been useful . so , instead , i gave her this list , my top ten of what parents should know or expect which you probably wo n't find in a book . 10 . when you host a playdate , expect parents to drop off early and pick up late . 9 . tourists will ask you for directions when you are breastfeeding . ",
        "8 . do n't expect to play a competitive game of hangman with a kid who can not spell . 7 . do n't worry if your kid 's friend is really exceptional in math or english , amigo probably has a tutor . 6 . there will be at least one teacher who does n't feel that your kid is as awesome as you do . 5 . the second happiest part of the day is picking your kid up from school or afterschool ; the first ? dropping your child off -- and it 's okay to feel that way . ",
        "4 . never dress your toddler as elmo for halloween , your kid will be mauled by sesame street-loving-tots like paul mccartney in the 60 's . 3 . remember and repeat this mantra : lice is curable . this will help you when you think about the benefits of hara-kiri as you pull nits out of your kid 's head while scratching and checking your scalp every ten minutes . 2 . do n't waste your time and money on an educational day out , like a fine arts museum , go to the beach or an arcade . ",
        "1 . when you get a call from the school , it will never be for something good like your child won the spelling bee . above all else , trust yourself and sometimes , put the books and blogs down and allow yourself to make mistakes .   "
