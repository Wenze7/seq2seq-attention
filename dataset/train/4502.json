        "how to deal with san francisco winter now i 'm not here to tell you to stop complaining because san francisco does n't have a ` real ' winter - okay maybe i am a little . the truth is that the colder , rainier days of winter can have an effect on morale no matter where you live . whether you have sad or a case of the winter blues , its important to take care of yourself . i 'm going to share my favorite tips from years of new england and san francisco wintering as to how to have your best winter ever ! ",
        "the right clothes and shoes are so important ! it may seem frivolous to invest in a winter wardrobe when most of the year is temperate , but if you think in layers , the right clothes will suit you all year . warm , waterproof and breathable are key elements to look for in a winter wardrobe . sweaters , waterproof footwear and a waterproof jacket are all winter essentials for san francisco where the temperatures drop and the rain picks up in winter . the right clothes will allow you to get out and enjoy the beautiful parks and city streets without feeling the rain and cold . ",
        "which leads me to my next tip ... get outside ! do n't let the winter weather keep you in . damp , chilly weather may have you wanting to huddle up inside , but getting out and soaking up some sun can do wonders for your mood and your vitamin d levels . keeping active also keeps your endorphins flowing ! in new england we rely on snow sports to get us out in the winter , but in san francisco there are a lot more choices . find some activities that are more suited to the cooler weather , like hiking , biking or running . ",
        "the great thing about getting active in cool weather is you wo n't feels so hot and sweaty after . there are plenty of beautiful spots in the city that are a short walk or lyft ride away - golden gate park , land 's end and chrissy field all offer miles of paths to explore on foot or bicycle . being in san francsco does n't mean that you have to give up your fun snowy winter activities though . if you 're after snow , try a weekend get away to lake tahoe for amazing winter fun only a few hours away ! ",
        "san francisco is great because you really do get to have it all . if your winter sadness is caused by a lack of fresh powder take a short trip to the many mountains of the lake tahoe area and get your fix of ` real ' winter with plenty of snow-filled activities like skiing , snowshoeing , skating and sledding . the same can be said for craving some warm weather . sunny beach weather may be a little further away but sometimes the best thing to do during the winter months is plan a vacation somewhere warm . ",
        "southern california has a lot to offer in terms of warmer weather and interesting places to visit . a drive down the coast is especially charming in the winter months . if you really , really want to stay inside - think warming activities . invite a friend over for some hot coco , or invest in some luxurious fluffy throw blankets . hot drinks , warm clothes , candles , and turning your heat up can all make winter months more pleasant . it seems san franciscans often forget their homes even come with heaters but turning the heat on for a few minutes a day can improve your mood . ",
        "turning the heat on can be particularly helpful in the mornings and evenings but may not be necessary for all day or all night - meaning the heating bill should n't be too high . the reason this can improve your mood and your outlook on winter is that when you feel cold even inside your house you are less excited about facing the world outside . start your day off with hot tea , hot cereal and a hot shower . self-care is especially important in the winter when our mood and our immune system can be low . ",
        "be sure you are eating plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables , getting plenty of rest , and taking care to wash your hands frequently to prevent illness . you may even want to try some immune boosting supplements like vitamin c or elderberry . another great way to practice self-care during this season is through mindful meditation . take a few minutes each morning to listen to what your body needs and then take action . whether that be some slow stretching or a nutritious breakfast listening to your body can improve your energy levels and help you break through that winter slump .
