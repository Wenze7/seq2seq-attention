        "when i grew up in hong kong , my dad always said i got to work hard so i could find a decent job ; my mom gave me the similar idea , she added one more condition : i got to pick something i truly love , work very hard , and eventually i would be very good at it . so over the years , i did exactly what they taught me : i fell in love with gis , i worked very hard , took all opportunities to keep my saw sharp ; however , very often i met people who were under qualified working at the higher positions . ",
        "why ? what did i miss ? lately , i came across the term social capital , the investment in people and relationships , which was at the lowest priority in my list . i wished my dad had told me that the social capital is as important as technical skills and knowledge . i wished my dad had told me that it 's all about people at work . i wished my dad had told me that certificates and years of experiences are good , but not good enough . investing in social capital is an unknown territory to me . ",
        "it 's not taught in college and not encouraged in my upbringing . perhaps because of my pride ; i know i lack of these skills but i still want to find a way to work around it . thanks for reading . day 7 . ai weiwei , hirshhorn museum .   "
