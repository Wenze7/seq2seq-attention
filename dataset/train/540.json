        "wisconsin faces the miami hurricanes in the orange bowl at the end of december . so lets run down the miami special teams in preparation . the acc championship game was a natural disaster for the hurricanes . miami fell behind 21-0 by the end of the first quarter . the hurricanes eventually trailed 38-0 before kicking a field goal with 3:29 on a 4th-and-1 from the clemson 6 . so it was the miami special teams who got points on the board . anyways , lets assess miami special teams in advance of the orange bowl . as always , the badgers hope to use its strong defense and special teams to dominate field position .

        "related story : wisconsin football your special teams mvphere is how miami lines up according to national ncaa statistics . net punting : # 107 kick return : # 46 kick return defense : # 105 punt returns : # 5 punt return defense : # 27 as for the field goal kicker . senior michael badgley handles the kicking duties as he has for each of his four seasons with the hurricanes . he made the all acc 1st team this season . badgley is 76/94 for his career and only missed seven extra points . his college career long is 49 yards although his miami bio says he made a 58-yard field goal in high school . ",
        "so what i see from this is that miami is n't a great punting team but definitely pose a serious threat to badger hopes on returns . so i would expect wisconsin is spending extra bowl prep time working on high hang time and angling to limit miami return opportunities . the canes do have a weapon for its field goal kicker . badgley career mark of 80.9 percent is just higher than wisconsin 's rafael gaglianone . so no clear edge to either side . wisconsin slightly better at punting but the canes may be able to steal some field position on returns .
