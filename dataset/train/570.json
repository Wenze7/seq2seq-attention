        "green coffee bean is one of the most revolutionary weight loss supplement found in the market today . it is the unroasted form of the coffee bean that usually contains a high amount of chlorogenic acid . nevertheless , research shows that chlorogenic acid is the most crucial active ingredient in the green coffee bean since it inhibits visceral fat accumulation and also has anti-inflammatory and cardiovascular protective properties . moreover , the caffeine content in green coffee bean is less compared to the amount found in coffee . therefore if you desire to lose weight faster , add green coffee bean for faster results to your weight loss program . ",
        "below are some of the reasons why green coffee bean works faster in controlling weight gain . the green coffee bean is a great source of two phytochemicals-caffeine and chlorogenic acid . as mentioned earlier , chlorogenic acid is one of the most crucial ingredients when it comes to weight loss . the chlorogenic acid found in green coffee can inhibit glucose-6-phosphatase , an enzyme that plays a role in sugar formation in the liver . therefore , taking green coffee bean will not only help you lose weight but also prevent diabetes among other glycemic disorders . moreover , researchers have found out that chlorogenic acid can help improve insulin sensitivity by down-regulating the genes that are responsible for inflammation-induced weight gain as well as galatin-mediated adipogenesis . ",
        "in addition , chlorogenic brings about weight loss by slowing down the absorption of fats . when we eat , our body immediately absorbs fats and stores them in the body system . when chlorogenic acid is actively present in the body , it will activate the stored fats preventing the body from absorbing the fats usually found in food . by doing this , fat metabolism in the liver is boosted thereby aiding in weight loss . the other thing that makes chlorogenic so important when it comes to weight loss is its ability to reduce constant cravings for food and appetite . ",
        "one of the main reasons why people gain weight and have trouble getting rid of excess weight is the body 's tendency to become hungry and crave for unhealthy foods . however , with the green coffee bean , your urge to being-eat will go down to zero thereby helping you in eliminating the stored fats . in addition , chlorogenic has also been found to possess the cleansing capabilities . it has been found to be able to clean the body of any accumulated toxins . with all these properties , you will be able to loss weight within a short while . ",
        "finally , chlorogenic acid helps in weight loss by decreasing the absorption of sugar as well as normalizing the obesity-related hormones that play a role in weight gain . in a study conducted by joe vinson , phd , it was found out that participants taking green coffee bean lost 17 pounds in the course of 22 weeks as well as an average of 16 % loss in body fat . so , it is very clear from the above discussion that green coffee bean targets the root causes of weight gain and therefore can be a potential weight loss agent . ",
        "it is also important to note that green coffee is marketed in various forms .   "
