        "blues boss remains adamant his side can avoid drop despite damaging lossmarcus bignot insists that his chester fc side can stave off relegation from the national league despite a damaging 3-1 home defeat to fellow strugglers gateshead . a calamitous 60 seconds before the break saw chester concede twice to go in at half time 2-0 down , while a goal seven minutes after the restart from jordan preston sealed the win for the heed and pile the pressure on blues boss bignot . harry white pulled one back with just over 20 minutes remaining but it was too little , too late for bignot 's side who , not for the first time this season , had angered the home faithful with a limp and shapeless performance . ",
        "when asked if his side could still stay up , bignot said : `` i do , i do massively . on the limited resources we have got i still believe we can achieve . chester fc 1 gateshead 3 : survival hopes dealt a hammer blow after woeful displayterry marland `` are we fighting against all the odds ? of course we are . is it a level and fair playing field ? of course it 's not . but it is what it is and these are the group of players i have got . `` every game is big . ",
        "we have got cup finals . our away from has been more than good enough but we have got to some way turn that away form into home form . `` we will go again tuesday because this is the group we have got and we will go again tuesday . we are still on track to get the points return we need from january to give ourselves a chance . i will continue to work in a positive manner with these players . `` i 've got to lift these boys . it will be a case of taking some of them out because i have got to protect them . '' ",
        "the defeat sees chester slip to 22nd and remain five points adrift of safety heading into a crucial home clash with freefalling hartlepool united on tuesday night . speaking on the spell before and after the break that allowed paddy mclaughlin , jordan burrow and preston to net , bignot said : `` we did n't give ourselves a chance . three goals in the space of seven minutes , we have n't given ourselves a chance . that is what i need to focus on on the training pitch that if we do go a goal down that we stay together for the next 20 minutes .
