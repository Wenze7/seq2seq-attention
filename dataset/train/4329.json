        "hawaii 's emergency authorities lacked reasonable safeguards to prevent the kind of false alert that panicked residents on saturday with a warning of an imminent ballistic missile attack , the head of the federal communications commission said . ajit paiphotographer : zach gibson/bloombergfcc chairman ajit pai said in a statement on sunday that an investigation into the incident is well under way with federal and state officials . `` it appears that the government of hawaii did not have reasonable safeguards or process controls in place to prevent the transmission of a false alert , '' pai said . in determining steps to prevent a rerun `` we also must ensure that corrections are issued immediately in the event that a false alert does go out . '' ",
        "president donald trump told reporters sunday evening that the false alarm `` was a state thing , but we are now going to get involved with them . '' he did n't elaborate on what steps the federal government would take or refer to the existing fcc investigation . `` we hope it wo n't happen again , '' trump added . `` part of it is people are on edge , but maybe eventually we will solve the problem so they wo n't have to be so on edge . '' hawaiian residents , already anxious about months of nuclear saber-rattling between trump and north korea 's kim jong un , were sent into a panic on saturday by the false missile alert . ",
        "the message was sent when an employee at the hawaii emergency management agency `` pushed the wrong button , '' according to governor david ige . ige apologized on saturday for the `` pain and confusion '' that resulted and said `` everything '' is being done to prevent a repeat . he elaborated sunday on steps that are being taken , and added in a series of twitter posts that the u. s. `` must also do what we can to demand peace and a de-escalation of tensions with north korea . '' rude awakeningresidents of the island state , as well as thousands of tourists , woke around 8:07 a. m. local time on saturday to alerts lighting up their mobile phones about -- in all capital letters -- a `` ballistic missile threat inbound to hawaii '' and a warning that `` this is not a drill . '' ",
        "television programming was interrupted with flashing red text : `` a missile may impact on land or sea within minutes . this is not a drill . if you are indoors , stay indoors . if you are outdoors , seek immediate shelter in a building . '' residents were told that if indoors they should stay well away from windows . if driving , they should pull over and `` seek shelter in a building or lay on the floor . '' authorities reversed the warning with a second mobile alert sent 38 minutes later confirming `` no missile threat or danger '' and `` false alarm . '' ",
        "that lengthy delay , and the processes behind it , have been criticized by pai and others . trump briefedtrump was briefed saturday on what the white house described in a statement as `` the state of hawaii 's emergency management exercise . '' dhs secretary kirstjen nielsen said citizens should n't lose trust in government warning systems . `` we test them every day , '' she said on `` fox news sunday . '' hema administrator vern miyagi said saturday that a two-person redundancy system is now in place to prevent this type of event -- which he said was basically an errant mouse-click -- from occurring again . ",
        "hawaii has been on high alert for months given claims by north korea that its newest intercontinental ballistic missile could fly 13,000 kilometers . if true , that would put even the mainland u. s. within range , and honolulu is only about 7,400 kilometers from pyongyang . ` much bigger ' buttonthe isolated nation conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on sept. . 3 , and launched more than a dozen missiles in the past year . trump and kim have traded barbs for months . the president told north korea 's kim on twitter on jan. . ",
        "2 that he has a `` much bigger & more powerful '' nuclear button . nikki haley , the u. s. ambassador to the united nations , has warned that north korea 's regime `` will be utterly destroyed '' in a war with the u. s. `` at a time of heightened tensions , we need to make sure all information released to the community is accurate , '' senator mazie hirono , a democrat , said saturday on twitter . `` we need to get to the bottom of what happened and make sure it never happens again . '' ",
        "representative tulsi gabbard of hawaii said sunday that `` you can only imagine the panic , the terror , the chaos and confusion that ensued '' across the state . `` taking this threat seriously , they 've got minutes to say goodbye to their loved ones , to find their loved ones , to try to find some kind of shelter somewhere , which there are no designated nuclear bomb shelters in hawaii , '' the democrat and a member of the house armed services committee said on abc 's `` this week . '' 13-minute warninghema 's miyagi said saturday that if there were a real missile headed to hawaii from north korea , `` there will be 12 to 13 minutes '' of warning . ",
        "given those risks , gabbard said trump `` absolutely and immediately '' should be talking to kim . `` i 've been calling for president trump to sit across the table from kim jong un without preconditions , work out the differences , figure out a way to build this pathway towards denuclearization , '' she said . residents and tourists on saturday reported pandemonium when the phone alert hit . one widely shared video showed children being lowered into a storm drain for safety ; others showed people running toward buildings at the university of hawaii . suzanne mulder , a bloomberg employee from princeton , new jersey , is vacationing in honolulu with her family . ",
        "her 10-year-old-son noticed the mobile alert . `` we grabbed all the food and water we had , the kids grabbed their stuffed animals and we headed to the lobby , '' mulder said . `` kids crying everywhere , no one knew what was happening . we made our way to an internal bathroom and huddled there with some other people . it was probably 30 minutes between the alert and when we knew it was a false alarm .
