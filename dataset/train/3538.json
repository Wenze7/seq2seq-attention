",
        "in bethlehem , thousands plan to celebrate on december 24 and 25 , including the midnight mass at the church of the nativity , built on the site considered the birthplace of jesus . in good years the west bank town is flooded with palestinian and foreign visitors in the days before christmas . but in the weeks before festivities this year , the city has at time appeared almost empty of tourists -- with nearby clashes between palestinian protesters and the israeli army keeping many away . in the courtyard next to the church , a towering christmas tree adorned with lights has had few visitors , apart from street vendors selling santa hats and palestinians taking selfies . ",
        "archbishop pierbattista pizzaballa , apostolic administrator of the latin patriarch of jerusalem and the most senior roman catholic official in the middle east , told journalists wednesday there had been a marked increase overall in religious tourists this year . but since trump 's declaration on december 6 , `` dozens '' of groups had cancelled planned visits . `` of course this created a tension around jerusalem and this diverted attention from christmas , '' he said . jane zalfou , a 37-year-old bethlehem christian , said a lot of christmas celebrations had been called off following the decision , which had `` killed the joy '' in the community . ",
        "`` music , fireworks and many other things have been cancelled , '' she told afp . `` what happened was n't a small thing -- it is a big deal . the palestinian people have been waiting for so long to have their rights . `` perhaps as few as 50,000 palestinian christians make up only around two percent of the predominantly muslim population in the west bank and east jerusalem . israel 's tourism ministry denies christmas has been negatively affected , saying they are running free shuttles between jerusalem and bethlehem for mass . the ministry says it expects a 20-percent increase in christian pilgrims over the course of 2017 compared to the year before . ",
        "-- evangelical support -- israel seized east jerusalem in the 1967 middle east war and later annexed it , in moves never recognised by the international community . palestinians view east jerusalem as the capital of their future state , but israel sees the whole city as its undivided capital . the international community does not recognise jerusalem as israel 's capital , instead keeping embassies in tel aviv . the palestinians interpreted trump 's statement as rejecting their right to a capital in east jerusalem , though the americans deny this . in the latest international show of support for the palestinians , the united nations general assembly on thursday rejected the us decision on jerusalem by a vote of 128 to nine . ",
        "trump 's announcement was the fulfilment of a campaign promise which was particularly important to evangelical christian supporters -- with pence included among them . the evangelical christian movement is overwhelmingly supportive of israel , whose founding they see as the fulfilment of biblical prophecy . influential us evangelical christian laurie cardoza-moore said they want to see a third jewish temple built in jerusalem to help facilitate christ 's second coming , but their support for israel was based not merely on scripture . `` like judaism , christianity believes that the messiah will one day sit on the throne of david in jerusalem , '' she said in a statement to afp . ",
        "the irony that american christian support is one of the driving factors in trump 's embassy move is not lost on palestinian christians . they see their fate as part of the wider palestinian community , which views israel 's occupation as the largest problem they face . mitri raheb , pastor of the evangelical lutheran christmas church in bethlehem , said christian americans supporting israel were ignoring the ongoing occupation of the palestinian territories . `` the essence of the bible is freedom , not slavery , liberation not occupation , '' he told afp . `` unfortunately trump and his people are sacrificing the palestinian christians for their political agenda . ",
        "`` palestinians from the west bank , including christians , need special permits to visit jerusalem , while the jewish state has built a wall surrounding most of the city . georgette qassis , a 65-year-old from bethlehem wrapped in a blue scarf embroidered with the word jesus in english , agreed . `` who gave trump the right ? we did not , '' she said . `` the palestinian people are here on this great land . they should have asked for our opinion .
