        "yes , you read it right ! you can utilize the negativity in your life ! if not in that moment , but surely in the future when you lose your focus and lead astray ! in everyday lives , you face a lot of such situations when you are on a thin line . this side of the line and you achieve or survive ; that side and you are unable to make it . in case you make it , you should be even more careful so that you do n't waste that opportunity ! consider two hypothetical scenarios . ",
        "first : you have a major entrance exam in ten days . you have studied two years for this day and thus you desperately wish to succeed . all sorts of negative feelings can arise in your mind : i will be stuck in a traffic jam on the exam day ! i might suffer from a fever or a headache ! someone cheats from me and both of us will be expelled ! examiner might misplace my answer sheets ! second : you are getting operated for a minor surgery . you are worried because : doctor might be inexperienced ! ",
        "doctor asks for ointment a and an absent-minded nurse hands him ointment b ! i might not wake up for long hours after the surgery ! i agree that these are baseless thoughts and you should not pay heed to them . but it is difficult to control your emotions when you are ten days away from an exam or a day before the surgery . there is not even a 0.01 % chance that any of these things will happen to you . therefore , it would be best to avoid thinking about them . the next best would be to use them in the future to stay on the right path ! ",
        "suppose none of these grisly events happen to you . majority of you will forget about the anxiety before the event . but in one corner of your mind you should reserve those emotions so that you can use them wisely whenever you are off the track . these feelings must act as a reminder of your struggle . you should ask yourself : ` i suffered and achieved what i wished for . am i making it count ? am i making full use of this opportunity ? ' in the first case that opportunity is to study at one of the most prestigious colleges in your country . ",
        "do you enter the college and start binge watching all the tv shows or are you trying to become the booze-master by doing all sorts of drugs ? do you care about your cgpa and if not , is there anything you care about ? think about it . are you wasting this beautiful chance ? in the second case , that opportunity is to live a healthy life and getting cured from whatever ails you . if you start eating crappy food again without a tiny bit of exercise , or if you procrastinate to work on whatever you like ; then you have not learned anything from this experience ! ",
        "the surgery should have made you realize that you have a limited time left ; long but limited . you will be on a similar bed after 50 years . time is the most precious resource you have . are you waiting for another operation before you start pursuing your goals ? replace these two instances with any finger-crossing event in your life . and in case you made it , then think , ` are you making it count ? ' shahrukh khan , when asked about the secret to his success , said ` a lot of people struggle hard to get an opportunity . ",
        "but after getting the chance , no one works harder than me ! ' thanks for reading : -rrb- .   "
