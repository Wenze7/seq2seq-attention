        "latest from bradwall roadsandbach came away with a four-try bonus point but slipped to a 48-28 reverse at doncaster phoenix on saturday . jack seddon , ali burton and josh brown crossed the whitewash , and they were awarded a penalty try , as sandbach battled all the way and were still in touch at 36-28 with five minutes left . but in truth the bradwall road boys were never able to truly contain a lively phoenix outfit , whose all-round pace caused them problems all game . and they made life extra hard for themselves by picking up four yellow cards . ",
        "two of them went to mike egglestone which resulted in him permanently leaving the pitch less than halfway through . club spokesman pad davenport said : `` this game was always going to be a tricky encounter and we perhaps needed to play a tighter game than we normally do , to counteract their pace . `` we will learn from this , look to regroup and kick on again next week when lichfield visit . `` we will be looking for the same commitment , but a little more composure to reduce our penalty and card count and get back to winning ways . '' ",
        "sandbach 's highlight of the match came late on when , down to 13 players after replacement ben stelmaszek saw yellow , outstanding young hooker brown burst through a maul , sold an outrageous dummy and crashed over in the corner . but their slim hopes of salvaging something evaporated due to two late doncaster tries .
