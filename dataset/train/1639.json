        "after breaking his ribs , new orleans saints ' thomas morstead claims that it hurts when he punts , but will remain in the game . the divisional round game between the new orleans saints and minnesota vikings is turning into a bloodbath quickly . the vikings likely still are n't over their playoff loss in 2009 when brett favre played under center . that 's why they 've taken it to the saints early and often , opening up a 17-0 lead inside of two quarters . the way this game is going , the saints ' most important player could end up being their punter . ",
