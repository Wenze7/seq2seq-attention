        "turkish super lig side , bursaspor have confirmed their interest in leicester city 's ahmed musa for a possible loan deal . the nigeria international has found first-team action difficult to come by , featuring just once for the foxes this season in a league cup tie against sheffield united . the forward was linked to english championship side , hull city in the summer but was unwilling to drop to the second division . bursaspor 's representative hasan parlakay confirmed their interest while speaking with reporters on friday . `` ahmed musa is a very influential player who will be able to add value and class to us , '' parlakay said . ",
        "`` if we are realistic , we can not buy him . `` but he wants to play with nigeria in the world cup . for this you have to keep playing and keep form in the league . we have players in our team from the same national team , agu and troost-ekong . `` wearing the bursaspor shirt on loan until the end of the year is an attractive offer . we hope to give good news in the coming days .
