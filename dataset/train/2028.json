        "aboard the papal plane -- pope francis apologized for insisting that victims of pedophile priests show `` proof '' to be believed , saying he realized it was a `` slap in the face '' to victims that he never intended . but he doubled down on defending a chilean bishop accused by victims of covering up for the country 's most notorious pedophile priest , and he repeated that anyone who makes such accusations without providing evidence is guilty of slander . francis issued the partial mea culpa in an airborne press conference late sunday as he returned home from chile and peru , where the clergy abuse scandal and his own comments about it plunged the chilean church into renewed crisis and revived questions about whether francis `` gets it '' about abuse . ",
        "francis insisted that to date no one had provided him with evidence that bishop juan barros was complicit in keeping quiet about the perversions of the rev. fernando karadima , the charismatic chilean priest who was sanctioned by the vatican in 2011 for molesting and fondling minors in his santiago parish . flying home from the most contested trip of his papacy , francis said barros would remain bishop of osorno , chile as long as there 's no evidence implicating him in the cover-up . `` i ca n't condemn him because i do n't have evidence , '' francis said . ",
        "`` but i 'm also convinced that he 's innocent . `` karadima was removed from ministry and sentenced by the vatican in 2011 to a lifetime of penance and prayer based on the testimony of his victims , who said they were all molested by him in the swank parish he headed in the el bosque area of santiago . a chilean judge also found the victims to be credible , saying that while she had to drop criminal charges against karadima because too much time had passed , proof of his crimes was n't lacking . the victims have said for years that barros , one of karadima 's proteges , witnessed the abuse and did nothing to stop it . ",
        "barros denies the accusations . `` the best thing is for those who believe this to bring the evidence forward , '' francis said . `` in this moment i do n't think it 's this way , because i do n't have it , but i have an open heart to receive them . `` juan carlos cruz , the most vocal of the accusers against karadima and barros , responded with a statement to the associated press : `` if he wanted evidence , why did n't he reach out to us when we were willing to reaffirm the testimony that not only us , but so many witnesses , have been providing for more than 15 years ? '' ",
        "he said . francis , though , repeated again that anyone who makes an accusation without providing evidence is guilty of slander . `` someone who accuses insistently without evidence , this is calumny , '' he said . `` if i say ` you stole something , you stole something , ' i 'm slandering you because i do n't have evidence . `` he acknowledged that he misspoke when he said he needed to see `` proof '' to believe the accusations , saying it was a legal term that he did n't intend . he corrected himself and used the term `` evidence , '' instead , which he said could include testimony . ",
        "`` here i have to apologize because the word ` proof ' hurt them . it hurt a lot of abused people , '' he said . `` i know how much they suffer . and to hear that the pope told them to their face that they need to bring a letter with proof ? it 's a slap in the face . `` the barros scandal dominated francis ' jan. . 15-21 trip to chile and peru , and led to a remarkable church-state public rebuke of the pope . cardinal sean o'malley , francis ' top adviser on abuse , issued a public criticism saying francis ' words were a `` source of great pain for survivors '' and that such expressions had the effect of making them feel abandoned and left to `` discredited exile . '' ",
        "the chilean government spokeswoman , paula narvaez , said there was an `` ethical imperative to respect victims of sexual abuse , believe them and support them . `` francis insisted that he did respect victims and apologized for his `` unhappy '' choice of words when he was asked by a chilean reporter jan. . 18 about his 2015 decision to appoint barros to osorno over the objections of chilean bishops . francis replied : `` the day they bring me proof against bishop barros , i 'll speak . there is not one shred of proof against him . ",
        "it 's all calumny . is that clear ? `` the comments sparked an outcry among chileans and roiled abuse survivors and their advocates . the spokesman for a group of osorno catholics opposed to barros , juan carlos claret , said the pope still did n't get it . `` it 's incredible that the pope does n't understand that the problem was n't the word ` proof ' or ` evidence , ' which is the same thing , but that he accused victims of slander -- victims who were found to be right by both vatican and chilean justice , '' he told the associated press . ",
        "he said cruz had testified in 2010 that barros was present during the abuse . in the press conference , francis also explained a letter reported last week by the ap that showed the vatican was prepared to ask barros and two other karadima-trained bishops to resign and take a year sabbatical in 2014 to try to contain the fallout from the scandal surrounding the priest . francis admitted that he put a stop to the plan , saying that if he accepted the resignations without evidence or `` moral certainty '' that barros had done anything wrong , `` i would be committing a crime of bad judgment . ",
        "`` francis said barros actually did offer to resign -- twice -- but that he rejected it . `` i said ` no , this is n't how we roll , '' adding that sending barros and the other bishops on sabbatical would have been seen as an admission of guilt . the 2015 appointment outraged chileans and badly divided the osorno diocese , where hundreds of lay catholics and many priests have refused to accept barros . francis was also asked about the sex scandal in neighboring peru regarding the lay movement sodalitium christianae vitae . he revealed that its founder , luis figari , is appealing his vatican sentence on charges of physical , sexual and psychological abuse , and economic mismanagement . ",
        "the vatican high court is expected to hand down its sentence in two months , he said . `` what i know is that the thing is unfavorable to the founder , '' francis said . ___ ap writer eva vergara contributed from santiago , chile .   "
