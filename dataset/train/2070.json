        "from quantum computers that 'll make conventional machines redundant to a map of the brain , these are some of the key issues for science in the coming yearphilip ballquantum computersthis will be the year when we see a quantum computer solve a computational problem that conventional computers ca n't , using the rules of quantum mechanics to manipulate data , potentially making them much more powerful than classical devices . many researchers think that the prototype devices built during the past year will soon be able to achieve `` quantum supremacy '' -- the solution of a task that would take a classical computer an impractical length of time . ",
        "this does n't mean that quantum computers are yet ready to take over the computer industry , but this will be the year that they start to become a genuine commercial proposition . quantum internetusing quantum rules for processing information has more advantages than just speed . these rules make possible some tricks that just are n't imaginable using classical physics . information encoded in qubits can be encrypted and transmitted from a sender to a receiver in a form that ca n't be intercepted and read without that eavesdropping being detectable by the receiver , a method called quantum cryptography .

        "china has developed `` quantum-capable '' satellites that could ultimately host an international , ultra-secure `` quantum internet '' . many experts put that at a decade or so off , but we can expect more trials -- and inventions -- of quantum network technologies this year . rna therapiesthe announcement last month of a potential new treatment for huntington 's disease , an inheritable neurodegenerative disease for which there is no known cure , has broad implications . the preliminary tests showed a lowering in the levels of toxic proteins in the brain , suggesting that the method might work for other dementia-related conditions .

        "gene-editing therapiesdiseases with a well defined genetic cause can potentially be cured by replacing the mutant genes with properly functioning , healthy ones . that 's the basis of gene therapies , which have been talked about for years but have so far failed to deliver . the discovery in 2012 of a set of molecular tools , called crispr-cas9 , for targeting and editing genes with great accuracy has revitalised interest in attacking such genetic diseases at their root . but is the method safe enough for human use ? clinical trials kicked off last year , particularly in china but also in the us . ",
        "it should start to become clear this year just how effective and safe these procedures are . high-speed x-ray moviesx-rays are used to figure out the structures of biological molecules , an important element in drug design . a new `` x-ray free-electron laser '' in hamburg , inaugurated in september , is the fastest and brightest of these sources of intense x-rays to date , capable of taking high-speed movies of such molecules in action . two others in switzerland and south korea are starting up , too , and another at stanford in california is getting an ambitious upgrade .

        "as these instruments host their first experiments in 2018 , researchers will acquire a new window into the molecular world . a hundred thousand genomesby the end of 2018 the private company genomics england , set up by the uk department of health , should have completed its goal of reading the genetic information in 100,000 genomes of about 75,000 volunteers . given so much data , it should be possible to identify gene mutations linked to cancer and to some of the many thousands of known rare diseases -- information that could point the way to new therapies and drugs .

        "the large hadron collider in its tunnel at the european particle physics laboratory near geneva . photograph : martial trezzini/ap beyond the standard modelthe so-called standard model of particle physics , which accounts for all the known particles and forces in nature , was completed in 2012 with the discovery of the higgs boson using the large hadron collider , the world 's most powerful particle accelerator , at cern in switzerland . the trouble is , it ca n't be the whole story . what 's now needed is some clue from particle-smashing experiments for how to extend the standard model : some glimpse of particles , forces or effects outside the current paradigm . ",
        "researchers were hoping that the lhc might have supplied that already -- in particular , many anticipated finding support for the theory called supersymmetry , which some see as the best candidate for the requisite new physics . but so far there 's been zilch . if another year goes by without any chink in the armour appearing , the head-scratching may turn into hair-pulling . crunch time for dark matterthat 's not the only embarrassment for physics . it 's been agreed for decades that the universe must contain large amounts of so-called dark matter -- about five times as much as all the matter visible as stars , galaxies and dust . ",
        "this dark matter appears to exert a gravitational tug while not interacting significantly with ordinary matter or light in other ways . but no one has any idea what it consists of . experiments have been trying to detect it for years , but all have drawn a blank . the situation is becoming grave enough for some researchers to start taking more seriously suggestions that what looks like dark matter is in fact a consequence of something else -- such as a new force that modifies the apparent effects of gravity . this year could prove to be crunch time for dark matter : how long do we persist in believing in something when there 's no direct evidence for it ?

        "the jade rabbit yutu rover chang ' e 3 on the surface of the moon in 2013 . phase four of the programme starts this year . photograph : / china national space administration -rrb- return to the moonin 2018 , the moon is the spacefarer 's destination of choice . among several planned missions , china 's ongoing unmanned lunar exploration programme called chang ' e will enter its fourth phase in june with the launch of a satellite to orbit the moon 's `` dark side '' . that craft will provide a communications link to guide the long march 5 rocket that should head out to this hidden face of the moon in 2019 , carrying a robotic lander and rover vehicle to gather information about the mineral composition of the moon , including water ice in the south polar basin .

        "it 's all the prelude to a planned mission in the 2030s that will take chinese astronauts to the lunar surface . voyage to mercuryexploration of the solar system wo n't all be about the moon . the european space agency and the japanese aerospace exploration agency are collaborating on the bepicolombo mission , which will set off in october on a seven-year journey to mercury , the smallest planet in the solar system and the closest to the sun . bepicolombo should provide information not just about the planet itself but also about the formation of the entire solar system .

        "mapping the brainit 's sometimes said that understanding outer space is easier than understanding inner space . the human brain is arguably the most complex object in the known universe , and while no one seems to be expecting any major breakthrough in our view of how it works , we can expect to reach next christmas with a lot more information . over the last summer the € 10bn european human brain project got a reboot to steer it away from what many saw as an over-ambitious plan to simulate a human brain on a computer and towards a more realistic goal of mapping out its structure down to the level of connections between the billions of individual neurons .

        "one vision is to create a kind of google brain , comparable to google earth , in which the brain structures underpinning such cognitive functions as memory and emotion can be `` zoomed '' from the large scale revealed by mri scanning down to the level of individual neurons . • philip ball is a science writer .
