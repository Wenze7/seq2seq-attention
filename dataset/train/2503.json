        "los angeles - lebron james added another impressive entry to his bulging collection of assorted records and statistical milestones on tuesday after becoming the youngest player in nba history to amass 30,000 points . the 33-year-old cleveland cavaliers superstar had firmly established his place in the pantheon of basketball greats long before he sank the 20-foot jump shot at the end of the first quarter of his team 's 114-102 loss to san antonio . with that scoring milestone passed , few would bet against james ultimately finishing his career as the nba 's all-time leading scorer and overtaking kareem abdul-jabbar , the current points leader with 38,387 . ",
        "to do that , james will need to play another five seasons and average around 20 points per game . provided he stays free of injury -- and james has been one of the most durable players in the nba during his glittering 14-year career -- that points total is well within reach . long-time friend and team-mate dwyane wade is certain that james will finish his career as either first or second on the points list . `` i 've always said i think he will end 1 or 2 , '' wade said this week . `` by knowing his drive , i think from there it 's just about his health and as he 's getting older how much he wants to go and try to get that . ",
        "i think he will . `` once he looks at it and says , ` that 's only 8,000 away at some point let me see what i can do , ' i think he will try to go get it . '' - ` a special moment ' - james , meanwhile , who has always made it clear that he places championships above personal milestones , nevertheless took a moment to reflect on his entry to the 30,000 club , which until tuesday contained just six other players -- abdul jabbar , karl malone , kobe bryant , michael jordan , wilt chamberlain and dirk nowitzki . ",
        "`` just a special moment , '' james said . `` i just started thinking about everything . `` my journey from being a kid who first picked up a basketball when i was 5 years old to first playing organized basketball when i was 9 all the way up to this point . `` i give a lot of thanks to a lot of people . it 's something i never set out to do . `` while abdul-jabbar 's points record could one day be in his sights , james would prefer to boost his tally of nba titles . ",
        "so far he remains stuck on three , and his finished on the losing side in the nba finals five times . that contrasts sharply with jordan , who won all six of his nba finals during the chicago bulls dynasty . - chasing a ghost - `` my motivation , '' james said in a 2016 interview , `` is this ghost i 'm chasing . the ghost played in chicago . `` so far this season , it looks likely that james will have to wait for his fourth nba championship : cleveland 's campaign has been blown off course in recent weeks , with the team losing 10 of their last 13 games . ",
        "more worryingly , a steady stream of headlines from the cavaliers locker room has painted a picture of in-fighting and discord behind the scenes . cleveland remain third in the eastern conference standings so are firmly in the playoff picture . and while james ' personal stats are impressive -- averaging 26.8 points , 7.9 rebounds and 8.6 assists -- they have not necessarily helped the cavaliers . for the first time in his career , his team have fared better when he is not on the court , with a differential of +3.7 points compared to -1.1 points when he is playing . ",
        "if cleveland continue to struggle , it could ultimately lead to a second departure from the cavaliers . after signing a three-year $ 100 million contract in 2016 , james has an opt out this year , which has fuelled speculation that he may seek pastures new . his purchase of a second mansion in los angeles last month has prompted talk of a possible move to the lakers , who are struggling to recapture former glories after years at the foot of the western conference . in the short-term however , a move to the lakers is unlikely to get james closer to his goal of another championship ring . ",
        "that reality could tempt james into looking towards a more established franchise , with the houston rockets touted as one possible option .   "
