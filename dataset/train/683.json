        "we recently hired makers academy graduates at redgate for the first time . we learned a lot from it , so we decided to share our experience . careers fairthe first step was to prepare the pitch for the careers fair . because we 're based in cambridge , we knew we 'd have to persuade the graduates to relocate from london . also , our technology stack is different than what students learn during the course : another aspect that could put off candidates . we felt these two concerns were substantial enough to be worth the first half of our 5-minute pitch . ",
        "for the second half , we focused on our excellent benefits package and on what 's like to work in a team at redgate . after the companies had made their pitches , the networking part of the fair began . it took a good few minutes for a graduate to come and talk to us , but then conversations flowed nicely . we spoke to seven people , and we wrote down their names , which proved useful later in the process . we got seven applicants the following week , and we invited them to visit the office and meet some people from redgate . ",
        "pre-interviewwe wanted the visit to be short -- it would be much easier to organise , and it would n't feel tedious . so we decided to have a one-hour session , followed by lunch and a tour of the office . for the one-hour session , we wanted to get the makers to talk to as many people from redgate as possible , so we thought we 'd try the speed networking format . speed networkingfor the speed networking session , we invited people from different parts of the business : four software engineers , two tech/team leads , one ux designer , our head of product engineering and one person from the people team . ",
        "we arranged the room so that each person from redgate had their own table . each graduate then had seven minutes at each table before having to move on to the next . the feedback on the format , from both sides , was mostly positive . graduates liked having the chance to ask many questions and that a variety of people from redgate attended . however , some redgaters felt seven minutes was n't quite enough to get to the interesting part of conversations . lunchafter the morning session , we invited the graduates for lunch in the sql servery -- our nerdily-named canteen . ",
        "this was an excellent opportunity to have more relaxed and informal conversations . tourafter lunch , some people stuck around to help give the candidates a tour of redgate 's office . because we were too many , we ended up splitting into three groups . closingafter the tour , the groups met in the atrium for the closing . we handed the graduates redgate goodie bags -- which contained , among other things , a copy of tdd -- and offered to reimburse their travel costs . we all shook hands and said our goodbyes . there was some feedback that having a q&a session at the end of the visit would 've been helpful , so we might try that next time . ",
        "interviewsdue to time constraints , we 'd only be able to interview three people in the week after the pre-interview . we were n't sure what criteria to use for selecting three among the six people who attended , so we figure we 'd do an exercise : we asked the redgaters who took part in the speed networking session to pick their top three candidates . we knew the chances of us drawing any conclusions from this exercise were slim , but the results were surprisingly revealing . although we worried that basing ourselves on these results would lead to too subjective a decision , we proceeded to book interviews with the `` top three '' . ",
        "technical interviewfor the technical interview , we decided to experiment with some variations of our regular process . firstly , we wanted the candidates to sense what it 's like to work in one of our teams , so we decided to do the technical interviews in the team area , as opposed to an interview room . secondly , we were keen that they were interviewed by a member of the team they 'd likely end up joining . finally , we decided to have a single interviewer , as opposed to a pair , to avoid putting too much pressure on the candidate . ",
        "unfortunately , this experiment did n't work as well as expected . with two of the candidates , we felt we did n't have enough information on their technical skills at the end of the interview to make a decision . also , because there was only one interviewer , we could n't resort to a second opinion . thankfully , both candidates agreed to follow-up on the interview . for one candidate , we asked them to do a coding assessment in c# over the weekend . we created a slack channel with them and the rest of the team so that they could ask questions along the way . ",
        "for the other candidate , we invited them to do a remote pairing session in c# . we sent them a one-month code school gift subscription , in case they wanted to learn a bit of c# beforehand . cultural fit interviewwe had the cultural fit interviews on the same day as the technical interview , to speed up the process and avoid unnecessary train journeys from london . the candidates were interviewed by the tech/team lead of the teams they 'd end up joining and another person from the business , much like our regular process . outcomeone candidate dropped out because they got an offer elsewhere , and we made a job offer to the other two . ",
        "sadly , one candidate did n't want to relocate to cambridge , and they felt the commute would n't work for them in conjunction with the salary we were able to offer . luckily , the other candidate accepted our offer ! actually , we ended up hiring another maker who reached out to us for a follow-up on the pre-interview , but that 's subject for another article . the hiresredgate 's transparent interview process for makers gave me a great insight into the company , their culture and got me excited about being part of their team . ",
        "redgate 's recruitment process really stood out for me . i had interacted with many companies before , but redgate definitely knows how to deal with people in the best way . redgater-maker affinity matrixluboš michaličslaiman ahmadshahhiring makers academy graduates for the first time was challenging , but it was worth it . we 've collected lots of feedback throughout the process , which will help us improve for next time . we 'll be doing this again in the future , so watch this space !
