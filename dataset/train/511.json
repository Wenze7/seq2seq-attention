        "a wonderfully accessible conversation about two of life 's most intimidating hobbies -- long distance running and philosophy . for anyone who knows me , they know the dead giveaway that i have enjoyed a book is that by the end of reading it , it is absolutely ruined . this is because if it 's good , i will take it everywhere with me -- to cafes , long hikes , the beach , the kitchen , hell even the loo . i am pleased to say that my copy of mark rowlands ' running with the pack boasts the battle scars of a thoroughly loved book . ",
        "although published in 2013 , i only recently found running with the pack in a second hand bookshop on the sunshine coast , australia . but really , i think the book found me -- yes i 'm one of those deterministic types . running with the pack came into my life at a time when i had semi-recently taken up running again and my housemate had dropped out of his science degree to study philosophy . the unique combination of threads in this `` serious philosophical examination of why we run and the value of it '' was too relevant to pass up . ",
        "so , why do we run ? rowlands presents a case that the value of running is running . i know how that must read , but bare with me . for rowlands , running is too often framed as something done only for secondary , instrumental benefits -- to lose weight , to feel healthier , to socialise . although health benefits are undeniably valuable , rowlands argues the true purpose and pleasure of running is in its ability to show us what is important and valuable in life . `` most of the serious thinking i have done over the past twenty years has been done while running . '' ",
        "dedicating each chapter of the book to a memorable long run from his life , the book serves somewhat as rowlands ' memoir , telling stories as a child , professor , dog-owner , and father . each story , although interesting in its own right , feeds into the idea that the value of running is indeed intrinsic . that the value of the run is in the new thoughts experienced , the enjoyment of the game , the gratitude to be alive . this discussion of intrinsic value is seamlessly integrated with , and supported by , interesting philosophical ideas about the human experience -- memory formation , work vs play , problem solving , consumerism vs capitalism , the meaning of life . ",
        "there are many profound moments in this book . one of which comes in chapter two , in discussing how the hypotonic rhythm and exertion of running can bring on new thoughts and perspectives within the mind . `` running is the open space where thoughts come to play . i do not run in order to think . but when i run , thoughts will come . these thoughts are not something external to the run -- an additional bonus or pay-off that accompanies the run . they are a part of what it is to run , of what the run really is . ",
        "'' `` the tendency of humans to make , both individually and collectively , the same mistakes in thinking over and over again -- and even a cursory glance at the history of thought will show that essentially the same , typically unsuccessful , ideas are revisited over and over again , in slightly different forms -- is a testament to the associative nature of the brain . '' `` sometimes , the brain has to be persuaded to let go , just for a while , and when it is tired it is perhaps more easily persuaded . ... to an extent , the familiar but fruitless avenues and dead ends of thinking are left behind , and in this new desert landscape of the mind thoughts are uncovered , shining and pristine . '' ",
        "another thought-provoking discussion comes in chapter seven , as rowlands reflects on completing a marathon , injured and grossly undertrained . `` when you are starting to run , or working your way back after a long lay-off , your run is likely to contain multiple episodes of what i , quite recently , decided to call the ` cartesian phase ' -- after the seventeenth-century french philosopher rene descartes . '' `` according to descartes , the body , for which descartes ' purposes incorporates the brain , is a physical object , differing only in the details of it organisational from other physical objects . ",
        "but the mind -- or soul , or spirit , or self , descartes was comfortable thinking of these interchangeably - is very different . ... cartesian dualism , sees each one of us as an amalgam of two very different things : a physical body and a non-physical mind . '' `` the cartesian phase and i go back many years together . today it makes its first appearance -- no doubt there will be others -- sometime after the fourteen-mile marker . just get me to fifteen , i tell my legs , then you can walk for a while . ",
        "but of course i must make sure i am just as much a liar today as i was in november , when i was working on getting my long run back up to twenty miles . '' `` for much of my professional life , dualist intuitions have simply been things to ignore . descartes ' dualism is beset with empirical and logical problems as long as one 's arm . ... descartes can not be right . i know that . and yet sometimes on the long run i can almost believe he is . '' rowlands ' proposition that the value of running is metaphysical is interesting when thinking about maintaining a regular exercise routine . ",
        "it 's widely acknowledged that the best exercise routine is the one you stick to . so what is most motivating -- the intellectual journey or the physical rewards ? the intrinsic or the instrumental benefits ? for rowlands , the answer to this question is clear . and i suspect that many other running `` fanatics '' -- the kind of people who pump out the better half of a marathon before a long day at work -- intrinsic , mediative benefit is the primary reason they lace up their running shoes . but what about the casual , amateur runners -- the everyday people for whom a 10 km jog is an impressive enough feat to brag about on social media ? ",
        "can this runner , who is much closer to my current level of fitness , be more inspired to run by the potential benefits to the mind , rather than just looser fitting pants ? i suppose the only real way to find out is to run . and i recognise the fact this book has convinced me to run if only to test out the power of the idea , is more motivating than if i had never read the book at all . in praising the insights of this book i must admit that , at times , i found it overwhelming . ",
        "one moment rowlands is quoting german philosopher moritz schlick in a discussion on american consumerism , the next , he is discussing tolstoy 's views on the meaning on life . for someone whose only prior experience with philosophy was an enthusiastic housemate and a few philosophise this ! podcasts , the intellectual stimulation of the book was slightly dizzying . nonetheless , reading this book fully caffeinated , left me excited for what my next run and life will bring .
