        "in less than an hour , the decision was made . it was 2 december and avi loeb , an astronomy professor at harvard , was with yuri milner , the russian billionaire and founder of breakthrough listen , a $ 100m alien-hunting venture . milner had invited loeb , an adviser on the project , to his palo alto home to discuss the bizarre features of the interstellar object , ` oumuamua . the first known visitor from another solar system , the monolithic lump appeared long and slender , a curious shape for a space rock . the two agreed there was the slimmest chance ` oumuamua was not what it seemed . ",
        "eleven days later , breakthrough listen swung the world 's largest steerable telescope , at green bank in west virginia , into position and scanned the 400-metre-long body for signs that it was a passing spacecraft . alien megastructures - where we should look nextit was a long shot . after 10 hours of observations the telescope , which can detect a mobile phone signal at twice the distance of the sun , found no evidence that ` oumuamua was the work of an alien civilisation . by all accounts , it is a dark , skyscraper-sized lump of carbon , ice and dust that simply tumbled into our solar system from , well , somewhere beyond . ",
        "but even as the search came up empty , it proved a point : the riskier , more audacious hunts for life elsewhere are driven by private money , not governments and national space agencies . it is not the only example . earlier this week , the us department of defense confirmed that from 2007 it ran a program to investigate unidentified flying object sightings , but dropped funding five years later in favour of more pressing concerns . luis elizondo , the military intelligence official who ran the advanced aerospace threat identification program , as the effort was named , resigned in october . ",
        "he has since joined a private venture to continue his work in the field . of all the methods brought to bear on the question of life elsewhere , ufo sightings are at the farthest end of the credibility scale . when monica grady oversaw britain 's meteorite collection at the natural history museum in london , she received plenty of letters about alien spacecraft over britain . most ended up in the bin , but one exemplified the problem many scientists have with such reports . it came from a man who had photographed what he described as an alien vessel at the bottom of his garden . ",
        "no-one else noticed it , he noted ruefully , but he was adamant the spacecraft was responsible for road rage , cot death and measles . `` for me , it 's the difference between astrology and astronomy , '' said grady , now professor of planetary science at the open university . `` we do n't have any credible sightings that are more likely to be an alien spacecraft than not . `` few scientists would bet on finding anything more exotic than extraterrestrial microbes , in our solar system at least . `` we are not expecting to get to the bottom of enceladus 's ocean and find a whole load of gnomes smelting metal , '' said grady , referring to the tantalising subterranean water on the moon of saturn which occasionally sends geysers into space , andrew siemion , who leads the breakthrough listen effort at the berkeley search for extraterrestrial intelligence research center in california , is sceptical that ufos have ever visited earth . ",
        "`` astronomers of all types spend their lives looking up at the sky with every conceivable instrument we can build , and we do so independently , and we have never taken a picture of a spaceship . and i can tell you every single graduate student and postdoc would love nothing more than to be the one to take that photo . `` what darwin 's theories tell us about the shape alien life will takeno wonder , then , that governments leave the more speculative searches for alien life to others . the programs they do fund tend to avoid all mention ufos - the term has lost its intentional ambiguity since it was coined in the 1950s and become synonymous with alien spacecraft . ",
        "instead , programs emphasise the potential threats posed by unexplained aerial objects that might be the secretive work of hostile nations . when nick pope worked on ufo sightings at the uk ministry of defence in the 1990s , all mention of ufos was scrubbed in favour of the more fundable uap , or unidentified aerial phenomena . `` the term ufo has a lot of pop culture baggage , '' pope told the guardian . `` it will never really lose its fringe tag . `` while ufology struggles for credibility , the search for alien transmissions is serious science . ",
        "much of the sky has been swept for alien signals in the form of optical , infrared and radio waves . but the searches are far from extensive . future scans could tune into directed energy beams used to propel craft , x-ray and gamma-ray broadcasts , or even gravitational radiation . when the massive radio telescope known as the square kilometre array comes online in 2020 or thereabouts , it will be the first facility that is sensitive enough to detect the equivalent of tv broadcasts on planets around alpha centauri , the closest star system to earth . ",
        "pope believes that it is searches like these that will finally answer the question `` are we alone ? `` discoveries from land and space telescopes , and robotic planetary missions , strongly suggest that life should exist elsewhere . water and organic molecules needed for life as we know it are ubiquitous in space . and from nasa 's kepler mission , astronomers now believe that almost every star in the galaxy has at least one orbiting planet . `` everything necessary for life to arise and thrive on this planet exists in abundance throughout the universe , '' said siemion . ",
        "the question , then , is where has life gained a foothold ? `` it should be on europa , a moon of jupiter ; it should be at the bottom of enceladus 's ocean , and it should be on mars , '' said grady . `` if the processes that got life going on earth are universal , then some form of life should have got going . '' `` the reason people are so incredibly interested and excited is that it 's such a profound human question . we have a basic desire to know what is beyond , what is out there , '' said siemion . ",
        "`` what we have done so far is very minimal . we have far more work to do . ''   "
