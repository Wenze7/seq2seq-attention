        "the unprecedented rise in consumer debt means the bank of canada 's rate-hiking cycle is already the most severe in 20 years and further increases will have far graver consequences than conventional analysis shows , macquarie capital markets canada ltd. . said . assuming just one further rate rise , the impact would be 65 percent to 80 percent as severe as the 1987 to 1990 cycle , according to macquarie , which took into account five-year bond yields , household debt and home buying . canada 's housing market slumped in the early 1990s after that rate-hike cycle and a recession . ",
        "`` the canadian economy has experienced an unprecedented period of hyper-leveraging , '' analysts including david doyle wrote in the note released thursday . according to macquarie , this is underlined by the fact that : about 30 percent of nominal gdp growth has come from residential investment and auto sales over the past three years . this is about 50 percent greater than what has been experienced in similar prior periods . the wealth effect from rising home prices has driven nearly 40 percent of nominal growth in gross domestic product over the past three years , about two to four times the amount experienced previously when the boc was hiking rates . ",
        "even as this has occurred , fixed business investment and exports have struggled , limiting the ability for a virtuous domestic growth cycle to unfold . this again is in sharp contrast to similar periods in the past when these were accelerating . new mortgage stress-test rules will also have a larger impact than estimated , macquarie said . the new rules in isolation are expected to reduce buyers ' maximum purchasing power by as much as 17 percent . that jumps to about 23 percent after incorporating the rise in mortgage rates since mid-2017 , according to the note . ",
        "governor stephen poloz has indicated high household debt could make the slowing impact of rate hikes harsher , and that the impact of 2017 's increases will not be fully clear for 18 months , doyle said . `` when taken together , these observations mean the bank of canada is proceeding with hikes despite uncertainty surrounding the severity of tightening performed so far , '' macquarie writes . `` this elevates the risk of policy error . '' macquarie expects only one more rate hike in either april or july .   "
