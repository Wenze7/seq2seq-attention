        "afp/file / adrian dennis bath salvaged a little pride with tries by zach mercer and matt banahan , pictured in december 2014scarlets gave a scintillating attacking display to win 35-17 at bath on friday and vault to the top of pool 5 in the european champions cup . bath had won by five points in rainy , windy llanelli back in october and began the night top of the pool , level with toulon on 13 points and one ahead of scarlets . but on a dry night in bath , the home team had no answer to the dazzling running and passing rugby of the visiting welsh team who secured a bonus point for four tries before the hour mark . ",
        "scarlets took the lead after 12 minutes , sweeping the length of the field in a move that giant lock tadhg beirne finished by side-stepping to the line . `` i do n't know where that came from , '' beirne said after the match . `` i went for it and it worked out . the match pivoted on an incident 10 minutes later . bath winger matt banahan stormed through but , with the ball just short of the scarlets ' line , john barclay broke up the play , preventing a try but earning a yellow card . ",
        "yet the punishment benefited scarlets . in the 10 minutes they were a man short the welsh team kept the ball in hand , ran bath ragged and scored two tries , the first by paul asquith and the second by hadleigh parkes . scarlets continued to dominate at the start of the second half and spent nearly 13 minutes close to the bath line before dan jones collected a low kick from rhys patchell to score the bonus-point try . bath salvaged a little pride with tries by banahan and zach mercer , but the defeat takes qualification for the quarter-finals out of their hands . ",
        "toulon host treviso on sunday in the other match in the pool , but even if the french team win and take first place , they must visit llanelli in the final round . a home victory would secure first place for scarlets and make them first welsh team to reach the last eight since cardiff five years ago . `` it 's knockout rugby now , '' said beirne .
