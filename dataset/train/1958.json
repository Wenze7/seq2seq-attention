        "a 7-year-old california boy who donated his hair to cancer patients has been diagnosed with cancer . despite being mocked by other children , vinny desautels spent two years growing out his blond hair to 13 inches , the daily mail reports . `` i want to help people , so they do n't have to go to the doctors to fight cancer , '' vinny explained . when children teased that he looked like a girl , the boy shrugged the criticism off . `` during that time , he was mistaken for a girl many times , but vinny took it like a champ and was like , ` nah , i 'm a boy , ' '' his father jason , a combat veteran , said . ",
        "shortly after he cut off his long hair to donate , vinny was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer . vinny reportedly came home from school complaining of knee pain . before long , doctors discovered he had a growth around his hips . when they saw a bone growing around his eye and right cheek , they feared their original assumption it was just an allergy was n't the case . instead , they worried the two issues may be linked . doctors say they are still trying to find out what kind of cancer the boy has . in addition to their son 's medical expenses , they are expecting another child . ",
        "vinny 's grandparents , sue and ron desautels , have set up a gofundme account under the name `` victory for vinny '' to help the family . they hope to raise $ 100,000 . they wrote on the page : `` our precious grandson , vinny desautels , is fighting a battle that no child should have to fight - the fight against cancer . he recently donated his hair to ` wigs for kids with cancer ' . even though he was teased throughout the 2 years of growing his hair out , it did n't deter him from his mission ... to help a child in need . ",
        "`` there are many more tests ahead and they 're in the hospital for an undetermined amount of time . over the next days , weeks , and months ahead they will need to be at countless doctor appointments , hospital stays and surgeries . as you can imagine the normal costs of everyday living ... such as rent , food , gas , car , etc ... the medical costs can be astronomical . this will enable vinny 's parents be able to concentrate on vinny getting well and fighting this wicked disease called cancer .
