        "the catalan sport newspapers are jointly rounding on jurgen klopp for putting coutinho on the bench against everton at the weekend . looking for anything to drive a wedge between klopp and coutinho , and stir up as much trouble as possible at anfield , what was probably not a huge deal is being talked up into something very different indeed . earlier this morning we covered sport describing coutinho 's ` disgust ' over the everton decision , and mundo deportivo have also joined in . the other catalan sport newspaper say klopp 's ` incomprehensible gesture ' of not picking coutinho as a starter for the everton match ` gives more strength morally ' to the brazilian and his push for a january transfer . ",
        "in claims that are of course for a biased barcelona audience , both catalan newspapers are clearly twisting things in their favour and trying to get mileage out of klopp 's team decision against everton , and the subsequent draw against sam allardyce 's side . the post jurgen klopp 's ` incomprehensible gesture ' increasingly big story after everton match appeared first on sport witness .
