        "by emma rumney london - britain 's alternative finance market grew by 43 percent in 2016 , research showed on friday , with interest from start-ups , small businesses and institutional investors helping to boost demand for services such as crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending . last year , 4.6 billion pounds was raised through alternative channels , up from 3.2 billion pounds in 2015 , according to a survey of 8,300 investors and 77 crowdfunding or peer-to-peer platforms . `` alternative finance has entered the mainstream and is likely here to stay , '' said byran zhang , executive director of the cambridge centre for alternative finance at the university 's judge business school , which conducted the survey . ",
        "approximately 72 percent of the year 's market volume , or 3.3 billion pounds , was driven by demand from start-ups and small businesses . that was up from 50 percent the year before . peer-to-peer business lending was the largest market segment in 2016 , growing by 36 percent to 1.23 billion pounds , providing an equivalent of 15 percent of all new loans lent to small businesses by uk banks . major banks reined in their lending in the wake of the financial crisis , and many small businesses complain of poor treatment and difficulty accessing funds . ",
        "several alternative finance providers have sprung up to try to fill the gap , such as peer-to-peer lender funding circle , which announced this week it had lent more than 3 billion pounds to almost 40,000 businesses since its launch in 2010 . another , marketinvoice , offers peer-to-peer loans secured against businesses ' invoices and has lent 1.7 billion pounds since 2011 . attracting attention after peer-to-peer business lending , the biggest categories were peer-to-peer consumer lending , peer-to-peer property lending , invoice trading , equity-based crowdfunding , real-estate crowdfunding and reward-based crowdfunding . institutional investors including pension funds , asset managers and banks were also increasingly backing the platforms , the survey showed . ",
        "funding from these sources accounted for 34 percent of peer-to-peer property lending , 28 percent of peer-to-peer business lending and 32 percent of peer-to-peer consumer lending . peer-to-peer lending can offer relatively high returns . funding circle , for example , currently boasts an all-time average annual return of 6.6 percent . but the sector 's fast growth has also caught the attention of the financial conduct authority , which is looking at introducing new regulation for the sector , highlighting concerns about past loan losses and due diligence . this week , peer-to-peer lender ratesetter , the uk 's third-largest , reported a pretax loss of 23.7 million pounds after it took a hit from a bad loan .
