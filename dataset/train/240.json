        "there will be a race within the women 's race in the aramco houston half marathon on sunday that merits closer watching than the race itself . at stake is an american record set by deena kastor that , while hardly thought to be unassailable when it happened , has held up for a dozen years . but it 's going down sunday if molly huddle and jordan hasay are as fit as they appear to be , if the formidable east africans are as up to playing a key role as they always are and a race-time temperature expected to be in the 30s does n't muck up the works . ",
        "kastor set the u. s. standard of 67 minutes , 34 seconds in 2006 and no other american woman broke 68 minutes until 2016 . but kastor expects huddle and/or hasay , respectively the second - and third-fastest u. s. women at the distance , to `` for sure '' erase her time from the books in houston . `` records are great , `` hasay said , `` but they ca n't be forced . it 's my goal , but conditions will determine what happens . `` huddle also admitted : `` certainly i 'll be thinking about . ",
        "that 's what i 'm going for . the competition at this race is really deep . just trying to stay with that lead pack will be hard enough . but i always run my best when i 'm pushed - or dragged . i 'm hoping my time comes from that . `` personal history dictates the race , at least the red-white-and-blue portion , is huddle 's to lose . the 11 previous times they have been in the same competition at any distance , the 33-year-old from providence , r. i. , has won . but hasay , 26 , from california , has seemingly never been more primed to change the storyline . ",
        "in the first full marathon of her career , that little one in boston last april , she ran a 2:23 , the fastest debut by far from an american woman and good enough for third place , only 68 seconds behind the winner , ethiopian edna kiplagat . the previous best first , kara goucher 's almost three minutes slower 2:25:53 , held up for nine years . until hasay rocked beantown , goucher and kastor had been the only american women to debut under 2:27 . run with lead packthen came chicago in october . there , she copped another third place with a 2:20:57 , more than two minutes faster than she 'd toured boston and second in history among american women to kastor 's 2:19:36 . ",
        "`` i think it 's more important to compete , '' hasay said that day , explaining why she had broken with her coach alberto salazar 's plan for the race and fought to stay in the lead group for as long as possible . hasay ran the first 10k in 32:29 , beating her time at that distance in the 2016 olympic trials , and the half in 58:50 before deciding such a pace was `` pretty hot . ... i need to chill . `` still , she overtook two runners near the finish to lock up the third spot , even closing the gap on the champion , kenya 's brigid kosgei , approaching the finish to become just the fifth american woman to crack 2:23 . ",
        "and the others were hard-pressed to accomplish anything similar in their second go at 26.2 miles . ` like a big boxing match ` hasay , nonetheless , defers to huddle when asked about her chances over sunday 's 13.1 miles , conceding that 11-0 - or 0-11 - counts for something . but she 's enjoying the conversation about the confrontation for the attention it 's bringing to her sport . `` it 's like a big boxing match , '' hasay said . `` i 'm just going to go out and compete . in my experience , records never go when that 's what you 're focused on . ",
        "you 've just got to put together a smart race . the fast , talented field will help . it 's a really good shot to run a fast time . `` lest there be any confusion , though , neither is favored to break the proverbial tape at lamar and crawford across from the george r. brown convention center . huddle 's personal best is 67:41 and hasay 's is 67:55 , but edith chelimo of ethiopia has run a 65:52 , eunice chumba of bahrain a 66:11 and mary wacera of kenya a 66:29 . wacera 's time set the houston course record two years ago . ",
        "that 's why huddle , laughing , had added , `` dragged . '' `` any i 'll be happy with , '' she said . `` we focused on this race pretty much at the end of track season last year . i took a break right away so i 've been building up for about three months . i should be ready to go for the half . this kick-starts our training for the boston marathon . `` huddle 's most notable recent successes have come on the track , where she has always held sway over hasay . ",
        "in june in sacramento , she won her third consecutive 10k u. s. championship , then claimed a fifth consecutive 5k title in new york in november . as a teenager , hasay 's future appeared to be on the track after she set the national high school record for the 1,500 and won two foot locker cross country championships . but she failed to take the next step and wound up becoming more comfortable , and accomplished , as a professional road racer . a 68:40 in houston last january , good for fourth place just two seconds behind the former champion wacera , gave notice of what was coming in boston . ",
        "perfect conditions ? because of the `` losing streak '' against huddle , hasay surmises : `` the pressure 's on her . my record on the road is a little better . it 's good that it 's a , not on the track . i 've been doing a lot of speed work , so i think that 's going to in the half . `` her target time ? `` i just want to do better than last year , '' hasay said , `` and i think i am much fitter than last year , when the conditions were kind of bad . ",
        "`` bad as in hot and humid , a worst-case combo for distance runners . `` it think it will be good sunday , '' she said . `` maybe perfect . ''   "
