        "`` does he ever loosen up ? '' `` no . not really . '' that was a conversation between my wife and my father-in-law . i did n't know about it . rachel told me about it in response to me coming home from work the other day and telling her my boss told me to relax more . for the record , i just started as an actuarial analyst at a health insurance company . and a credentialed actuary just told me i need to relax more . ok . we have a problem . when even actuaries are telling you to lighten up , an error has occurred .
