        "the people behind timesplitters rewind put out a teaser in early 2017 -- albeit a very thin teaser -- to remind and reassure us all that the project , a remake of free radical 's early-2000s timesplitters fps series , was still in the works . now it 's 2018 , and that means it 's time to do it all again . this trailer is far more informative than its predecessor , showing off models of weapons , views of the map , basic animations , and other assets , although its real direct predecessor , the first developer update video , was actually released in august . ",
        "but it also highlights the fact that after more than five years of work , timesplitters rewind is nowhere near complete . such is the nature of fan remakes that rely on volunteers to get things done , something the creators alluded to in a mid-december blog post . `` since the project came into being in 2013 there have been a number of project leads , all with the challenging task of pushing this project to completion . rewind however has not been in continuous development since 2013 , with changes in direction sometimes putting development back , '' they wrote . ",
        "`` since moving onto cryengine 5.4 four months ago , the team has essentially rebuilt the core of the game from scratch . with the technical assistance of crytek the team has made steady progress and currently has perhaps the most stable iteration of rewind to date . '' obviously there 's no inkling of a release date at this point , but you probably do n't want to start holding your breath just yet .   "
