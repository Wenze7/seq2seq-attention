        "sacramento -- it 's been open for less than three months and the kimpton sawyer hotel has racked up thousands of dollars in fines for being a public safety nuisance . the fire department says they 've responded to a number of fire alarms at the new hotel right across from the golden 1 center , but they 've all been false alarms . `` it causes problems as far as public safety , potentially , '' said sacramento city fire marshall jason lee . dispatch records obtained by cbs13 show firefighters have responded nine times to the hotel for fire alarms . ",
        "each time , 17 firefighters racing to the scene with lights and sirens . and in each instance , there was no emergency -- and it was caused by a faulty alarm system . `` we have to go out to every single assignment , '' lee said . lee says the sawyer is now violating the city 's false-alarm ordinance . `` it 's a bad thing because we want to ensure that when we respond to calls for service that the calls for service are actual emergencies , '' lee said . so how much will it cost ? ",
        "under city law , commercial property owners are fined $ 240 after the third false-alarm in a 12-month period -- and the fines escalate with each additional false call . `` once the alarms have reached six per year , we consider the property a nuisance at that time , '' lee said . and that triggers a $ 1,000 `` administrative penalty '' on top of the fines . so far , the sawyer 's bill is more than $ 2,000 . hotel management was not available for an interview but issued a statement , saying : `` the false alarms can be attributed to the construction we 've had around the building from some of the third-party vendors and residences ... we are working closely with everyone involved in the building , as well as the fire department , to ensure this does not continue to happen . '' ",
        "the city says its false alarm fines seem to help . `` ten years ago we responded to about 4,700 false alarms per year . now we 're at around 3,000 per year , '' lee said . the sawyer says the hotel has not had another false alarm in almost a month and it has not yet decided if it will appeal the fines .
