        "secretary of state rex tillerson expressed confidence on tuesday that washington is doing all it can to force north korea to negotiate its nuclear disarmament . and he added that if diplomacy and sanctions fail and the us military is forced to take pre-emptive action , it will have been a personal failure . `` you know , we can only do our part in this , and the regime in pyongyang is going to have to come to some decision about their future , '' tillerson said . the united states has mobilised the world community to impose stringent economic and diplomatic sanctions on kim jong-un 's regime to halt its nuclear drive . ",
        "but pyongyang has continued to test ever more powerful ballistic missiles and boasts it can now target the us mainland with its nuclear arsenal . washington has pledged to deliver a denuclearised korean peninsula , but the strategy hinges on china maintaining pressure and kim agreeing to talk . tillerson : us diplomacy with north korea will continue until ` the first bomb drops ' `` we want them to make the right choice , which is to stop and say : ` let 's sit down to talk about it ' , '' tillerson said , in a year end speech to staff . ",
        "`` because if they keep going , they can cross a point at which there 's nothing left for us in the diplomatic community to do , '' he warned . `` we 've done everything we can do , as we do n't want to get to that point , '' he said , stressing that he works closely with us secretary of defence jim mattis . `` and i 've said to my partner secretary mattis many times : ` if we get there , i 've failed . and i do n't want to fail ' , '' he promised .
