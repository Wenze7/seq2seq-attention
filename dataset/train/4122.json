        "the california department of justice found that a native american lecturer at san diego state university discriminated against a white student based on race . according to fox news , following a six-month investigation , the california doj determined that san diego state university student crystal sudano faced discrimination and harassment due to her race after challenging the views of her professor , oscar `` ozzie '' monge . sudano reportedly filed four complaints against monge . the first complaint , in which sudano claimed that monge discriminated against her on the basis of a disability , was not found to be supported by evidence . ",
        "the following three complaints , which were all filed on the basis of racial discrimination , retaliation , and racial harassment , were found to be supported by evidence . supervising deputy attorney general christine mersten conducted the investigation , which included interviews with 14 witnesses , includes both sudano and monge . monge , an american indian studies lecturer , was prominent in the push to retire the school 's aztec mascot . his master thesis , titled , `` fail , montezuma ! the last vestiges of an obscured yet stubbornly persistent culture of racism at san diego state university , '' led to a new effort to retire the mascot in 2015 . ",
        "in november 2017 , the university senate voted to end the use of the mascot . according to the school 's paper , the daily aztec , sudano told investigators that monge had showed animosity toward white people in messages sent via facebook . investigators found at least 15 offensive messages sent to sudano by monge . the messages were sometimes about white people in general and other times about students at the school . in the messages , monge reportedly threatened sudano 's grade for challenging his position on retiring the aztec mascot . sudano then withdrew from his class . ",
        "in other facebook messages , monge accused sudano of being `` racist '' for wearing a t-shirt featuring the aztec mascot and of appropriating culture when she braided her hair . monge eventually blocked sudano on facebook after threatening to lower her grades . `` monge retaliated against sudano ... after she complained to about his discriminatory and harassing conduct , and appeared to undermine monge 's thesis in the mascot resolution debate , '' the report from the california doj read . `` monge told sudano that her grade would be lowered , ultimately causing her to seek a constructive withdrawal from class . ",
        "`` monge denied any wrongdoing when speaking to investigators and reportedly said , `` it is quite easy to argue that ` whiteness ' is synonymous with evil . `` jill esterbrooks , spokesperson for sdsu , issued a statement regarding the complaints against monge . `` san diego state university is committed to creating a learning environment where everyone is treated with respect and dignity , '' esterbrooks ' statement read . `` the university prohibits discriminatory behavior and harassment of any kind on campus , and takes allegations of misconduct by any member of the campus community very seriously . ",
        "the university responds to all reports of alleged violations by members of the campus community , and takes appropriate action to prevent , investigate , correct or discipline such conduct . san diego state university does not discuss pending matters due to privacy rights of all parties involved and to protect the integrity of the review process .
