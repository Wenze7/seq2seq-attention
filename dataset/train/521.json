        "raised by wolves x reebok classic leather ripple gtx in blue . sneakers may not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of footwear suitable for winter weather , but thanks to reebok and canadian streetwear brand raised by wolves , you can keep wearing the kicks you love without worrying about getting wet . the raised by wolves x reebok classic leather ripple gtx comes in three premium all-leather styles capped off with icy translucent ripple outsoles for added traction . but the real key to this collab is its gore-tex membrane , thinsulate insulation and gusseted tongue , which turn this seemingly ordinary sneaker into a winter warrior . ",
        "raised by wolves ' logo is embroidered at the heel , and the shoes come packaged with alternate raised by wolves and gore-tex laces . meanwhile , the sneaker 's traditional reebok branding is replaced with a raised by wolves underlay . a metal gore-tex badge is also featured on the side panel . the sneakers are offered in black , white and `` cape blue '' colorways . they 've sold out from raised by wolves ' site but can still be found on reebok 's e-commerce site for $ 150 , but they likely wo n't last for long , so pick these up while you have the chance .
