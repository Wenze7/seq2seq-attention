        "liberian president-elect george weah was inaugurated yesterday in monrovia , marking the first peaceful transition of power in liberia since 1944 . weah was one of the best soccer players throughout the 90s , when he played for monaco , psg , and ac milan . he won the ballon d'or in 1995 . the striker won serie a twice , ligue 1 once , and the african footballer of the year award three times . despite having no political experience at the time , weah ran for president in 2005 and won a plurality of the votes , probably because he was an incredibly famous soccer star . ",
        "he lost , and his opponents mocked him for being inexperienced and uneducated , though he continued his efforts . weah ran again and lost again in 2011 , this time as a vice presidential candidate . after obtaining a college degree from devry , weah got elected to the liberian senate in 2014 . after winning the presidential election in december , weah will be taking over for longtime president ellen johnson sirleaf , who is widely credited for liberia 's peaceful emergence from two brutal civil wars . american soccer fans might be more familiar with weah 's son timothy , who is one of the best players on the u. s. u-17 team .
