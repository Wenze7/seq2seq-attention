        "as i looked over svs 's line of all-new 4000 series subwoofers i was drawn to the sb-4000 mostly because it 's a sealed design , not ported . sealed subs typically have faster , more cleanly defined bass than ported subs . so i had a good feeling about the sb-4000 even before i heard it . one thing 's certain : it 's big . the cabinet measures an imposing 18.3 x17 .8 x20 .9 inches , and it tips the scales at 102.3 pounds . the sb-4000 features a 13.5 inch woofer with an 8-layer aluminum 3-inch voice coil and a 1,200 watt class d amplifier . ",
        "connectivity runs to stereo rca and xlr inputs and outputs . there 's a svs bluetooth dsp control app for ios and android devices with volume , parametric eq , low pass filter , phase , polarity , room gain , custom presets and system settings . i like the large , easy-to-read display on the top of the sub 's front baffle . the sb-4000 sells for $ 1,500 , Â£ 1,799 or au$ 3,199 . it 's big for a reason . there 's no way a smaller sub could match the sb-4000 's low-end fury and bass finesse . ",
        "if you love bass but never experienced what a great large sub can do , you 're really missing out . the difference is significant . so it 's not just about bone-shaking power , the sb-4000 's deft control and dexterity were apparent in the way it synced up with a pair of q acoustics 3020 monitor speakers and a sony str dn1080 av receiver in the cnet listening room . using a small speaker like this makes extra demands on big subs in terms of blend . can a big sub 's woofer seamlessly meld with the speaker 's 5-inch woofers ? ",
        "the sb-4000 had no problem in that area . i set the str-dn1080 's bass management crossover to 100 hertz , and adjusted the sb-4000 's volume level for a few minutes . that 's all it took for the sub and speakers to make beautiful music together . watching home theater with just the two speakers was also spectacular . first up , i played kraftwerk 's stellar `` 3-d '' blu-ray and the synth pop pioneers ' music set the room in motion . the sb-4000 's bass was deep and powerful , bass transients were quick , and there was no thickening or bloat . ",
        "i 've never heard bass like this in the cnet listening room ! then i played mickey hart 's `` dafos '' percussion cd at near realistically loud volume , and again the sb-4000 made the magic happen . the drums and percussion 's impact and dynamics were visceral . there was a palpable texture to bobby vega 's electric bass , which was well served by the sb-4000 . thanks to the perfect blend with the 3020 speakers the sb-4000 's bass seemed to come from the speakers , not the sub . big as it is , the sb-4000 disappeared as a sound source . ",
        "i moved on to recordings that did n't make big demands on the sb-4000 . when i played spoon 's `` hot thoughts '' cd , the sub helped the 3020 speakers project a larger and deeper soundstage . i tested it further by turning off the sb-4000 and running just the 3020s . right away the sound space seemed markedly smaller . then turning on the sub did n't just add more bass , the sb-4000 enlarged the soundstage . i 've noted the same effect with other top-quality subwoofers over the years . i also watched a few movies , `` gravity '' and `` the revenant . '' ",
        "the 3020s and sb-4000 subwoofer combination demonstrated the appeal of stereo home theater for smallish rooms . of course the sb-4000 would be even better when matched with better speakers , the svs prime towers or pioneer elite sp-ef73 towers would be stupendous with the sb-4000 , for example . the svs sb-4000 is a reference-grade subwoofer that does n't merely dish out room-rattling home theater effects , it 's also a very musical sub . i highly recommend it .
