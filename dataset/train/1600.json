        "washington , d. c. december 6 , 2017 -- the acoustics of a political speech delivery are known to be a powerful influencer of voter preferences , perhaps giving some credence to the saying , `` it 's not what you say , but how you say it . '' vocal disorders change the qualities of a person 's speech , and voice scientists rosario signorello and didier demolin at the université sorbonne nouvelle , paris have found that this alters politicians ' perceived charisma and listeners ' voting preferences . the researchers examined two cases of politicians with vocal disorders : umberto bossi , former leader of the italian lega nord party , whose vocal cords were partially paralyzed by a stroke , and luiz inácio lula da silva , former president of brazil , whose larynx has disturbed functionality due to throat cancer . ",
        "signorello will present the findings at the 174th meeting of the acoustical society of america , being held dec. . 4-8 , 2017 , in new orleans , louisiana . in both vocal pathologies , the vocal range was narrowed and pitch lowered . the disordered voices were characterized by hoarseness , a slower speech rate and a restriction in the ability to modulate pitch . `` we use pitch manipulation to be ironic and sarcastic , to change the meaning of a sentence , '' said signorello , emphasizing the limited speech capabilities of the politicians after their pathology . ",
        "`` before the stroke , people perceived bossi as positive , enthusiastic , a very charming speaker , and when listening to his post-stroke voice , everything changed , '' said signorello . `` after the stroke , he had a flat pitch contour , a lack of modulation , and this was perceived as a wise and competent charisma . '' multiple charismatic adjectives were assessed on a likert scale of agreement by a french audience . using an audience who did n't understand the languages of the vocal stimuli was important . `` henever you listen to a voice you assess the acoustics , but also what they say , and we did n't want the verbal , semantic content to influence our results , '' said signorello . ",
        "the french listeners were asked which vocal stimuli they would vote for and , perhaps surprisingly , there was a preference for the leaders ' post-disorder voices . `` french people did n't want to vote for someone who was strong and authoritarian , or perceived as a younger version of the leader , '' said signorello . however , this was a variable trend . `` in each example the vocal patterns are so diverse you never find the same answers ; all trigger different emotional states and convey different personality traits . '' emphasizing that there is no `` best '' voice , signorello said , `` charisma is a social phenomenon , difficult to assess because it is subject to social trends . ",
        "it 's impossible to give a recipe of what is more or less charismatic -- it 's like fashion , it changes drastically with time . '' the researchers found it intriguing that the leadership charismas identified from post-vocal disorder vocal stimuli were characterized by personality traits that are also used to describe an older person , for example , as wise . `` we are interested in how age and the perception of age from voice influences the social status of a speaker in a given society , '' said signorello , who plans to investigate this further . ",
        "he plans to extend the study to vocal disorders of female politicians , aiming to use the findings to improve and focus speech rehabilitation of public speakers , from teachers , to ceos and politicians . he is also interested in applying these findings to smart device voice recognition technology . clinical populations poster session : 3psc11 : `` the influence of vocal disorder on the perception of charisma in political speech , '' by rosario signorello and didier demolin , is at 1:00 p. m. cst , dec. . 6 , 2017 , in room acadia in the new orleans marriott .
