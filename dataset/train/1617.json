        "at this point , it 's well known that obama was willing to do just about anything to salvage his highly controversial `` nuclear deal '' with tehran . in fact , as we noted over the summer , ` anything ' included airlifting $ 1.7 billion dollars worth of euros , swiss francs and other currencies , stacked on wooden pallets , to tehran on an unmarked cargo plane . now , according to a new report from politico , ` anything ' might have also included enlisting the help of the department of justice and treasury department to quash a massive investigation , being led by the dea , of a $ 200 million per month drug trafficking and money laundering scheme in the u. s. that was literally funding hezbollah 's various terrorism campaigns around the globe . ",
        "here 's more from the washington free beacon : u. s. drug enforcement agents who spoke to politico about the matter accused the obama administration of intentionally derailing an investigation into hezbollah 's drug trafficking and money laundering efforts that began in 2008 under the bush administration . the investigation centered on hezbollah and iranian-backed militants who allegedly participated in the illicit drug network , which was subject to u. s. wiretaps and undercover operations . hezbollah is believed to have been laundering at least $ 200 million a month just in the united states , according to the report . ",
        "when u. s. authorities were ready to make the case against hezbollah 's most senior leadership , obama administration officials allegedly `` threw an increasingly insurmountable series of roadblocks in its way , '' according inside sources who spoke to politico about the situation . the obama-led effort to block the investigation was `` a policy decision , it was a systematic decision , '' one source said . `` they serially ripped apart this entire effort that was very well supported and resourced , and it was done from the top down . `` in light of these new revelations from drug enforcement agents , representative ron desantis , a member of the house oversight committee and chair of its national security subcommittee , said congress is now taking steps to examine evidence that could implicate top former obama officials , including national security council official ben rhodes , the architect of the former administration 's self-described pro-iran `` echo chamber . '' ",
        "`` i 've long believed that the obama administration could not have done any more to bend over backwards to appease the iranian regime , yet news that the obama administration killed the investigation into a billion dollar drug ring that lined the terrorist group hezbollah 's pockets in order to save its coveted iran deal may very well take the cake , '' desantis said . `` hezbollah is a brutal terrorist group with american blood on its hands and it would be unconscionable for american policy to deliberately empower such a nefarious group , '' he said . ",
        "`` congress will be investigating this thoroughly and my national security subcommittee will be particularly interested in how such a decision came about and whether it was driven by key iran deal architects such as ben rhodes , '' desantis said . representative peter roskam , a chief national security voice in the house who fought against the nuclear accord , mimicked the views of desantis saying that congress must investigate the obama administration 's actions and work to increase pressure on hezbollah . `` the report alleging the obama administration turned a blind eye and allowed hezbollah to pump drugs into the united states to fund its terror campaigns in the middle east is not surprising , '' roskam said . ",
        "`` hampering the dea 's investigation of hezbollah would be emblematic of the previous administration 's fixation to strike a nuclear accord with iran at any costs . '' `` this blind eye imperiled our efforts to combat iran and its proxies ' malign behavior and left us with a cash-flush iran on the warpath across the middle east with a nuclear program legitimized by the jcpoa , '' roskam said , using the acronym for the nuclear deal 's official name , the joint comprehensive plan of action . `` congress needs to investigate this report and do what the obama administration refused to do , severely increase pressure on hezbollah and hold the terrorist group , and its benefactor iran , accountable for their crimes . ",
        "`` of course , we 're sure it 's all another simple misunderstanding ... obama 's doj would never intentionally compromise an investigation to get what they want , right ?   "
