        "a colourful cast of pagans and druids braved soggy conditions at stonehenge this morning to mark the winter solstice together . thousands looked to the heavens shortly after eight o'clock to witness the sunrise on the shortest day of the year . some people offered prayers to gods , while others sounded trumpets , drums and other musical instruments at the prehistoric monument in wiltshire . pagans hold the event in more importance than the summer solstice as it marks the re-birth of the sun for the new year . english heritage 's kate davies said : `` we were delighted to welcome approximately 5,000 people to stonehenge to celebrate winter solstice this morning . ",
        "`` it was an enjoyable and peaceful celebration despite the damp weather and it was great to see so many families enjoying the music and chanting around the monument . `` we 'd like to thank all our partners for helping to organise a safe solstice and wish everyone who attended a safe trip home . `` we are looking forward to welcoming visitors over the festive season and in the new year . `` we will open on boxing day after being closed on both christmas eve and christmas day .
