        "there will come a day , and probably pretty soon , where pretty much every standalone speaker will have a voice-operated assistant inside of it . in the same way way that most tvs today have integrated `` smarts '' in the form of streaming apps for video , `` smart speakers '' will simply be the default , offering streaming audio apps and music at your voice 's beck and call . at ces 2018 there were a raft of new models were announced with either google assistant , amazon alexa or a mixture of both . from the jbl link view to the polk command bar to klipsch 's the one , most audio brands had at least one speaker on display . ",
        "and the list is only going to grow , and move far beyond traditional audio brands . now playing : watch this : sonos one is the best sounding smart speaker you can ... 1:44 as the audio reviewer at cnet , i am particularly focused on sound quality for music , so i 'm psyched to see these speaker makers offer better-sounding alternatives to the echo and google home speakers , let alone the terrible-for-music echo dot and google home mini . my current favorite , the sonos one , is a great example of the standalone smart speaker done right , and competition from other audio companies , or even sound-first smart speakers like the google home max -- is definitely a good thing . ",
        "even for people who crave good audio , the convenience of being able to ask for a song or artist by name is powerful . it 's enough , for example , to force just about every speaker maker to follow sonos ' lead , and sign on with one of the two major digital assistants . but what does having alexa and google inside everything really mean ? cheap , convenient and capablemuch like smart tv , a big reason voice assistants will be so widespread is that they are n't prohibitively expensive to add . we spoke to one manufacturer recently who told us that it costs around 10 dollars to add a `` smart '' microphone to each speaker . ",
        "as the technology improves and price comes down , having an assistant onboard should n't pass much extra cost on to the consumer . even now , the sonos one smart speaker is the same price as the `` dumb '' play : 1 it replaces . secondly , smart speakers have a clear benefit to us as consumers . want to know what the time is ? or find your telephone ? it 's just an `` alexa '' away . if you want to see where we see the future of wireless speakers heading , look at the humble headphone . ",
        "the microphone in a set of portable headphones has become so ubiquitous that most people simply forget about them . you buy a portable headphone and the mic is built right into the cable . the same thing is likely going to happen with portable and tabletop speakers -- they 'll all get microphones eventually . it 's not just table speakers that will get mics either -- for example , the polk command bar brings a fully formed echo dot to a sound bar . for clarification here , we 're specifically talking about bringing voice assistants to wi-fi-connected speakers -- the kind that let you stream spotify connect , for example -- and see this feature as an evolution of the hands-free microphone now available in most bluetooth speakers . ",
        "but there 's no reason bluetooth speakers themselves ca n't get assistants and microphones too , provided they 're high-end enough to justify the cost . while smart toilets are also a thing for some reason , smart speakers are far more useful because of where they sit at the intersection of music replay and voice control . these devices bring the user experience back to the fore , something that has suffered since wireless speakers started ditching user interfaces for smartphone control . voice control brings the fun back , because now instead of having to fish out -- if not go looking for -- your smartphone , then unlock it , scroll to the app , wait for it to load , search for the content and press play , you can simply say `` hey google , play x , '' and moments later it 's on . ",
        "and if you have a bunch of chromecast built-in devices or google homes , you can control speakers all around the house without ever taking out your phone . smart speakers are so much more than on-demand jukeboxes though . they control your lights , help organize your calendar , dictate recipes while you cook or help you load up the latest season of `` black mirror . '' they 're a lot more `` fun '' than a simple remote control , and not only that but they 're also more featured and getting better all the time . ",
        "but what about privacy ? there is an obvious and significant difference between the mics in headsets or bluetooth speakers and those in voice assistants . the fact that they are always listening is what has privacy advocates concerned . to use a microphone in your handset , you need to activate a button , software or otherwise to get it to start listening for commands . the equivalent `` button press '' that activates a smart speaker is a spoken `` wake word , '' namely `` alexa '' or `` ok google . '' ok , so maybe this is n't the kind of feature you necessarily want for your kid 's room , but how easily can hackers or third parties just record everything you say ? ",
        "how secure are they ? the companies involved will tell you they 're very secure , and more so than a pc or smartphone . one of the essential differences between a phone and smart speaker is that the smart speaker is locked down . there 's one input and it 's overseen by a single company that controls all of the development for each new software `` skill '' or hardware implementation . even though there was an amazon echo surveillance hack in august 2017 , for example , it needed actual physical access to the device . that 's because the switch that turns the microphone on and off is analog -- it ca n't be altered through software , amazon 's jeff bezos confirmed . ",
        "when the google home mini was first introduced , there was a bug in the touch controls that meant the microphone could remain on , essentially recording everything you said . but google has since patched the problem , and if you 're worried about it , you can see everything the mic has heard you say within the google home app . the risks of surveillance are n't limited to smart speakers , of course , and some researchers say that any microphone in your house -- and most households now have dozens -- could potentially be used to spy on you . ",
        "from your cellphone , to your computer , to your kid 's teddy bear and finally to your smart tv , each built-in mic could be vulnerable if not suitably protected . unless you want to cosset yourself in cotton balls and live in a forest , i think you should vote for the security of your home with your wallet : if you ca n't trust a manufacturer to maintain your device 's security , do n't buy it . you can help ensure you 're protected by periodically checking your connected devices are running the latest firmware . ",
        "time to get smart , speakersdevices such as the sonos one have shown us that a smart speaker can cost the same and still perform as well as or even better than the model it replaces . the added capabilities of the product over the speaker 's `` dumb '' predecessor arguably make up for the potential loss in privacy . the fact that more and more speakers will soon let you choose which assistant you want to use will also mean you are n't tied down to either google , amazon or whatever else comes down the pike . ",
        "there 's only one thing we can suggest to manufacturers when designing these things : make the microphone off switch a physical toggle , which could help make privacy-sensitive folks a little more comfortable . if companies can get the privacy implementations right , it 's likely that soon we 'll see `` smart speakers '' as just `` speakers '' in the same way that smart tvs are just `` tvs '' . it 's well-considered products like the sonos one and the google home max with their combinations of convenience , performance and intercompatibility that will usher in a new era of at-home listening .
