        "simon mignolet is considering his liverpool future due to what he described as an `` unhealthy '' goalkeeper situation at the club . loris karius , whose appearances this season have largely been restricted to the champions league , started ahead of mignolet for the fa cup tie with everton and sunday 's dramatic 4-3 win over manchester city . mignolet had previously been the first-choice ` keeper but an error in the 3-3 draw with arsenal prompted klopp to go with a rotation with karius , before revealing after the city game that the latter was now his preferred option . ",
        "and mignolet now looks set to seek a move elsewhere . `` after all that has happened this season , i know where i am at and the situation has become clearer , '' he said . `` klopp told me honestly and personally in that conversation . of course , i am absolutely not satisfied with that , but i must always respect a decision of the coach . after all that has happened this season , i know where i am and the situation has become clearer . `` then we played against everton in the fa cup and after a longer break the game followed against manchester city . ",
        "so , i had a hunch of what would happen and that proved to be correct . amazing team performance ! unreal atmosphere ! thank you for your support ! you 'll never walk alone #ynwa #lk1 #lfc pic . twitter . com/bbkpq0tbpb -- loris karius january 14 , 2018 `` i always try to stay quiet and calm . in the past i did come back stronger from such situations . `` but i must of course also think of my own future . the only thing i can do is focus on my training and do my best . ",
        "i become 30 years old and the world cup is coming this summer . `` this situation can not take too long , which is clear . i can not lose any more time . `` rubbishing talk of a bust-up with klopp , mignolet added : `` i have heard those rumours too , but there is absolutely no truth in it . `` ten days ago i had a conversation with klopp after the game against burnley . in the christmas period we rotated again and i found that it was not a healthy situation for a goalkeeper . ",
        "`` klopp told me what was said on sunday before and after the match . of course i am not happy with that , but there were certainly no heavy words in hindsight . `` this year 's world cup is an obvious motivation for mignolet to play regular football , but he already has the backing of belgium coach roberto martinez despite his liverpool omission . `` roberto martinez was the first to send me a message afterwards , '' he said . `` that i appreciate very much . `` i know he has a lot of confidence in me . ",
        "in the last friendly against japan i made a good impression . but playing regularly is always important . ''   "
