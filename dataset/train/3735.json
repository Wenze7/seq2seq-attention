        "aol shut down aol instant messenger , aka aim , today after 20 years of existence . aol announced the news in october , saying the service was no longer needed because people have new ways to communicate , and aim is n't part of our messaging diet . `` aim tapped into new digital technologies and ignited a cultural shift , but the way in which we communicate with each other has profoundly changed , '' wrote michael albers , communications products vp at oath . the shutdown was coming for awhile , especially after aol revoked access to aim from third-party chat clients in march . ",
        "although i 'm surprised aim lasted this long and truly had n't thought much about the service since middle school , it still feels like the end of an era . i remember my dad making my first screen name in 5th grade , which i will absolutely not disclose because it 's horribly embarrassing . i also remember my first taste of `` bot '' conversations with smarterchild . those were unproductive , but bots are still around and a key part of facebook messenger . and slack statuses remind me of away messages , which truly were an art form ; i wish i could dredge up some of my old ones . ",
        "while the service is technically gone , we still have features from the past integrated into our current platforms . we wo n't forget aim . so long . sorry but i have n't used aim since well , 10 years at least and i wont miss it one bit . just like i dont miss 14 inch lcd panels or ipods with only 180 gb storage and no cloud access . by ttringle . on 12.15.17 9:39 am . here lies aim , good friend of icq and msn messenger . murdered by sms , imessage , hangouts n√©e google talk , whatsapp and a plethora of other more convenient messaging apps . ",
        "by demios . on 12.15.17 9:52 am . i live in brazil , though we received the infamous trial cd , aol in general never really caught on here . first there was icq , then msn and then there was smartphones and whatsapp dominates over here . i think i used aim once or twice when it arrived , but that 's it . by franksands . on 12.15.17 10:31 am . fun times on aim back then ... rip . i used trillian in high school and college and had aim , msn , and icq handles . ",
        "the great thing about trillian was that it kept logs . one boring summer i pored over those logs and found such awesome and hilarious memories tucked away . i spent hours and hours pulling out nuggets and sending them to the friends involved and we all got a huge kick out of it . that 's the one thing i think people these days will lament . snapchat and its ilk all rely on the fleeting nature of things , and you have to manually save pictures and videos . it really is a beautiful thing to be able to look back -- not that it 's all valuable , maybe 5 % is . ",
        "but that 5 % represents some of the highlights of our lives . it 's a representation of us at our best , happiest , cringiest . by yodies . on 12.15.17 11:06 am . i had a long aim conversation when i was 12 about my first crush with a girl who had her first crush on me . it felt to me like the moment i came of age . i printed it out and hid it away somewhere in my childhood bedroom , but i think it is now lost to the ages . so it is with genuine nostalgic sadness that i say goodbye to aim .
