        "nearly half of complaints made by access-a-ride users are largely ignored or shoddily probed by the mta , according to a new audit . the investigation by city comptroller scott stringer revealed that a whopping 43 percent of grievances filed by riders -- ranging from late pick-up to serious safety concerns -- go unresolved for months at best after largely being outsourced to a private agency whose work is often never reviewed . the inquest discovered that 13 of the 145 complaints investigated , including a malfunctioning vehicle , rider injury , and unreasonable trip time , were never reviewed at all . ",
        "stringer is calling on the mta to appoint an internal ombudsperson to ensure the tens of thousands of complaints made annually are addressed without the massive delays and missed deadlines . many of the city 's disabled and elderly residents depend on access-a-ride , the main city-funded alternative to the subway and bus system , which is not always accessible to them . valerie joseph is wheelchair-bound , and recalled sunday how she once missed half of the lion king on broadway because her ride was late . `` i came into the show at intermission , '' said the 41-year-old queens village resident , who was born with spina bifida and hydrocephalus . ",
        "`` i 'm a person who goes to the hospital , i go to work , but i also have a personal life too and this is the only service that gets me to where i have to go . '' `` when a new yorker calls the mta to raise safety concerns or relay complaints about poor service , they expect the agency itself will investigate . but what we 're showing today is that in most cases , that simply does n't happen , '' the comptroller said in a statement . `` instead , for the bulk of the complaints received , it 's passing the buck to the very providers who are accused of causing the problems to begin with . '' ",
        "`` clearly , if you 're not going to bother to understand or investigate the problems plaguing your service , they 're never going to get fixed , '' he added . but mta spokesman shams tarek called the audit `` outdated '' and said it covered 2016 without taking reforms undertaken since then . those reforms included `` the launch of a live online dashboard that reports performance in six different categories to the public , '' he said . `` nyc transit is committed to continually improving service and other paratransit improvements made over the past year , '' added tarek . ",
        "`` including strengthening incident and complaint tracking controls ; the reporting of customer experience stats to the public at monthly board meetings , a new e-hail pilot and gps tracking to streamline booking , and the creation of a paratransit task force by chairman lhota . ''   "
