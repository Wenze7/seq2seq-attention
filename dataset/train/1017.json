        "jurgen klopp says it is `` disrespectful '' to liverpool 's other players to describe philippe coutinho , sadio mane , roberto firmino and mohamed salah as the ` fab four ' . the attacking quartet was in devastating form against spartak moscow on wednesday , with coutinho netting a hat-trick and the other three also on target in an emphatic 7-0 win at anfield . the performance led to some sections of the media dubbing them the ` fab four ' , a reference to the nickname given to the iconic liverpudlian band the beatles . klopp , however , feels it is unfair to single out those four and ignore the contributions of the likes of daniel sturridge , alex oxlade-chamberlain and adam lallana . ",
        "`` i have no problem with nicknames like ` fab four ' but that 's disrespectful to other players , '' he told a news conference . `` we played a fantastic game with west ham and ox was involved . adam lallana has not been fit but he would fit in well with any boy band on the planet . sturridge , solanke ... it 's not fair on them . '' liverpool host everton in the merseyside derby on sunday looking to make it six wins from seven premier league games since their 4-1 defeat to tottenham . ",
        "that match at wembley came following a 7-0 champions league thrashing of maribor and klopp is eager not to see a repeat in the wake of their spartak victory , especially with everton showing signs of form under new boss sam allardyce . 21 - liverpool have scored 21 goals in the champions league this season , the most by an english side in a single cl group campaign . prolific . pic . twitter . com/r1skybsw33 . -- optajoe december 6 , 2017 . `` all allardyce teams are difficult to play but , on the other hand , we are in a good moment and we have to learn from our mistakes , '' said klopp . ",
        "`` after our last clear win in the champions league against maribor , we were not spot on in the next game . `` there is no doubt about the quality of everton . no results , no confidence , they thought they needed a change and needed time to get it . `` the challenge is we do n't expect to play like we did against moscow : it was confident , flying . we have to start from the ground again . we have to be perfectly organised and protect what we do in a perfect way . ",
        "`` i played him at three different clubs and i 'm only two years here . at each club , he did the job . he 's very successful ; we know what we 'll get but that does n't make it easier . '' klopp added that alberto moreno will miss the derby due to an ankle problem picked up in midweek . `` we 're not sure what it is yet , '' he said . `` it 's around the tendon . we have to make a further assessment . it could be one week or it could be a couple of weeks . ",
        "`` it 's a very rare thing . so far , the specialists are n't sure . not everton , but if it 's in a week or so or a little bit longer we have to wait for that . there 's a little damage around the tendon . ''   "
