        "new york -- the academy awards showered outsiders , on screen and off , with milestone-setting nominations that celebrated guillermo del toro 's full-hearted ode to outcasts `` the shape of water , '' embraced first-time filmmakers like greta gerwig and jordan peele , and made `` mudbound '' director of photography rachel morrison the first woman ever nominated for best cinematography . in nominations that spanned young and old , studio blockbusters and passion-fueled indies , the 90th annual academy awards on tuesday gave many who have long been shunned by the movie business women directors , transgender filmmakers , minority actors , even netflix something to cheer about . ",
        "leading all nominees with 13 nods , including best picture , was `` the shape of water , '' by veteran mexican filmmaker del toro , whose cold war-era fantasy is about a mute office cleaner who falls in love with an amphibious creature . but the nominations also carried forward some of the ongoing reckoning of the me too movement that has been felt especially acutely in hollywood , where male filmmakers outnumber women by a ratio of approximately 12-to-1 . gerwig , the writer-director of the nuanced coming-of-age tale `` lady bird , '' became just the fifth woman nominated for best director , following lina wertmuller , jane campion , sofia coppola and kathryn bigelow , the sole woman to win , for `` the hurt locker . '' ",
        "speaking by phone tuesday from los angeles , gerwig said the distinction was extremely meaningful . `` when i think about kathryn bigelow winning and me sitting there watching it and feeling suddenly like , ` it 's possible , '' ' said gerwig . `` to be nominated as the fifth woman , i hope that what it does is that women of all ages look at it and they also find the spark within themselves that says : ` now i have to go make my movie . ' that 's what i want . and i want it selfishly because i want to see their stories . '' ",
        "in what 's been a wide-open awards season , oscar voters chose nine best-picture nominees , including four with female protagonists : `` the shape of water , '' `` lady bird , '' martin mcdonaugh 's rage-fueled comic drama `` three billboards outside ebbing , missouri , '' jordan peele 's horror sensation `` get out , '' joe wright 's winston churchill drama `` darkest hour , '' steven spielberg 's timely newspaper drama `` the post , '' christopher nolan 's world war ii epic `` dunkirk , '' luca guadagnino 's tender love story `` call me by your name '' and paul thomas anderson 's twisted romance `` phantom thread . ''",
        "one of gerwig 's first calls of congratulations was to another first-time filmmaker , peele . the two have been brought together by hollywood 's months-long oscar campaigning and their mutual rookie status . peele becomes the fifth black filmmaker nominated for best director , and the third to helm a best-picture nominee , following barry jenkins last year for `` moonlight . '' he 's also the third person to receive best picture , director and writing nods for his first feature film after warren beatty and james l. brooks . `` i 'm going to write . i 'm now going to get hard at work on the next one , '' peele said by phone . ",
        "`` one of the greatest things that i get from this whole process is this faith in my voice . it 's like jet fuel . it makes me want to make as many movies that i can in my life . `` the shape of water '' landed just shy of tying the record of 14 nominations , scoring a wide array for nominations for its cast , del toro 's directing , its sumptuous score and its technical craft . del toro said in an interview tuesday that he would celebrate with an extra chicken sausage for breakfast : `` that will be my indulgence for the day . ",
        "'' `` you realize that we are all , in some way or another , a bit of an outsider in different ways , '' said del toro of his film 's resonance . `` not fearing the other but embracing the other is the only way to go as a race . the urgency of that message of hope and emotion is what sustained the faith for roughly half a decade that the movie needed to be made . '' all of the acting front-runners frances mcdormand , gary oldman , allison janney , sam rockwell landed their expected nominations . ",
        "but there were plenty of surprises and more than a few landmarks in the nominations announced from los angeles ahead of the march 4 ceremony , to be hosted by jimmy kimmel . meryl streep scored her 21st nomination , for `` the post , '' and john williams his 51st . two 89-year-old legends became the oldest nominees : agnes varda and james ivory . there were eight first-time acting nominees , including 22-year-old `` call me by your name '' breakthrough timothee chalamet and daniel kaluuya , 28 , of `` get out . '' saoirse ronan , that grizzled 23-year-old , landed her third oscar nom , for `` lady bird . '' ",
        "denzel washington was nominated for best actor , likely eclipsing james franco . franco was accused of sexual misconduct , which he denied , just days before oscar voting closed . christopher plummer , who replaced kevin spacey in ridley scott 's `` all the money in the world , '' also sneaked into the best supporting actor category . added to the film in reshoots little more than a month before the film 's release , 88-year-old plummer is the oldest acting nominee ever . `` everything has happened so quickly of late that i am still a trifled stunned but excited by it all , '' said plummer . ",
        "perhaps most unexpected was the broad success of paul thomas anderson 's `` phantom thread , '' which scored not only nods for daniel day-lewis for best actor and lesley manville , for best supporting actress , but also nominations for best picture , anderson 's direction , costume design and johnny greenwood 's score . anderson likely displaced steven spielberg and martin mcdonagh , the director of the film many have tapped to win best picture , `` three billboards . '' his absence is a major knock for a film that has endured the harshest backlash of the contenders , with many claiming it 's out of touch in matters of race . ",
        "still , `` three billboards '' scored seven nominations tuesday , behind only `` the shape of water '' and christopher nolan 's `` dunkirk . '' the world war ii epic , thus far little-honored in hollywood 's awards season , emerged especially strong with oscar voters , taking eight nominations , many of them in technical categories . it 's nolan 's first nomination for best director . though the favorites are largely independent films , a number of blockbusters fared well , including five nods for `` blade runner 2049 , '' four for `` star wars : the last jedi , '' three for `` baby driver , '' two for `` beauty and the beast '' and two for pixar 's `` coco , '' which is up for best animated feature . ",
        "the wolverine film `` logan '' even notched a screenplay nod , a first for a superhero movie . yet patty jenkins ' `` wonder woman , '' which became the highest grossing movie ever directed by a woman , failed to receive any oscar nods despite an awards campaign . sean baker 's far lower budgeted `` the florida project '' also managed only a supporting actor nomination for willem dafoe despite hopes for more . though some minorities were still absent from the acting categories , the film academy , which has worked to diversify its membership in recent years , voted for a field of nominees almost as diverse as last year when `` moonlight , '' `` fences '' and `` hidden figures '' powered a rebuttal to the `` oscars so white '' backlash of the two years prior . ",
        "four black actors washington , daniel kaluuya , spencer and mary j. blige were among the 20 acting nominees . the documentary category also including `` abacus : small enough to jail , '' `` last men in aleppo '' and two netflix entries : `` icarus '' and `` strong island '' likewise contained history . yance ford , the director of `` strong island , '' about ford 's investigation into his brother 's 1992 murder , became the first transgender filmmaker nominated for an oscar . some had lobbied for `` a fantastic woman '' star daniela vega to become the first transgender actor nominated . ",
        "while vega did n't garner a nomination , her film , from chile , landed in the best foreign language category . the other nominees are : `` the insult , '' from lebanon ; `` loveless , '' from russia ; `` on body and soul , '' from hungary ; and the palme d'or winner `` the square , '' from sweden . last year 's oscars broadcast drew 32.9 million viewers for abc , a 4 percent drop from the prior year . more worrisome , however , was a steeper slide in the key demographic of adults aged 18-49 , whose viewership was down 14 percent from 2016 . ",
        "though the show ran especially long , at three hours and 49 minutes , it finished with a bang : the infamous envelope mix-up that led to `` la la land '' being incorrectly announced as the best picture before `` moonlight '' was crowned . this year , the academy has prohibited the pwc accountants who handle the envelopes from using cellphones or social media during the show . the accounting firm on monday also unveiled several reforms including the addition of a third balloting partner in the show 's control room . but the movie business has larger accounting problems . ",
        "attendance hit a 24-year low in 2017 . it was a dominant if bittersweet day for 20th century fox . its specialty label , fox searchlight , is behind both `` three billboards '' and `` the shape of water , '' and fox released `` the post . '' yet fox 's leading 27 nominations may soon count for the walt disney co. , which last month reached a deal to purchase fox for $ 52.4 billion . both amazon and netflix failed to crack the best picture category but earned nominations elsewhere . netflix 's `` mudbound '' scored four nods and amazon 's `` the big sick '' grabbed a nomination for kumail nanjiani and emily v. gordon 's original screenplay about their real-life romance . ",
        "`` at times we worried it would be insurmountable , or would rip us apart , or even worse that no one would like it , '' nanjiani and gordon said in a joint statement . `` the fact that it connected with audiences is exhilarating , and this nomination proves that our love is real . we have decided to stay married .
