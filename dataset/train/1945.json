        "bloomberg gadfly columnist lionel laurent discusses why it 's too early to write off mifid ii . call it a 12th-hour mifid ii punt . on the day the law started , u. k. regulators granted a 30-month reprieve to intercontinental exchange inc. . and london metal exchange venues from having to comply with a key provision intended to inject more competition and end discriminatory practices in the market . the u. k. announcement on exchange-traded derivatives followed a move on tuesday by germany 's financial supervisor , bafin , to grant a similar delay until july 2020 for deutsche boerse ag 's eurex clearing unit . ",
        "the goal of the requirements is to open access in the market by enabling traders to transact a deal on one venue and have it guaranteed at a separate clearinghouse . the french markets regulator amf also granted a 30-month deferral to exchange operator euronext nv , according to spokeswoman florence gaubert . steven maijoor , chair of the european securities and markets authority , told reporters on wednesday that the requirement to improve access between trading platforms and clearinghouses is `` very important . '' maijoor said the u. k. and german decisions to delay the requirements , steps allowed by the law , `` is an indication of the expected impact of these open access provisions . '' ",
        "brexit impactthe three firms applied for the delay , and some industry executives have said britain 's decision to leave the european union may have contributed to the need for the deferrals . the rules say national authorities should weigh the risks to the `` orderly functioning '' of trading platforms and clearinghouses when considering requests for a deferral of the open-access requirement for 30 months . ice chief executive officer jeffrey sprecher told analysts in november that exchanges and regulators were discussing whether the requirement made sense in the context of brexit . `` if we think of mifid ii as being essentially forced fragmentation of markets in order to stimulate competition , you 've got this overlay now of a population that voted for fragmentation , '' sprecher said . ",
        "`` and is there still a role right now for government to implement forced fragmentation when the market itself is fragmenting the market in ways that none of us sitting here today can fully comprehend ? '' a spokesperson for eurex said `` brexit is a game changer '' and that the open-access rules raised financial stability concerns . the lme said in a statement that the regulatory decisions are a recognition of `` the current risks open access applications could pose to the orderly functioning of financial markets . '' the london stock exchange group plc has supported open access requirements in recent years . ",
        "a spokesperson said the company `` will continue , working in partnership with our customers to promote greater choice , transparency and innovation in financial markets , in order to reduce risk and maximize capital and operational efficiencies . '' -- with assistance by mark burton , will hadfield , and fabio benedetti valentini .   "
