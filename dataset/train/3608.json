        "we share three takeaways from an eventful night , when the toronto maple leafs secured a 3-2 shootout win against the san jose sharks . toronto maple leafs coach mike babcock has often said about how his young team is still learning to win . one of the biggest issues has been their inconsistent play to start games , with the leafs often struggling to make an impression in the opening period . it 's fair to say both problems were resolved , for one night at least . let 's get to our three takeaways from an eventful thursday evening at the air canada centre : 1 -rrb- nazem kadrinazem kadri entered thursday night on a major slump , with no points in 12 games . ",
        "he said the barren run was n't an issue , but you know it had to be affecting him on some level . as such , when kadri scored in the second period , the feeling must have been a mixture of ecstasy and relief . however , this was n't even the main talking point for him on a night when he also scored one of the leafs ' two goals in the shootout . no , the main talking point came during the opening faceoff , when the 27-year-old found himself involved in a fight with the bigger joe thornton . ",
        "it 's debatable if kadri really held his own , but at least he left his mark on the fight . explaining he though he was pulling down on the middle of thornton 's jersey , kadri accidentally ripped out a handful of his opponent 's beard , which ended up on the ice . the leafs ' 2009 seventh round draft pick joked about the incident afterwards . as reported by the toronto sun 's mark zwolinski , kadri said : '' i thought i was a hockey player , not a barber . '' next : 100 not out2 -rrb- frederik andersenthursday night was a special occasion for frederik andersen , as it represented his 100th game for toronto . ",
        "by the end of the evening , he had secured the win and improved his record to 54-28-15 in a leafs jersey . andersen got to celebrate the win in style , by saving five of the six shots he faced in the shootout . he also stopped 33 of 35 shots during regulation and overtime . however , that does n't mean the 28-year-old did n't have his problems . for the second consecutive game he made a costly error , as he gave away the puck in front of his net and allowed chris tierney to tie the game at 2-2 in the second period . ",
        "overall though , this was an evening to cheer the effort of andersen , who has proved to be an excellent acquisition . here 's to his next 100 games between the pipes for the toronto maple leafs . next : losers no more toronto , on -- november 6 : frederik andersen3 -rrb- end of the losing streakto say the toronto maple leafs have had trouble beating the sharks , would be considered an extreme understatement . entering thursday night , san jose had won 10 straight against the leafs . in fact , the leafs had won just once , in their last 15 games against san jose . ",
        "as such , they were due and they came through big time , against a team challenging for the playoffs in the west . not quite as lengthy , but just as significant , toronto also ended a three-game losing streak from this season . the losing run had seen them drop down to sixth in the eastern conference . with the win , the leafs moved up to fifth and within three points of second place in the east . seasons are filled with lots of ups and downs , but to be able to end two losing streaks in one game , should do wonders for the collective morale of the team .
