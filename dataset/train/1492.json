'' ",
        "marchionne added : `` i 've seen the car when i was in europe eight days ago . so we are working on the vehicle but it 's not finished . they 're just mock-up bodies just now . but it looks good . '' the suv is expected to outpace the alfa romeo stelvio quadrifoglio , currently the fastest utility vehicle under ferrari 's parent company , the fiat chrysler group , says jalopnik . the stelvio quadrifoglio boasts a top speed of 176mph , with a 503bhp twin-turbo v6 engine , the website says , suggesting ferrari 's entry could be the first 200mph suv on the market .
