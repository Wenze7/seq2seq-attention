        "philadelphia , pa -- october 23 : a ball sails past brent celek # 87 of the philadelphia eagles as eric kendricks # 54 of the minnesota vikings defends in the first quarter during a nfl game at lincoln financial field on october 23 , 2016 in philadelphia , pennsylvania . the eagles defeated the vikings 21-10 . to preview the nfc championship game between the minnesota vikings and philadelphia eagles , we spoke with inside the iggles to ask 5 questions ! the minnesota vikings are set to take on the philadelphia eagles in the nfc championship game with the winner going on to face the winner of the new england patriots and jacksonville jaguars in super bowl 52 . ",
        "for this game , the vikings will be on the road in philly . the game will pit two of the top defenses in the nfl against quarterbacks who were not expected to be thrust into action but have managed to keep their teams ' hopes alive . to preview the game , the viking age reached out to fansided 's site inside the iggles to learn more about their opponent for sunday 's game and we were fortunate enough to speak with website expert geoffrey knox to ask him five questions . let 's dive into the discussion and talk about how the eagles offense has struggled without their sophomore quarterback at the helm ! ",
        "next : 1 . can philly keep up offensively ? philadelphia , pa -- january 13 : carson wentz # 11 of the philadelphia eagles looks on prior to the philadelphia eagles taking on the atlanta falcons during the nfc divisional playoff game game at lincoln financial field on january 13 , 2018 in philadelphia , pennsylvania . 1 -rrb- considering the injury to carson wentz , how can philadelphia score enough points to keep up with minnesota ? `` truthfully , since wentz 's injury , the eagles have seen a dip in production in just about every offensive category . ",
        "that includes 3rd down conversions , points , and yards-per-game . i 'm not even sure this is a matter of needing to keep up with minnesota . both of these teams have great defenses . both of these teams can go on droughts offensively . i 'm expecting this to be an ugly game on both sides offensively . i expect to see both punters constantly . when it 's all said and done though , i expect to see a heavy dose of the eagles running game . i expect to see a lot of run-pass options . ",
        "coach pederson will do a lot of creative things to get foles comfortable . `` next : 2 . what is the eagles ' biggest advantage ? philadelphia , pa -- january 13 : quarterback nick foles # 9 and tight end zach ertz # 86 of the philadelphia eagles celebrate their 15-10 win over the atlanta falcons in the nfc divisional playoff game at lincoln financial field on january 13 , 2018 in philadelphia , pennsylvania . 2 -rrb- what is one big way the eagles have an advantage over minnesota ? `` the biggest advantage is home field advantage . ",
        "i wrote earlier this weekend that , if history is any indication of anything , it 's the fact that teams who play indoors typically do n't win in january on the road . we 're not playing in a living room . this will be outdoors , and it will be on grass . that will throw off everything from timing plays in the passing game to field goal attempts . i 'm also expecting a raucous home crowd . the fans at ` the linc ' are n't as vicious as the ones who used to show up at ` the vet ' , but if they get involved the way that they are capable , it can feel as though the other team is under attack . ",
        "`` next : 3 . underrated eagles players3 . who are two players who vikings fans may not know on the eagles roster , but should pay close attention to during the game ? `` on offense , it 's definitely left tackle halapoulivaati vaitai . this is a guy who 's been hot and cold . he 's been a rock at times , and at others , he 's been what i 've called a ` turnstile ' . his inconsistency can result in a big day for a vikings pass rush . if he struggles , it could be a long day for an immobile nick foles . ",
        "on defense , i 'm going to cheat and give you two . defensive end brandon graham continues to get the cold shoulder from the national media , and he 's a team captain . it may not always show up on the stat line , but he 's always making plays or creating the opportunity for a teammate to get one . then there 's jalen mills . i would n't be surprised if he shows up and is a shutdown corner . i would n't be surprised if he 's taken advantage of for a couple of big plays . ",
        "it 's feast or famine with him . `` next : 4 . who is primed for a big day ? minneapolis , mn -- january 14 : adam thielen # 19 of the minnesota vikings breaks a tackle from vonn bell # 48 of the new orleans saints during the first half of the nfc divisional playoff game at u. s. bank stadium on january 14 , 2018 in minneapolis , minnesota . 4 . which one player from each team will have a big day on sunday and why ? `` jay ajayi should get the ball a ton here and truly earn that ` workhorse ' moniker . ",
        "i expect 25 carries . i expect a healthy yardage total when the day is over . for the vikings , i assume that thielen will play . he 's a professional athlete , and i do n't see how anyone will keep him out of a game like this one . he should be able to get open against an eagles secondary that can occasionally get taken advantage of , and if minnesota uses a double move here or there , he may even get in the end zone . `` next : 5 . predictions and score .
