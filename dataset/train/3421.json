        "nevada rancher cliven bundy and his sons were released by a federal judge in las vegas , after she dismissed with prejudice all charges against them . prosecutors ' failure to disclose evidence had led to a mistrial . us district court judge gloria navarro ruled monday that the government committed `` flagrant prosecutorial misconduct '' in the process against bundy and his sons in relation to the 2014 armed standoff with federal agents over grazing rights . federal prosecutors willingly withheld evidence from defense attorneys , violating the brady rule , navarro said . she dismissed all charges against the bundys and their co-defendant ryan payne `` with prejudice , '' meaning that the government will not be able to prosecute the case again . ",
        "`` a universal sense of justice was violated , '' navarro said , according to the los angeles times . on december 21 , navarro declared a mistrial , finding the prosecutors in violation of the defendants ' due process rights . the government refused to turn over fbi memos and other documentation until after the october 1 deadline and repeated requests from the defense counsel , the judge said . bundy , 71 , and his sons were charged with a total of 15 counts of criminal conspiracy and other violations following the confrontation with federal agents in april 2014 . ",
        "agents with the bureau of land management descended on bundy 's ranch that month and began to round up his cattle , saying he had failed to pay grazing fees for 20 years . on april 12 , hundreds of armed supporters arrived at bundy 's ranch , leading to the standoff with federal authorities . outnumbered government agents soon retreated from the property . no shots were fired . the situation calmed down after clark county sheriff doug gillespie negotiated with bundy and newly confirmed blm director neil kornze . an 18-page memo written by blm special agent larry c wooten , leaked last month , described nearly three years of misconduct by the agency in investigating the 2014 standoff , according to the las vegas-based ksnv . ",
        "`` i routinely observed , and the investigation revealed a widespread pattern of bad judgment , lack of discipline , incredible bias , unprofessionalism and misconduct , '' wooten wrote to associate deputy attorney general andrew goldsmith , `` as well as likely policy , ethical , and legal violations among senior and supervisory staff at the blm 's office of law enforcement and security . '' in january 2016 , bundy 's sons ammon , 42 , and ryan , 44 , led a group of armed activists in `` occupying '' a wildlife refuge in oregon for 41 days , after federal authorities ordered two local ranchers to serve time in prison over a brushfire that damaged federal property . ",
        "one of the occupiers was shot and killed by authorities . the bundys were charged with a number of felonies , but were acquitted by a jury in october 2016 .   "
