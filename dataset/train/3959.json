        "the dolphins appear to be playing out the string , and that 's a huge disappointment for head coach adam gase who had such high expectations . jay cutler was the best alternative the dolphins had after ryan tannehill went down , and while his numbers are decent -- 63.9 percent completions with 15-11 td-interception ratio -- he has not won enough games for this team . the bills have won four of their last five home games against the dolphins , although miami won a 34-31 overtime decision in upstate new york last year . tyrod taylor has endured a difficult season with the bills , in large part because his coach sean mcdermott has not shown him enough support . ",
        "taylor has completed 63.2 percent of his passes and has a 12-4 td-interception ratio . gase made a statement when he traded jay ajayi at the deadline to the eagles , and it was not a positive one . kenyan drake has taken over at running back , and while he works hard and leaves it all on the field , he is not a game-changing back . jarvis landry is a solid receiver who knows how to get open and catch short passes , but kenny stills is faster and has caught 14 passes of 20 yards or more . ",
        "the bills have an ordinary offense despite the presence of star running back lesean mccoy , and that 's because their receiving crew is ordinary . explosive sammy watkins was traded before the start of the season and he would have given taylor a big-play target . charles clay is a decent tight end with huge hands , while rookie zay jones is still learning his trade and needs to get better . the dolphins have special talent on the defensive side , but their level of play is just ordinary . much of that falls on defensive coordinator matt burke who has not been able to coax a consistent effort out of this unit . ",
        "defensive tackle ndamukong suh may be the strongest man in the league and he can dominate , but he also disappears for stretches . kiko alonso is a stellar tackler at middle linebacker . hard times have hit the bills on defense and much of that is due to a pass rush that has slipped dramatically . that part of the game was a strength for buffalo just a couple of years ago , but shaq lawson leads the team with 4.0 sacks and that 's not enough . preston brown has 100 tackles , while micah hyde is an excellent ball athlete with five interceptions and 16 passes defensed . ",
        "the dolphins have been uninspired on special teams this year and while they have n't been hurt in the return game , they rarely make big plays either . pk cody parkey has been relatively consistent , but he does n't inspire confidence in game-winning situations . the bills work extremely hard in coverage and they make it a point to shut down the opponents ' return game . they are more than doubling their opponents in punt return average . pk steven hauschka is tough and dependable in crucial-fg situations .
