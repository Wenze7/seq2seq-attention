        "get the most votesthat 's it . does n't matter how you do it or how you go about it . does n't matter if you 've never held any sort of office before . canada has a pm whose only prior qualifications included a famous name , a short stint as a drama teacher , fancy socks and the ability to look good in selfies . if the powers to be want a potted plant to run as president then that 's who will be on the ballot . if it makes you more comfortable to be ruled by family dynasties masked as semi-royalty like the bushes or the kennedys , then so be it . ",
        "it 's interesting how the internet blew up instantly even on the whiff of oprah running for the job . americans are on a hair trigger to slam even potential political candidates . it just indicates that reason and critical thinking have been tossed out the window and all people want to do is lash out and defend entrenched positions . imagine the type of person who would be motivated to step into that type of seven ring , bear cage of a circus . that 's why you 've got asshole extraordinare in the white house right now . ",
        "oprah was smart enough to pour cold water on it shortly after her globes speech . america is going to go down the tubes because good , smart people are going to look at politics and say no , no , and hell no ! if you have n't noticed , america is quite dysfunctional with their two party system . two people get pushed forward for your choices and you might as well flip a coin when you go to the ballot box . the potus has only so much power with all the checks and balances of the system . ",
        "at the end of the day , the house , senate , the government apparatus , and the individual states really hold the power . the potus is just the lightning rod while the rest of government goes about doing the actual work of running the country . btw , since i 've seen the ` nuclear codes ' argument already , you people really should stop watching so much tv . the president does n't just pop out of bed and randomly decides to punch the big red button . there 's a whole apparatus in place to stop an illegal order that does n't make sense especially if the us is looking to do a first strike . ",
        "nice fear-mongering tactic though , make sure to hold on to that when you want to disparage the next person put forward . america could have done worse than oprah as president .   "
