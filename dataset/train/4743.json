        "the uk boss of insurer axa lays too much of the responsibility for providing electric car charging infrastructure at national grid 's door , writes mike brown . plus nigel trow says people should still learn to drivelettersamanda blanc , axa 's uk boss , lays too much of the responsibility for providing electric car charging infrastructure at national grid 's door . electricity privatisation removed national grid 's obligation to plan provision of adequate generation capacity as the market was seen as a more efficient provider . national grid is responsible for carrying energy from the generation companies to regional bulk supply points , where most of it is passed on to regional distribution companies ' infrastructure which feeds our homes and businesses . ",
        "while the grid will require reinforcement , additional supply points and consequent investment , the impact on the distribution networks is likely to be disproportionate ; banks of superchargers will require cabling to industrial amounts of energy while slower and home chargers will add cumulative demands that may require reinforcement work at street level . grid and distribution charges are moderated by ofgem but on the basis that necessary capital investment costs are passed on to the customer , so there will be an impact on energy costs . the solution to ms blanc 's charging delays might be found in larger , shared tracked electric vehicles , using a continuous overhead power supply , which are available in much of europe and sometimes at reasonable cost .
