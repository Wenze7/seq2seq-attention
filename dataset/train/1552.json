        "spider-man : homecoming cast members tom holland , jacob batalon and laura harrier participated in a q&a panel at phoenix , arizona 's ace comic con , where the young stars were asked which movies helped inspire their journeys into acting and their eventual work on the john hughes-inspired homecoming . `` it 's funny , because i actually really liked not another teen movie , '' batalon answered . `` chris evans in that was ridiculously funny for some reason . '' `` so funny , '' harrier said . `` i love him , he 's so funny , '' holland added . ",
        "`` it was such a 2000 's feeling movie , it was so in the time and that did n't make me want to become an actor per se , but i definitely want to be cool like that , '' batalon explained . `` i mean , i loved mean girls , '' harrier said , inspiring cheers from the crowd . `` and i also loved that our movie was n't mean girls , and liz was n't regina george . but yeah , that was a big one for my childhood . '' `` i love mean girls , '' holland said , going on to answer the kind of movies he enjoys . ",
        "`` so many , so many . i mean , spider-man is so unique in the way that he moves , there 's nothing else really like it , '' holland answered . `` but yeah , action movies , the old james bond movies , the mission : impossible movies , all those things i love , '' holland said . `` i love action movies , and for me , movies like ferris bueller 's day off , back to the future , those are my movies , that 's what we wanted to do . and that 's what jon watts did so well , and i 'm really glad we were able to do that . ",
        "`` first-time marvel director watts took inspiration from seminal '80s teen comedies like ferris bueller and the breakfast club , while holland 's peter parker performance was inspired by back to the future leading man marty mcfly . `` he gave us a load of videos , old movies , to watch before starting shooting : pretty in pink , back to the future , breakfast club , ferris bueller 's day off , '' holland said of the cast 's `` homework '' handed down by the director . `` my goal was to try and kind of be our generation 's marty mcfly . ",
        "that was what my all-time goal was , and i was actually lucky enough that a journalist said , ` oh , you 're kind of like marty mcfly in this movie .
