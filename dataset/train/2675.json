        "elisabeth moss was nominated for outstanding performance by a female actor in a drama series at the 2018 screen actor 's guild awards , and many expected her to win the category . however , claire foy ended up taking home the honor for her performance in the crown . that left some viewers feeling like elisabeth moss was snubbed at the sag awards . twitter in particular was definitely disappointed . moss had already won a few awards for her role as offred/june , earning both an emmy and a golden globe for her efforts . moss was the favorite to win at the sag awards , with gold derby predicting that both she and the series she stars in would end the night victorious . ",
        "it 's clear that banking on moss was a safe bet , and i think most of us can agree that if she had won , it would have been well-deserved . the handmaid 's tale took audiences by storm when it was released because of how much it resonated with the current political climate , and moss ' performance was nothing short of incredible . however , it was a category with a lot of competition and there 's no denying foy also gave a stunning , layered performance as queen elizabeth ii . with so many amazing actresses around , it 's hard to say who earned it more -- though twitter seems to have been rooting for moss .
