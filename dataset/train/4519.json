        "in five days time from now , a moment , an idea that captures an essence of modern britain will crystallise . it 's britain 's leading talent in which you 'll be be forgiven if they 're not seared yet on your conscious . what emerged as a day dream , a `` what if '' from last summer then matured into a profound thought . on the 7th of december , the continuum of that dream should spread its wings and fly . on the 7th we will no longer have any claim to the dream 's narrative . ",
        "it will be yours to decide upon a point of entry , how to weave its explicit and implicit stories into your episodic memory , and distil its enduring legacy . on the 7th britain 's leading weavers of stories , whose presence aligns within that glowing televisual frame parked in your personal space , will gather in one unified space -- together . what unites them is their extraordinariness . what they share is a a creative passion towards story telling and a resilience to plough their chosen path . what they illustrate is a perceptible trajectory of change 's journey and a viable destination . ",
        "it 's a start . a proof of concept . we gather all the time , to share our love , our quest for knowledge , a need to understand others . and this gathering , the tvc leader 's list shares these characteristics , yet in a way that makes a statement . i ` ve learned that people will forget what you said , people will forget what you did , but people will never forget how you made them feel , said maya angelou . on the 7th , we like to think you wo n't forget how you felt either .
