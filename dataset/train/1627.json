        "people in business are not the same as they are in life . people in business can be far more ruthless , more selfish , more prone to deceive , manipulate and selfish . fair enough i guess , after all it is money we 're talking about and those with it will maintain that status above all else . when you go into business , or like trying to buy a business , you better have your smart hat on . do n't think for a minute that the seller will be nice to you -- because they wo n't -- by and large . ",
        "if there is a better deal to be had , they will find it . the written word is the only gold . verbal agreements , handshakes -- all mean nothing when it comes down to it . do your homework . analyse , analyse , analyse and then make a calculated decision . do n't let your emotions get in the way . do n't like the way things look on the outside . it 's the black and white that matters . lemons change hands all the time . you have to know how to pick a lemon , or at least know that you 're getting one and turn it into lemonade . ",
        "i 'll go over a few of the things you need to watch out for in my series of posts on my adventures into cafe land . suffice to say , it 's all in the paperwork and if there is n't any run like hell because that is the first sign of a lemon or a shady deal coming your way . know that you are entering a harsh land , put your big pants on , and in you go . do n't expect to be met with thunderous applause , open arms and helpful hands , because this is business and it 's every person for themselves .
