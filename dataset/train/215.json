        "on november 30 , brad fritsch received a text message that made his heart sink . it was from one of his brothers , asking about a specific part of fritsch 's weight loss program . in early november , not long after his 40th birthday , the canadian decided to make some drastic health changes . weighing in at 242 lbs -- `` pretty much the heaviest i 'd ever been , '' fritsch recalls -- he got in touch with his friend alex , a chiropractor who offers a successful weight loss program . alex 's adverts promised you could `` lose a pound of fat per day '' and fritsch was finally sold after his wife lost 25 pounds on the same plan . ",
        "as a professional golfer , currently ranked 831 in the world but having achieved a career high of 234 , he would have the best part of two months off during golf 's off-season . over the course of his pro career , fritsch has so far earned just under $ 800k . `` i would lose the weight and simultaneously adapt my golf swing throughout the program with my instructor , '' fritsch said in a lengthy facebook post . the weight loss program , he told his brother , included just two low calorie meals a day , consisting of a small amount of protein and his choice of vegetables , drinking 120 oz of water , a liquid multivitamin and a spray called biosom . ",
        "then came the text : `` hey , it 's not that spray that got vijay in trouble , right ? `` the female golf caddy that conquered augustadeer antler sprayin 2013 , fijian golfer vijay singh said in an interview with sports illustrated that he used `` deer antler spray , '' a supplement used in the sports and fitness industry to build strength and endurance or recover quickly from injury . singh was eventually cleared of doping by the pga tour after the world anti-doping agency said the spray did not contain a sufficient amount of growth hormone to break the rules . ",
        "fritsch describes himself as `` a huge advocate '' in expanding the tour 's anti-doping program , both in meetings and private conversations . `` i 've been adamant that we should publicize every offender , no matter the offense , '' he says . however , now that it was his turn , could he just lie about it ? `` i could n't , '' fritsch said . `` it 's not who i am . i believe in the program and if i 'm to be suspended , then so be it . it is my own fault that i 'm in this position . ",
        "`` i 'm just so upset with myself that i did n't think to question what was in the supplements . but i never did . and in the program rules , it stipulates that a self-report is the same as a positive test . `` fritsch sent a text to andy levinson , pga tour senior vice president , to tell him he was concerned about the contents of the spray he had used . he tested positive and so was suspended by the pga tour for three months , retroactive to november 30 , the day he messaged levinson . ",
        "at last , glory for garcia -- golf in 2017 `` mr. fritsch self-reported this information after discovering that an ingredient in a supplement that he was taking was on the prohibited list , '' the tour said in an official statement . `` he has acknowledged his inadvertent error and accepted his suspension . `` fritsch now says he is in a `` good place , '' has lost 28 pounds and is thankful he never played a competitive round of golf while using the spray . `` i just wish i had paid attention to the details . ",
        "i 'm embarrassed that i did n't pay attention to the details , '' fritsch said . `` to all those who believe in me , who cheer for me , who respect me - i hope those three things do n't change . ''   "
