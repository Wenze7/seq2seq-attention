        "today 's writing prompt from wordpress resonated with me . `` calling . '' what does that mean ? a calling is a tricky thing . it means , in its most religious sense , what god has meant for you to do . it 's the answer to the question `` why are you here ? '' attempting to divine god 's will or plans is a sure way to either 1 -rrb- prove your own hubris or 2 -rrb- wind up in a lot of trouble . countless people claim to know what god wants for themselves or others , usually making it clear they 're really out for their own self-interest . ",
        "or that they 're nuts . it 's a toss up . best case scenario , you drive yourself nuts trying to figure out if something is what he intends . so do i have a calling to write ? is that why i 'm here ? are there issues with using that term ? some would apply the word only to those who have been called to the priesthood . anything outside of that is a vocation we choose . that 's fine . i 've always felt moved to write , even at a young age . even when i did n't know `` writing '' could be a career choice . ",
        "the impulse has often driven me . when i was n't writing it was scratching around the back of my brain , waiting to get out like a caged animal . maybe writing is n't a calling . maybe nothing is . if you want to take issue with that , it 's up to you . even if we do n't want to use that word , the spirit of what it means still keeps me moving forward . that spirit was encapsulated in a common saying , one that i saw regularly on a framed needlepoint on the wall of the stairs leading to the basement of my grandparents ' house . ",
        "my grandmother had made it herself . she was n't an overly-religious person , but knew this still applied . your talent is god 's gift to you . what you do with it is your gift back to god . same basic concept . chris thilk is a freelance writer and content strategist who lives in the chicago suburbs .
