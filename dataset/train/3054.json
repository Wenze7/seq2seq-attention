        "paris -- airbus said friday that its ceo , tom enders , will step down in 2019 , as the european airplane maker shakes up management amid multiple corruption investigations . the company said enders , who will have been at the helm of airbus and defense firm eads for 14 years , wo n't seek another term when his current term expires . enders has been a key figure as airbus has jockeyed with u. s. rival boeing over the past decade to be the world 's top-selling plane maker . the 59-year-old was quoted friday as saying airbus needs `` fresh minds for the 2020s '' and that he would use the remainder of his time to ensure a smooth transition and to strengthen the company 's ethics and compliance programs . ",
        "the governments of france and germany , which have stakes in airbus and used to have seats on its board , are paying close attention to the management changes and the legal probes . `` we obviously need to keep an eye on our strategic interests and governance , which must be exemplary , '' french president emmanuel macron told reporters in brussels on friday . speaking alongside german chancellor angela merkel , macron insisted that their governments wo n't `` interfere politically to return to a role in the daily management of the company '' -- but said he wants the airbus board to provide clarifications in the coming weeks about the executive shakeup . ",
        "also leaving is the chief operating officer and president of the commercial aircraft division , fabrice bregier , who will step down next february . he will be succeeded by guillaume faury , currently ceo of airbus helicopters . enders described faury as part of `` the next generation of leaders , '' which could suggest he is being groomed to eventually take over as ceo of the overall airbus group . the announcement came weeks after airbus announced it is replacing its combative , long-serving sales chief , john leahy . he 's being replaced by an outside executive , from rolls royce . ",
        "the big challenge for incoming airbus management will be legal investigations . authorities in britain and france are investigating alleged fraud and bribery related to airbus ' use of outside consultants in commercial plane sales . airbus has warned that the investigations could lead to `` significant penalties '' and promised to stop working with middlemen . meanwhile , austria is investigating suspected fraud in the government 's purchase of airbus combat aircraft . it 's a bumpy time for airbus , which recently saw a major deal with gulf carrier emirates for a380 superjumbos fall apart at the last minute at the dubai air show . ",
        "the airline handed the contract to boeing instead . shares were little changed friday , as management changes were expected . airbus had revenues of 67 billion euros last year and employs 134,000 staff worldwide .   "
