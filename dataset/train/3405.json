        "the democratic national committee has decided to start paying its interns next year , addressing criticism that its internship program effectively excluded poor and working-class students . tom perez , the dnc chair and a former u. s. labor secretary , wanted to make sure an internship was n't beyond anyone 's means , the party 's governing body said in a statement to huffpost . `` as part of the new dnc , tom perez believes it 's critical that we establish a process to provide paid internships in order to give the young voices in our party the opportunity to grow and become the next generation of democratic leaders , '' the dnc said . ",
        "`` it is important that young democrats have a seat at the table and paid internships will ensure that we select the most qualified and diverse individuals regardless of financial background . '' under the new system , interns who accept positions will be able to apply for stipends of up to $ 3,000 . unpaid internships have come under fire in recent years , particularly in the politics and media worlds . critics say the practice helps keep lower-income students and graduates out of influential institutions , since only their better-off counterparts can afford to live and work for free for several months . ",
        "a group called pay our interns pressured the dnc to start offering interns money . the group succeeded in getting perez to pledge to change the program when he campaigned for chair . payday report revealed that the committee still was n't offering paid internships as of the summer . `` i hope this is a moment they can show leadership on this issue , and hopefully others will follow , '' said carlos mark vera , the group 's 23-year-old founder , who was an unpaid intern at the white house under president barack obama . `` folks in the party say millennial voters will be a big voting bloc . ",
        "that 's great , but you should pay us for what we 're doing . '' it is n't clear how long the dnc internships were unpaid . parag mehta , who worked at the committee from 2005 to 2008 , told huffpost that it offered need-based stipends at the time under then-chairman howard dean . research by pay our interns shows that republican lawmakers are actually better at paying interns than democrats are . half of gop senators have paid internships , compared with about one-third of democratic senators , the group found . the republican national committee already has a paid internship program in place . ",
        "vera applauded perez for taking time over the last few months to develop the paid program . after all , he noted , it 's democrats who are the vocal party when it comes to worker rights . `` they should be practicing what they 're preaching , '' vera said . this post has been updated to note that the dnc previously offered stipends under howard dean .
