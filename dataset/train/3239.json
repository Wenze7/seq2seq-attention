        "chatbots are a vital feature on the homepages of many brands and major businesses . for anyone looking to build on their success , it is always a positive to see them being used , gaining positive feedback and generating interest in the press . yet , what are the true results from using chatbots ? companies are often less inclined to talk about that , but word is starting to get out . booking time with a chatbottake a look at this piece from travel site booking . com , in 7 things you need to know about designing a chatbot they discuss the development of new chatbot booking assistant . ",
        "naturally enough , their key focal point was the conversation . using entry points to ascertain a visitor 's likely intent and provide the appropriate information as fast as possible , getting the context right and using a suitable tone of voice for the company 's wide user base . those issues are key considering that many people are still unfamiliar with chatbots and may not understand the technology . user testing revealed a wide range of responses to the assistant , something that any major project needs to consider . one thing the testers learnt is that while the chatbot may be a 24/7 tool , the human help or support element is n't , which can lead to failure to deliver and reduced expectations . ",
        "any business that can afford it probably needs that human touch on call at anytime . on a related note , since chatbots provided the fastest response of any help method , they rapidly became the default mode among testers , a pattern your real world customers should also track . should you use emojis in chatbots ? one of the current hot topics of developer water cooler chats is the use of emoji in chatbots . theoretically , they help get over language barriers and are faster to convey a range of emotional states . let 's take a look at british airways who last christmas trialed a facebook messenger chatbot with personalised holiday offers based on emoji input . ",
        "the company 's head of marketing , rob mcdonald said : `` three in five people said that they find it easier to convey how they are feeling with the use of an emoji , so giving customers the chance to speak to us with them takes choosing a holiday to a much more exciting and engaging level . '' their survey also revealed that 63 % of 18 to 34 year olds use emojis in most or all of their messages , while almost half of women respondents said they use emojis to convey feelings , emotion and mood when words wo n't do the trick . ",
        "consider these ideas and statistics when building a chatbot and planning to incorporate the use of emoji . the one quirk here is that ba only used the chatbot up to january 2017 at the end of a limited trial . does this suggest they did n't find consistent results or value ? the devil is in the detailwith those lessons in mind , the general reaction to chatbots has been one of approval when it comes to simple tasks , but users feel let down when more complex interactions are attempted . a recent survey by eptica on digital customer experience showed that 72 % are happy with online chat and some 33 % would use a chatbot for shopping . ",
        "however , 77 % would prefer to talk or chat to a human for complex issues and only 15 % are happy their chatbot interactions , suggesting there is a long way to go . that 's where bot developers must focus their efforts to either send a customer to a human agent earlier , rather than getting bogged down with an intractable problem that ca n't solved by `` can you say that another way ? '' they also need to make resolving complex issues a priority , either by better use of scripting to offer more refined options , or ai to help better understand the context of a conversation . ",
        "still plenty of options for chatbot buildersthe good news is that any company can build a chatbot using the wide and growing range of resources available online . chatbots will soon dominate most areas of customer service including technology and service support . soon , bots move away from the website , app or messenger and will be integrated or connect via the product , such as your home washing machine or fridge , saving on digging out the warranty to locate a customer support number , then waiting on hold for ages because your call is valuable . you can build an app now , for free , using a service like snatchbot , it offers a deploy-anywhere model , using a creation tool that anyone can use with no coding experience . ",
        "using templates or existing examples as a basis , any company big or small can build and deploy a chatbot . then view the interaction results via a cloud analytics tool . capable of being updated in minutes , rather than weeks as with traditional apps or websites created with a web developer , the chatbot can be refined and realigned to meet customer needs quickly , and as you learn more about what your customers want the chatbot can be tweaked to meet those needs . with a little perseverance , even those complex tasks can be mastered to improve customer service and satisfaction . ",
        "with chatbots still in the early days , any information we can get from the trenches is valuable , and learning how any business can make their bot better will help this technology and the market overall improve .   "
