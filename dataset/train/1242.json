        "afp/file / bryan r. smith president donald trump regularly extols the health of the us economy under his watch , but analysts with an eye on the yield curve are n't as optimistic about its long-term prospectsthe us economy may be basking in the warm glow of solid growth , but economists are nervously eyeing a trend in the bond market that could spell stormy weather ahead . even though president donald trump is touting unemployment at its lowest level in 17 years and wall street soaring to new heights , economists are worried about one indicator that is often a harbinger of recession : the yield curve . ",
        "`` since 1950 , each recession has been preceded by a reversal of the yield curve , '' said christopher low , chief economist of ftn financial . this closely scrutinized graph maps the difference in yield , or return on investment , of short - and long-term us treasury debt , usually comparing two-year notes to 10-year bonds . normally , the shorter the investment , the lower the yield , and conversely , the longer the investment , the higher the return , to offset the greater risks of losing access to funds for an extended period . ",
        "but for the past year , the yield curve has been flattening as the return on short-term debt has been getting close to long-term yields , possible signaling eroding confidence in the economy 's performance in the coming years . the spread between the yield on two - and 10-year treasury paper fell from 135 in december 2016 to 51 basis points on december 15 , the lowest since october 2007 -- just before the start of the global financial crisis . worse still would be if the yield curve inverts , as short-term returns outpace the longer-dated debt -- meaning the spread is negative -- and if officials ignore the warning . ",
        "the yield curve inversion `` could be heralding a contraction of the economy , '' says gary duncan , chief economist at oxford economics . - fed policy - as gregori volokhine , of meeschaert financial services , explained : `` an inversion of the curve indicates that investors do not have confidence in the future . `` the main factor behind the flattening of the yield curve is the us central bank 's moves to raise the benchmark interest rate five times since the end of 2015 , including three increases this year and three more expected in 2018 . ",
        "the long-term yields fluctuate more in line with growth and inflation expectations . and while growth prospects have been revised upwards for next year -- in part due to the impact of the massive corporate tax cuts just approved by congress -- the federal reserve 's inflation target will not be reached until 2019 , according to its latest forecasts . the fed 's preferred inflation measure was only 1.6 percent year-on-year in october . two voting members of the fed 's policy committee -- including minneapolis fed president neel kashkari -- dissented from the december 13 decision to raise rates , preferring to wait for inflation to rise further . ",
        "- ` worrying ' - kashkari also mentioned his concerns about the yield curve and the signal it is sending to policymakers . `` while the yield curve has not yet inverted , the bond market is telling us that the odds of a recession are increasing , '' he said in a statement explaining his opposition to raising rates again . duncan of oxford economics cautioned that `` if the fed tightens its policy too quickly , the markets anticipate a slowdown in the economy in the longer term '' as credit becomes more expensive . however , outgoing fed chair janet yellen downplayed those fears . ",
        "`` there are good reasons to think that the relationship between the slope of the yield curve and the business cycle may have changed , '' yellen said in her press conference last week . ftn 's low said yellen could be making the same mistake as her predecessors alan greenspan in 1998 and ben bernanke in 2006 , who each saw recessions after the yield curve inverted . `` janet yellen is making the same speech , '' low said . `` this is worrying . `` like most analysts , low does not anticipate an inversion before 2019 , or a recession until `` early 2020 . ",
        "`` historically the economy has seen four to six quarters between a curve inversion and the start a recession . of course , not every flat curve brings on an economic downturn , and some economists agree with yellen that it may be too early to panic . noted economist mohamed el-erian , chief economic adviser at allianz se , parent company of pimco , notes several reasons the yield curve could steepen , including many indicators signaling the economy still has room to expand and inflation to pick up . if it does n't , the fed could reverse course quickly , he wrote in a blog post . ",
        "in addition , `` the synchronized pick-up in growth in the rest of the world is supportive of the us expansion . ''   "
