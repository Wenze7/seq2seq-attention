        "by peter jacksonleigh halfpenny is being warned to raise his game as wales full-back in the face of growing competition for his place . the scrum-capped goalkicker finds his 50-test run at no . 15 under challenge from four other contenders for the back-three positions -- liam williams , rhys patchell , steff evans and george north . as halfpenny fights to retain his place at the start of a tenth season of international rugby against scotland in cardiff on february 3 , his form is being questioned by a lions record-breaker whose four tries in one series has stood since 1974 , jj williams . ",
        "the wing who never lost a five nations home match over six years is calling for halfpenny to rediscover his ` spark ' and bring more of an attacking threat to a wales team undergoing the strategic overhaul necessary to embrace a wider game . `` every time leigh got the ball , he kicked it downfield and that was the case under gatland for quite a while , ' williams told the rugby paper . `` over that period he lost his spark . all international full-backs today are running the ball back , not kicking it . it makes sense because it 's the best form of counter-attack . ",
        "`` leigh 's goalkicking has been a little inconsistent by his very high standards . he 's not as deadly as he was . he 's got to offer more as an attacking force , to be more dangerous ball-in-hand as he was early in his career . he seems to have lost a bit of pace since he 's come back from toulon . `` with the choices wales have at full back , there 's not much in it now between halfpenny , liam williams and rhys patchell . i think they will start with halfpenny against scotland with williams and steff evans on the wings for what 's going to be a loose game . ",
        "patchell 's got to be on the bench at the very least . '' halfpenny , 29 , began on the wing against south africa ten years ago , scoring eight tries from 23 tests before switching to full-back during the 2011 world cup . since then he has scored half as many tries in more than twice as many matches . a serious knee injury in wales ' last warm-up match for the 2015 world cup put him out of the tournament . by the time he returned , wales had played 14 matches without him . the scarlets stuck with patchell as their starting full-back in the champions ' cup against toulon last saturday .
