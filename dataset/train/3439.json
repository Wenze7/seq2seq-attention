        "googlewe are a week and a half away from christmas , but it 's still not too late to fly away for the holidays -- it 'll just cost a pretty penny to do so . if you 're okay with that , google announced on its blog that it updated its suite of travel applications and services to feature price tracking and deals . starting with google flights , the search giant is leveraging its machine learning chops to take a look at historical price data to let you when is the best time to book a flight .

        "because you 're dealing with hotels , google lets you know if rates for a specific room are higher or if the surrounding area is busier due to a local event . that way , you can better plan when to make a hotel room reservation , with folks having the option to receive email alerts whenever prices fluctuate . finally , the google trips app now features a `` discounts '' section . as the name implies , the section nets you deals for things like tickets , tours , activities , and attractions . discounts vary based on where you 're located , and the app also leverages google 's travel-booking features , so you do n't have to tell it where you 're headed .

        "google trips , which launched last year , peruses your gmail account to automatically organize your travel reservations into individual trips . that way , you can go into the trips to scope out places to eat and landmarks to visit . it is also available offline , in case you do not have any internet access on your phone . overall , the new features sound very familiar to what services like kayak and hopper already offer . the main difference is , since many folks are already deeply immersed in google 's ecosystem , these are just more reasons why they should n't leave that ecosystem . ",
        "the flight and hotel price tracking are currently rolling out worldwide , whereas the discounts tab inside of the trips app will be available in english , french , italian , german , spanish , and portuguese . you can give the google trips app a download below if you 're interested in trying it out . get the app .
