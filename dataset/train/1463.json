        "i left my house with a lot of time to spare before i was supposed to be at the gymnastics club coaching . i made a metal check list of all the things i wanted to get done in this rare amount of spare time . this list that i thought was crucial consisted of going to the bank . running by the grocery store for a snack . hitting starbucks for a quick boost . calling my mom . posting to instagram . checking in with my sister through text . my mind raced through the list as i merged onto the highway , prepared to be in the car and rushing for the next 45 minutes . ",
        "i have a favorite loop to run and walk . you know how you have your favorite spot to read or your favorite place in your home to relax ? i love and feel at home walking and running around the river market . i feel safe with all the people around . i love being by the water and running over the bridges . to me , there is no better feeling than being in my favorite spot , outside in the fresh air , listening to music and the time alone to think . this loop happens to be between my home and my jobs . ",
        "i think about this loop from the time i wake up until the point where i make the time to get outside . my heart knows this loop heals me . so i have this urge to feel the sun on my face and breath the fresh air at all times . but because i 'm human i make all these excuses . the list i listed above , those are the exact excuse i 'm referring too . the walking helped heal me when i was struggling with depression . the walking helped heal me through my first big heart break . ",
        "the walking helped me on the journey of finding myself . the walking got me through my struggles with an eating disorder . the walking heals me when i ca n't even pinpoint whats wrong . you would think since i know this with absolute certainty i would put walking first ... . but nope . i wish you could hear all the excuses that were going through my mind about 5 minutes before i was about to pass that exit for downtown on my way to accomplish all those ` errands ' . i laugh because your mind will try so hard to talk you out of what your heart really wants and needs . ",
        "so i 'm coming up on the exit and i hear myself saying `` okay kristina ... . you have got a choice here . you can go rush through all your errands and create more anxiety that may be transferred into the way you coach or you have a choice to run your heart out for 15 minutes and feel that anxiety leave your body . you can go to your girls and lead by example . you can transfer all your good energy to them because you respect yourself enough to take care of yourself . kristina you know this is what you need to do for you and them . '' ",
        "i basically swerved off the exit . put my headphones on . and i ran . i ran fast . i ran for myself . and i followed the directions my heart has guiding me to heal . and you know what . i got back in the car feeling on top of the world . i felt so proud of myself . the gymnasts and i had a great practice . so many smiles . that is healing , love and good energy at work . all that being said no it is not always easy to choose what your self-love asks of you . ",
        "but find that thing that gives you life . and do it for you . do it for the people you love most . we all want to see you happy and proud . i out ran the pressure and took back my power . i hope i can come back on days i 'm struggling to choose self-love , read this post and find that strength all over again . to running your heart out , kristinawe have got to lead by example . they are my purpose , my passion project .
