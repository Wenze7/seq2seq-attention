        "australia have regained the ashes courtesy of a dominant victory over england in the third test at the waca . josh hazlewood took five wickets as the hosts bowled england out for just 218 runs on the final day , wrapping up the victory by an innings and 41 runs . england began the final day on 132-4 and chasing 127 simply to draw level with australia 's record-breaking total of 662 , but they put up little resistance to surrender the urn . jonny bairstow was dismissed with england having added just one run to the overnight total , and moeen ali soon followed to expose the tourists ' tail . ",
        "dawid malan was england 's last major hope of batting out the day and at least earning a draw , but when his 54-run innings was brought to an end by hazlewood , england 's fading hopes went with him . the tourists lost their last three wickets for just 22 runs as australia comfortably saw out the victory , taking an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match series to win back the urn . the fourth test begins on monday at the mcg , with england now looking to avoid a second consecutive series whitewash in australia .
