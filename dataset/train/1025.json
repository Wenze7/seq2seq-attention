        "paul briden 15/01/2018 - 11:26 amsamsung 's galaxy s9 has been certified ahead of launchyou likely know the drill by now ; usually when a new handset is about to break cover it starts appearing in official certification documents all over the world ; they 'll pick up certifications for major connectivity protocols , including bluetooth from the bluetooth sig , wi-fi from the wfa , and certifications from major national authorities such as china 's tenaa and the us fcc . the galaxy s9 and galaxy s9 + have now rocked up in a listing with the latter authority , the us federal communications commission , with the model number sm-g960 for the regular edition , and sm-g965 for the plus . ",
        "the listings detail how both phones are to be manufactured in vietnam , china , and korea , and will support all major lte , gsm , umts and cdma bands . versions dubbed sm-g960u , sm-g960u1 , sm-g960w and sm-g960xu are all mentioned . it 's thought the first two are for the us market and the third is for the canadian market . the fourth is belived to be for promotional and demonstration units . similarly for the plus model there are sm-g965u , sm-g965u1 , sm-g965w and sm-g965xu variants . that 's about all the info we get from the fcc , but fortunately we do know a bunch of other specs and details thanks to the samsung galaxy s9 retail box leaking last week . ",
        "the leak confirmed ip68 water and dust resistance , a qhd + super amoled display , akg branded and tuned stereo speakers and headphones , and a 12mp primary camera with `` super speed '' dual pixel phase detection autofocus and a variable f/1 .5 / f/2 .4 aperture . with the duo showing up at the fcc there 's not going to be long before they are launched - but we knew that anyway with samsung having already lined up a launch event for mwc 2018 in february !
