        "younger adults with difficult-to-treat epilepsy may have early signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy in their brain tissue , but it appears to be uncommon , according to a small , preliminary study published in the january 10 , 2018 , online issue of neurology , the medical journal of the american academy of neurology . chronic traumatic encephalopathy is a rare , degenerative brain disease most likely caused by repeated head trauma . people with cte may develop symptoms like dementia , personality disorders or behavior problems . people with epilepsy can experience head trauma when they have full body seizures , also called tonic-clonic seizures , or partial or focal seizures where they lose some or all awareness of their surroundings . ",
        "for this small pilot study , researchers looked at microscopic sections of brain tissue from 10 people living with epilepsy who had resective surgery to control seizures that could not be fully controlled by medication . the surgery removes the area of the brain shown in testing to be where the seizures begin . `` previous studies have found signs of cte in up to a quarter or even a third of older people with epilepsy , so our aim was to determine if such signs could be found in the brains of younger people with epilepsy , '' said study author gregory d. cascino , md , of the mayo clinic in rochester , minn. , associate editor for neurology , and a fellow of the american academy of neurology . ",
        "`` only one of our 10 study participants had signs of cte , but because our study was small , more research needs to be done to confirm our findings . `` the 10 study participants had been living with epilepsy for an average of 24 years , and had the surgery when they were an average age of 33 . eight had a history of head injury related to their seizures , but none of the injuries required medical care . while none of the participants played football , information on other contact sports was not available . one had localized seizures with impaired awareness , two had tonic-clonic seizures , and seven had both seizure types . ",
        "seizure frequency ranged from two to three a day to one to two per year . one study participant had sparse brain lesions caused by tau protein tangles in the brain tissue , a sign of cte . that person had an average of two partial seizures with impaired awareness seizures a day , had seizures for 28 years before the surgery and had a history of mild head injuries related to seizures . in the brain tissue of the other nine patients , researchers found no evidence of cte . there were no unique characteristics for the one person who had signs of cte when compared to the other nine people . ",
        "`` despite a history of disabling seizures , nine of the 10 patients had no sign of tau protein deposits in their brain tissue , '' said cascino . `` this lack of tau in the brains of our study participants does not mean it 's not possible for them to develop cte at a later age , but it appears that signs of the disease may not be obvious in most people before they are 50 years old . `` in addition , all of the participants were evaluated before surgery for thinking , behavior and memory skills . ",
        "eight showed mild to moderate cognitive impairment , which can occur in people with difficult-to-treat epilepsy . cascino said , `` our study suggests that tau accumulating in the brain is unlikely to be a contributor to cognitive impairment in younger patients with epilepsy with localized seizures that do not respond well to medications . `` a major limitation of this pilot study is the small number of participants . larger , long-term studies are needed to determine the prevalence of cte in younger patients with epilepsy .
