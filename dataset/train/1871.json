        "as facebook continues to battle the scourge of `` fake news , '' it 's trying out a new feature that it hopes will connect users with local news , events , and announcements called `` today in . '' the new feature will push local content from publishers approved by the company 's news partnership team , according to recode . the feature is available on mobile in just six cities so far : new orleans , louisiana ; little rock , arkansas ; billings , montana ; peoria , illinois ; olympia , washington ; binghamton , new york . ",
        "by clicking the menu button and selecting `` today in , '' users who identify themselves as living in those six cities will see a selection of content . according to a facebook spokesperson , `` today in '' is intended as a place on facebook where users can find news from vetted local news sources , community events , and even alerts from local authorities . image : facebookpartnering with local news has been a major focus for facebook , including last year 's sit-down between the social media company and some of the top stake-holders in local media in the u. s . ",
        "the roundtable for local news included partnership groups like the local media association and the local media consortium , as well as media companies like gannett , tegna , and mcclatchy . image : facebook `` today in '' is just the latest tweak facebook has recently rolled out aiming to positively change the way users engage with news . besides demoting what they called `` engagement bait , '' the platform has tried working with fact-checking journalists and trying out a now-defunct `` disputed news '' tag in an attempt to curb the spread of fake news . it 's been an uphill climb for facebook , but maybe by starting on the smaller , local scale , the platform can see meaningful changes and impact .
