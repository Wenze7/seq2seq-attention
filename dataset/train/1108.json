        "tottenham supporters have been pretty buoyant in the transfer tavern this week after seeing their side get their quest for fa cup glory underway with a comfortable 3-0 victory over afc wimbledon at wembley on sunday . mauricio pochettino 's men have not won a trophy since lifting the league cup back in 2008 , leaving them enduring a longer silverware drought than north london rivals arsenal did in their infamous barren spell between 2005 and 2014 . yet they got their fa cup campaign off to the perfect start on sunday as a brace from harry kane as well as jan vertonghen 's first goal in over four years secured a routine win over neal ardley 's dons , earning spurs a fourth round trip to league two outfit newport county . ",
        "subsequently , there have been many happy tottenham fans in the tavern in recent times , several of whom are likely to be further encouraged by a recent report from calcio mercato , which outlines some potentially promising comments from real madrid manager zinedine zidane regarding his january plans . the european champions have repeatedly been linked with striker kane in the last few months , what with the 24-year-old already having netted 26 goals for pochettino 's side this season , which means he is well on his way to beating last term 's impressive tally of 35 . ",
        "yet real manager zidane has recently ruled out a january move for the forward , saying : ` i do not need anyone , we have a team and some players i really believe in . ` every season there are difficult times , but we have everything to go on and we will see what happens at the end of the season , if we need to change something . ` and while a summer move is n't out of the question , these comments are sure to come as a big boost to pochettino and tottenham fans , with it likely that kane will remain a spurs player beyond the january 31 deadline . ",
        "landlord 's verdict : harry kane 's form in front of goal for tottenham in the last few years has been extraordinary , with the englishman winning the premier league 's golden boot in each of the last two seasons . and with 18 goals in just 21 league appearances this term , the 24-year-old is well on his way to doing so again , and his excellent goal-scoring exploits have unsurprisingly attracted interest from real madrid in recent times . however , manager zinedine zidane has recently stated that the spanish giants will not be looking to make any signings this month , which is sure to come as a big boost to spurs boss mauricio pochettino , even if a summer move is not out of the question . ",
        "for now though , it looks like kane will remain a tottenham player ahead of the second half of the season . tottenham fans ... what do you make of the news ? let us know !   "
