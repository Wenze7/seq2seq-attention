        "footage and images of a seemingly disinterested naby keita training for rb leipzig have fed into the growing speculation that liverpool 's pre-arranged deal to sign the guinean midfielder could be brought forward and completed this month . liverpool sealed a high profile £ 48m transfer 12 months in advance after meeting keita 's release clause , set to become active on 1st july 2018 , but suggestions of striking a deal with leipzig to make it happen sooner have never been far away . leipzig officials have regularly denied it could happen , while some over eager liverpool fans comically mistook an instagram post of keita with a ticket - it later turned out for a basketball game - as a ` hint ' that he could soon be boarding a plane to merseyside . ",
        "but in fresh reports from germany , it has been suggested that leipzig are softening their previously firm stance and may sanction an earlier deal if liverpool were prepared to pay an additional £ 13m . following on from that , bild footage on thursday morning showed a despondent looking keita as the last of the leipzig players to emerge for training . perhaps tellingly , he walked out to train where the majority of his team-mates had been running . a still image being shared on social media then showed keita sat down while others trained , with bild noting that leipzig chiefs oliver mintzlaff and ralf rangnick were also out to speak with him at one point . ",
        "whether there is anything to it , or whether there is a more innocent explanation for his behaviour remains to be seen . were keita to arrive at anfield this season , his presence would be a huge boost as the reds battle in the premier league and fa cup . he would , however , be ineligible to play in the champions league until next season after already participating in the competition in 2017/18 .
