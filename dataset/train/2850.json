        "photo credit : paul sancya/apthe orlando magic fell way behind the detroit pistons sunday afternoon , in no small part because instead of aaron gordon and evan fournier they had to start shelvin mack and mario hezonja . i know -- you are scratching your head at how either hezonja or mack could possibly start in place of gordon , a power forward . magic coach frank vogel is working with the dregs of the dregs , man . almost nothing that happens in an nba game after one team takes a 24-point lead much matters , but the magic did rip off a 19-point run in the fourth quarter to briefly make it a five-point game , and that is just enough of a pretext to appreciate draft hype cautionary tale hezonja going off for 28 points , in a real live nba game ! ",
        "probably you will see the moon grow arms and legs and dance a happy jig in the night sky before you ever see hezonja put together this kind of performance in anything like a legitimately competitive nba game , let alone a magic win . still , it 's nice to be reminded that there 's some honest-to-god basketball talent behind all of hezonja 's shrugging indifference . a couple steals , an extra pass or two , a push in transition , and a bulging crapload of above-the-break threes . once upon a time , people were really excited about this guy . ",
        "this is almost certainly hezonja 's final season in the nba . the magic -- as talent poor an nba outfit as there is -- declined the final option year on hezonja 's rookie contract , making him an unrestricted free agent after this season . maybe some teams will be willing to sniff around his potential , but salary cap space will be tight once again , and hezonja will be able to make more money , and over a longer contract , back in europe , where he has an actual track record of success . thanks for the memories , mario !
