        "five ways writers drop the ... penremember how crossing your fingers behind your back nullified while you made a promise you made ? it was a underhanded move but one recognized as fair play if pulled off successfully . as writers , we can not simply make a promise go away without any consequences . we own it to our readers to follow through on any promise we make . think of your writing as a relationship between you and the reader . you want to build trust with your readers , do n't you ? one way to do this is by keeping the story promises you make . ",
        "stories are built on promises -- steven jamesjust what kind of promise am i talking about ? think of chekhov 's gun ? -- the dramatic principle that states that every element in a story must be necessary , and irrelevant elements should be removed ; elements should not appear to make `` false promises '' by never coming into play . it 's like that but but with more depth . for instance , if you start a story by showing a neglectful airplane mechanic who leaves without fixing a major problem on an airplane then you have just made a promise to your readers that something will go wrong with the plane , presumable while it 's in the air . ",
        "if nothing happens then you have just left your readers with a feeling of un-fulfillment , and that 's not a good thing .   "
