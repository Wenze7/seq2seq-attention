        "i was close to marrying her . the last time i ever saw her was before i left to work . i got home early morning and i informed her of it . she kept telling me she did n't want to see me , etc. . i went out of my way to go see her in her house until she told me she did n't want to see me that day . i did lie to her and told her i was home . i eventually went back to my house and she saw me . she called me out on me being a liar and i explained myself . ",
        "she kept insisting i was a liar , i did n't want to see her , etc. . she broke up with me for that . i had just received the ring today as well and now dont know what to do . everywhere i go , i see her . why ? well she was always next to me wherever i went . really , anywhere . i am also reminded of her when i get home to an empty room , i think of her any time i see historic art , museums , national parks , just everything ... i miss her so much and the urge to text her overwhelms me . ",
        "like i just feel like i have to let out how i feel without her . how do i avoid this ? how do i avoid thinking of her ? i have no life but the truck and home on the weekends . i only had her . i only always looked forward to seeing her .   "
