        "a million russian artillery shells helped scientists discover the higgs boson . and all over the world , remnants of world war ii weapons are built into the most mysterious experiments in physics . in the mid-1990s , physicists needed tons of a metal strong enough to withstand the massive magnetic fields of the house-sized compact muon solenoid experiment , one of the particle detectors on the large hadron collider in geneva , switzerland . they settled on high-quality brass -- but where would they get enough of it ? although russian science was floundering during the 1990s , those russian scientists who were part of the international cms collaboration still wanted to help . ",
        "one of the scientists remembered that the brass in the tough artillery shell casements had the exact qualities that the detector needed . a russian navy commander agreed to give shells leftover from world war ii to the cms scientists , who used 600 metric tons of the brass in the experiment . the lhc turned on in 2009 , and with the cms detector 's help , ended a 50-year , many-billion-dollar search with the joint discovery of the elusive higgs boson particle in 2012 . proving the most basic laws of physics is really expensive . these days , fundamental particle-hunting experiments can cost billions of dollars , so recycling is common .

        "parts are frequently swapped between machines . magnets originally built for medical imaging machines can find their way into nuclear physics research . and sometimes , decommissioned war parts end up in some of the most important physics experiments , including several nobel prize winners that have shaped our modern understanding of how the universe works . world war ii left behind huge warships plated with steel several inches thick , material from nuclear weapons development , and other parts which scientists acquired through connections , government surplus lists , and other back channels . in many cases , the parts are free . ",
        "in the united states , war-part re-purposing commonly involved using the steel armor plating from decommissioned ships . particle physicists working during the 1960s and 1970s used metal to do just about the same thing it did for the warship : keep unwanted things out . for these experiments , that thing was background radiation . `` the physicists knew they were going to need large quantities of high-density material , '' valerie higgins , an archivist from fermi national accelerator laboratory in illinois , or fermilab , told gizmodo . `` they were looking for inexpensive ways to get that material . ",
        "they considered using used soil , or automobiles -- but steel would be a much better means of shielding . what they needed was to filter out unwanted particles . '' but more importantly , this cheap steel is thick as hell . in 1962 , american physicists leon lederman , jack steinberger , and melvin schwartz could have been one of the first teams to incorporate such a large quantity of wartime metal into their experiments at brookhaven national lab in new york . they hoped to better study neutrinos , incredibly tiny and incredibly common particles which most experiments ca n't detect because they barely interact with regular matter at all . ",
        "they 're almost like ghosts . studying the properties of such elusive particles required ingenious thinking . the physicists thought they could blast a hunk of some target metal , beryllium , with a beam of protons from the alternating gradient synchrotron experiment at brookhaven . this would result in a shower of different particles . putting the steel between the shower and their final detector would ensure only neutrinos made it through . there 's another reason wartime steel transitioned so well into particle physics , aside from cost-cutting . steel from wwii and prior is sometimes called low-background steel , since it is less radioactive than steel from after the beginning of the atomic age . ",
        "newer steel is often contaminated with radioactive cobalt , said phillip barbeau , a physicist from duke university who uses wwii-era steel in his own experiments . present-day steel still is n't very radioactive , he said , `` but it 's radioactive for the physicist who worries about the radioactivity of fingerprints or dust . '' a fermilab letter discussing the use of the warship steel in 1974 low radioactivity is crucial for particle physics research . after all , radioactivity is a property of some matter , like very heavy metals , in which they spontaneously spit out high-energy particles . ",
        "if the metal shielding is too radioactive , it might cause the experiment to detect false positives -- particles from the shielding instead of from the experiment . the special neutron beam and its battleship steel helped lederman and his team win the 1988 nobel prize . not only had they devised a whole new way of studying these elusive particles , but their ingenuity helped discover an entirely new kind , called the `` muon neutrino . '' `` leon was always amazing at finding this stuff , '' explained robert kephart , director of the illinois accelerator research center at fermilab and a former colleague of lederman 's . ",
        "`` this stuff would just appear . i do n't know exactly where he got it from . '' kephart recalled lederman acquiring a 16-inch battleship gun to filter out particles traveling at the wrong angles . one of lederman 's grad students was just small enough to slip inside . `` i 'll never have a grad student of that caliber again , '' lederman would joke . other physicists realized that they could use the thick steel plating wherever they needed to keep ambient radiation out of a detector or keep particles from escaping . through the 1970s , the national accelerator laboratory in batavia , illinois acquired many tons of this wartime steel as shielding and filters for experiments that ultimately helped discover brand new particles . ",
        "plenty of wartime vessels have made appearances in these physics experiments . lederman 's nobel-winning discovery used machined sheets from the then-decommissioned uss missouri battleship , write carlo giunti and chung kim in the fundamentals of neutrino physics and astrophysics textbook . purchase orders sent to gizmodo by fermilab reveal requests for tons of steel from heavy and light cruisers , ships like the fall river , astoria , the roanoke , and the topeka . `` it was largely the steel shielding around the water line , '' the part of the hull below the water , `` to make it much thicker so if torpedoes hit head-on , it would survive , '' explained john peoples jr. , a physicist who began at fermilab in 1971 and succeeded lederman as the lab 's director in 1989 . ",
        "a purchase order for 197 tons of warship steel during the 1970s , the energy research and development administration would notify labs like fermilab when the navy had scrapped a ship . `` armor that could be useful to fermilab is requisitioned by the fermilab research division , and erda then requests that this steel be reserved for the factory 's needs , '' according to a 1975 fermilab newsletter . fermilab eventually acquired a whole lot of the stuff . the quark-discovering tevatron collider , decommissioned in 2011 , incorporated large blocks of battleship steel in its underground particle detector , the collider detector at fermilab experiment or cdf . ",
        "they used it as a filter and even built magnets out of it . when scientists realized that they needed more shielding , they began burying entire unused steel magnets in the dirt around it . `` there were a bunch of these dipole magnets that were in inventory , '' said kephart . peoples decided that burying the magnets and keeping them in inventory was the same thing . `` ` i know where they are if i need them , ' '' kephart recalled peoples saying . `` ` they 're buried . ' they 've been underground ever since . '' ",
        "it 's not easy to move or manipulate this stuff . while it 's free , explained jonathan lewis , associate head of fermilab 's particle physics division , shipping the steel to the experiment can be quite expensive . and remember , battleships used the plating to stop torpedoes . `` it 's extremely difficult to machine , '' said barbeau at duke . `` every time i have one of the guys in the machine shop work on it , it breaks the bits . '' you have to arc weld it -- the dangerous kind of welding that requires melting the metal itself . ",
        "`` it 's very bulletproof , let 's put it that way , '' he said . others did n't have the same success using steel in their experiments . occasionally , the steel contained slightly more radioactive metal left over from the radioactive thorium-containing welding rods , explained todd hossbach , senior research physicist from pacific northwest national labs . even steel without the radioactive welding rods was more radioactive than some other options . this was especially noticeable in the experiment hossbach worked on , buried deep underground in south dakota 's homestake mine . eventually , hossbach 's team turned to specially fabricated , high-quality copper and other metals . ",
        "ultimately the decision to use steel relies on both cost and just how little background radiation the experiment requires . `` every situation is different , '' said hossbach . `` today , for our standard low-background radiation detection systems , we would typically never use pre-atomic era steel for the innermost shielding . however , it is possible to use this material in the outer shielding layers or as part of a support structure . '' steel is n't the only wartime part that makes appearances in these experiments . kephart 's experiment used beryllium left over from nuclear weapons research . ",
        "another project at fermilab used a cooling system taken from a california missile testing facility , according to another 1975 fermilab newsletter . the scientists of the neutrino-hunting team at brookhaven continued to research . steinberger moved to work at cern and still visits the lab . schwartz passed away in 2006 . leon lederman lives with his wife in idaho , but recently sold his nobel prize medal for almost $ 800,000 to help pay for his medical bills after being diagnosed with dementia . but wartime parts continue to play a crucial role in particle physics experiments , even today . ",
        "barbeau , who frequently uses strange metals in his experiments at duke , discovered tons of battleship steel behind a building on duke 's campus . several experiments at oak ridge national laboratory in tennessee incorporate the stuff . that includes the coherent experiment , which recently discovered an interaction between neutrinos and entire atomic nuclei physicists thought would be impossible to detect . and of course , there 's cms and its russian artillery shells . mysteries remain for particle physicists to solve . are there new , fundamental particles we have n't discovered ? what are the properties of the particles we already have discovered ? ",
        "why does our universe contain particles like these , with properties whose values seem too fine-tuned to be the result of random chance ? there are plans to build new , enormous colliders in japan and in china . cern proposes a successor to its current collider , the large hadron collider , that may require up to 100 kilometers , or 62 miles , of experiment and tunnel . you can bet that these experiments will feature recycled parts , some of them a peaceful sequel to their wartime function . `` it 's efficient , '' said fermilab 's lewis . ",
        "`` why would n't you do it ? ` reduce reuse recycle ... ' so we reused . ''   "
