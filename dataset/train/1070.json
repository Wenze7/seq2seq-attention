        "the continuing revelations of sexual misdeeds by prominent men is indeed a watershed moment in american life that i hope is just the beginning of an even larger transformation . bravo to sen. kirsten gillibrand , gov. andrew cuomo and others who have returned campaign contributions from those who have admitted sexual harassment . their wishing to distance themselves from reprehensible behavior is a powerful message , as far as it goes . what about the political contributions from other donors whose behavior is just as reprehensible , just in other ways ? for example , manufacturers who have lied about the safety of their products or who have fouled our air , water and earth ; or financiers whose cavalier lending and spending behavior brought the financial system , and millions of consumers , to their knees . ",
        "business and financial interests routinely escape unscathed from their misdeeds because their political contributions control the regulatory systems meant to govern them . until we have comprehensive campaign finance reform , i put this challenge to politicians : when any donor is found guilty of reprehensible behavior in any regard , the politician should give back the money . thea hoethalbany .
