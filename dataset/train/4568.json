        "wycombe wanderers 1 preston north end 5the chairboys crashed out of the fa cup as championship side preston north end gave them a pasting at adams parkwanderers may have intended to come out all guns blazing as leatherhead did in the last round , but any chance of that was ruined with less than two minutes on the clock when a josh harrop free-kick gave them a mountain to climb . gareth ainworth made three changes to the team that survived a second-half scare to beat forest green rovers on new year ` s day . marcus bean replaced dom gape , who was fit enough to make the bench . ",
        "skipper adam el-abd was back in place of will de havilland , and nathan tyson replaced mackail-smith . the big news from a wycombe point of view was scott kashket was back , only on the bench , but his return could be really timely for the remainder of the league season . preston meanwhile named a strong starting line-up as they looked to avoid a cup upset . when leatherhead visited adams park in early december they came out aggressively , ready to cause a cup upset . wycombe may have done the same , but sam saunders gave the ball away within the first minute and luke o`nien was forced into a foul on the edge of the area . ",
        "josh harrop , who scored for manchester united at old trafford on the final day of last season before leaving to play regular football despite being offered a new deal by jose mourinho , stepped up and curled one beautifully over the wall , past scott brown and into the top corner . if wycombe had intended to come out and take the game to preston , that plan was already over . preston continued to look threatening , with callum robinson unlucky not to get on the end of a dangerous through ball . ainsworth applauded the visiting supporters who sung his name . ",
        "he used to play for preston , as anyone would know from both his pre and post-match interviews . things did n`t improve for the hosts as bean and dan scarr left the ball to each other , and scott brown was called upon to deny harrop . it was one way traffic , robinson shooting over and el-abd making a brilliant tackle to stop new signing billy bodin who joined pne from bristol rovers this week . declan rudd was eventually called into action , although any of us could ` ve saved what was a tame volley from matt bloomfield . ",
        "nick freeman then fired one over the bar before brown did brilliantly again to deny robinson . then with half an hour on the clock wycombe began to work their way into the game slightly . their best move so far led to akinfenwa chesting the ball down for nick freeman whose shot was deflected wide . freeman then skipped past his man down the right and crossed for akinfenwa only for the big man ` s header back across goal to slip narrowly wide . this was better , and suddenly it felt like a cup tie . this feeling was short lived though . ",
        "a dangerous low cross was cleared brilliantly by jacobson but it only fell to alan browne who hit a sweet left footed volley past brown . for all their dominance and deserved lead , it was two wonder goals that gave preston the lead . yet , a minute before half-time it was game on . marcus bean took a legal throw , having made two foul throws previously , freeman found o`nien and the midfielder ` s deflected effort flew past rudd to reduce the deficit at the interval . ainsworth introduced de havilland at half-time in place of sam saunders who presumably was injured . ",
        "de havilland played at right-back with bean pushing into midfield . this presumably meant that gape was n`t fit enough to play as he remained sat on the bench . if the o`nien goal had given wycombe hope , it was short lived . daryl horgan slipped past de havilland before shooting . it was deflected off the hapless defender and past brown . this as good as ended the tie with preston beginning to dominate again . then , with 20 minutes remaining the highlight of the afternoon arrived . when the news came out just before 2 pm that kashket was back , it excited all wycombe fans . ",
        "he replaced bloomfield and the famous `` scotty kashket scores another goal '' rang out . this game may ` ve been over , but he was fit again and on the adams park pitch for the first time since scoring the wijnner against cambridge last may . brown was on hand to keep the score down yet again before a preston cross came in and referee peter bankes adjudged scarr to have pulled horgan and awarded a penalty . browne stepped up and fired above the dive of brown to double his tally for the afternoon and make it 4-1 . ",
        "preston strengthened further as daniel johnson and paul gallagher came on , as ainsworth introduced cowan-hall for jacobson . this meant the hosts switching to 3-5-2 with nathan tyson at left wing-back . there was still enough time for harrop to add his second and preston ` s fifth with a fine header after an excellent move from the visitors . an acrobatic kashket attempt almost made for a dream return but in truth it was comfortable for rudd as the game petered out into a very comfortable win for the visitors who progress into round four . wycombe can now focus solely on their remaining 20 league games beginning with the old enemy colchester united next saturday . ",
        "the u ` s missing the chance to go above wanderers this afternoon with a 4-1 loss at home to cheltenham . a win for coventry against premier league opposition stoke city means the planned league encounter between the chairboys and sky blues on 27th january has been postponed , giving wanderers some extra rest ahead of their visit to kenilworth road three days later to face luton . hopefully today ` s thrashing wo n`t affect the confidence of the wycombe side ahead of next week ` s match . ratings : brown 6 - he kept the score down . ",
        "bean 4 - fourth choice right-back admittedly , but at his age to not be able to take a throw on is embarrassing . scarr 5 - okay . el-abd 5 wrong game to come back to , but good to have him back ahead the league schedule . jacobson 5 - his brilliant defending before their second was a rare glimmer . o`nien 7 - best player yet again . for the last month he ` s been a class above . saunders 4 - a simple sloppy pass set the tone and we never recovered . bloomfield 4 - it took me thirty minutes to realise he was on the pitch . ",
        "freeman 5 - could never get into the game . akinfenwa 5 - marshalled well by preston . tyson 5 - pretty anonymous but put in two deliveries that were better than we ` ve seen from jacobson in recent weeks . subs : de havilland 4 - not the most convincing centre-back , and certainly not the most convincing right-back . kashket 6 - the one positive from today was him on the pitch . barely touched the ball though . cowan-hall n/a .
