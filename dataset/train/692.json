        "joe root has had much to deal with on and off the field Â© gettythe past seven weeks of joe root 's career have tested him like no other . not even on the previous ashes tour in 2013-14 when he was dropped for the final test can he have felt as much under pressure as he does now . captain of england , 3-0 down and with a team which looks out of form and underpowered , the next three weeks wo n't get any easier . as is the way with root , he tried to emphasise the positives for england at the end of the third test which england lost by an innings and 41 runs . ",
        "it may be the media training that all players are put through or it may be his generally happy disposition but he always tends to look at the glass as being half full . that 's not a criticism . it may even help ensure that this tour stays on the rails . so he said that he could n't `` fault the lads ' effort '' . england had n't , root said , `` been completely outplayed '' and have `` put up some really good performances '' in the series . they had n't left `` anything to chance '' . ",
        "there was `` no reason '' why england 's senior players , so quiet on this tour , could n't raise their games in melbourne and sydney . but you could n't hide the dejection in his face and in his voice at the end of the third test at the waca just as you could n't after the defeat in adelaide . `` it 's bitterly disappointing , '' root said . england have been beaten by the better side and the 3-0 scoreline does not flatter the home team . there have , however , in all three tests been moments when england have had the initiative . ",
        "it was the same in 2013-14 . yet in that series and this , australia have wrestled that advantage away . `` one of the most frustrating things is that we have n't been blown away , '' root said . `` we 've not be completely outplayed and we 've put up some really good performances . just not for long enough . in all three games , there have been periods where we have matched and outplayed australia . those key moments within the game , they 've really grasped those . `` root has had much to deal with on and off the field . ",
        "it started with the ben stokes incident in september and then continued with jonny bairstow 's headbutt and ben duckett 's drink throwing exploits on tour . root , in typically understated fashion , called it `` an experience '' and said he did n't want to make excuses for things which he termed `` irrelevant '' . but england 's young captain could have done without the added stress . how much this has impacted his own batting form is difficult to tell and he would n't be drawn into whether he felt angry at stokes for putting himself in a position to miss the tour . ",
        "if anything , root thought he may himself have been trying too hard during the series . `` as captain , you take a lot of responsibility , '' he said . `` you 're always learning , always finding things out about yourself and your team . that can only make me a better player and captain . `` his second innings dismissal in perth , edging a very wide ball from nathan lyon , suggested a frazzled mind . `` i 'd like to think that if he bowled me that again i 'd smash it for four , '' root said . ",
        "`` it 's been that sort of series . first innings , getting caught down the leg-side . things just have n't quite ran for me . i 've felt pretty good in the way i 've prepared . sometimes you 've just got to keep battling . it was n't a great shot to get out to . that 's how cricket goes , you 've got to take it on the chin . `` as well as his own form , the failure of england 's attack to generate movement with swing , seam or reverse swing has been another important factor in this series . ",
        "`` we certainly have n't been able to get the ball to move as much as we would have liked , '' he admitted . `` we felt like we tried every plan : different fields , bowling straight , hanging it wide , every now and again , a bit of bumper warfare . we did n't leave anything to chance . `` that is true and england 's bowlers did a lot of work with shane bond , the bowling consultant , in the build up to the series in devising a whole range of plans , particularly to smith . ",
        "not many of them have worked consistently , however , and england 's medium paced attack has looked shorn of firepower when the pitches have flattened out . root has n't had the luxury of his australian counterpart in having 90mph plus bowlers at his disposal , another key difference between the two teas . `` we 've got a very skilful , talented bowling unit and that 's probably one area where we have n't got lots of resources in , '' root added . `` you ca n't worry about that . that 's one of their strengths in these conditions and we had to try and out-skill them but we were n't able to do that in these first three games . ",
        "`` root now has a huge job on his hands with trevor bayliss . england 's tour could implode over the next three weeks with matches at the mcg and scg to come and australia on the hunt for their third 5-0 whitewash of england in eleven years . root will need his senior players to step up . for starters , alastair cook , who is averaging 13 with the bat , could do with some runs and stuart broad , 0-142 at the waca , could do with some wickets . moeen ali could do with some of both . ",
        "`` they have a huge amount of experience and they do offer a lot to this group , '' root said of his senior players . `` their performances over a long period of time speak for themselves . they 've been in situations where things have n't gone for them before and that 's why they have played so many games . there 's no reason throughout the rest of the series why they ca n't do the same again . `` it 's very important as a group that me as captain , trevor , we do n't panic , we do n't make any hasty decisions after three games which have n't gone in our favour . ",
        "we are very realistic about where we are and what 's going to be most important is that we field a team that 's going to give us the best chance of winning the next game and so forth . `` a win would do wonders for root and this england team but it is hard to see that happening given the ever increasing gulf between the two sides . this tour has the potential to get very ugly , very quickly . root will have a long and brilliant test career but the next three weeks will be some of the hardest periods of his time in an england shirt . ",
        "just as the previous seven have been .   "
