        "the u. s. government shutdown extended into this week after an attempt late sunday to strike a deal to fund bureaucrats for the next three weeks fell apart . the shutdown began midnight last friday after democrats in the senate said they could n't vote for a bill that would provide short term funding for the government over a few months without tackling larger issues like immigration . while republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and democratic leader chuck schumer work to salvage negotiations and plan to bring a short-term bill to a vote by noon on monday , many `` non-essential '' government services will remain closed .

        "sensitive sites that require supervision from park staff are likely to be closed . during the 16-day government shutdown in 2013 under the obama administration , national parks lost out on about $ 500 million from visitors being turned away and became emblematic of washington 's failures . paycheck increase delayslarger paychecks promised by the republican tax bill signed at the end of last year may also face delays as about 45,500 internal revenue service employees are sent home monday . some of the employees were working to follow through on the promise that lower income taxes in the bill would have immediate impacts in february 's paychecks . ",
