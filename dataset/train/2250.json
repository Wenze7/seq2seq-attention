        "albany -- two weeks since the state health commissioner declared flu prevalent in new york , reports of the serious virus has spiked significantly , with rates of illness in the capital region among the highest in the state . in the two-week period , the total number of flu cases reported statewide for the season more than doubled from 1,820 to 4,455 . the number of cases reported for the week ending dec. . 23 was 1,745 , a 96 percent jump over the 892 reports received the previous week . health experts have predicted that 2017-2018 could be a rough flu season , following reports of record numbers of cases this year in australia , where it is summer now and flu season has ended . ",
        "the strain of flu that caused the most harm in the southern hemisphere was h3n2 , which is now circulating here . it tends to be a fairly severe form of flu , local health experts said , but was not one of the strains in the vaccine used to protect people from the illness this year . health officials recommend getting vaccinated against the flu nonetheless . h3n2 is a strain of influenza type a , which typically spikes early in the flu season . the vaccines also include strains of influenza type b , which may circulate more broadly later in the year . ",
        "even a less effective vaccine can reduce the severity of the flu and its chance of spreading . flu symptoms are familiar enough . they include fever , chills , headache and muscle aches as well as a cough or sore throat . yet a true case of influenza can be severe , lasting a week or two and sometimes causing complications like pneumonia . thousands of americans die of the virus each year .
