        "by pinchas cohen . big jump , shaky gains . so why then is the dollar unable to maintain its gains ? one of the current president 's most anticipated fiscal policies has just moved a lot closer to becoming reality yet investors are not in agreement on the future of the usd . however , that 's not what happened . instead , after the price rose on a gap this morning , if fluctuated , making higher highs , as well as lower lows . it finally setted near the opening price . bearish high-wave candle signals lack of leadership . ",
        "this up and down movement with no actual change formed a bearish high-wave candle . such price action is typical of lack of leadership . it means that either equally divided opposing forces or fickle traders are driving this trade . this candle generally develops before a reversal . if we cross-reference the high-wave candle with other technical factors , we would notice that it also climbed above , but settled below , its uptrend line since november 7 , compounding the resistance presumed by expected supply . as well , the price just about reached the 100 dma , before it retreated , adding a third component for resistance . ",
        "finally , the greenback reached the top of its trading range since last tuesday . a divergent technical occurrence is the 50 dma that crossed above the falling 100 dma , which demonstrates that recent price data is rising relative to older price data , potentially forming an upward momentum . trading strategies . conservative traders would wait on entering a short position for a decisive downside breakout , followed by a return move to retest the pattern 's integrity , confirmed by a down day that covers the preceding up day . moderate traders may wait on a short position for a downside breakout , with the option waiting for the return move , depending their risk aversion . ",
        "aggressive traders may enter a short now , counting on the assorted technical signals : the downtrend line , the range top , the flag that 's forming and the 100 dma . a stop loss may be entered above the november 30 , 93.50 high , with a minimum target of the flag bottom of 92.75 , for a 1:2 risk-reward ratio . a target of 93.50 is required for the 1:3 risk-ratio . minimum pattern target : 91.08 . naturally , a trader may include this target price when entering a trade inside the flag , providing they can stomach the fluctuation until and during the breakout .
