        "dear god , dear god , i come to you a confused man . i come in the search of guidance and a boost of strength ; as my fears and nightmares have seemingly overshadowed and overpowered my hopes & dreams . i 'm at a loss , with a spirit that ca n't be found , who am i ? i look around for a sense of direction , can a destiny not have a purpose ? i see the hate , the injustice , inequality and ignorance and think , how can they deserve this ? none of this is god-given but rather taught by parents , who are incoherent in their role , as someone who is leaned on and looked upon as some form of an heroic figure , it just figures , how blind they 've become to the bigger picture . ",
        "who am i ? god 's biggest blessing is providing the opportunity for one to be a mother or father to a child . that child not only will one day represent the family 's name but will also be a reflection of you , & how you raised him/her , what values did you preach ? what lessons did you teach ? the characteristics you tried to implement of importance will be imprinted in him/her , as they grow . to be a proud parent will reflect on the choices a child makes as they age , the decisions , the maturity , and the character , are because of you and what 's been instilled in them . ",
        "for that , i thank my parents for providing me , with the best example , all while letting me grow , make mistakes , figure things out , be wrong , battle against them , but never for a second losing faith in me , belief in me and forever showering me with unconditional love , support , care and guidance . so , i thank god for you , and i thank you for being you . who am i ? dear god , no one can live off minimum wage . $ 10 an hour has my life feeling limited because i know me , as well as many others , are underpaid , but the system is a scam forcing us to ` sell-out ' in order to survive . ",
        "we 're not living , but barely surviving as death inches closer ... but as i 'm selfishly thinking of me and my personal , financial predicament , i know there 's those out here without a home , without water , without power , without all the necessities we , myself included , take for granted . puerto rico , due to arrogance and selfishness of a billionaire , is still struggling ; fighting to survive and we kid ourselves by thinking sending prayers and thoughts will ever be enough . people are dying and we 've become numb to it , accustomed to it , too used to it . ",
        "because as soon as you turn on the news , you see camera crews covering another story ; another murder , another travesty , another nightmare , another loss , whether child , teen , adult , it 's become just another day in the life . dear god , who am i ? as my confusion rises , my hope sinks & my dreams fade away in a blink , i wonder what 's ahead in this path for me . 23 , working , focused on that college degree , did i get the best out of this experience ? ",
        "or , was there more to seek , more to see , more to challenge myself with ? since tomorrow 's not guaranteed , if i were to die today , put everything in my life up to yesterday , did i accomplish what i set out to do ? reach all my goals , ambitions and dreams ? or has my consistent failure and inability to find my purpose , shape and define who i am ? maybe i do n't know but what i do know , is you know . i do n't come to you , for the answers to my questions and curiosities , i come to you for the guidance and direction on this path for me . ",
        "and as i 've rambled on , i now know what can be controlled is only myself , so i conclude with a goal , which is : to be a better man , a better son , a better brother & better friend than i was the previous day & to enhance the growth , each day you wake me up . this is what i can control and this is a piece of who i am .
