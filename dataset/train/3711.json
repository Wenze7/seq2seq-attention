        "dimension drive might be a familiar name to some , but unfortunately it was n't always known for the game itself . a news story broke in may 2015 about the crowdfunded project from dutch studio 2awesome , but it was for the wrong reasons . what the two man team experienced was agonisingly documented as their project was short of the required goal , only to be seemingly rescued before the relevant donation 's account was outed as fraudulent . needless to say the campaign was promptly relaunched , and the pleasing end result is that the game is now available on the nintendo switch . ",
        "turbulent history not withstanding , dimension drive is a 2d , vertically scrolling space shooter following female pilot jack , who has acquired a fragment of mysterious technology from a well travelled and all conquering alien race known as the ashajule . jack is the sole survivor of one destroyed civilisation . flying her ship - the manticore - and accompanied by on-board artificial intelligence system v. e.r. . a , they venture out on a journey to rid the universe of evil . the thing is that this technology allows space craft to shift between two inter-dimensional planes . ",
        "rather than serving solely as a plot device , the dimension shifting macguffin is important to the gameplay , too . in one respect it is easy to reminisce about old school shooter experiences like r-type or even more recent bullet hell titles like sine mora ex , as dimension drive on paper sounds like another to simply get in line - it is n't . not completely , anyway . you will be frantically dodging incoming enemy fire , avoiding structural obstacles and trying to pick up green energy blobs or other power ups . enemy ships dart around the screen , relentlessly firing in waves , spirals or circle patterns . ",
        "so far , so familiar . it would be easy to dismiss this as another generic shooter until you see a screenshot , or more specifically see it in motion . while it does invoke feelings somewhere between tension and exhilaration - like trying to pull of a perfect loop de loop to avoid a screen filling tractor beam or being involved other such intense space dog fights - dimension drive has one ace up its sleeve that sets it apart from its competitors . the hand drawn characters presented in static cutscenes - along with parallax scrolling levels - are detailed and polished , even if some obstacles are more difficult to make out as the game progresses . ",
        "the mix of crunchy guitar riffs and meandering synth soundtrack are equally accomplished . taking full advantage of 16:9 and the switch 's widescreen display , dimension drive 's battlefield is split equally into two , akin to any racing couch multiplayer , except you are in charge of both . if this brings back memories of star fox zero 's dual screen shenanigans , let it be known that while it is easier to deal with here it might require the same perseverance . by tapping b your ship will cross over from one side to the other , with the corresponding position on the other screen displayed as a small purple orb . ",
        "after a few stages you 'll earn new abilities that will allow you to shoot behind and slow your craft 's speed . each of the worlds feels distinct , but as the different sides are asymmetrical , sometimes it is difficult to distinguish structures from background when things get hectic . one misplaced or mistimed transfer will result in a spectacular , explosive end . in the early skirmishes there a couple of brutal difficulty spikes , and it might be painfully tough to get to grips with . it 's like memorising the twists and turns of a race track . ",
        "rhythmically alternating between screens to navigate laser gates , impassable architecture or weaving in and out of tight alcoves to retrieve the last power cube is integral to progressing , and this micro-management - combined with the genre 's gameplay tropes - is n't easy to master . with practice , however , there is plenty of opportunity to accumulate high scores . the reward for switching between the two planes to take out all possible enemies and gather all the power ups is not only numerical , though . dimension drive is n't a game you should be content with giving up on easily , or merely stumbling through ; that said there is a level of coordination that will frustrate or even overwhelm some . ",
        "its relentless attack patterns and environmental hazards - and demands for rapid reaction speeds - can result in satisfaction like all good shooters , and push the player to develop their skills and read the game in a new way . this certainly leads to real high points , though we should note that the broader design does n't always excel in the same way as the concept - take away the dual screen hook and it is a competent but not revolutionary shooter . in addition to the single player campaign there 's also a two player cooperative mode where two pilots can tackle levels from the main story . ",
        "for the less-skilled audience it can turn into a confusing and hilarious mix of ridiculing each other 's abilities . get better though , and it turns into an immensely gratifying synchronised experience . have you ever tried to play both sides of a splitscreen multiplayer game ? the rational answer is no , but dimension drive requires the same level of simultaneous manoeuvring in order to fully appreciate it .
