        "washington - twitter announced friday it would not block the accounts of world leaders even if their statements are `` controversial , '' citing a need to promote a `` public conversation '' on political issues . the announcement came just days after a tweet from president donald trump hinting at the use of us nuclear weapons sparked criticism that the social network was allowing threats of violence . `` twitter is here to serve and help advance the global , public conversation . elected world leaders play a critical role in that conversation because of their outsized impact on our society , '' the california-based company said in a blog post . ",
        "`` blocking a world leader from twitter or removing their controversial tweets would hide important information people should be able to see and debate . it would also not silence that leader , but it would certainly hamper necessary discussion around their words and actions . `` twitter made no specific reference to trump or his tweet this week saying he has a `` nuclear button '' which is `` bigger and more powerful '' than that of north korea 's . some activists said twitter should have banned trump and one group projected images on the company 's headquarters with a message '' @jack is #complicit , '' a reference to chief executive jack dorsey and `` ban @realdonaldtrump . ",
        "`` the group called resistance sf accused dorsey of `` endangering the world '' and violating its own rules by not banning trump . friday 's announcement comes less than a month after twitter began enforcing new rules aimed at filtering out `` hateful '' and `` abusive '' content on the social network , including messages which promote or glorify violence . twitter , which has struggled to maintain an open platform without allowing violence or hate speech , said at the time it would not cut off accounts for military or government entities . friday 's statement left open the possibility however that twitter could remove specific tweets from political leaders which violate its policies . ",
        "`` we review tweets by leaders within the political context that defines them , and enforce our rules accordingly , '' the statement said . `` no one person 's account drives twitter 's growth , or influences these decisions . we work hard to remain unbiased with the public interest in mind .
