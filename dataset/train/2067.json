        "live montreal more streams quebecers who have a severely limited capacity to work will gradually be able to access a guaranteed minimum income beginning next year , premier philippe couillard 's government announced sunday . the measure is part of a $ 3-billion action plan to fight poverty and promote `` economic inclusion , '' but falls short of offering a basic income for all quebecers , a demand of many anti-poverty groups . an estimated 84,000 quebecers would qualify for the minimum income measure , largely those with physical and intellectual disabilities . of the 84,000 , the vast majority are single people , long a neglected demographic when it comes to poverty reduction programs in quebec . ",
        "guaranteed minimum income just ` inspiration ' in new quebec government report by next year , they will see their government assistance increased by at least $ 73 per month . that figure will reach $ 440 per month by 2023 , bringing their annual guaranteed minimum to $ 18,029 . the couillard government also plans to table a bill to amend the social aid act in order to guarantee its basic income provisions . `` we can not just support employment , '' said couillard . `` employment is not the only solution to get out of poverty . ",
        "it also takes measures like the ones in front of us today . '' parti québécois leader jean-francois lisée criticized the proposed basic income measure , saying it only benefits a small portion of the population . `` we 're far from the general idea of guaranteed minimum income , '' he said . focus on the job market the government 's anti-poverty plan also proposes additional funding for existing programs , including $ 286 million for social housing projects and $ 580 million for social benefits . single quebecers who receive social benefits will see it increased by $ 180 per year by 2018 . ",
        "in 2021 , they will receive about $ 540 annually . the plan also includes $ 40 million to create more kindergarten classes in low-income areas and $ 300,000 for mental health initiatives . many of the measures announced sunday either encourage low-income quebecers to enter the job market or help them stay employed . this includes $ 1.8 million in funding to improve the digital skills of those living in poverty and nearly $ 34 million for quebecers who receive social assistance and want to learn more skills . the measures also come one year after the couillard government introduced controversial new rules that penalized social assistance recipients who failed to take steps to find a job . ",
        "the $ 3 billion in spending will be spread out over several years , with the goal of helping 100,000 quebecers out of poverty by 2023 . in quebec , an estimated 802,000 people currently live below the poverty line of $ 18,000 per year for a single person . montreal 's working poor on the rise , study finds lukewarm reception some anti-poverty activists claim the measures do n't go far enough to help low-income quebecers . serge petitclerc , the spokesperson for the collectif pour un québec sans pauvreté , said that while those who have severe limitations preventing them from working will receive support , others living in poverty are expected to find employment . ",
        "`` they 're not tackling other categories of people in social need or people living in poverty , '' said petitclerc . `` it 's as if they 're creating a division and emphasizing that division . '' basic income should also apply to all quebecers without conditions , he added . `` by limiting it to a single category of people in quebec , we 're missing the point , '' he said . `` because one of the primary characteristics of guaranteed minimum income is that it should be unconditional and it should apply to the entire population . ",
        "`` that 's not what 's happening right now . '' jean-paul faniel , co-ordinator for the table de concertation sur la faim et le développement social du montréal métropolitain , said the government 's goal `` lacks ambition . '' `` the portrait of poverty is not numbers , '' he said . `` poverty is people struggling , who are coming from pain and the misery of staying afloat . poverty is accompanied by a life of misery every day . '' $ 15 minimum wage would help women climb out poverty , quebec activists say .  "
