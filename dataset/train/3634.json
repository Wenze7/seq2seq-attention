        "the us government has been shut down : it is not working since saturday , jan 20 , as there is no financing for it . during the budget negotiations , the republicans and the democrats stumbled across the immigration issue and the questions around defense sector support . as it often happens , the discussion was very extended , and there was no time for the budget approval talks . last time , the us government was shut down in 2013 , while there were around 20 shutdowns over the last 50 years . each time this happens the dollar finds itself under pressure but then recovers rather quickly . ",
        "currently , everything depends on how much time it will take to make a decision : as soon as an agreement is achieved , the financing will be renewed . the problem is , however , that nobody can tell us when this will happen exactly . as a rule , such political debate that looks more like a show does not last long . this year , the government has to work at its best , as the success of trump 's reforms very much depends on how quickly the initiatives will be supported by the respective documents . ",
        "meanwhile , this week the ecb is meeting for the first time this year . no major decisions are expected , although it is still important to watch whether the tone will be hawkish or dovish . during the early week , eur/usd fundamentals will be centering around the us government shutdown , while later eurozone news is likely to prevail . technically , there could be seen something like parity in eur/usd , but only at first sight . both the long term and the short term eur/usd trends are ascending , with the latter having recently added momentum . ",
        "as of now , the price has surpassed the upper border of the trend channel and is testing the line that has already become support . the price is consolidating as if ready to bounce way up later . the trend aims for the current channel upper border at 1.2517 . however , the important round number of 1.2500 may prevent some traders from buying , which could lead to the price bouncing back down to 1.2250 . with a strong correction movement , the quotes may even fall to 1.1975 . eur/usd 4h chartthis article was written by dmitriy gurkovskiy , chief analyst at roboforex .
