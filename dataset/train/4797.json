        "the magnificent seven are , in the field of astronomy , not a group of gunslingers , but a group of neutron stars a few hundred parsecs from earth . they are n't near each other , spatially , but they share a number of different properties : -- they are young , and about the same age -- less than a million of years or so . -- they primarily emit x-ray radiation ; no radio signals have been detected . they are therefore termed radio-quiet ; however , there are indications they might be radio pulsars , just not pointing in our direction . ",
        "-- with the exception of rx j0420 .0 -- 5022 and rbs1556 , they have relatively similar periods of rotation , clustered from 7 to 11 seconds . one interesting member of the magnificent seven is rx j0720 .4 -- 3125 , which lies 360 parsecs from earth . what differentiates it from its six counterparts -- and from many other neutron stars in general -- are some strange , and so far unknown , changes in the x-ray spectra gathered over years of observations . while a few explanations have been proposed over the years , none are completely consistent with the available data . ",
        "the first changesthe magnificent seven were first discovered in 1997 by the rosat all-sky survey . for several , years , monitoring indicated that all of them were relatively stable ; the x-ray emission in particular was quite constant . in the two decades since , many fundamental properties have been measured or constrained , including their magnetic fields , effective temperatures , rotation periods , and radii . in 2004 , however , there came a development . data from the xmm-newton mission indicated slow changes in the intensity of emission at certain parts of the neutron star 's spectrum , between 10 and 38 angstroms . ",
        "there was an increase in flux from 10 -- 23 angstroms , and a decrease from 23 -- 38 angstroms . it was realized that rx j0720 .4 -- 3125 was no longer as stable as previously thought . vink et al. . did more monitoring using the chandra x-ray observatory . they found that the spectrum was still changing ; the change in flux above 23 angstroms had disappeared ! the authors found that the data supported a previous hypothesis : that the object was precessing , and displaying difference parts of its surface . there would thus be anisotropic luminosity . ",
        "another suggestion , that the body might have heated up due to accretion of gas was also considered but dismissed , as the overall flux was not consistent with such a change . eight years laterrx j0720 .4 -- 3125 continued to evolve . hohle et al. . analyzed long-term data from both xmm-newton and chandra , as well as previous observations noting changes in temperature and pulse profile . in the interim , the precession model remained popular , but another theory -- that the neutron star had experienced a glitch , a sudden increase in spin observed in some pulsars -- had also grown in prominence . ",
        "the authors made even further observations , using the same two telescopes . earlier scientists had suggested , based on 4.5 years of data , that the evolution was periodic , with a period of just over 7 years . hohle et al. , equipped with 12 years of data , dismissed this . over the past 7 years , the supposedly periodic changes had lessened , becoming only gradual . even longer periods seemed to be ruled out . in fact , the precession model seemed to be inconsistent with the new observations . the authors also considered the glitch hypothesis . ",
        "models indicated that , if this was true , roughly 10 to the 17th or 10 to the 18th kilograms must have been accreted in a short time . while the classical models of glitches involve a disparity in rotation between the crust and inner sections , resulting in a realignment that causes a sudden increase in spin , this glitch seemed to have been caused by an external impact ! it was possible that a small body , such as an asteroid , might have hit the neutron star ; alternatively , an accretion disk could have formed and suddenly been absorbed . ",
        "however , the glitch models required sudden changes across the object 's spectrum , and these broad flux changes were not observed . the authors proposed that activity in the magnetosphere could be the culprit . the spin behavior of rx j0270 .4 -- 3125 resembles that of magnetars , highly magnetized neutron stars . it is possible that the magnificent seven are a collection of magnetars , whose magnetic fields have decayed by an order of magnitude or so since their formation . a magnetic event could have caused the changes first seen in 2004 . future observationsthis data was taken five years ago , and the authors determined that further observations would be needed to confirm or disprove this hypothesis . ",
        "in particular , they predicted that the neutron star should return to normal around 2019 . when we get a complete , 20-year data set in a year or two , we 'll be able to get the clearest picture yet of the evolutionary history of rx j0270 .4 -- 3125 . fundamental questions may be answered : has it been accreting matter ? was it once a magnetar ? what are the implications for the origins of the magnificent seven ? all of these questions still need answers . i 'm excited to find out what they 'll be .
