        "klopp may be without two of his most important players when take on local rivals everton in the fa cup on friday . when liverpool stepped out on the pitch at turf moor on monday afternoon , they did it without philippe coutinho and mohamed salah . both were deemed unfit to play against burnley . salah had gone off limping with a tweaked ankle after scoring a brace against leicester city on saturday , and so his fitness was always in doubt . with the burnley match coming only two days after the game against leicester city , it made no sense for klopp to risk his top scorer . ",
        "in particular , memories of last year 's disastrous january collapse must surely be playing on klopp 's mind as he makes his rotation decisions . philippe coutinho , on the other hand , is either suffering from a minor thigh issue or `` suffering '' from a `` minor thigh issue '' with an eye towards another battle of wills over a potential transfer to barcelona . it seems unlikely that the club would sanction a mid-season move for one of their best players just as they look to cement their top four spot and make a deep champions league run . ",
        "but with memories of coutinho 's barca back ache over the summer fresh in everyone 's mind , the fact that he has another injury as the january window opens feels awfully convenient . either way , salah and coutinho are both doubts for friday 's derby match . about his two stars , klopp said after liverpool 's victory , `` phil are mo are injured , not massively but enough for today no chance . and a doubt , at least a doubt , for everton . '' salah was always likely to miss out or start the game from the bench . ",
        "he and sadio man√© will be making the 7,000 mile trip to ghana for the african player of the year award ceremony , for which they 've both made the shortlist . they 're set to take a private plane back to merseyside on thursday , to be ready for the game on friday . salah is the favorite to take home the award , so it appears he 'll have the freedom to celebrate his victory without a concern about playing for liverpool a day later . klopp has taken advantage of his expanded team options to heavily rotate his squad during the festive period . ",
        "in addition to salah and coutinho , the fit roberto firmino was also left out of the starting xi who took on burnley , so he should be ready for the derby . even without salah and coutinho and henderson , klopp still has a strong squad to choose from . through the beauty of the festive period , we 'll find out soon what team klopp plans to field for the big game .
