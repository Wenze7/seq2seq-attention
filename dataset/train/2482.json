        "the state 's republican lawmakers rushed to define and defend their party 's tax cut plan as it passed congress on wednesday , amidst signs the unpopular legislation will be a big issue here in the 2018 midterm elections . sen. maria cantwell , d-wash . , joined environmental and native leaders , vowing continued resistance to a backdoor provision in the tax bill designed to put oil drilling platforms , haul roads and pipelines in alaska 's arctic national wildlife refuge . `` do n't take one of the great wild pristine places in america and turn it into an oil field , '' said cantwell , a passionate refuge defender . ",
        "the last time big oil tried to drill the arctic , and use seattle and portland for staging , it was confronted by hundreds of protesters in kayaks with the message : `` shell no ! !! `` the promise of `` new economic opportunity '' by sen. lisa murkowski , r-alaska , and that drilling the refuge will `` create new wealth , '' is likely only to intensify and focus resistance ... and bring it out to this washington . the tax bill 's chief cheerleader in washington 's delegation has been rep. cathy mcmorris rodgers , r-wash . ",
        ", who chairs the house republican conference . mcmorris rodgers ' leadership job has been to come up with talking points and themes for gop lawmakers to defend the legislation . `` we are on a mission to improve peoples ' lives , '' mcmorris rodgers tweeted . `` the #taxcutsandjobsact means big things for everyday american families across this nation . relief is heading your way . `` but rep. rick larsen , d-wash . , shot back that more riches are on the way for the wealthiest americans `` at the expense of the middle class . '' ",
        "`` analysis from the tax policy center found that the top 1 percent of americans would receive an estimated 62 percent of the bill 's tax cuts : that is more than double the george w. bush-era tax cuts . mcmorris rodgers is facing a tough democratic challenge in eastern washington 's 5th congressional district . former washington state university-spokane chancellor lisa brown has raised more than $ 450,000 . as mcmorris rodgers was omnipresent on fox news touting the tax bill , brown slated a community forum wednesday night in the spokane valley , to discuss impacts in a part of washington that works hard but lags in the size of its paychecks . ",
        "democratic hopefuls in the 8th district , where gop rep. dave reichert is retiring , denounced the tax bill -- which makes corporate tax cuts permanent while cuts for individuals expire in 2027 . `` it will vastly increase income inequality in our country , explode the deficit and debt , and will do nothing to help our economy , '' said jason rittereiser , a former king county deputy prosecutor . republican dino rossi has been quiet on the tax bill , and has often seemed to be campaigning against the acrimony and lack of cooperation in a congress controlled by his own party . ",
        "the tax vote was not a distinguished valedictory for dave reichert . in a letter to house speaker paul ryan , reichert and 11 other house republicans called for arctic refuge drilling to be deleted from the tax bill . `` this threatens the home of countless animal and plant species that depend on this unique environment to survive , '' they wrote . oil from the refuge is `` not necessary , '' added the letter . drilling the refuge stayed in the bill . reichert voted for the bill on tuesday and wednesday , and tweeted the talking point themes that mcmorris rodgers has been perfecting and testing . ",
        "`` what a great christmas present , '' wrote reichert . `` it lowers tax rules . almost doubles the standard deduction . increases the child tax credit . grows wages and jobs . `` the last statement is highly debatable . at a recent ceo forum -- telecast by abc news as the bill was passed -- executives were asked to raise their hands if they planned to use tax cut money to raise employees ' wages . few hands went up , amidst embarrassed laughter . the washington delegation split on party lines . democrats lamented that they would have eagerly worked on a bipartisan tax reform deal . ",
        "the bill was worked out `` behind closed doors '' and rushed to passage without hearings , said rep. suzan delbene , d-wash . `` republicans always promise that the benefits will trickle down to working people , but they never do and they never will , '' she added . delbene is a former microsoft vice president . rep. jaime herrera beutler , r-wash . , a former aide to mcmorris rodgers , said the tax bill will benefit her southwest washington constituents . `` today , we passed historic tax cuts where the average southwest washington family of four will get to keep $ 2,385 more of what they earn , '' tweeted herrera beutler . ",
        "but two billionaire southwest washington constituents , real estate developer clyde holland and hedge fund manager kenneth fisher , will reap more riches from the tax bill . both are strong supporters of president trump . approval of the tax package has ranged from 24 percent to 35 percent in opinion polls this week . the democrats ' message on wednesday : it 's not over . as usual , the newest voice in washington 's congressional delegation , rep. pramila jayapal , d-wash . , was the most fiery . said jayapal : `` this bill 's passage has me outraged . ",
        "i will never stop organizing against the injustices coming out of this congress and this administration -- and neither should you . ''   "
