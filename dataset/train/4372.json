        "-- the trump administration will allow states for the first time to impose work requirements on medicaid recipients . the centers for medicare & medicaid services released a guidance thursday outlining what states need to do to mandate that certain medicaid enrollees work to qualify for benefits . the agency is expected to start approving state waivers promoting `` community engagement activities '' in coming weeks . the historic move would be a significant change in how the government health insurance program operates and would fulfill a longtime republican goal . states , for instance , could require non-disabled , working age recipients to work , volunteer , go to school or enter a job training program . ",
        "the guidance also includes caregiving as one of the activities . `` medicaid needs to be more flexible so that states can best address the needs of this population . our fundamental goal is to make a positive and lasting difference in the health and wellness of our beneficiaries , and today 's announcement is a step in that direction , '' said seema verma , the agency 's administrator . critics , however , argue that republicans are using work requirements to thin the medicaid rolls . they fear many recipients will be unable to meet the mandate and be left uninsured . ",
        "the work requirements will likely be challenged in court . in its guidance , cms pointed to studies that show working and volunteering can contribute to better health as justification that the requirement is in keeping with medicaid 's mission . the agency 's guidance provides states with a lot of flexibility in designing their programs and highlights that many recipients may need additional considerations . for instance , the guidance notes that some medicaid recipients may have trouble meeting these requirements because of poor health , substance abuse or high unemployment in their areas . states should take these issues -- as well as recipients ' employability -- into consideration and allow for modifications or exemptions , the agency said . ",
        "pregnant women will also be exempt . the agency specifically calls out the opioid epidemic , saying that time spent in treatment can count towards the mandate and those in intensive recovery programs can be excused . many governors , including republican ones , have defended the medicaid program as being critical to addressing the substance abuse crisis . id = `` wpcom-iframe-45165177a4bc22cd8c22bba5fff2025b-5a57a0279e031 `` frameborder = `` 0 `` scrolling = `` no `` webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen class = `` wpcom-protected-iframe `` states will be required to describe strategies to assist recipients in meeting the requirements and to link them to job training and support resources , including child care and transportation . ",
        "however , they will not be allowed to use federal medicaid funding to finance these services . the agency is encouraging states to align their medicaid work requirements with those mandated by other federal safety net programs . recipients who meet the work requirements in the supplemental nutrition assistance program , commonly known as food stamps , and by the temporary assistance for needy families , must be considered in compliance with their state 's medicaid rules . republicans have long wanted to add work requirements to the medicaid program , which covers nearly 75 million low-income children , adults , elderly and disabled americans . ",
        "the broadening of medicaid to low-income adults under obamacare -- roughly 11 million have gained coverage under the health reform law 's medicaid expansion provision -- further spurred gop efforts . however , the obama administration did not approve any state waivers that would impose work mandates , saying it was not in keeping with the program 's mission to provide access to medical services . consumer advocates and health policy experts fear that such a requirement could prove a big hurdle for many recipients , leaving them without the care they need . the trump administration swiftly signaled that it held a different view . ",
        "verma , sent a letter to governors hours after after she was confirmed in march urging them to apply for such waivers . related : trump administration open to making some medicaid recipients work , pay premiums `` one of the things that states have told us time and time again is that they want more flexibility to engage their working-age , able-bodied citizens on medicaid , '' verma told a conference of state medicaid directors in november . `` they want to develop programs that will help them break the chains of poverty and live up to their fullest potential . ",
        "we support this . '' the guidance release thursday pointed to several studies that said unemployment is harmful to one 's health and can prompt higher rates of hospital admission and death , as well as poorer general and mental health . ten states -- arizona , arkansas , indiana , kansas , kentucky , maine , new hampshire , north carolina , utah and wisconsin -- have submitted waivers that include work or community engagement requirements , according to the agency . south dakota 's governor said in his state of the state address tuesday that he would also look to require certain recipients to work . ",
        "verma , who served as a medicaid consultant for indiana and kentucky before joining the trump administration , has long advocated for work requirements . now , she is in a position to approve them . `` for the future of our country , we need all americans to be active participants in their communities , '' she said in november . `` believing that community engagement requirements do not support or promote the objectives of medicaid is a tragic example of the soft bigotry of low expectations consistently espoused by the prior administration . those days are over . '' ",
        "related : millions of medicaid recipients already workmany medicaid recipients are already employed . some 60 % of non-disabled , working-age adults have jobs , while nearly 80 % live in families with at least one member in the labor force , according to a kaiser family foundation analysis . most of those who do n't work cite illness , disability or family obligations as the reason . the work requirements will likely have an impact on a broad number of adults . many medicaid enrollees may have physical or mental health problems -- such as arthritis or asthma -- that do n't meet the criteria for federal disability programs , but still interfere with their ability to work , kaiser said . ",
        "they could find it difficult to apply for exempt status and verify it , which may need to be done monthly in some states , while those who are working may have a hard time verifying their hours , especially if they have variable shifts . plus , state medicaid agencies wo n't get any additional federal funding to help recipients find and hold jobs , even though they are generally not equipped to develop , provide , and administer work support programs , said marybeth musumeci , associate director of kaiser 's program on medicaid and the uninsured . ",
        "`` the new will penalize individuals by having them lose health coverage , rather than incentivize them , as a voluntary program with adequately funded supportive services necessary to overcome barriers , would , '' she said . the-cnn-wire & Â© 2018 cable news network , inc. , a time warner company . all rights reserved .
