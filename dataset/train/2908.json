        "winter program to focus on growing the shallow , high-grade r1515w zone and accelerating progress of triple r deposit towards pfskelowna , british columbia -- - fission uranium corp. . is pleased to announce preparations have begun for a $ 9.4 m winter work program at its award-winning pls project in canada 's athabasca basin . the 31 hole program will focus on two core goals : growth of the recently-discovered , high-grade r1515w zone and accelerating progress towards the pre-feasibility study `` pfs '' , which is a key milestone for potential eventual production at pls. . fission has retained roscoe postle associated inc. .

        "growing the high-grade , near-surface , land-based r1515w zone : eight holes will focus on further expansion of the recently-discovered , high-grade , shallow and land-based r1515w zone . the land-based r1515w is the westernmost zone on the 3.18 km trend outlined by fission as the company pushes west from the triple r deposit , towards the large , high-grade boulder field .   ",
        "drill results on the r1515w zone have been very encouraging to date , and include results such as hole pls17-564 , located 1.4 km west of the triple r deposit , which intersected 128.0 m of total composite mineralization , including intervals such as 7.0 m @ 6.90 % u3o8 in 14.50 m @ 3.39 % u3o8 and 7.0 m @ 6.36 % u3o8 in 10.50 m @ 4.35 % u3o8.the r1515w exhibits some important geological characteristics similar to the r780e zone , such as multiple stacked lenses , which can be a component of wide , high-grade mineralizationaccelerating progress towards pre-feasibility study : 23 holes will continue to advance the resource development of the triple r deposit to pfs level .",

",
        "the uniquely near-surface , high-grade mineralization at pls allows us to pursue multiple goals simultaneously . we will also be targeting further growth of r1515w - the exciting land-based zone , over 1.4 km west of the triple r , which has several similar characteristics to the r780e zone , and has delivered the widest intervals of mineralization outside of our deposit . `` pls mineralized trend & triple r deposit summaryuranium mineralization at pls occurs within the patterson lake conductive corridor and has been traced by core drilling approximately 3.18 km of east-west strike length in five separated mineralized `` zones '' . ",
        "from west to east , these zones are : r1515w , r840w , r00e , r780e and r1620e . thus far only the r00e and r780e have been included in the triple r deposit resource estimate , where-as the r840w and r1620e zones and the recent addition of the r1515w zone , fall outside of the current resource estimate window . the discovery hole of what is now referred to as the triple r uranium deposit was announced on november 05 , 2012 with drill hole pls12-022 , from what is considered part of the r00e zone . through successful exploration programs completed to date , it has evolved into a large , near surface , basement hosted , structurally controlled high-grade uranium deposit . ",
        "the triple r deposit consists of the r00e zone on the western side and the much larger r780e zone further on strike to the east . within the deposit , the r00e and r780e zones have an overall combined strike length validated by a resource estimate of approximately 1.05 km with the r00e measuring approximately 105m in strike length and the r780e zones measuring approximately 945m in strike length . a 225m gap separates the r00e zone to the west and the r780e zones to the east , though sporadic narrow , weakly mineralized intervals from drill holes within this gap suggest the potential for further significant mineralization in this area . ",
        "the r780e zone is located beneath patterson lake which is approximately six metres deep in the area of the deposit . the entire triple r deposit is covered by approximately 50m to 60m of overburden . mineralization remains open along strike in both the western and eastern directions . basement rocks within the mineralized trend are identified primarily as mafic volcanic rocks with varying degrees of alteration . mineralization is both located within and associated with mafic volcanic intrusives with varying degrees of silicification , metasomatic mineral assemblages and hydrothermal graphite . the graphitic sequences are , associated with the pl-3b basement electro-magnetic conductor . ",
        "the r840w zone , located 495m west along strike of the triple r deposit , now has a defined strike length of 465m and is still open . the recent discovery of the high-grade r1515w zone located a further 510m to the west of the r840w zone , now has a defined strike length of 71m and an across-strike lateral width of up to 64m with vertical extension up to 171m . mineralization is open . the r840w and r1515w zones have significantly upgraded the prospectivity for further growth on land to the west of the triple r deposit within the patterson lake corridor . ",
        "the recently discovered high-grade mineralization in the r1620e zone , located 210m to the east along strike similarly has significantly upgraded the prospectivity for further growth of the pls resource to the east of the triple r deposit . updated maps and files can be found on the company 's website at lake south propertythe 31,039 hectare pls project is 100 % owned and operated by fission uranium corp. . pls is accessible by road with primary access from all-weather highway 955 , which runs north to the former cluff lake mine and passes through the nearby uex-areva shea creek discoveries located 50 km to the north , currently under active exploration and development .
