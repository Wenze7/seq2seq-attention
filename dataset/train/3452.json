        "we are using fossil fuels for almost all our energy needs , result of which is depleting fossil fuels bank and an increase in the carbon footprint of this planet which calls for unsustainable environmental conditions . so what is the solution to above problems ? how can we build a more sustainable and long term energy ecosystem plans besides those which involve fossil fuels ? an energy plan which satisfy all parameters such as sustainability , feasibility and accessibility . the answer to all the above worries is solar ! yes ! you heard it right . sun and its energy is the most abundant source of energy available to us for our use and we still underrate it .

        "indeed its ' a fact that if we switch to solar completely we wo n't have to be dependent on any other fossil fuel for energy generation . delhi has a huge market for solar panels for home and has great scope to incorporate solar power . if delhi goes solar completely or even if manages to achieve 60 % percent of it , it will not only manage to put an end to power cut woes but also help reduce in pollution to great extent . solar power is one of the cleanest sources of energy and is something available in abundance .

        "going solar for delhi is beneficial in every aspect . in recent years delhi 's lifestyle has taken a major shift . people in delhi prefer to live in gated societies and apartments rather than private houses . also one of the major reasons behind the rise in flat culture is the space crunch in delhi . this calls for yet another revolution that of green and sustainable buildings to take place . and in this revolution going solar can help in a long way , after all what better can it be than that a building producing its own energy and electricity and hence becoming self sustainable .

        "with solar subsidy schemes and availability of various finance option has made getting solar panel more affordable . govt . of delhi is focusing a lot to curb pollution from the streets and has made schemes easy for residents who want to go solar . with technological advancements part of solar panels have become a lot cheaper and their efficiency has increased massively . the payback period of solar panels have been reduced to 5 -- 7 years . hence possibilities are many , ways are a plenty and ideas infinite . all it needs some planning and proper execution to go solar .
