        "a roman catholic priest in wisconsin says he feels `` liberated '' after coming out to his church -- and the world -- as a gay man . the rev. gregory greiten , who serves as the pastor of milwaukee 's st. bernadette parish , received a standing ovation when he opened up about his sexuality to his parishioners this past sunday . `` i am greg . i am a roman catholic priest , '' he reportedly told the congregation . `` and , yes , i am gay ! '' greiten further detailed his journey toward self-acceptance in a lengthy column published in the national catholic reporter on monday . ",
        "`` a few roman catholic priests around the world have mustered up the courage to break through the wall of silence and speak the truth about their sexual identity , '' he wrote . `` i pledge to you that i will no longer live my life in the shadows of secrecy . i promise to be my authentically gay self . i will embrace the person that god created me to be . '' he continued : this fire burning deep inside my heart , i will no longer contain . i will not be silent any longer ; the price to pay is way too great . ",
        "i must speak my truth . i have lived far too many years chained up and imprisoned in the closet behind walls of shame , trauma and abuse because of the homophobia and discrimination so prevalent in my church and the world . but rather , today , i chart a new course in freedom and in integrity knowing that there is nothing that anyone can do to hurt or destroy my spirit any longer . first steps in accepting and loving the person god created me to be . greiten , of course , is not alone . although most surveys are based on limited samples due to the sensitivity of the issue , more recent estimates have put the share of catholic priests in the u. s. identifying as gay between 15 percent and 50 percent . ",
        "despite the applause greiten received sunday , churchgoers seemed divided over the implications of his announcement . madge powell , a parishioner at st. bernadette 's for eight years , told the national catholic reporter that she could n't care less about greiten 's sexuality . `` i love him for the person he is , '' she said . shawn govern , who is opposed to same-sex marriage , took a more tentative stance . `` he made a choice to walk in christ 's shoes , '' govern said , `` because he 's not going to be accepted by everyone . '' ",
        "for his part , greiten said his decision to come out was very much a personal choice . `` the difference for me now is i get to live a life that 's open , '' he told local nbc affiliate tmj 4 . `` it is honest and it 's full of integrity , and that 's what 's most important to me . '' whether greiten will face any church-based repercussions will depend on milwaukee 's archbishop jerome listecki . in a statement released to the milwaukee journal sentinel on monday , listecki seemed supportive of greiten 's announcement and confirmed that the two had met beforehand . ",
        "`` we support father greiten in his own , personal journey and telling his story of coming to understand and live with his sexual orientation , '' listecki wrote . `` as the church teaches , those with same-sex attraction must be treated with understanding and compassion , '' he added . `` as priests who have made a promise to celibacy , we know that every week there are people in our pews who struggle with the question of homosexuality .
