        "by ernie palladinoin one move , brian cashman minimized all the questions about aaron boone 's lack of experience . that does n't matter now . in landing giancarlo stanton , cashman effectively turned his rookie skipper into a push-button manager . or as close as it gets in this era of analytics and soft-love player communication , anyway . boone will still have to deal with certain lineup and rotation decisions . but for the most part , he now takes over a team that is world series ready thanks to the generosity of its old shortstop , derek jeter . ",
        "the funneling north of the nl mvp for starlin castro and a couple of low-level prospects by the marlins ' new co-owner desperate to free up dough for his debt-ridden franchise may only the beginning of a talent pipeline reminiscent of the one that brought roger maris and others from the kansas city athletics in the early 1960s . but regardless of who comes in the future , getting stanton and his 59 homers is the move that should set up the yanks to storm the american league . boone need only to run out his lineup every day and watch the balls fly . ",
        "analytics ? put the binders aside . the only numbers boone needs to heed now are 59 , 52 , 33 , 25 , and 21 . those were the 2017 home run totals for stanton , aaron judge , gary sanchez , didi gregorius , and brett gardner . and they do n't even take in the numbers greg bird is expected to produce provided his repaired ankle and late-season progress continue on their current paths . what pitcher in his right mind wants to face a lineup that reads gardner , judge , sanchez , stanton , bird , gregorius ? ",
        "there 's not a weak spot until it gets to the bottom three of chase headley , and gleyber torres , the super-rookie expected to replace castro at second , and whoever takes jacoby ellsbury 's place if cashman succeeds in unloading him during the winter meetings this week . stanton and judge alone have gotten people talking about a new addition of the `` m&m boys '' -- mantle and maris -- but the top of the 2018 lineup would spell out an entire acronym if not for want of a vowel or two . as with anything , there are concerns . ",
        "the 28-year-old stanton has endured several trips to the disabled list in his career . he missed 88 games in 2015 from swinging too hard at a pitch , and lost the last 17 games of 2014 when he took a pitch in the face . other lengthy absences happened in 2011 , ' 12 , and ' 13 . but stanton did play in all but three games last year . if his health holds , boone 's biggest problem may involve when to rotate him between the outfield and dh . then there 's the strikeouts . he finished among the top 10 in three of his eight seasons . ",
        "last year 's 163 ranked seventh . and with judge 's league-leading 208 , that scares the dickens out of some folks . it should n't . homers and strikeouts are the name of the game now . with everybody upper-cutting for the long ball , the `` golden sombrero '' has gone from shameful to merely an occupational hazard . for boone 's purposes , it 's better to strike out than have a dp take his team out of a possible three-run shot . forget about hitting and running . no need to steal , not that that was a big part of the yanks ' offensive philosophy to begin with . ",
        "but station-to-station ball has never looked so good in the bronx . on the business end , picking up the remaining 10 years , $ 295 million will make it hard , but not impossible , to stay under baseball 's $ 197 million luxury tax threshold . no matter . summoning the ghosts of babe ruth 's `` murderer 's row '' and the `` m&m boys '' easily trumped any financial considerations . in fact , it became a fine investment not only for the offense , but also for a rookie manager who does n't need a mountain of pre-game moves to clutter up his thinking . ",
        "for boone , it at least starts with pushing buttons . set that monstrous top six , fiddle with the bottom three , run them out there , and watch them destroy the ballpark . pitching ? that 's a discussion for another day .   "
