        "hull city are planning to step up their pursuit of highly-rated aberdeen defender scott mckenna this week as nigel adkins seeks a timely breakthrough in the january transfer window . city 's opening offer for mckenna was rejected saturday and a second bid turned down yesterday , with the spl side adamant their centre-back would not be leaving pittodrie this month . that stance is unlikely to deter the tigers , however , as they look to bolster a defensive line desperately short on numbers for next season . mckenna , 21 , has been identified as a hot prospect after breaking into aberdeen 's first team this season and city are not yet willing to look elsewhere in their quest to sign a new central defender ahead of the transfer deadline in just over two weeks . ",
        "adkins has made it clear he is planning for the long-term in his recruitment drive this month and admitted on saturday that mckenna `` had a big future in front of him '' . city are also tracking several wingers to strengthen their attacking options , but have so far met with frustrations during a window that has yet to see the tigers do any business in or out of the club . saturday 's 0-0 draw at home to reading kept city firmly in relegation trouble , a point above the bottom three ahead of travelling to sunderland this weekend , but adkins intends to keep a measured outlook in the second half of the window . ",
        "`` there 's a bid on the table and there 's several things we 're doing behind the scenes , '' he said . `` i 'm very happy with this group of players but we 've got an opportunity to bring in the players we feel can improve us . i do n't want to sign someone just for the sake of it . `` that 's maybe why some clubs find themselves in certain situations and taken someone they might not need at that moment in time . `` we wo n't panic . we need to bring in a couple of players and we 're working very hard to do that . ",
        "`` it 's been highlighted that bids are on the table and we believe we 're looking in the right areas for players we need to strengthen . `` time will tell if we can do that but the budgets have got to be right . the players have got to want to come as well . `` maybe a player you look to target will think ` maybe i can go and join this football club as i can get promotion to the premier league now ' rather than going to hull city at the wrong end of the table . ",
        "it 's a balance and finances can dictate that . '' mckenna is part of an aberdeen squad due to return from a warm-weather training camp in dubai today . the 21-year-old has previously spent time on loan with ayr and alloa but has blossomed with his hometown club in the spl this season . dons manager derek mcinnes does not intend to lose any of his players this month as they sit second in the table in between celtic and rangers , but an increased offer from city would test that resolve .
