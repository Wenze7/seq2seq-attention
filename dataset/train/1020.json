        "lg kicked off its ces press conference monday , january 8 , with a slew of smart home announcements , but it was the mishap of cloi the camera-shy robot that threatened to steal the show . lg ` s cute cloi smart home robot , perched atop a small table , was supposed to help vice president of marketing david vanderwaal figure out the best setting to wash clothes and help find a recipe on lg 's premiere instaview thinkq refrigerator . instead , all he got was a shy robot which -- after initially engaging with vanderwaal -- did not respond . ",
        "the robot continued to blink but otherwise remained mute , leaving awkward pauses in the presentation while the audience waited for its reply . vanderwaal took the mishap in stride by tapping the screen of the fridge directly to continue his demonstration . `` even robots have bad days , '' vanderwaal quipped to some awkward laughter from the audience . cloi , a curvy little countertop smart hub robot device , is about a foot tall with a head and a screen face that blinks . it is supposed to work like a smart hub for lg 's thinkq smart home platform , controlling things like air purifiers and washers and dryers . ",
        "the device is also supposed to help , among other things , find recipes to cook based on ingredients in your thinkq fridge and help you automatically preheat the oven when you have made your recipe choice . it debuted at ces 2017 , but there is no current release date or price for the public . in addition to announcing smart home appliances at the press conference such as the lg styler , a de-wrinkling closet-like device that steams your clothes , and the lg thinkq sidekick washer and dryer , lg solidified its footing in the robot market by debuting three other concept robots for commercial uses at restaurants , airports , and hotels . ",
        "a serving robot features a tray and will serve food and other products . the porter robot will be able to carry luggage and assist with check in and check out at hotels , and the shopping robot includes a bar code reader that scans in products when you place them into the robot 's shopping bin . a multilingual airport robot is currently being tested at south korea 's incheon international airport and is designed to assist travelers by giving information about flights . editors ' recommendations .
