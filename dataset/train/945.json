        "lyft has finally opened up concierge to businesses and organizations of all sizes . the program allows members to hail rides for other people , giving companies a way to offer that extra touch of service to customers , especially those who ca n't call for a ride themselves due to one thing or another . concierge launched in 2016 when lyft teamed up with the national medtrans network in new york city -- the perfect place to start , since most residents do n't have cars -- to take patients to the doctor . after a while , lyft forged partnerships with more companies , including jetblue , caremore and gogograndparent . ",
        "jetblue , for instance , can call a lyft to offer their passengers or crew a seamless journey , while gogograndparent can hail a ride for the seniors who call their number on a landline . rotor zen , a san diego-based helicopter tour operator , also uses the service to get guests from hotels and to drive them back after their tour . now , concierge is open to any company , so long as they sign up for a lyft business account and add a payment method . they can hail almost any type of lyft ride for employees and clients alike . ",
        "it 's worth taking note , however , that the companies will be able to track passengers ' journeys in real time . that 's ideal for businesses like gogograndparent , so they can track their elderly customers . but those who do n't appreciate being watched by their employers might want to call a ride on their own and just ask for reimbursement . lyftthis article originally appeared on engadget at .
