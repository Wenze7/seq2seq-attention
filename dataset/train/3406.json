        "north korea contacted authorities in seoul over a hotline for the first time in about two years , paving the way for a thaw during the winter olympics despite president donald trump 's fresh taunts at kim jong un . officials from both countries spoke several times wednesday to conduct technical checks before agreeing to stop for the day , according to lee yeon-du , an official with south korea 's unification ministry . president moon jae-in has proposed holding talks jan. . 9 at the border village of panmunjom , which would be the first formal gathering between the two sides since 2015 . ",
        "the move shows further progress after kim called for improved relations with south korea in a new year 's day address . tensions over north korea 's nuclear program had threatened to hang over the games in pyeongchang , a city about 50 miles from the border dividing the korean peninsula . the detente between the two koreas progressed even as trump continued a war of words with kim , who warned monday that the nuclear button is `` always on my desk . '' the president responded tuesday night , saying on twitter that he had `` a much bigger & more powerful one than his , and my button works ! '' ",
        "` reckless , juvenile ' while defense analysts believe kim has as many as 60 nuclear bombs and missiles that can reach washington , doubts remain over north korea 's ability to miniaturize a warhead and deliver it safely across the pacific . trump has codes to launch as many as 800 nuclear missiles in 10 minutes , said daryl kimball , executive director of the washington-based arms control association . `` trump 's reckless , juvenile twitter taunts and threats against the nuclear-armed north korean regime diminish u. s. credibility and increase risk of miscalculation that could lead to a catastrophic war , '' kimball said by email . ",
        "the president has expressed doubts about kim 's pre-olympics overtures , with an administration official saying north korea is aiming to drive a wedge in the u. s.-south korean alliance . the u. s. wants to avoid anything that might undermine its pressure campaign of sanctions and military threats to halt kim 's nuclear program . `` we are very skeptical of kim jong un 's sincerity in sitting down and having talks , '' state department spokeswoman heather nauert told reporters in washington . white house press secretary sarah sanders said `` our policy has n't changed at all . '' ",
        "` watertight ' cooperation . south korean foreign minister kang kyung-wha spoke by phone with u. s. secretary of state rex tillerson to discuss recent developments regarding north korea . the officials reaffirmed their commitment to a peaceful and diplomatic resolution of the north korean nuclear issue through `` watertight '' cooperation , south korea 's foreign ministry said on wednesday . a trump administration official said that the u. s. was in close touch with south korea on a unified response to north korea . the u. s. has about 30,000 troops in south korea and provides a nuclear deterrent . ",
        "following kim 's call on wednesday to reopen the hotline between the countries , several stocks connected with north korea gained . j. estina co. , a jewelry and accessory maker , jumped 5.1 percent . its factory in the jointly run gaeseong industrial park has been closed for almost two years . moon sparred with trump last year over offers of dialogue to north korea , and has repeatedly sought to reassure his citizens that he 's doing everything to prevent a war . he has long pushed for north korea to attend the olympics . ` honest attitude ' ",
        "besides discussing the olympics , south korea is looking to improve overall relations with north korea during the discussions . while kim might seek an easing of sanctions and the cancellation of joint military exercises between the u. s. and south korea , analysts said easier measures would include humanitarian assistance and reuniting separated families . earlier on wednesday , kim welcomed moon 's follow-up steps for talks between the two countries in a statement on the korean central news agency that included none of the usual insults that north korea has often used to describe its southern neighbor . ",
        "`` we will try to keep close communications with the south korean side from sincere stand and honest attitude , true to the intention of our supreme leadership , and deal with the practical matters related to the dispatch of our delegation , '' kcna said . it called the talks `` the first meaningful and good step for improved north-south relations .
