        "the collection is a short documentary by adam roffman that chronicles a unique piece of hollywood history : tens of thousands of plates and blocks used to create the newspaper advertisements used for nearly every film that hit theaters before the 1980s . the documentary explains that two friends , dj ginsberg and marilyn wagner discovered and purchased the collection from an antique store in nebraska in 1999 . it contains nearly 60,000 blocks and plates used to print advertisements for newspapers through the 1980s . as publishers shifted to other types of printing -- such as offset and digital printing -- around that time , the nebraska manufacturer responsible for making the plates and blocks went out of business . ",
        "image : adam roffman . in 1984 , an antique store purchased the company 's entire inventory . the collection sat in storage for 15 years before ginsberg and wagner purchased it , and when they had it appraised in 2015 , they found that it was worth between $ 8 and $ 12 million . it 's now for sale . ginsberg says that they 've spent the last 17 years working to catalog and restore the collection to its original condition , which dates back to the beginnings of the film industry . the collection includes blocks used for films as 2001 : a space odyssey , blade runner , star wars , planet of the apes , and many others . ",
        "wagner says that `` we just feel that these blocks are just too beautiful and too important not to be seen , '' and that they hope that the entire collection will end up in a museum for movie fans to appreciate . looks pretty damn interesting . i 'm left wondering if they should really be cleaning them and striking them after watching the preview . i mean , obviously , they were meant to be used , but does cleaning and striking some of them take away from their value ? guess i 'll have to watch it and see if they cover that lol .

        "by bla1ze . on 01.07.18 2:00 pm . seems like it would be straight forward to `` scan '' the plates and cnc new plates for actual use . could make quite a bit simply selling reprints of some . by templarian . on 01.07.18 2:13 pm . i think you 're right but at the end of the day this collection could have easily ended up in a landfill so best to take them in whatever condition they 're in , some could even argue some wear is part of the charm of such original pieces . it does rather make current poster/advertising design look a little uninspired .
