        "the msnbc host is under fire for a quip made off-camera before interview with the former presidential candidatelongtime msnbc fixture chris matthews apologized on friday after a video was published of him making a joke about raping former democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton . matthews made his misjudged , ugly attempt at humor as he and his camera crew prepared to interview clinton at a campaign event on jan. . 5 , 2016 in iowa . as his `` hardball '' staff worked to get things ready , a jovial matthews mocked clinton as he requested a drink . `` can i have some of the queen 's waters ? ",
        "precious waters ? '' he asked . `` where 's that bill cosby pill i brought with me ? '' matthews said as a staffer poured him the beverage . impressed with himself , the msnbc host guffawed at his horrible joke for several seconds . at the time , the veteran comedian cosby had been accused by numerous women of date rape through drugging their drinks . `` this was a terrible comment i made in poor taste during the height of the bill cosby headlines , `` matthews said after new york magazine writer noreen malone confronted him with the clip . ",
        "`` i realize that 's no excuse . i deeply regret it and i 'm sorry . `` matthews has provoked controversy before for his treatment of women , including a 2007 incident when he sexually harassed then-cnbc anchor erin burnett on his program , calling her `` beautiful , '' a `` knock-out , '' and urged her to lean in closer to the camera so he could leer at her : in 1999 , msnbc had to give a $ 40,000 payout to a woman to whom matthews had repeatedly sexually harassed . matthews also frequently questioned clinton 's ability to be the president and even grabbed her cheek on the air once after an interview . ",
        "he also , as the progressive watchdog media matters reported , has a long history of making unprofessional remarks to women about their appearance , sometimes even trying to flirt with them . during the july 24 , 2007 edition of `` hardball , '' matthews referred to three women who had starred in political parody song videos as `` these gorgeous creatures of god . '' as he interviewed them , he warned them that `` you 're giving me the peepers . . . be careful with the advances you are making with your eyes right now . ",
        "i 'm not a casting agent . `` on his sept. . 12 , 2007 `` hardball '' program , matthews repeatedly flattered future fox news anchor laura ingraham . `` you are -- i 'm not allowed to say this , but i 'll say it -- you 're beautiful and you 're smart . and you 've got a huge radio audience , '' he said . later on in the program he continued : `` can i sing your praises ? . . . i get in trouble for this , but you 're great looking , obviously . ",
        "you 're one of the gods ' gifts to men in this country . but also , you are a hell of a writer . `` in a 1999 interview with gennifer flowers , the woman who reportedly had an affair with former president bill clinton while he was governor of arkansas , matthews repeatedly referred to her appearance . `` i got ta pay a little tribute here . you 're a very beautiful woman , and i -- and i have to tell you , he knows that , you know that , and everybody watching knows that ; hillary clinton knows that . ",
        "how can a woman put up with a relationship between her husband and somebody , anybody , but especially somebody like you that 's a knockout ? i do n't quite get this relationship . '' after flowers replied , `` gosh , you make me blush here , '' matthews added : `` t 's an objective statement , gennifer . i 'm not flirting . `` jennifer palmieri , clinton 's former communications director said viewing matthews ' remarks about clinton `` makes me feel ill . `` in light of the huge momentum of the #metoo movement to empower women who have experienced sexual harassment and the dismissal of major nbc universal personalities due to misconduct allegations -- matt lauer and mark halperin in particular -- the revelations come at a difficult time for the media giant , something that may perhaps precipitate serious consequences for matthews . ",
        "matthews is not the first on-air staffer to have made a sexist joke at the expense of clinton . in 2008 , then-reporter david shuster was fired after he accused clinton of having `` pimped out '' her daughter chelsea .   "
