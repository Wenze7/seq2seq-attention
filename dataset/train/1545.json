        "in the town of kabasalan in zamboanga , dozens of families huddled in the homes of neighbours on christmas eve , two days after floods carried off 40 houses , killing three people with one missing , said local civil defence chief junalyn maravillo . `` this is a disaster . they do n't think about christmas . all they think about is what they will eat for today , '' she told afp . pope francis said in rome he was praying for storm victims in the philippines , where some 80 percent of the population is catholic .
