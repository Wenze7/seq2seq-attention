        "the cleveland browns have several roster decisions to make for 2018 , none more important than at the quarterback position . the cleveland browns are embarking on yet another one of their `` most important off seasons ever '' as they start yet another rebuilding project . but unlike their past attempts to turn themselves into an actual nfl franchise , this rebuild is taking on a different look and feel . because of the work that executive vice president of football operations sashi brown did before he was fired in december , there is a solid foundation for general manager john dorsey to build on . ",
        "in addition to sound offensive and defensive lines , along with young , promising players at tight end , linebacker and in the secondary , dorsey has somewhere north of $ 100 million in cap space at his disposal , along with 12 selections in the 2018 nfl draft -- including picks no . 1 and no . 4 in the first round , plus another three selections in the second round . dorsey needs to hold onto some of that cap space to start resigning players nearing the end of their rookie deals , running back duke johnson and linebacker christian kirksey come to mind , but the cap dollars , draft picks and unwritten nfl rule that a new general manager needs `` his players '' to make things work means that the roster will undergo changes between now and week 1 of the regular season in september . ",
        "to that end , let 's take a look at which players currently on the roster will likely still be in orange and brown come the fall , and which will be seeking employment elsewhere , starting with the quarterbacks .   ",

        "stay or go ? while it is somewhat easy to create a reasonable scenario where dorsey , not wanting to trust a rookie quarterback to head coach hue jackson after seeing how jackson handled kizer this season , declines to select a quarter in the upcoming draft , the odds are the browns are going to talk out of the first round with their latest quarterback of the future . more from dawg pound daily nfl snubs browns coaching staff for senior bowl appearance1 d ago browns search for an offensive coordinator just got spicy1 d ago browns reportedly eyeing coaching , front office additions2d ago daily dawg tags : one day closer to the draft3d ago cleveland browns : 3 takeaways from another sad day in pittsburgh4d ago that puts kizer in line for a demotion , either to qb2 or , more likely , to the third quarterback position and a spot on the weekly inactive list . ",
        "the browns are expected to sign or trade for a veteran quarterback so they do n't have to rush their rookie quarterback onto the field in 2018 the way jackson did with kizer this past season , so that will leave kizer as the odd man out this fall . kessler is likely gone no matter what the browns do in free agency and the draft . once a quarterback that fans talked themselves into as a potential starter , but who is really destined to be a serviceable backup quarterback , kessler found himself inactive on game days as soon as dorsey took over in the front office .

        "the browns have more than enough cash laying around to absorb kessler 's cap hit , which is $ 924,295 , according to spotrac . com . hogan would seem to have an in since he was drafted by dorsey in the fifth round of the 2016 nfl draft while dorsey was still with the chiefs . hogan also found himself as the backup quarterback once dorsey arrived in cleveland . next : qbs rosen , darnold to enter nfl draftbut with a quarterback coming in the draft , another one coming via trade or free agency , and kizer , the numbers just do n't work out in hogan 's favor .
