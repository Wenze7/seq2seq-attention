        "ankara - turkey 's broadcasting watchdog has fined a tv station nearly one million lira over footage of young girls dancing in shorts in a talent competition after viewers complained of `` child abuse '' , a board member said on thursday . citing moral dangers for the children , it penalized tv8 channel for footage in the `` yetenek sizsiniz '' program which showed a group of girls , aged from 7 to 11 , who peformed in shorts and tank tops , the board member who did not want to be named told reuters . the move by the turkish radio and television supreme council is likely to further anger government critics , who accuse president tayyip erdogan and his islamist-rooted ruling ak party of trying to roll back secularism and civil rights for minorities , gay people and women . ",
        "last year , hundreds of turkish women marched in istanbul to protest against violence and threats from men demanding they dress more conservatively . rtuk ruled that the footage had violated its ethical broadcast regulations and fined the channel 2 percent of its advertising revenues , amounting almost to 1 million lira . the regulations state that `` programs which contain content that could harm the physical , mental and moral development of children and youth can not be broadcast '' . rtuk said in a report that it had received complaints that the channel had exploited the children in an `` immoral '' show . ",
        "`` there were reactions from citizens for making minor children , aged 7-8 , dance half-naked for ratings , amounting to child abuse , '' the report said . turkey 's family and social policies ministry said the children were `` dancing with clothes that were not appropriate for their age and development level . `` hurriyet newspaper said rtuk also fined several music channels for broadcasting a music video which it described as `` one tick below an erotic film . `` the video of the `` sifir tolerans '' song by belgium-born singer hadise depicts the artist in intimate scenes with her male co-star . ",
        "the video includes scenes of the singer in a bed with the male actor and in a bathtub .   "
