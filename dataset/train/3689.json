        "authored by jeff thomas via internationalman . com , governments regularly claim that they favour tax reform . when this claim has been repeated so many times that virtually no one believes them anymore , they announce a tax reform , to show that they really mean it . they then reshuffle the existing taxes to give the appearance that taxation will actually be lowered . when it becomes apparent that the reform is a sham , they often pull a rabbit out of a hat in the form of a `` temporary '' tax , that 's pre-legislated to end sometime in the future . ",
        "sounds promising . so , let 's have a look at one such temporary tax and see how things worked out . the us government introduced the war revenue act of 1898 -- a tax on telephone use -- under the claim that it was necessary to pay for the spanish american war . in what way does telephone use pertain to a government invading another country ? well , actually , one has nothing to do with the other . but , let 's leave that discussion for another day and see how this temporary tax played out . ",
        "the act was repealed in 1902 but was reinstated , this time as the emergency internal revenue tax act of 1914 . the justification then given was that another war was on the way and increased taxation to pay for it could n't begin too soon . telephone users needed to cough up . it was decided by both parties to increase the tax on telephones and the war revenue act of 1917 was created . it had n't passed the debate stage until the war was over , but they decided that they 'd implement it anyway , as the work had already been done . ",
        "in the bargain , they introduced not only increased rates , but graduated rates . this act was also repealed , in 1924 , but was reinstated with the revenue act of 1932 . since that date , it has been reauthorised 29 times . in 1941 , an increase was put in place to pay for another war -- world war ii . this was increased again in 1943 , but people complained and the new law contained a provision that the increased rates would end six months after `` the date of termination of hostilities in the present war . '' ",
        "however , the excise tax act of 1947 was passed to assure that the tax would continue indefinitely . over the subsequent years , periodic changes were made . although the rates went up and down like a bride 's nightie , most , not surprisingly , were upward . as further wars came and went , taxation on telephone calls repeatedly needed to be increased and , regardless of the party in power , increases continued . at long last , on 14 september , 2000 , the house of representatives took up legislation which included the repeal of the telephone excise tax . ",
        "this measure passed both houses , but the fix was in . president clinton vetoed the repeal . then , in 2006 , a case was made , to amend the internal revenue code `` of an outdated , antiquated tax that has survived a century beyond its original purpose , and by now should have been ancient history . '' finally , american citizens could wash their hands of a one-hundred-year theft of their earnings that , even at the start , was based upon a ludicrous concept . unfortunately ... it did n't happen . the repeal was never enacted and americans continue to pay for the spanish american war today . ",
        "so , what 's the takeaway here ? well , first off , this little history serves as a reminder that there 's nothing so permanent as a temporary government measure . second , although not a month goes by without one politician or another , from one party or the other , rising up in righteous indignation that a new tax or an expanded tax is absolutely necessary to continue the welfare of the american people , there is , in truth , no sincerity in their claim . they simply want more money . third , no amount of money is ever enough . ",
        "even if washington , d. c. , is the only part of the us that is enjoying prosperity , even if no congressman leaves office without more zeroes behind his net worth than when he went in , virtually every legislator will vote for increases in taxation . and , fourth , there 's no such thing as tax reform . from time to time , legislators will need to trot out the idea of tax reform , and be seen to be arguing over the details , but will ultimately always do the same : the deck will be reshuffled , but somehow , taxes will rise once again . ",
        "but the overall lesson to be learned is that government is , and has always been , a shell game . its purpose is not to serve the electorate ; it is to separate them from the fruits of their labours . full stop . as former us chief justice john marshall stated , the power to tax involves the power to destroy . more recently , ron holland offered the following : since the beginning of recorded history , the business of government has been wealth confiscation . however , both these individuals were conservatives , and it would only be fair to ask for commentary from the liberal side . ",
        "one such liberal political leader is none other than vladimir lenin , who stated , the way to crush the bourgeoisie is to grind them between the millstones of taxation and inflation . of course , the reader may wish to consider relocating to a jurisdiction where the taxation is far lower , but if he chooses to remain in the us , eu , canada , or other jurisdiction where the tax level is already oppressive , his plans should include temporary taxes that are unlikely to end in his lifetime . * * * few people realize this , but it is possible to escape the us government 's `` power to destroy .
