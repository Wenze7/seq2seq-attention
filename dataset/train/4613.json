        "`` my good friend , welcome to india , '' modi said in hebrew to open his speech . new delhi - indian prime minister narendra modi is not only revolutionizing india by `` catapulting '' it into the future , he has already revolutionized the india-israel relationship , prime minister benjamin netanyahu said in india on monday . speaking after a two-hour meeting , netanyahu said he was `` deeply moved '' by the honor `` shown the people of israel and the state of israel '' in the welcome ceremony held at the presidential place . `` you are a revolutionary leader in the best sense of the word ` revolution , ' '' netanyahu said , noting that modi 's visit over the summer was the first visit by an indian leader to israel `` in 3,000 years of our own sovereign existence and our history . '' ",
        "noting that israel and india have had diplomatic relations for 25 years , netanyahu said that `` something different is happening now because of your leadership and because of our partnership . '' netanyahu said he spoke with modi about cooperation in all fields , including defense , `` so that our people are always safe and always secure . indians and israelis know too well the pain of terrorist attacks , '' he said . we remember the horrific savagery in mumbai . we grit our teeth , we fight back , we never give in . '' modi greeted netanyahu warmly , hugging him and greeting him in hebrew , `` dear friend , welcome to india . ",
        "`` netanyahu 's visit , modi said , `` is a long-anticipated moment in the journey of friendship between india and israel . your visit is also a fitting climax to the commemoration of 25 years of diplomatic relations between india and israel . '' modi said of netanyahu , `` i have a counterpart who is equally committed to taking the india-irael relationship to soaring new heights . `` netanyahu ended his statement by joking to modi , a yoga aficionado , that `` any time you want to do a yoga class with me , it 's a big stretch , but i 'll be there . ",
        "trust me . '' following the meeting , the two sides issued a joint statement referring to the ties between the two countries as a `` strategic relationship . '' `` the two prime ministers share a common vision for the relationship , '' the statement said . `` they believe that in the next 25 years , the two respective countries should strive to raise bilateral cooperation in diverse sectors to a qualitatively new level in consonance with our strategic partnership . '' the statement said that the two leaders `` reiterated that there can be no justification for acts of terror on any grounds whatsoever and advocated strong measures against terrorists , terror organizations , those who sponsor , encourage or finance terrorism or provide sanctuary to terrorists and terror groups . '' ",
        "the statement included a carefully worded paragraph on the israeli-palestinian peace process that did not mention a two-state solution . `` they reaffirmed their support for an early resumption of peace talks between israelis and palestinians for arriving at a comprehensive negotiated solution on all outstanding issues , based on mutual recognition and effective security arrangements for establishing a just and durable peace in the region , '' the statement read . before the statements , the two leaders witnessed the signing of nine different agreements meant to enhance cooperation across a variety of different fields . these covered everything from a memorandum of understanding on cyber security , which aims to promote cooperation through training programs , skill development , and `` simulation based hands-on training , '' to an mou on exploring the opportunities for bilateral engagements in the oil and gas field . ",
        "in addition , an agreement was signed to establish a framework for film co-production , and another one envisioning cooperation in the field of homeopathic medical research . modi agreed to open trade discussions , indian foreign ministry secretary in charge of economic relations vijay gokhale told reporters . `` a delegation from the commerce ministry will actually go next month for discussions on trade , '' he said . bilateral trade has jumped from $ 200 million in 1992 , when the two countries opened diplomatic relations , to $ 4.16 billion in 2016 , largely in favor of israel . ",
        "netanyahu , accompanied by a 130-member delegation , wants to increase exports to india by 25 percent over the three years . israel has emerged as one of india 's biggest suppliers of weapons alongside the united states and long-term partner russia . but the two sides were tight-lipped over the fate of a $ 500 million deal to buy anti-tank missiles from israel 's state-owned defense contractor rafael that india called off just weeks before netanyahu 's first . the indian government wanted to support a local program to build the missile but israel has since pushed hard to revive the order . ",
        "it has offered to transfer technology and eventually build the missile with a local partner in a boost for modi 's signature make-in-india drive for a domestic defense base . without referring to the anti-tank missile deal , modi said he had invited israeli companies to take advantage of india 's liberalized rules in the defense sector to `` make more in india with our companies . `` reuters contributed to this report .
