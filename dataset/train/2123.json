        "image : image comicsthe creators of image comics ' saga say there are no plans to make a movie or tv show based on their iconic series , despite fan demand and thor : ragnarok actor tessa thompson 's desire to be its star . in fact , there are no plans for any kind of adaptation -- unless , of course , lin-manuel miranda wants to put it into song . writer brian k. vaughan and artist fiona staples chatted with vulture about the next issue of saga , which they say will cover `` fake news and genuine terror . '' ",
        "considering comic adaptations are all the rage these days , the conversation soon turned to whether the pair would be interested in having their space opera turned into a film . vaughan previously said he and staples conceived saga to be an unadaptable comic book but has since opined that they 're open to a possible adaptation . however , it 's not a priority . unless , of course , you 're talking about a musical created by the hamilton virtuoso . vulture asked the pair about that time manuel mentioned saga during an interview in the new york times , where he called it `` an incredible world in which to get lost . '' ",
        "this immediately perked up the creators ' ears and caused them to change their tune . i do n't blame them . vaughan : yeah , i love that column about creators and books in the times , so i was reading it myself when i saw that epic saga shout-out . we 've never spoken with mr. miranda , but seeing hamilton on stage was one of the greatest experiences of my artistic life , and it 's a ridiculous honor to know he reads our work . i know i said we 're not pursuing adaptations , but if lin-manuel ever wants to mount a saga musical , it 's all his , would n't you say , fiona ? ",
        "staples : absolutely ! i bet fard has great pipes . honestly , this is all i want in the world now . comic books , fantasy , and scifi have had a hard go on broadway , and it 's about time they had their day on stage . back in the day , we had shows like little shop of horrors and the rocky horror show , but the only one we 've gotten recently , is spider-man : turn off the dark , which was an utter disaster . there were rumors for years that we 'd get a back to the future musical , but the flux capacitor might be shut off for good in that case . ",
        "saga would be really hard to produce , a bold experiment in storytelling and visuals that would test the limits of what musical theater can do . that 's why i think it should happen . no lying . and if anyone could handle such a feat , it would be lin-manuel miranda . it 's up to you , buddy . do n't throw away this shot .
