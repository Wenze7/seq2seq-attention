        "president trump continues to show disdain for free expression with his latest attack on the nation 's libel laws . the most recent threat came last week as part of the administration 's pushback on michael wolff 's book , `` fire and fury : inside the trump white house . '' trump -- who likely has lost more libel suits than any person to occupy the white house -- made similar attacks on libel laws while running for president . `` we are going to take a strong look at our country 's libel laws , so that when somebody says something that is false and defamatory about someone , that person will have meaningful recourse in our courts , '' trump said last week . ",
        "the latest outburst is n't surprising , given the president 's hostility toward any form of criticism and his well-established lack of understanding of the first amendment . but the comments are still disturbing . it is true that plaintiffs bringing a libel claim in u. s. courts face a tougher challenge than in most other countries . that 's a good thing . u. s. libel law is a key protection for robust political debate in this country . as president , trump can do mercifully little to alter libel laws . such laws are written at the state level , not at the federal level , and libel law has mostly been shaped by court rulings rather than statutes over the centuries . ",
        "over the past 50 years , courts generally have made it more difficult for plaintiffs to prevail in libel cases , with the aim of protecting free speech . the seminal supreme court ruling on libel was the 1964 case , new york times vs. sullivan . that ruling grew out of efforts in the south to use libel law to intimidate civil rights activists . in a 9-0 ruling , the court ruled that public officials had to prove `` actual malice '' to win a libel verdict , meaning they had to demonstrate that a person knowingly made a false claim or acted with reckless disregard to whether it was false or not . ",
        "that protection lies at the heart of trump 's objection to libel laws . the president has never made explicit what standard he would prefer , but it 's clear he 'd like to make it easier for public officials to use libel laws to punish -- or silence - their critics . under current law , plaintiffs can and do recover damages when they are the subject of false and defamatory statements . it is not easy to win such cases , nor should it be . the president serves as exhibit a for why those barriers are good . ",
        "trump frequently equates stories he does n't like with falsity , hence his frequent cry of `` fake news '' to denounce even well-documented criticism . criticism and falsehood are not remotely the same thing , and in pushing for libel reform , trump is really striving to crush criticism . before becoming president , the notoriously thin-skinned trump filed seven lawsuits that used libel claims or other laws in an effort to snuff out criticism . he sued an architect who criticized a proposed trump building . he sued a business reporter who questioned trump 's net worth claims . ",
        "he lost all of those cases , but bragged that bringing the suits punished his critics by running up their legal bills . it 's not clear where trump will go with his vow to change libel law . the president frequently says he 'll do things and never follows through . but the public , and congress , should be on guard . congress should steer clear of legislation aimed at making it easier for public figures to win libel claims . such legislation would be bad for political discourse , and would be unlikely to survive a court challenge . ",
        "one area where trump could influence libel law is through his judicial nominees . so the senate , which has the responsibility for approving judicial nominations , should carefully probe trump nominees about their views on libel law and free speech . trump has demonstrated that he sees a free press and an independent judiciary as barriers to his authoritarian streak . his attack on libel law is a way to target both obstacles . while it 's easy to dismiss trump 's efforts as political and uninformed , those who value free speech must take his threats seriously .
