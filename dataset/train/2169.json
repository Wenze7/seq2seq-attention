        "the gop 's tax bill passed through congress this week and president trump is expected to sign it into law before the year is out . in this q&a , stanford law professor deborah sivas discussed the environmental implications of several provisions in the bill . included in the gop 's tax bill is a provision that will open up the arctic national wildlife refuge to oil exploration and drilling . first , why is anwr protected ? anwr is a place of spectacular wilderness and biodiversity , unlike anywhere else in the u. s . it supports polar bears , a species now teetering on the brink of extinction , as well as grizzly and black bears , over 200 species of birds , huge caribou herds , and much more incredible wildlife . ",
        "it is one of the last truly wild places left on earth , largely untouched by human activity . and it is incredibly fragile . oil-related drill rigs , roads , and other infrastructure , not to mention the potentially catastrophic impacts from oil spills , pose significant risks to the anwr ecosystem . it is for these reasons that the secretary of the interior set aside nearly 9 million acres and withdrew the area from leasing , including oil and gas leasing , in 1960 . then in 1980 , congress enacted and president carter signed a law that expanded the protected area to 19.3 million acres and renamed it the arctic national wildlife refuge . ",
        "that law mandated further assessment of oil and gas development on the 1.5-million-acre coastal plan and required congressional approval for any drilling . another 8 million acres was designated as wilderness . that was the compromise struck nearly four decades ago , and since then many environmental groups and indigenous people have fought to protect the coastal plain area from oil and gas development . what might oil drilling mean to the environment ? what are the objections to drilling from environmentalists ? there have been several attempts to open up the coastal plain to oil and gas development , including toward the end of the reagan administration . ",
        "but in 1989 , we had the valdez oil spill in prince william sound , which demonstrated how much damage can be done by an oil spill and how hard it is to clean up such an incident . for example , hundreds of thousands of birds were covered by oil and died . the responsive cleanup efforts , which involved scouring rocks with high pressure hot water , created their own damage to the flora and fauna , with long-lasting impacts . and as a nation , we saw how unprepared the industry was to deal with an accident and how hard it is to get cleanup personnel and equipment into alaska . ",
        "anwr is even more remote and more fragile than where the exxon valdez ran aground . a major oil spill there could permanently damage the ecosystem , creating harm that could last literally for many decades . several attempts to open the anwr coastal plain to oil drilling , usually in budget bills , have been thwarted , including in 2005 , when alaska 's then-senator ted stevens vowed to open the area to drilling no matter how long it takes . in 2015 , the department of the interior proposed designating the remaining 12 million acres of anwr as fully-protected wilderness , including the coastal plain . ",
        "now , the new tax bill mandates that the interior department open anwr 's coastal plain to oil leasing -- thereby finally achieving what special interests and some alaska elected officials have , for decades , been unable to do . how `` climate aware '' is the tax bill ? for example , does the tax bill leave in place incentives for solar , wind and renewable energy development ? although the original house tax bill would have scaled back tax credits for wind and solar power and for electric vehicles , those changes have been mostly deleted from the reconciled bill . ",
        "this is largely because some prominent republicans , even some climate skeptics , have renewable energy industry in their states . for example , iowa now gets one-third of its power from wind energy and tesla is building a battery factory in nevada , meaning that republican senators from those states argued for maintaining these tax credits . the administration also announced this week that the us no longer regards climate change as a national security threat . what does this mean -- and why should we care about this ? it seems to run contrary to the actions and statements made by coastal state governments such as california and new york . ",
        "this announcement is yet another problematic statement by the administration . in some ways , the u. s. military and national security establishment have been on the forefront of climate science and adaptation . this makes sense . many military installations , for instance , are located on the coast , directly in harm 's way as sea level rise accelerates . we are likely to see new international tension and conflict , especially between russia and the u. s. , as melting ice opens new shipping passages in the arctic ; the ability of russian and other military vessels to expand their presence to north america is troubling for u. s. national security . ",
        "and probably most significant , we are poised to see worldwide population displacement , with millions -- or hundreds of millions -- of climate refugees fleeing rising sea levels , changing weather patterns , increasing catastrophic natural disasters , and declining food security . much more modest population migration in response to middle east conflict has already begun to fray western european democracies . a destabilized world order , where mass global migration becomes much more common , will profoundly threaten national and international security . the question is whether this week 's revised national security strategy is mostly just provocative words , like so much else from this administration , or whether it actually portends a shift in direction by those in the military and national security establishment . ",
        "it is not yet clear whether the president 's political rhetoric will actually have repercussions for our day-to-day national security operations . provided by stanford universitythis story is republished courtesy and copyrighted by phys . org , a popular site that covers news about science research . read the original article .
