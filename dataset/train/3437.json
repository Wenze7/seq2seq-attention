        "by dave thomas . for the los angeles chargers , 2017 proved to be so close , yet so far . tied with four other afc teams with 9-7 records , the chargers missed out on their first visit to the playoffs since 2013 . despite a pair of those 9-7 clubs getting playoff berths , los angeles was left on the outside looking in . so what kept the chargers out of the playoffs -- besides not having as good a conference mark as buffalo , which ended a 17-year playoff drought ? chargers got off to slow start . ",
        "one of the biggest hurdles the chargers had to climb during the 2017 campaign was overcoming a sluggish start . after opening the season 0-4 , the bolts had essentially two roads in front of them . they could all but tank the season and focus on 2018 , or they could regroup under first-year head coach anthony lynn and make a push for the postseason . as it turns out , the chargers took the latter road . starting with an early october win at the new york giants , the chargers righted the ship sooner than later . ",
        "before it was all said and done , the bolts had reeled off three straight victories before a tough loss in new england to the defending super bowl champions . from there , a hard-fought three-point loss in jacksonville would be followed by four straight victories . during that winning streak , los angeles outscored the opposition 131-53 . with a battle for first place on the line in kansas city 's arrowhead stadium on a mid-december saturday night , the chargers laid an egg , dropping a 30-10 decision . although the bolts were still mathematically alive for the division and wild card races , the former was all but out of reach . ",
        "heading into the final two games of the regular season , los angeles defeated the new york jets and oakland raiders , respectively . unfortunately , it was not enough to get the team into postseason action . rivers , allen among those with solid seasons . even with the playoff disappointment , the chargers had much to smile about this season . on the offensive side of the ball , veteran quarterback philip rivers put up some noteworthy numbers yet again . most notably , rivers joined the exclusive 50,000-yard passing club . for the season , rivers finished with 4,515 yards passing . ",
        "that went along with 28 touchdowns and only 10 interceptions . starting wide receiver keenan allen also put up some positive numbers . allen caught 102 passes for 1,393 yards and six touchdowns . teammate hunter henry caught 45 passes for 579 yards and four scores . the second-year tight end has shown that he is slowly taking over the spot that future hall-of-famer antonio gates has been holding down for more than a decade . on the ground , starting running back melvin gordon ended his campaign with 1,105 yards rushing and eight touchdowns . over on the defense , second-year defensive end joey bosa continued to show why he was a smart pick by the bolts . ",
        "bosa capped the year with 70 total tackles and 12.5 sacks . fellow end melvin ingram turned in 10.5 sacks on the season . leading the charge for los angeles was safety jahleel addae with 96 total stops . for the chargers , allen , rivers , bosa , and casey hayward were named to the afc pro bowl squad . although the team did not accomplish its goal of reaching the playoffs , it appears things are headed in the right direction for rookie head coach anthony lynn and his troops . along with division rivals , the chargers are slated to host cincinnati , baltimore , tennessee , arizona and san francisco in 2018 . ",
        "along with afc west foes , the bolts will visit buffalo , cleveland , the l. a. rams , seattle and pittsburgh . so , are you ready for some chargers football in 2018 ?   "
