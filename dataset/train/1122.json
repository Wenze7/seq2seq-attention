        "the reasons behind spain 's legislative paralysis ever since the general elections of december 2015 , spain has been passing laws at the slowest pace of its entire democratic history . the repeat election of 2016 made that year the least productive in four decades . and the trend kept up in 2017 , when congress passed no more than 13 laws . it was the slowest non-election year since 1979 . the government has been resorting to decrees , which do not require parliamentary approval , in order to get things done : fully 59 % of new spanish laws during the present political term have been created that way . ",
        "the figure is significantly higher than the previous record of 34 % set during the first mariano rajoy administration , between 2011 and 2015 . the government has been resorting to decrees to get things donein theory , low output does not necessarily indicate a lack of parliamentary activity or political disillusionment . congress could merely be focusing on a few major bills requiring lengthy debate . but that is not the case . the one organic law to get greenlighted in 2017 was to `` guarantee participation of people with disabilities '' in popular juries . and of the 12 ordinary laws that made it through , three were laws transposing eu directives , one was the 2017 budget , and another gave approval to the cupo vasco , a special financing deal for the basque country . ",
        "as for the driving forces behind this legislation , only two bills were introduced by someone other than the governing popular party : the socialists pushed through a law to ensure greater independence at the state broadcaster , and ciudadanos introduced a reform affecting self-employed workers . a new surge ? pablo iglesias , leader of podemos , which has been introducing numerous initiatives in congress . uly martinyet everything suggests that 2018 could be a bumper year for new legislation . in the 14 months that have elapsed since the last election , parties have introduced 161 bills in congress . ",
        "most of these typically die a sudden death : the government can veto any project that increases spending , and sometimes lawmakers will propose a bill in the knowledge that they can not secure a majority for it . but at least it looks like they 're doing something . there are still over two years to go before the end of the term , which is plenty of time to match , or even surpass , the 322 bills that were introduced under the second josé maría aznar administration , from 2000 to 2004 . there is an obvious reason for this surge in legislative activity : there are more parties in congress now -- ciudadanos and podemos both entered parliament at the 2015 election -- and they want to prove that they have initiatives . ",
        "even if these are doomed to fail , at least they go on the records . the unpleasant laws are always made by the government `` they get recorded , and later they get nowhere because of the government veto or else because the parties were n't even that interested in the subject in the first place , '' notes cristóbal herrera , lobby director for the consulting firm llorente y cuenca . if there is one party that makes a lot of effort but sees few results , that is unidos podemos , the congressional group comprising podemos , the united left and other small leftist parties . ",
        "this group has put forward 50 initiatives , nearly a third of the total . the psoe accounts for 38 , and ciudadanos for 14 . the pp has only presented 16 . minority governmentthere are two main reasons for the slow production . the first is that this is spain 's first truly minority government . and the second is catalonia . `` a minority government is always like this , '' says roger senserrich , a political scientist . `` it needs to build specific majorities for each law , and the opposition does not want to hand the government any successes . '' ",
        "the rules of the political game have changed in spain . votes are now shared out among four main parties , not two as was the case for decades . and nobody knows for sure anymore how their own voters will react to specific proposals . `` most parties only worry about increasing their votes at the next election , '' says senserrich . politicians act on incentives , and there is no better incentive than attracting votes . josé maría aznar withtony blair and george w. bush in 2003 . el paisduring the two-party system , the rules were clear . ",
        "`` everyone knew how things worked : the majority party would sometimes require support from a regional nationalist party that would provide this backing in exchange for infrastructure or some other local benefit , '' says herrera . `` but that 's all gone now , and we now talk about a period of postnormality . '' and in the middle of this legislative muddle , the catalan crisis made an entrance . `` the catalan problem has pushed everything else out of the debate , '' says senserrich . a cis poll conducted in october showed catalonia to be the second most serious problem in spaniards ' opinion , after unemployment . ",
        "this was a spectacular leap from previous surveys . some political parties saw a chance to turn this into more votes , inside and outside catalonia . what next ? so what are spain 's most pressing legislative needs right now ? basically everything , according to the experts . `` the agenda of reforms is as broad as the imagination of any entrepreneurial politician can stretch , '' says jorge galindo , a researcher at geneva university . josé fernández-albertos , a political scientist at the science research council csic , says it is imperative to deal with `` the scars of the crisis '' that gripped spain from 2008 to 2014 . ",
        "this could include initiatives on `` minimum wage , youth policies , temporary jobs or the wounds created by lower spending on education . '' besides that , regional funding remains on hold in a highly decentralized country where regional governments are in charge of critical services such as health and education . `` the current system was approved in 2009 , it should have undergone review after five years , yet there is no new agreement , '' says sandra león , who teaches at york university . bonanzathe most productive lawmaking year was 1980 , when 112 acts and decrees were passed . ",
        "but spain had just emerged from a long dictatorship and there was an entire body of laws to build . the next big boom period was 1997 to 1999 under josé maría aznar , who was heading the first alternative government after 14 years of socialist rule . then came the bonanza years for the spanish economy . things were starting to crack , but nobody noticed . `` those were comfortable years , '' says eloísa del pino , a political scientist at csic . `` this idea that everything is working fine prevents policies of redistribution . the chance to solve structural problems was not grabbed . ",
        "during the mini-crisis of the 1990s , inequality shot up , and we were unable to revert it in the 2000s because we just did n't feel like it . '' the agenda of reforms is as broad as the imagination of an entrepreneurial politician can stretchjorge galindo , geneva universitydel pino says there were no lack of ideas for things like pension reform . but there was no political will to pull on the reins of an expanding economy . those changes were eventually and forcibly adopted during mariano rajoy 's first term in office , from 2011 to 2015 . ",
        "but by then spain had been a fully functional country for decades , and changing the status quo is more complex than building a new system from the ground up . besides , the crisis was not confined to spain , and finding solutions required finesse : wanting to make reforms does not mean knowing how to do so . now that part of the crisis is behind us , the government seems at ease without a clear agenda . `` the pp is a status quo kind of party , and failure to pass laws is not a tragedy for them , '' notes senserrich . ",
        "besides , the conservatives already passed all the laws they thought necessary during their previous term of office , when they had an absolute majority . meanwhile , the opposition seems disinclined to rock the boat . a leader from one of the new parties confessed that when you 're in the opposition , you are not going to propose anything that might harm or anger your own voters . this would mean losing votes needlessly . the unpleasant laws are always made by the government , particularly at the beginning of each term . english version by susana urra .
