        "one day a polar bear shows up at sophia 's house asking if it can come inside . its habitat melted and the bear needs a new home . so starts `` the tantrum that saved the world , '' a new children 's book about climate change 's effects on creatures and communities around the world , by penn state researcher michael mann and author and illustrator megan herbert . after the polar bear makes itself comfortable , more climate refugees show up -- honeybees confused by the seasons , a flamingo whose breeding ground was disrupted , an i-kiribati family whose house was submerged by water . ",
        "finally , sophia , tired of being ignored and postponed , throws a tantrum to make the world 's decision-makers take notice , and in the end becomes a hero by channeling her energy into action to effect positive change . mann and herbert created the story because they wanted a way to discuss climate change with their own children , but could not find a book that would suffice . `` both mike and i are parents , and we were worried about the state of things not just for us but for our kids , and we wanted to do something about it , '' said herbert , a film and television script writer and children 's book illustrator . ",
        "the authors first met at earth 101 , a conference bringing together climate scientists with film and media professionals to discuss ways to raise awareness about climate change . after months of discussions and research , they settled on an approach to their book , which includes not only a story but also supplemental scientific information . `` the idea was really to have this story stand on its own , but for parents and kids who want to dig deeper there 's that second part which provides further scientific context , '' said mann , distinguished professor of atmospheric science and director of the earth system science center . ",
        "`` meg uses her wonderful artistic abilities to really make those sections engaging for our audience too . '' the scientific section of the book provides readers with a detailed look at how climate change is impacting the various characters in the book . it also shows the book 's characters in their native land or habitat , tying the book together visually . the story features an equal mix of humans and animals from regions around the world , which was intentional . `` we want people to understand climate change is not just affecting one or two areas but it 's affecting many , and those issues are quite interconnected and have effects on other places , '' herbert said . ",
        "at first the authors struggled to find a format that would work best for children . `` the last thing you want to do is frighten children or make them feel depressed , '' said herbert . `` you want to make them feel empathy and then a desire to do something positive . '' in addition to the story and scientific information , the book includes an action-oriented poster outlining what children can do in their daily lives to make a positive difference , whether it 's helping parents choose locally sourced foods at the grocery store or , when they are older , contacting representatives or starting petitions . ",
        "`` it was important to us to have empowering stories and narratives for children today , to make sure they feel emboldened to be part of the process of solving the great problems we face , '' said mann . `` the tantrum that saved the world '' is also printed in an environmentally friendly way , showing the authors ' commitment to making a positive difference . the books will be printed with 100 percent recycled material , using soy ink that is both biodegradable and is derived from plants . to address the carbon footprint of printing and shipping costs , the authors are partnering with companies that help organizations offset their operations through planting trees or providing renewable energy supplies to low-income communities . ",
        "the project launched through the crowdfunding platform kickstarter , which gave them funds to pursue these nontraditional publishing routes . it also , said mann , allowed them to get the book out to the public quickly . `` we did n't have to shop around to find the right publisher , which could take years , '' he said . `` we wanted this to happen now . '' the book is being published by world saving books . the authors hope to release an e-book version in december 2017 followed by a print version in 2017 . `` what we 're really hoping is that we can build a community of people who are making change within their own families to live in a different way , and that then grows to change in their schools and communities , and it grows from there , '' herbert said .
