        "a top political science analyst says it is possible republicans will lose up to 38 seats on capitol hill as well as their grip on the house majority . `` if trump 's popularity and the economy continue at their current pace , republicans should be expecting a major loss in the house and a possible chance of losing the senate , '' eric smith , a professor of political science at the university of california , santa barbara , writes in the washington post . smith says he used a forecasting model based on changes in real gross national product in the first and second quarters of the election year , the president 's approval rating in gallup polls as of july of the election year , and whether it is a presidential or midterm year . ",
        "`` the model predicts that the republicans will lose 38 seats in the house , a number that would give the democrats a majority in the next congress , '' he writes . `` but it 's important to note that simple models such as this one produce forecasts with real uncertainty . in this case , you can think of the forecast as having a ` margin of error ' of 38 seats .
