        "sacramento -- immigration advocates are bracing for a sweeping raid by ice agents across northern california , targeting undocumented immigrants . immigration and customs enforcement agents will target california for its `` so-called '' sanctuary state status in what could be the biggest enforcement operation yet under president trump . sacramento 's b'nai israel synagogue now includes a dedicated space for undocumented immigrants seeking sanctuary from arrests by federal agents . the congregation voted not to hide undocumented people , but to house them , hopeful federal agents would not raid a house of worship . `` as a jewish community we have known what it means to be on the outside , '' rabbi mona alfi said . ",
        "reports of a massive immigration raid , have alfi fearful for undocumented families facing separation . `` this does n't feel like this is about the safety and security of our country , '' alfi said . a report by the san francisco chronicle , describes an imminent ice raid seeking to arrest 1500 undocumented people . those served with final deportation orders and those with criminal histories would be primary targets . an ice spokesperson would not confirm or deny reports . `` we ca n't speculate about future enforcement actions , '' ice spokesperson james schwab said . ",
        "uc davis professor holly cooper says the massive size of the reported operation is especially unusual because it would require lots of space to detain the arrested and get them hearings . she is advising undocumented people to prepare . `` if you do have a removal order you should talk to a lawyer immediately , '' cooper said . in response to california 's so-called sanctuary state status . ice acting director thomas homan appeared on fox news earlier this month promising more enforcement action in california . `` we are going to be all over the place , and we are going to enforce law without apology , '' homan said . ",
        "now reports that an ice action is imminent , in an operation aimed all over northern california . `` this feels political , '' alfi said .   "
