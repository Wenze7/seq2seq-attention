        "after the revelation that al shaqab owes huge sums to british-based trainers , it appears no such issues affect other big-time qatari ownerschris cook ` no problems ' getting paid by qatar racingas any punter knows , getting paid is half the battle and that message has apparently been borne in on trainers who have horses owned by al shaqab , the racing empire of sheikh joaan , a brother of the emir of qatar . according to a times story this morning , al shaqab has been slow to pay invoices to several people in british racing over the past six months and now has debts running into seven figures . ",
        "related : richard johnson back on track with welsh grand national on horizonal shaqab 's general manager , khalifa al-attiyah , has apologised for the delay , which he says has been caused by organisational problems . in a statement sent to the guardian , he says : `` we have been going through a longer financial review due to many activities and engagements in regards to our operation in qatar , which is taking us quite a bit of time to finalize . '' al-attiyah insists that `` all will be settled fully in the coming weeks '' , that there will be no such delays in the future and that al shaqab remains committed to racing in britain and elsewhere . ",
        "al-attiyah denies that the delay has been at all caused by the diplomatic crisis now affecting qatar , several countries in the region having severed relations with it and imposed travel and trade bans . it appears that no such delays have affected those dealing with qatar racing , the other major group in british racing to be owned by members of qatar 's ruling al-thani family . qatar racing , whose claret colours have been carried by many horses including the leger winner simple verse , is a subsidiary of qipco , a private commercial company run by sheikh fahad and two of his brothers . ",
        "ralph beckett , trainer of simple verse and many others for qatar racing , says he has always been paid promptly by the organisation . i 'm told there has also been no problem collecting funds from qipco for its many sponsorship ventures in british racing , which include backing the british champions series of races . officials would not offer on-the-record quotes about their dealings with a client but qipco were described to me by one source as `` exemplary payers '' . today 's best bets , by chris cookludlow offers a couple of tempting runners today , starting with braventara , a sister to caventara , winner of the maiden hurdle at ayr yesterday . ",
        "this seven-year-old was tried in listed company by nick williams last season but ended her time with him with a couple of falls . she 's now with the in-form tom george and handily weighted for this first venture into handicaps . this could be the right time to catch her , in a mares ' race that lacks evident depth . jeremy scott is another trainer going well and his jack snipe looked back to form until unseating three-out at plumpton last month , when first-time blinkers appeared to be making a difference . he gets to run off the same mark this time , when hopefully the headgear will have a similar effect . ",
        "he 's 7-2 . pick of the card at southwell could be princess way , who won over this course and distance just 12 days ago on her fibresand debut . after a 5 lb rise , she is still only 1 lb above her last winning mark and is worth chancing again at 7-1 . southwell : 12.40 shine baby shine , 1.10 speciality , 1.40 kommander kirkup , 2.10 jack the truth , 2.40 the great wall , 3.10 vivat rex , 3.40 princess way . musselburgh : 1.00 heartasia , 1.30 boy 's on tour , 2.00 nendrum , 2.30 randy pike , 3.00 mixboy , 3.30 thepensionfund .
