        "what are experts learning as online interactions are meticulously monitored , tested , and analyzed ? a recap of code 2017by paula kleindigital experimentation -- long thriving in academia -- is now permeating corporate environments , too , yielding new insights into online interactions . at the same time , issues of online privacy and selection bias raise concerns daily . at the code 2017 event hosted by the mit ide in october , these and other topics were explored in-depth by a diverse set of experts from the fields of social science , computer science , economics , analytics , marketing , and statistics . ",
        "many focused on the practical value of digital experimentation as it expands into new applications . for instance , conducting real-time digital experiments has the potential to monitor and reduce security breaches , better understand how social media affects behavior , and even to enhance the quality of online services -- from ridesharing to health care -- according to speakers . during two days of presentations and discussions experts evaluated advances in the field . organizers and mit ide leaders sinan aral , erik brynjolfsson , and alex pentland , stated that : `` the newly emerging capability to rapidly deploy and iterate micro-level , in-vivo , randomized experiments in complex social and economic settings , at population scale , is one of the most significant innovations in modern social science . '' ",
        "it 's also changing rapidly . `` as more and more social interactions , behaviors , decisions , opinions and transactions are digitized and mediated by online platforms , our ability to quickly answer nuanced causal questions about the role of social behavior in population-level outcomes such as health , voting , political mobilization , consumer demand , information sharing , product rating and opinion aggregation , is becoming unprecedented . '' a sea-change underway `` this new toolkit portends a sea-change in our scientific understanding of human behavior and dramatic improvements in social and business policy as a result . ",
        "when appropriately theorized and rigorously applied , randomized experiments are the gold standard of causal inference and a cornerstone of effective policy . '' organizers and participants also acknowledged the fine line that has to be walked when issues of user privacy and selection bias can color responses and results noting . the hosts noted that `` the scale and complexity of these experiments create scientific and statistical challenges for design and inference . '' in his talk on experimenting from the inside-out : the sbo project , carnegie mellon university professor , alessandro acquisti , said that early versions of internet testing -- such as cmu 's homenet in 1995 -- were the precursors to today 's deeper analytics . ",
        "the security behavior observatory is an infrastructure for long-term monitoring of client machines that began in 2014 -- 20 years after homenet . emily falk , associate professor at the university of pennsylvania , spoke about neuroscience approaches to understanding how ideas and behaviors spread in social media campaigns , and what motivates behavior and outcomes . from healthcare to uber ridersalso addressing the behavioral-science implications of digital experiments , mit sloan professor , ren√©e richardson gosline , talked specifically about the outsourced mind : using behavioral science for better patient ux . she discussed how to use algorithms to help manage diseases , raise awareness , and ultimately to improve patient care . ",
        "in another session , stanford professor , susan athey , explained her current research on service quality in the gig economy : empirical evidence from uber . using ridesharing as her marketplace example , athey examines -- and attempts to dispel -- the assumption that low-priced market entrants weaken safety and quality of services . during a panel discussion with athey and gosline , ide leader aral pointed out that as corporations do their own external experimentation , transparency may be biases or reduced , while collaboration-funding can become limited . in all , it 's a complex and rapidly-changing field of interestfor more : see the full agenda and speaker bios here .
