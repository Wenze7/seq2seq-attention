        "the embraer phenom 300 is displayed during the latin american business aviation conference & exhibition fair at congonhas airport in sao paulo , brazil august 15 , 2017 . reuters/paulo whitakerby tim hepherparis - boeing co is eyeing a broad partnership with embraer reaching beyond commercial aircraft to defense and global services , but its shape hinges on talks with the brazilian government . the u. s. aerospace group has yet to make a formal offer and its final structure would be driven by talks that are expected to resume in coming weeks - but sources say the aim is to go well beyond traditional joint ventures or an equity infusion . ",
        "`` a broader combination would be preferred but boeing is sensitive to concerns the government may have about issues like defense . if those can be addressed ... this deal can get done , '' a person with direct knowledge of the discussions said . political obstacles to a deal have eased since a u. s. spying scandal helped derail a boeing fighter sale to brazil in 2013 . brazilian president michel temer , who took office last year , has pushed a market-friendly agenda aimed at privatizing utilities and reducing the government 's role in state-run firms . but temer has been wrestling with single-digit poll ratings and officials have warned they would veto any full bid . ",
        "`` the companies are now working through the regulatory issues with the government of brazil . the defense portfolio would be handled in accordance with the government of brazil and the golden share and discussions are ongoing , '' the person said . a tie-up would round out boeing 's commercial portfolio at the lower end where sales have been slow , and echo a venture between airbus and canada 's bombardier on the cseries jet . analysts say october 's deal for airbus to control the new canadian project left embraer looking exposed with its smaller e-jet , and keenly aware that china may be on the prowl again after seeing its own efforts to buy the cseries thwarted . ",
        "though most sources say that deal rang alarms at embraer , people involved in the boeing talks insist they are independent . `` it is a longstanding relationship that has evolved over time . these discussions have been going on for the better part of a year and came into greater focus in the last few months , but well before the airbus and bombardier announcement . it is not a reactive play , '' the person with direct knowledge said . ` growth play'boeing and embraer have long pondered commercial links and sources say they were close to a deal last decade for the brazilian company to work on the next boeing single-aisle jet . ",
        "in 2012 they agreed to work on safety and alternative fuel . their partnership expanded to include boeing 's joint sales and support for embraer 's kc-390 military transporter . but boeing is now wooing the privatized firm with a broad offer including access to a global supply chain and new markets for the kc-390 and brazil 's super tucano light attack plane . analysts say embraer would value access to the u. s. defense market while boeing hopes to steady a defense portfolio weakened by slow fighter sales and the end of c-17 transport production , although there are many hurdles to full military co-operation . ",
        "`` it gives embraer access to boeing 's balance sheet , greater access to u. s. defense and international markets and alignment of a global supply chain and services , '' the person said . `` it 's a growth play that would result in more planes being built in brazil due to more sales volume from a stronger combined portfolio and with broader benefits to the customer . `` observers say the two managements are culturally close and broadly in step on issues like trade , where they are waging parallel battles against alleged bombardier subsidies . a tie-up is also not expected to strain boeing financially . ",
        "but with pride at stake and brazil still limping out of severe recession , any deal is expected to depend on cast-iron assurances over autonomy and jobs . `` it would not be boeing plus embraer with a small ` e ' . embraer would keep its brand identity , management and jobs footprint , '' the person said . boeing said on friday it respected the need to safeguard the company 's defense and other state links .
