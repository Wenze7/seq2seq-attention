        "live ottawa more streams looking for a holiday dinner that will make you feel like a character straight out of charles dickens 's a christmas carol ? look no further than a traditional goose or duck , a traditional meal in parts of the united kingdom and other parts of europe , says dorothy edwards , owner of my favourite farm in laurentian valley township . edwards knows a thing or two about raising and cooking geese . she grew up eating these birds , and now raises them on her farm . edwards , speaking to cbc 's all in a day , suggests three different ways to cook a duck or goose . ",
        "the first is for pink breasts and tender leg meat . the second is less work , but the breasts are well done and taste a tiny bit like liver . the third is deliciously tangy . remember that they are free-range birds . in order to make sure they are tender , cook them low and slow . at around 250 f is best . method 1 thaw the bird and rub salt all over the skin and in the cavity . let sit uncovered in the fridge for as long as you can , up to two days . ",
        "then wipe the salt off with paper towel . do n't rinse it off with water . stuff the cavity with bread pieces , onions , mushrooms , apple segments and raisins . the skin of geese and ducks should be snipped all over . make many small cuts with a sharp pair of pointed scissors , or very sharp knife , being careful to avoid snipping the meat . most of the fat will drain away and collect in the roasting pan . the pan should have sides that are at least two inches high and a grate or rack to keep the bird above the fat . ",
        "roast for about 20 minutes only , then check the breasts . if you like the breasts pink , and the rest of the meat very tender , remove the breasts when they are roasted to a pink and juicy state . this will take 20 to 40 minutes depending on size . check them periodically . wearing gloves , cut them off the carcass with a small knife and allow to cool . the bird will be hot and greasy . take your time . cover the breasts and set them aside in the fridge . cut apart the rest of the bird and roast the legs , wings and neck , and any other tough pieces of meat , immersed in the collected fat drippings at 200 f for around six hours . ",
        "they will be very tender . remove the pieces from the hot fat with tongs and allow to drain for a few minutes on paper towel , but do n't let them cool . place them on a serving dish with the sliced breasts and broil with the skin side up quickly to crisp the skin . this should just take a minute or two . for the last 90 minutes , roast par-boiled root vegetables after tossing them in a bit of the goose fat . garnish with parsley , slices of orange and grape tomatoes to serve . ",
        "mix orange marmalade and soy sauce with some goose fat and juices from the roaster . pour over the meat on the serving platter or serve it on the side . add lemon and orange zest and squeeze orange and lemon juice over the dressing just before you serve it . sprinkle potatoes with salt and pepper . mix and warm in a frying pan in some fat from the bird . reheat in the oven when you roast the potatoes . save excess fat to cook potatoes for another day and the bones to make soup stock . method 2 thaw the bird and rub salt all over the skin and in the cavity . ",
        "let sit uncovered in the fridge for as long as you can , up to two days . then wipe the salt off with paper towel . do n't rinse it off with water . the skin of geese and ducks should be snipped all over . make many small cuts with a sharp pair of pointed scissors , or very sharp knife , being careful to avoid snipping the meat . stuff the bird with diced pears and apples and finely chopped onions . place it on a rack in the deep sided open pan and roast at 250 f for three hours , making sure that it is always above the fat . ",
        "baste the bird with the drippings three or four times while it 's roasting . toss potatoes , carrots , onions , squash , parsnips and anything else you like , in some of the goose fat with some salt and pepper and roast for three hours . check to see that they 're not overdone or underdone . if they are n't cooked enough when the birds are done , remove the meat from the oven , heat up the oven to 400 f and roast the veg and watch carefully until they are just right . if they are done early , remove from the oven , and when the bird is ready , place the vegetables under the broiler to warm up for just a few minutes . ",
        "serve garnished with fresh parsley and grape tomatoes . method 3 thaw the bird and rub salt all over the skin and in the cavity . let sit uncovered in the fridge for as long as you can , up to two days . then wipe the salt off with paper towel . do n't rinse it off with water . the skin of geese and ducks should be snipped all over . make many small cuts with a sharp pair of pointed scissors , or very sharp knife , being careful to avoid snipping the meat . make a generous mixture of finely chopped garlic , ginger , and tamarind sauce , about a cup . ",
        "it should be thick and sticky . rub all over the goose or duck , marinate overnight . fill the cavity with chopped onion , orange and lemon and pears or prunes . cook in an oven at 250 f for three hours depending on the size . garnish with cilantro or parsley .   "
