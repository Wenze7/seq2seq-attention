        "long story short . i 've had a friends with benefits for 2 years . i caught feelings for him so i ended things with him a few months ago . he reeled me back in with his charm and we started hooking up again and now i wan na end things for good cause i like him too much . i 've written this to send to him next time he asks to hookup . what do you think ? i 'm trying to be respectful to him i do n't know please help and let me know what i should and should n't keep in the text or what i should add ... `` ok i 'm just gunna be straight up . ",
        "i 've caught feelings for you . i thought i could just put those feelings aside and ignore them but it 's getting more difficult the more we hook up . i think it 's just best to not hook up anymore before someone really gets hurt , once one of us finds someone we want to commit to . i have n't hooked up with anyone else the last couple years we have been and i think that 's why it 's been so easy to catch feelings . using each other for sex has really gotten to me and it was a mistake for me to rekindle what we had going on when i first said i did n't want to hookup anymore because now it sucks even more and i 'm sorry '' "
