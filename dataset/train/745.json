        "honda 's latest insight wo n't be sold in europe , but it 's the latest in the brand 's renewed push for electrificationthe 2018 honda insight has been revealed in prototype form ahead of its official unveiling at the detroit motor show . it 's powered by the same hybrid powertrain as the 2018 cr-v hybrid , which is scheduled to go on sale in the uk in august . unlike the new cr-v , however , the third-generation insight is not bound for europe , but it will sit in the brand 's us line-up between the civic and the accord .

        "the new toyota prius rival takes a more conventional saloon shape than its high-reared predecessor . the front will adopt honda 's aggressive new styling theme , with a metallic strip running the full width , tying in with honda 's other us-market models . the wheelbase and length of the new car have grown over the previous insight , although honda has n't yet specified the new car 's dimensions . where previous hybrids have been compromised by their electrification , the new insight will be `` a great car in its own right , independent of what 's happening under the hood '' , said honda 's us boss , henio arcangeli . ",
        "`` the all-new insight embodies honda 's approach to creating electrified vehicles without the typical trade-offs . '' the original insight of 1999 was rated as the most fuel-efficient petrol car certified by the epa at the time . honda has not yet announced how fuel-efficient the next insight will be , but arcangeli described the car as having `` best-in-class performance '' in this regard . fuel economy of around 60mpg is mooted , although honda claims the insight can drive on electric power alone in most situations . inside , the car has an 8.0 in touchscreen infotainment system and a 7.0 in lcd display behind the steering wheel . ",
        "it 'll feature smartphone-mimicking customisation of the interface and applications , as well as the ability to update software over-the-air via wi-fi . read more honda insight review honda civic review honda jazz review .   "
