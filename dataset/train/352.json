        "santiago de chile - pope francis on tuesday apologized for sexual abuse by clergy in the catholic church , saying he felt `` pain and shame at the irreparable damage caused to children '' and calling such cases `` a great and painful evil . '' `` i am one with my brother bishops , for it is right to ask for forgiveness and make every effort to support the victims , even as we commit ourselves to ensuring that such things do not happen again , '' the pope said in a speech to chilean president michelle bachelet , her successor-to-be sebastian pinera and other dignitaries . ",
        "tuesday was the first full day of the pope 's sixth visit to latin america , which will also take him to peru until sunday . at a meeting with priests later in the day , francis told them cases of abuse were painful `` because of the harm and sufferings of the victims and their families , who saw the trust they had placed in the church 's ministers betrayed . `` he said they were also painful for priests and other church representatives , who faced `` suspicion and questioning '' and even insults . `` for this reason , '' the pope said , `` i suggest that we ask god to grant us the clear-sightedness to call reality by its name , the strength to seek forgiveness . '' ",
        "`` i think too many abuses were committed for too long . it is a good sign that the pope recognizes it , '' said pinera , who will succeed bachelet in march . police meanwhile used water cannon and tear gas to disperse a demonstration protesting sexual abuse scandals and a democracy that kept people in poverty . about 20 people were detained , local media reported . two churches meanwhile burned down in cunco in the south , according to radio cooperativa . another church was attacked with a firebomb in santiago de chile , where the attackers reportedly burned chilean and vatican flags and left anarchist leaflets . ",
        "six churches or parishes had already been attacked prior to francis ' arrival . chile is the latin american country where the pope is least valued , receiving an approval rating of 5.3 out of 10 , according to the pollster latinobarometro . his lack of approval is largely attributed to a string of sexual abuse scandals . francis was criticized for his 2015 appointment of juan barros as bishop of osorno , chile . it is alleged that barros protected priest fernando karadima , whom the vatican found guilty of child abuse in 2011 . barros ' presence at a mass celebrated by the pope on tuesday sparked criticism on social media . ",
        "dozens of demonstrators also urged francis to sack the bishop . juan carlos cruz , one of karadima 's victims , called the pope 's apology `` another cheap headline . '' `` bishops who covered up are still there . empty words , '' he tweeted . the vatican has meanwhile tried to mitigate the repercussions of another sexual abuse scandal in peru , announcing last week that it was taking over the catholic movement sodalicio . peruvian prosecutors want to arrest its founder for alleged abuses . at the mass following the meeting with bachelet , francis urged catholics to have faith `` in the transforming power of god '' instead of ignoring social problems and `` dulling our senses with consumerism . ",
        "`` the o'higgins park , where the mass was held , was filled with some 400,000 believers waving yellow-and-white vatican flags . `` i feel a very great joy and happiness . ... my catholic faith is stronger than ever , '' said sandra , a teacher . `` this visit gives us hope and joy in being catholics . today chile is a very different , more diverse country , but also with less faith , '' said francisco , 22 . the pope and bachelet later visited a women 's prison , where francis stressed the importance of motherhood . ",
        "`` motherhood is not , and never will be a problem , '' said the head of the catholic church , which has criticized bachelet 's government for relaxing abortion legislation . the pope also criticized the penitentiary system , saying that `` a jail sentence is very often simply a punishment , offering no opportunities for personal growth .
