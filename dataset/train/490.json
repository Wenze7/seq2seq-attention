        "after a massive crash over the past couple of weeks , the bitcoin and ripple price has started to rebound over the last 24 hours . vjkombajn / pixabaycryptocurrency reboundthe website coinmarketcap measures the 100 largest cryptocurrencies , and today reported gains for 98 currencies over the last 24 hours as of 7 am et . the bitcoin and ripple price made notable jumps , with bitcoin jumping 13 percent to reach $ 11657 and ripple making a gigantic stride of 43 percent to reach a price of $ 1.52 . although the bitcoin and ripple price increase was notable , the two highest performers were tron and bitconnect , which increased by 99 percent and 284 percent respectively . ",
        "the jump in bitconnect price is especially surprising , considering that the exchange was recently outed as an alleged ponzi scheme and subsequently closed . even though the bitcoin and ripple price has made a gigantic jump , the prices are still much lower than they were at the end of december -- an outstanding month for cryptocurrency that saw record highs for the majority of the investments . in early january , however , the currencies took a massive dip , with the bitcoin price plummeting thousands of dollars from its high of almost $ 20000 . considering the massive coverage of the bitcoin and ripple price in the news , many hopefuls took the initiative to invest in these new currencies only to suddenly see a large drop just a few weeks later -- reinforcing the idea that these currencies are anything but a safe investment . ",
        "inverse reports that experts believe that the technology behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will remain in use even if the coins themselves were to fall , due to groundbreaking ideas like the blockchain ledger used to securely distribute data . but it seems like the currencies may start to bounce back , despite concerns indicating the opposite to be true . the cryptocurrency crashafter the massive crash in bitcoin and ripple price , many were concerned that recent events in the world of cryptocurrency would keep the currencies from once again reaching those massive highs . over the course of a few weeks , multiple rumors and events greatly affected the bitcoin and ripple price , leading to the massive crash following the meteoric rise . ",
        "a rumor regarding the fact that china may be increasing regulation regarding bitcoin mining within the country is concerning , as many bitcoin organizations call the city home due to the low price of electricity within the country . this news comes after previous actions by the government that have hampered the cryptocurrency scene , such as the shutdown of exchanges and current steps towards banning initial coin offerings . israel also had an effect on the bitcoin and ripple price , expressing concern over the lack of regulation around the currency and taking steps to look into regulation within the country through the government 's financial divisions . ",
        "in addition to issues from governments , sites like coinmarketcap actually contributed to the drop in bitcoin and ripple price with their reporting . with a decision to exclude data collected from south korea due to the currencies ' unusually high value in the country , investor confidence plummeted -- as did the value of many cryptocurrencies . the recent fiasco with bitconnect was also a problem , with many people losing a significant amount of money in a `` bitcoin loaning '' structure that was allegedly formatted like a ponzi scheme . invest with cautionall these factors and more have had an impact on the downturn of the currencies , but it appears as if the bitcoin and ripple price , along with the price of the majority of other cryptocurrencies , is starting to turn around from this massive drop . ",
        "only two coins dropped in value over the past 24 hours -- neblio dropped 2.8 percent to $ 28.33 and tether dropped one percent to $ 1.01 . while tether did drop slightly today , it was one of only two cryptocurrencies to actually increase in value during the massive crash on tuesday . it 's too early to call this a true recovery for the cryptocurrency scene , and many are currently viewing the bitcoin and ripple price increase with cautious optimism . if there 's one thing that 's certain , it 's that these coins are incredibly volatile . ",
        "there 's no telling what may happen in terms of cryptocurrency news over the next few days , and the price could either continue to rise or turn right around from this momentary upturn and continue to crash lower and lower . many experts agree that while cryptocurrencies may continue to see rapid growth , they 're by no means a safe investment . those who got in on the ground level with these currencies have seen massive returns with bitcoin and ripple price increases , and this recent crash has people worried about the end of the crypto scene . ",
        "however , these investments have bounced back before , so it 's definitely a real possibility that this is the start of a return to the high values we were enjoying at the end of last year . the post bitcoin and ripple price increases in possible cryptocurrency rebound appeared first on valuewalk .
