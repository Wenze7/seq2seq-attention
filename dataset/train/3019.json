        "underwater drone tech explained and the top models rankeddrones are going to be practically everywhere before too long . perhaps you 've spotted a few yourself , making deliveries in your city or maybe doing laps across your local park while its pilot watches from a distant vantage point . there 's no way around it -- drones are lots of fun ! but the funny part is , while most of us are still saving our pennies for our own sky-patrolling aircraft , the next major step for drones is already happening ... underwater . 10 best drones 2018that 's right : underwater drones are finally coming of age . ",
        "what 's the state of this technology ? and which models are the right ones for developing your inner captain nemo ? to find out , keep reading our complete guide to buying underwater drones ! why underwater drones are massively taking offdrones tickle a nearly primeval desire in the human mind to explore and learn about our environment . who would n't want to elevate themselves to a bird 's - eye view of the world ? this technology , ahem , took off in large part because of our insatiable curiosity . but consider how much less we know about the seas and oceans than we do about the skies and the clouds . ",
        "scientists with the national ocean service estimate that more than 95 percent of the earth 's oceans have so far gone unexplored . so is it any wonder why underwater drones are taking the consumer tech world by storm ? we 're not saying you 're going to catch giant squids or discover new species on your days away from the office , but merely treating ourselves to a fleeting glimpse of this underwater kingdom is privilege enough for us land-dwellers -- and an outlandish level of luxury that can surprisingly be relatively affordable . what you should consider when buying an underwater droneyou 'll likely remember the earliest airborne drones -- they were little more than novelties or kids ' toys . ",
        "many of them still are . but in just a short while , we watched as this burgeoning technology matured to the point where amateur hobbyists can now fly aircraft that require oversight from the faa . for a few hundred dollars , you can get a highly capable flying drone , spare batteries and propellers and just about everything else you need to get flying . some of the underwater drones below require physical tethers because radio signals do n't travel well through water -- this is a unique challenge airborne drones do n't have . recording low-quality , compressed video to stream it wirelessly could make the whole endeavour kind of pointless . ",
        "if video quality is your major concern -- if you 're a filmmaker or a salvage operator , for example -- tethers are going to be here for a while . also , the cleanliness of the camera lenses and sensor apertures is something else to consider . if a drone is submerged beneath hundreds of feet of water , the whole operation has to grind to a halt while the operator retrieves the drone and attends to the problem . naturally , some or all of these challenges apply to `` regular '' drones as well . they 're not tethered by a cable , but the range of our remotes and the finite lives of our lithium-based batteries still mean operating a drone comes with a limited operational window . ",
        "everything you need to hit the water this summerthe top 4 underwater drones on the marketfishing and high technology do n't sound like an obvious match , but our first entry combines them for interesting results . that 's right -- powervision 's powerray is a drone for fishermen . sensors and sonar equipment aboard the drone can feed you all kinds of data points , including the temperature of the water , what the submarine landscape looks like and whether there are any fish about . a high-powered camera can record video in 4k or stills at 12 megapixels .
