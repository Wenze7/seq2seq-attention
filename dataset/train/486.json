        "you 've probably been annoyed at one point or another by your parents breathing down your neck about grades or sats , or being totally unreasonable about something like curfew . but when you have a super strict parent , it 's an everyday struggle . while it may seem like you 're the only girl in the world whose parents are this strict , rest assured you are not alone in the parental oppression . here are things only girls with super strict parents understand . 1 . anytime you go shopping with your friends , you have to hide any new clothes your mom would n't approve of . ",
        "because if she sees the cute new mini-skirt you bought at the mall , she 'll never let you out of the house again . 2 . but that 's never stopped you from wearing them . whether it 's on the ride to school or in the bathroom before homeroom , you 've taken changing clothes on the sly to ninja levels . 3 . your parents do n't understand sleepovers . you have a bed at home . why do you have to go over a friend 's house to sleep ? the only way you 're ever allowed to go to a sleepover is if your parents are going out of town , your grandparents are n't available to `` babysit , '' and they know your friend 's parents . ",
        "and even then , they still need to talk with them on the phone for 20 minutes to make sure they have an itinerary of the night 's events . 4 . your parents have to meet any boy you want to `` hang out with '' ... even when it 's not a date . 5 . if you 're allowed to date finally , your parents want your date 's phone number . and his parents ' numbers . and the address of the movie theater you 'll be going to . and the name and showtime of the movie you 're seeing . ",
        "and the precise moment you 'll be home . and his zodiac sign . 6 . you 're the only person you know who actually has to wait until you 're 17 to see an r-rated movie . your mom would n't even make an exception so you could see jlaw 's oscar-winning performance in silver lining 's playbook . and she 's your fave actress ! 7 . your friends think you 're trying to get out of hanging with them . your friends give you major side eye because no parent can really be that strict . but they 've clearly never dealt with your parents . ",
        "8 . you have to call your friends ' parents mr. and mrs. even if they insist that you call them by their first names : `` mr. and mrs. makes us feel old . '' because ~ respect ~ , man . 9 . they stalk your facebook and insta . you laugh in your friends ' faces when they tell you to just unfriend your parents so they wo n't be able to see your profile . what they do n't know is you wo n't be able to use facebook at all if you did that ... because your parents would promptly take your computer and phone away . ",
        "10 . you get in trouble if your phone ever dies . because clearly , you let your phone die on purpose so that you would have an excuse not to tell your parents exactly where you were every hour on the hour and return their five billion texts and voicemails -- not because your battery is just really crappy and dies after you post one selfie on insta . 11 . your parents wo n't let you stay home alone . even if your parents are just going out for the night , they insist on calling your grandparents to `` babysit . '' ",
        "because only one of two things could possibly happen if you were given that much freedom : 1 -rrb- you 'll throw a raging house party and burn the house down , or 2 -rrb- some big baddie will choose that weekend to come kidnap you in your sleep . 12 . you know those teen girl rights of passage , like dying your hair , or getting your ears pierced ? nope . totally out of the question -- unless you want to try to do it yourself behind their backs . 13 . your parents insist on driving you everywhere . ",
        "your friends think they 're super nice for driving you to the movies all the time , but you know it 's just so they can constantly keep tabs on you . 14 . and getting your license does n't change anything . you 're not allowed to drive with friends in the car , after dark , if it 's raining , or on highways . basically the only time you are allowed to drive is when they need you to run an errand . 15 . there 's no way they 're letting you go far away for college . ",
        "you 've tried to bring it up as gently as possible , but if it were up to them they would homeschool you for college if they could . even though they 're super not into it , you still might have to force their hand someday . 16 . and staying in a dorm ? out of the question . they always tell you that you 'll commute in to your dream school aka they will drive you everyday to the school closest to your house where they can see your classroom from their bedroom window . 17 . ",
        "but in the end , you know they only do it because they love you . and they 're right ... sometimes .   "
