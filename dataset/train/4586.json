        "dedicated to my motheri 've been reflecting on 2017 ... in 365 days , i gone from feeling the lowest of lows to the most satisfying , `` things just feel right '' moment in my life . i started by compiling a list of everything for which i am eternally grateful ... my family & friends and the underlying framework and scaffolding to support my life . my attitude and deeply engrained never-give-up outlook which has given me the opportunity to excel in mental & physical pursuits to asymptotic extremes ... as well as to realize that it is actuallythe silence between thoughts in the pursuit of excellence where self-discovery & personal growth can be foundmy active lifestyle embracing all that our planet can offer usinstead of being entertained by activity performed by others ... my challenges , failures & injuries which likely has built me into a stronger , tougher , more flexible version of myself . ",
        "having literally run one quarter of the distance between the earth and the moon over 35 years of exploration towards the limits of myself and injuries sustained during the journey , certainly my bones are stronger than my peers ! most of all ... my optimism -- i am grateful for my openness to find more fun in the world ... perhaps more so than the average citizen of our 21st century technologically-subsidized , virtual-reality-enhanced world . when people see this ... what 's the first emotion they feel ? fear ... or ... funi 'm totally at home and grinning ear-to-ear doing thisas more difficult or seemingly impossible things become transform into `` normal '' and just another day our boundaries to experience more of life gets lowered ... yeeeehaaaaw !
