        "by greg roumeliotis and laharee chatterjee - gopro inc is considering selling itself and has hired j. p. morgan to help it with the process , a source familiar with the matter told reuters on monday . earlier in the day , the company lowered its fourth-quarter revenue forecast on weak demand for cameras in the holiday season and announced its plan to exit the drone business . the action camera maker 's shares , which fell as much as 33 percent to a record low of $ 5.04 , recouped some of their losses after the sale talks were first reported by cnbc . ",
        "`` if there are opportunities for us to unite with a bigger parent company to scale gopro even bigger , that is something that we would look at , '' chief executive nick woodman told cnbc . gopro could not immediately be reached for comment . j. p. morgan declined to comment . the company , once a wall street favorite , has seen a decline in demand for its cameras and karma drones for several quarters , and plans to cut more than 250 jobs as it restructures . gopro had 1,254 employees as of sept. . 30 . ",
        "the company said the move to exit the drone business will take place after selling the existing karma inventory , as tough regulatory hurdles in europe and the united states will likely reduce the market for drones in the years ahead . gopro , whose cameras and drones are mostly used by sports junkies and travel enthusiasts , cut the price of its latest hero6 cameras to $ 399 from $ 499 . it said the decision would hurt revenue by around $ 80 million in the fourth quarter . morgan stanley said in a research note on monday that the price cut for the hero6 camera would make earnings growth difficult in fiscal 2018 . ",
        "the company 's ceo said it saw softer demand for existing camera models . `` despite significant marketing support , we found consumers were reluctant to purchase hero5 black at the same price it launched at one year earlier , '' woodman said in a statement . the company now expects fourth-quarter revenue of $ 340 million , compared with its november projection of $ 470 million , plus or minus $ 10 million . `` cutting costs is a good move , although now it 's about if the company can turn this ship around themselves or ultimately they get consummated by a larger tech player , '' daniel ives , analyst at gbh insights , said . ",
        "woodman will also reduce his 2018 cash compensation to $ 1 , the company said .   "
