        "prague - europe 's far-right leaders including marine le pen and geert wilders will gather for a controversial conference in prague on saturday held under tight security amid protests planned to counter groups spreading xenophobia . allied within the europe of nations and freedom , a european parliament group established two years ago , the parties -- espousing strong anti-migrant and anti-eu views -- say they plan to focus on cooperation within europe outside eu bodies at the conference . le pen , who lost the french presidential election run-off to emmanuel macron in may , and wilders , head of the dutch party for freedom , will sit next to lorenzo fontana from italy 's lega nord or georg mayer from the austrian fpo . ",
        "the organisers have also listed belgium 's gerolf annemans , poland 's michal marusik , marcus pretzell from the alternative for germany and janice atkinson , a former member of britain 's ukip , among the speakers . czech police tightened security as left-wing groups announced several protests , including a blockade of the suburban area of prague where the conference will be held on saturday . police will also have their hands full with wilders , who is facing death threats over his fiery anti-islam rhetoric . protest organisers include the no to racism initiative and against hatred , another local group . ",
        "- far-right spike - the conference takes place two months after the far-right spd led by tokyo-born entrepreneur tomio okamura scored over ten-percent support in the czech general election on a staunchly anti-islam and anti-eu ticket . backed openly by le pen , the spd won 22 seats in the 200-member czech parliament amid a far-right spike across europe coming in the wake of the migrant crisis . okamura has received backing from czech president milos zeman , a veteran leftwinger known for his pro-russian , pro-chinese and anti-muslim rhetoric , who attended an spd congress last weekend . zeman , who once called the migrant crisis `` an organised invasion '' of europe and muslims `` impossible to integrate '' , is the odds-on favourite in a two-round presidential election slated for january 2018 . ",
        "paradoxically , the czech republic , which vehemently opposes the eu 's quota system for distributing migrants among its members , has received only 12 migrants under the scheme . overall , migrant numbers from the muslim world are very low in this eu member of 10.6 million people as refugees prefer wealthier european countries such as germany or sweden . czech parties nevertheless still seized on the political capital to be gained from playing on fears over terrorism and economic welfare to campaign on an anti-muslim and anti-migrant platform . by jan flemr .
