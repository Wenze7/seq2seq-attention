        "style savvy has about a dozen brands , each representing a different style . you can dress like a rocker , in psychedelic vintage clothes , or in elegant gothic lolita frills and lace . unexpectedly , my favourite brand in style savvy : styling star is basic u , which sells clothes that are basic . in previous games , the basic style was not so much a style as it was filler . if you needed a pair of shoes or an undershirt to complete an outfit , you could grab one from basic u . these are items of clothing that you never think about : plain white t-shirts , black socks , and casual sneakers . ",
        "there are circumstances in which you just wear that stuff , but in a game about being adventurous in fashion it felt out of place . in this most recent game , basic u has a little bit more of a personality . i mean , i had my doubts . when you visit basic u , this is how you 're greeted : while that is n't a particularly auspicious sentiment , when you put together an outfit from basic u , you almost always look like audrey hepburn in funny face . while a t-shirt and jeans can sometimes look sloppy , `` basic '' in style savvy : styling star evidently does n't mean `` laundry day . '' ",
        "it 's sporty , colourful and playful . its relative simplicity does n't come from not caring about fashion , but from caring more about cut and colour than embroidery or detailing . in previous games , the basic style just seemed plain boring compared to everything else . after playing around with the style in styling star , i think i might have just been wrong about that . while there 's still stuff i simply do not care for -- bootcut jeans are not a look i like -- making minor changes to my outfits using similar but not identical pieces is actually really fun . ",
        "although my in-game character owns several striped turtlenecks from basic u , some patterns look better with that one denim jacket i have , and others look better with the long parka . the choices you make when you put together an outfit in this style are tiny , but swapping out a skinny jean for a straight leg one or a turtleneck shirt and skirt for a long , knit turtleneck dress can result in a very different outfit . you 're not just throwing stuff on , you 're crafting a look . being stylish is n't necessarily about being the glitziest person in the room . ",
        "it 's also about thinking carefully about how things look with each other . i really understood this when judy , a customer from my boutique who normally asks for rocker-style clothing , said she wanted a makeover in the basic style . i had come to associate judy with plaid pants and studs ; i 'd grown fond of her through my playthrough , and i was worried that the basic style would remove some of her personality . but she does n't look boring . in fact , she 's still really cute . it 's just a little less busy . ",
        "although i still like being adventurous with avatar 's outfits in style savvy : styling star , playing around with the basic style in-game has given me some inspiration for my real life wardrobe . while wearing ball gowns every day is possible in the world of style savvy , in real life i do n't have that kind of money . i can buy a striped turtleneck and a good pair of jeans , however , and i think i 'm going to now . watch more : nintendo news .
