        "rotherham united winger ryan williams has been just as busy cheering his country to victory in the cricket as he has helping the millers climb the table in league one . australian born ryan told the football league paper that it 's been enjoyable watching his country win the ashes especially as they regained them in his home city of perth . ` yorkshire is a big cricket county and when england are doing well , there are a lot of cricket fans about , but when they are not doing as well , there are none ! ' the twenty-four year old said . ",
        "going on to talk about his football career , ryan said that some people told him he 'd never play football again after a bad pelvic injury saying , ` but i am very competitive and so i wanted to prove them wrong . ` after playing for portsmouth , fulham and barnsley ryan signed a two year deal with the millers in the summer saying , ` one of the main reasons i came to rotherham is to win promotion to the championship and i see no reason why we ca n`t mount a challenge in the second half of the season . ",
        "when i was at barnsley and we won promotion in 2016 , we were rock-bottom at christmas , so anything is possible if we keep believing and working hard . ` we had a very hard pre-season and trained for this period of the season . '   "
