        "world champion peter sagan showed his class when he won the fourth stage of the uci season-opening tour down under in south australia on friday , taking the overall lead in the process . sagan , who had a string of minor placings in the last two years of the race , finally enjoyed a win in the run into the town of urailda . the slovakian finished the stage in 3 hr 21 min 7sec to take the ochre leader 's jersey , two seconds ahead of south african daryl impey , who finished second on friday . australian jay mccarthy was in third place , nine seconds behind sagan . ",
        "sagan , from the bora-hansgrohe team , formed part of a lead group that caught race leader zak dempster on the approach to the king of the mountain climb at the top of norton summit road . he then battled defending champion and race favourite richie porte towards the finish at urailda . sagan remained in a good position at the front of the leading group as a number of riders tried to attack . but on the fast descent to the line , the 27-year-old made his move . he followed the wheel of impey before turning on the power in the final metres to take the win . ",
        "impey finished second , with spain 's luis leon sanchez , italian diego ulissi and mccarthy making up the top five . sagan said despite taking the leader 's jersey , he was expecting teammate mccarthy to take the lead on stage five , which includes two climbs up the notorious willunga hill . `` tomorrow will be again another story , '' he said . `` i 'm in the ochre jersey now but we all know we are racing here for jay . `` it 's his home race . he 'll have a much harder climb than today to have his say tomorrow . ",
        "`` sagan added that although the temperature reached 45 degrees celsius , it was not the hottest day of racing he had experienced . `` it 's been a very hard day of racing but maybe not the hottest in my career so far , as i 've experienced something slightly hotter in california a couple of years ago , '' he said .
