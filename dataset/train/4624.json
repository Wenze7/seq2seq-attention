        "to continue digging their own grave or get help for their poison of choice . this picture from a movie called `` heaven knows what '' is very relatable to me . almost two years ago when i was living downtown with some roommates i was out of money and alcohol . so i stole from them , not a lot , just enough to feel extremely guilty once sober . shots of their alcohol , money left on the floor , and eventually 2 or 3 bottles of dayquil . it was a point in my addiction that i knew was going to be one of the lowest . ",
        "i was surprised though , a full bottle of dayquil provides quite the powerful buzz . do n't try that at home kids , and do n't listen to lil wayne 's music . every person in this world is searching for something . every person gets scared along the way . surrendering to addiction is an easy way out . trust me , i 've done it . people who try to help an addict can only do so much , and can only stick around so long . if you 're someone thats never experienced addiction or been around it consider yourself lucky . ",
        "if you 're someone who 's struggling to understand someone else 's addiction watch `` heaven knows what '' . it 's on netflix . it 's not an easy watch , even less so since it 's based on a true story . it 's brutal , unforgiving , and downright disturbing . you know , the three basic food groups of addiction . i 'm glad to be sober although its only been a couple months . i 'm too mentally and emotionally exhausted to go through another relapse . i 've lost parts of myself and amazing people through this struggle . ",
        "i 'm too young to lose anybody else . i ca n't afford it , not that i ever really could anyways . i 'm one of those guys who feels things at a higher level than your average joe . whether that means i 'm overly sensitive or something else i 'm not sure . i 'm sick of having to write posts like this . post relapse post after post relapse post . oh well , eventually i wo n't have to .
