        "i have a five year-old niece who loves gymnastics , an animated show called shimmer and shine , and reading . her mom , my amazing big sister , does n't let her wear makeup yet because -- duh -- she 's five . but i suspect even when she 's older my sister will struggle with the transition -- much as our parents struggled when it was our turn to try -- because , well , it 's complicated . there are so many things i love about makeup -- my earliest memories of it are quite fond . ",
        "i 'd sneak into my parents ' bathroom , park myself in front of my mom 's vanity and play with all of the products i could find . i 've been an expert at applying liquid eyeliner since age 7 , because that 's what she had , so that 's what i learned . and while much of my exploration was driven by curiosity , i have to admit that insecurity played a role as well . i wanted to be pretty , and i wanted to be lighter-skinned like my mom and my sisters . so i 'd take her two-shades-too-light foundation and try to cover what i saw as my flawed , dark complexion . ",
        "eventually i grew out of my desire to change my skin color , but held onto the idea that makeup was a corrector -- a way to transform my perceived imperfections into assets . this is n't the relationship i have with makeup now , nor is it one i like to promote . it 's why at mented we 're so adamant about creating makeup that enhances -- not transforms -- your beauty . we love making products that celebrate a woman 's natural beauty ; it 's not a coincidence that every product we 've launched is in our signature nude color range . ",
        "the thing is , much as i love our stated goal of ` enhancing not transforming , ' there 's no denying that makeup , yes even our makeup , is transformative for many women . and what i 've come to learn is that 's ok too . because beauty is complicated . yes , we should all love the skin we 're in , and no , we should n't feel the need to cover up our flaws . but the truth is , much as i love and appreciate my skin there are days when i 've got yet another breakout , dark circles that wo n't go away , and brows that will not cooperate , and frankly i just want to cover it all up with every piece of makeup i can find . ",
        "and a mask . and a paper bag , if you 've got one . am i making sense ? i hope so . the point is , like many women i know i am in a never-ending quest to be kinder to myself . on my best days , makeup helps with that journey by giving me the extra bit of confidence i need to feel my best , but i also know that becoming overly reliant on makeup could thwart that goal , putting me in a space where i only feel beautiful when i 'm covered in products . ",
        "my hope for myself and our customers is that we can all love ourselves exactly as we are , and play dress up because we get to , not because we think we have to . * also posted on the ment at mentedcosmetics . com .   "
