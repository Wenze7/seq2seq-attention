        "caracas , venezuela -- the new leader of venezuela 's opposition-controlled national assembly pushed lawmakers toward reaching a negotiated solution with the government friday , a strategy that has sowed divisions among president nicolas maduro 's detractors . omar barboza told legislators their top priority should be ensuring a fair vote in the upcoming presidential election following colossal losses in recent races that were either boycotted by government opponents or tainted by claims of fraud . `` the great majority of venezuelans want a democratic solution to the crisis we are living , '' the 73-year-old former governor said . ",
        "`` we should achieve that pacifically . `` venezuela 's legislature is one of the few government entities that remains in opposition hands but has become essentially powerless . the government-stacked supreme court routinely declares its laws unconstitutional and an all-powerful , pro-maduro assembly installed last year has taken over its legislative authority . opposition leaders spearheaded nearly-daily demonstrations last year that brought thousands of venezuelans onto the streets in protest against maduro 's rule , but more recently have struggled to reassert themselves . recent electoral losses have left the opposition 's base disillusioned and leaders divided over whether to negotiate with a government that supporters consider illegitimate . ",
        "barboza , a seasoned opposition leader , acknowledged the opposition had made mistakes since winning a majority in congress in 2015 while also accusing the government of purposely trying to create mistrust among maduro 's foes . `` the important thing is to improve and move ahead , '' he said to applause . venezuelan government and opposition leaders held talks in december without reaching an accord but are set to meet in the dominican republic again next week . some observers have been hopeful a deal might be struck as maduro 's cash-strapped administration looks for support to refinance venezuela 's foreign debt . ",
        "barboza replaces julio borges , who led the assembly during last year 's spate of protests that left at least 120 people dead . borges is now part of the opposition 's delegation trying to reach a negotiated solution with the government . in a sign of the nation 's continued polarization the rivaling constitutional assembly held its opening session hours later friday , with leaders vowing to unite against opposition factions they characterized as `` fascists '' intent on destroying the nation . the troubled latin american nation is scheduled to hold a vote for president this year , though no date has been set .
