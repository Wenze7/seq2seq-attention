        "approach the asus booth at ces this year , and you 'll be faced with four new computers -- most excitingly of all a brand new zenbook for 2018 . see related lg 's new 65in 4k tv can be rolled up like a poster forget wallpaper , you can now turn your whole wall into a tv with samsung 's 146in giant modular setthe new zenbook 13 is a powerhouse in the ultrabook mantle . described by asus as `` superthin '' and `` superpowerful '' -- very much the opposite of your author here -- the zenbook weighs in at just 985 grams , and offers a very solid 15 hours of battery life . ",
        "despite this , it 's no slouch in the specs department , with an eighth generation i7 processor , 16 gb ram and a whopping 1 tb ssd . it even has discrete graphics in the form of the geforce mx150 . no price is provided , but you 'd imagine north of Â£ 1,500 for that little lot . next up is the less catchily titled 15.6 in asus x507 , which is positively hefty by comparison , weighing it at 1.68 kg . it packs a seventh generation i5 or i7 processor , up to 8 gb ram and either 1 tb of hard drive , or 256 gb of ssd . ",
        "graphics are either provided by the intel hd 620 or the nvidia geforce mx110 , if you fancy a little light gaming . finally , asus is pushing a pair of all-in-one computers the vivo aio v272 and vivo aio v222 . the former of these packs a 27in multitouch display with up to an eighth generation i7 processor and nvidia geforce mx150 graphics . the latter is a smaller 22in model , with a 1080p display . no other details are provided as yet , but the company did say that multiple configurations would be available for both . ",
        "all four computers will be available at some point in the first half of 2018 -- we 'll update this piece with more specifics and prices when we get confirmation from asus . asus unveils four new computers at ces , leading with a new zenbook .   "
