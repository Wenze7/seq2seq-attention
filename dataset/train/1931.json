        "you would n't know it from president donald trump 's rhetoric , but the tax overhaul coming into effect is heavily tilted to the rich . it also leaves `` obamacare '' in place , despite his assertion that the tax plan repeals the health care law . nothing about the plan provides the fuel to achieve economic growth at the levels he 's predicted . trump 's penchant for exaggeration and sometimes pure fiction has clouded the realities of the overhaul as it has shaped up over months . as for democrats , you would n't know to hear them talk that middle-class people are getting a tax cut out of the deal , too . ",
        "a look at remarks made wednesday and earlier about the tax plan trump will shortly sign into law . trump : `` it 's the largest tax cut in the history of our country . '' -- remarks wednesday . the facts : it is n't . for months trump has refused to recognize larger tax cuts in history , of which there have been many , or to grant that other presidents have enacted big tax cuts since ronald reagan in the 1980s . an october analysis by the committee for a responsible federal budget found that it would be the eighth biggest since 1918 . ",
        "as a percentage of the total economy , reagan 's 1981 cut is the biggest followed by the 1945 rollback of taxes that financed world war ii . trump 's plan is also smaller than cuts in 1948 , 1964 and 1921 , and probably in other years . valued at $ 1.5 trillion over 10 years , the plan is indeed large and expensive . but it 's much smaller than originally intended . back in the spring , it was shaping up as a $ 5.5 trillion package . even then it would have only been the third largest since 1940 as a share of gross domestic product . ",
        "vice president mike pence : `` you 're delivering on that middle-class miracle . '' -- to trump at a cabinet meeting wednesday . the facts : modest does n't make for a miracle . pence 's praise to the boss reflects trump 's assertion that `` it 's a tax bill for the middle class , '' as he put it earlier and many times , but average people are not the prime beneficiaries of the tax cuts . aside from businesses , rich people get the most . the nonpartisan tax policy center estimates the biggest benefit of the new law will go to households making $ 308,000 to $ 733,000 . ",
        "households making over that should get a tax cut worth 3.4 percent of their after-tax income . for the richest 0.1 percent , the tax cut should be worth 2.7 percent of their after-tax income . for middle-income earners : 1.6 percent , the center estimates . moreover , only high-income people would get a meaningful tax cut after 2025 , when nearly all of the plan 's individual income tax provisions are due to expire . republicans argue that the middle class will also see benefits from the business tax cuts , in the form of more jobs and higher wages . ",
        "democratic sen. charles schumer : `` their bill increases taxes on lots of middle-class people . ... according to the tax policy center , the top 1 percent of earners in our country gets 83 percent of the benefits . '' -- remarks tuesday . the facts : the tax cuts are not nearly as lopsided as many democrats are portraying them . almost all of the middle class would initially pay less in taxes . for the next eight years , the vast majority of middle-class taxpayers -- those earning between $ 49,000 and $ 86,000 -- will receive a tax cut , albeit a small one . ",
        "in 2018 , nine-tenths of the middle class will get a cut , according to the tax policy center . in 2025 , 87 percent will . the tax cut wo n't be very big : just $ 930 next year for the middle one-fifth of taxpayers , the center 's analysis concludes . for those paid twice a month , that 's about $ 40 a paycheck . schumer and other democrats are basing their assertions on the fact that nearly all personal tax cuts expire after 2025 , which would result in a slight tax increase for about two-thirds of the middle class by 2027 . ",
        "the top 1 percent would still get a cut that year . only in 2027 do the wealthiest taxpayers get 83 percent of the benefit , as schumer says . in 2018 , roughly 21 percent of the tax cut 's benefits go to the richest 1 percent , a much smaller figure , though still a disproportionate share . just 11 percent will go to the middle one-fifth . rep. nancy pelosi , house democratic leader : `` 86 million middle class families get a tax hike . '' -- tweet wednesday . the facts : she 's ignoring all the middle class tax cuts before 2027 ; that year , taxes will be slightly higher for the middle class unless the cuts are extended . ",
        "trump on his tax legislation : `` obamacare has been repealed in this bill . '' -- remarks wednesday . the facts : it has n't . the tax plan ends fines for people who do n't carry health insurance . that 's a major change but far from the dismantling of the law . other marquee components of obama 's law remain , such as the medicaid expansion serving low-income adults , protections that shield people with pre-existing medical conditions from being denied coverage or charged higher premiums , income-based subsidies for consumers buying individual health insurance policies , the requirement that insurers cover `` essential '' health benefits , and the mandate that larger employers provide coverage to their workers or face fines . ",
        "also , the tax bill does n't repeal fines for uninsured individuals until the start of 2019 , meaning the `` individual mandate '' is still in force for next year unless the administration acts to waive the penalties . trump : `` when the individual mandate is being repealed , that means obamacare is being repealed because they get their money from the individual mandate . '' -- remarks wednesday . the facts : this is also wrong . the fines on people who do n't carry health insurance only provide a small fraction of the financing for the program . ",
        "most of the money comes from higher taxes on upper-income people , cuts in medicare payments to service providers , and other tax increases . the congressional budget office estimated that fines from uninsured people would total $ 3 billion this year , while the government 's cost for the coverage provided under the health law would total about $ 117 billion . trump : `` so we 're at 3.3 percent gdp . i see no reason why we do n't go to 4 percent , 5 percent and even 6 percent . '' speaks of gdp `` getting up to 4 , 5 , and even 6 percent , because i think that 's possible . '' ",
        "-- cabinet meeting last week . the facts : there are no signs the economy is capable of delivering a phenomenal and rarely achieved growth rate in the order of 6 percent , or 5 or even 4 . federal reserve officials and most mainstream economists expect economic growth to hew closer to 2 percent . the economy last cleared the 6 percent hurdle in 1984 and only for that fleeting year , at 7.3 percent . this was a different time , when baby boomers were at prime working ages , instead of today when they 're starting to retire . ",
        "the federal reserve had boosted growth by steadily slashing a key interest rate from its 1981 peak of 20 percent , while the fed today is slowly increasing the same rate . also , the national debt was much lower . trump 's tax cuts are forecast to max out at roughly $ 280 billion in 2019 , says congress ' joint committee on taxation . yet to generate growth of 6 percent , those cuts would have to spur a massive $ 1.2 trillion gain to the gross domestic product . no administration analysis emerged to show how this could be possible . ",
        "house speaker paul ryan : `` we are making things so simple that you can do your taxes on a form the size of a postcard . '' -- remarks when the tax bill came out nov. . 2 . the facts : do n't count on it . few accountants would agree that simplification has been achieved . the combination of temporary provisions , partial elimination of deductions and other loopholes , and differing tax rates for business income and wages in the new law has , if anything , added further complications . some middle-class taxpayers may see simpler returns because the standard deduction has doubled in size , to $ 24,000 for a married couple . ",
        "some families will probably stop taking deductions for things like mortgage interest as a result , making their tax returns easier to file . but people who give heavily to charity , for example , will still have to run through their receipts to see if they 're better off with the standard deduction or itemization . many business owners and upper-income taxpayers are faced with a host of new complexities : should high-paid employees try to reclassify their salaries as business income , which will now be subject to a lower tax rate ? if so , what will they do in eight years , when the lower rate on business income is set to expire ? ",
        "are they losing their deduction for state and local taxes , which can be worth tens of thousands of dollars for wealthier taxpayers ? many will , but it may not matter if they paid the alternative minimum tax in previous years , which overrode those deductions . these types of questions will keep accountants busy for months , if not longer . trump on the tax plan : `` so there 's a great spirit for it , people want to see it . '' -- fox business interview in october . the facts : polling does n't find that spirit . ",
        "in an nbc-wall street journal poll this week , 41 percent said the tax plan is a bad idea , 24 percent said it was good . that 's a deterioration in support over two months . a quinnipiac university poll this month found that registered voters , convinced that the benefits will flow mainly to corporations and the wealthy , oppose the plan 55 percent to 26 percent . in a gallup poll in september , just 2 percent of respondents named taxes as the country 's most important problem . dissatisfaction with government , race relations and immigration were among the issues at the forefront . ",
        "a survey this month by cbs news found that 53 percent americans say they pay about the right amount in taxes , while 40 percent say they pay more than their fair share . that same survey found 52 percent said corporations pay less than their fair share . the president 's plan will cut the corporate tax rate to from 35 percent to 21 percent . associated press writers josh boak and ricardo alonso-zaldivar contributed to this report . find ap fact checks at .
