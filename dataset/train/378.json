        "a man was beginning some home renovations when he made an incredible discovery . while renovating his house , a homeowner knocked down a wall in his basement , which revealed a large tunnel , according to the daily mail . as he explored further , he discovered there was so much more . the man went into the newly revealed tunnel to discover that underneath his home was a hidden ancient city . it was later revealed to be the lost underground city of derinkuyu . the city , which is an astonishing 18 stories deep , was once home to an estimated 20,000 people and stored livestock and food supplies to feed the residents . ",
        "derinkuyu is thought to have been constructed during the byzantine era in 780-1180 a. d . it is believed that the underground network of tunnels may have been used as a giant bunker to protect inhabitants during the arab-byzantine wars , as well as from natural disasters . the tunnels included a number of rooms , such as kitchens , stables , churches , wells , communal rooms , schools and tombs . the discovery was made in nevsehir province in turkey in 1963 , reports the daily mail . the underground city had about 600 entrances through which inhabitants could enter and leave . ",
        "heavy stone doors that blocked the entryways closed from the inside to keep intruders out . the city featured all the amenities of a regular city , as well as a fully functioning air ventilation system , according to mad world news . derinkuyu is not the only city of its kind , but it is thought to be one of the largest in existence . some archeologists believe there may be hundreds of underground cities in turkey 's cappadocia region alone . while only about one-half of the city is accessible today , the site has become a popular tourist attraction in turkey . ",
        "the website sometimes interesting provided insight into the cappadocia region and how underground cities such as derinkuyu were able to exist : the cappadocia region of anatolia is rich in volcanic history and sits on a plateau around 3,300 feet tall . the area was buried in ash millions of years ago creating the lava domes and rough pyramids seen today . erosion of the sedimentary rock left pocked spires and stone minarets . volcanic ash deposits consist of a softer rock -- something the hittites of cappadocia discovered thousands of years ago when they began carving out rooms from the rock . ",
        "it began with storage and underground food lockers ; the subterranean voids maintained a constant temperature , protecting the contents from exposure to harsher surface weather extremes . the underground tunneling would also serve a bigger purpose : protect the hittites from attack . the exact dates are unknown , but estimates range the tunnels first appeared between the 15th century and 12th century bce . the hittites were believed to have used the tunnels to hide from phrygian raids . those who subscribe to this theory point to the historic account of the phrygian destruction of hittite city hattusa , along with the identification of a small number of hittite-related artifacts found in the tunnels . ",
        "an alternative suggestion has the phrygians first building the tunnels later , between the 8th and 7th centuries bce . they explain the discovered hittite artifacts as being remnants from the spoils of war . this theory is reinforced by reputation : phrygian architects are considered by archaeologists to be among the finest of the iron age , and known to have engaged in complex construction projects . because the phrygians are known to have possessed the necessary skills and inhabited the region for a long time , they are often credited with first creating the underground city at derinkuyu .
