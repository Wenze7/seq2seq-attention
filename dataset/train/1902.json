        "sean raggett made his norwich city debut in the canaries ' victory at bristol city . the central defender , who joined up with daniel farke 's side earlier this month following the culmination of his loan at lincoln city , was a 95th minute substitute for nelson oliveira in the 1-0 success at ashton gate . raggett 's appearance for the norfolk club could be good news for the imps . farke is assessing raggett before deciding whether to keep him at carrow road or send him back out on loan . under fifa rules , players can only play for two clubs in a single season , so if raggett is sent out on loan again this season it can now only be to the imps . ",
        "raggett 's appearance has scuppered any hopes bradford city had of signing the player . the league one bantams had been linked with a loan swoop for raggett . speaking after the imps ' 2-2 draw with notts county , cowley said he was proud of the former dover athletic defender . `` it 's good news for him and i 'm really proud of him , '' said cowley . `` he 's a boy we took from dover , where he was a part-time player , and he 's worked so hard at his game . he 's now made his championship debut . '' ",
        "when asked if raggett 's appearance for norwich has raised his hopes of bringing the player back to sincil bank , cowley said : `` i do n't think sean will be thinking of coming back here after making his championship debut . we 'll just wait and see . '' regular midfielder michael bostwick has replaced raggett in the heart of the imps ' defence for the last two games , while centre-back james wilson was an unused substitute against notts following his arrival after leaving sheffield united by mutual consent .
