        "luxor , egypt - egypt 's authorities on saturday revealed artifacts and a linen-wrapped mummified body , possibly that of a top official , from two tombs that were discovered two decades ago in the nile city of luxor but had not been fully unexplored . the ministry of antiquities said the tombs , located in the draa abul naga necropolis on luxor 's west bank , had been noted by german archaeologist frederica kampp in 1990s and were either unexcavated or had never been entered . along with the mummy , archaeologists found painted wooden funeral masks and several hundred carved statues , likely dating around the end of egypt 's 17th dynasty or the start of the 18th dynasty , the ministry said . ",
        "egypt 's relics are a draw for foreign visitors and authorities hope new finds can help attract more as a way to help revive tourism hit by unrest that followed the ouster of former president hosni mubarak in 2011 . in september , egyptian archaeologists announced the discovery of a tomb of a prominent goldsmith who lived more than 3,000 years ago , unearthing statues , mummies and jewelry in the latest major find near luxor .
