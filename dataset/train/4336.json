        "2/2 . Â© bloomberg . attendees walk through during heavy snowfall outside the congress center ahead of the world economic forum in davos , switzerland , on monday , jan. . 22 , 2018 . world leaders , influential executives , bankers and policy makers attend the 48th annual meeting of the world economic forum in davos from jan. . 23 - 26 . 2/2 . -- enjoy the party while it lasts : that was the opening day message for the corporate and political leaders attending the world economic forum 's annual meeting . booming stock markets and the best global economic growth in seven years are fueling record levels of optimism among chief executives , according to a survey released by pricewaterhousecoopers llp late monday in davos , switzerland . ",
        "but just hours earlier , the international monetary fund used the gathering to argue that while the outlook for this year and the next was better than previously anticipated , a recession may be closer than many acknowledge and that investors and policy makers should guard against complacency . the combination of optimism and caution will set the tone for a week of meetings a decade after the worst financial crisis since the great depression wrong-footed davos delegates . among the current risks : potential irrational exuberance in financial markets , surging debt in china and elsewhere as well as political flash points from brexit to north korea . ",
        "`` the bull market seems to be steamrollering over everyone who has a bearish view , '' said tim adams , president of the institute of international finance who will be in davos . `` but there 's a lot of complacency . there are termites in the foundation and a number of those are gnawing away at night . '' it 's a conflicted backdrop for world leaders and global executives gathering for the meetings that this year will host u. s. president donald trump , indian prime minister narendra modi and french president emmanuel macron , along with many leading ceos . ",
        "in some ways the davos meeting should be a cause for celebration . after years of sluggish growth , the world economy is finally taking off . the imf upgraded its outlook for this year and the next by 0.2 percentage point each , pushing its forecast for worldwide expansion for both 2018 and 2019 to 3.9 percent , the highest level since 2011 . trump 's recent tax cut was cited as one reason for the pickup . the lender said the global recovery now under way is the broadest in seven years , with gross domestic product rising last year in 120 countries which together account for three-quarters of world output . ",
        "the optimism was mirrored by pwc 's survey . fifty-seven percent of about 1,300 ceos polled by the global consultancy saw brightening prospects for the world 's economy in the next 12 months . that was almost double the amount last year and the largest increase since the firm started asking about the world economy in 2012 . optimism among u. s. business leaders in the international environment has more than doubled to 59 percent after trump 's election had ushered in a period of uncertainty , pwc said . faith in the economy turned executives optimistic about their own companies ' outlooks . ",
        "forty-two percent said they were `` very confident '' in their own firm 's prospects for the coming year , up from 38 percent last year . retaining top talent at companies has risen to the top concern of global chief executives as fears of an economic slump have receded from their biggest worry last year , according to a separate poll by the conference board released last week . `` with the stock markets booming and gdp predicted to grow in most major markets around the world , it 's no surprise ceos are so bullish , '' said bob moritz , pwc 's global chairman . ",
        "there still remains doubt over whether the good times can last . in a briefing to reporters , imf officials were at pains to stress that the world economy was still plagued by uncertainty and that governments should use the current window of stability to prepare for a future downturn . while the u. s. tax cut may give the world a lift now , it could end up exacerbating america 's trade and budget gaps , leading to a slowdown later on . `` the next recession may be closer than we think , and the ammunition with which to combat it is much more limited than a decade ago , '' said maurice obstfeld , the imf 's economic counselor , at a press briefing in davos on monday . ",
        "there are several reasons to doubt the durability of the recovery , including advanced economies approaching the limits of their growth potential and the likelihood that expansions in the world 's two biggest economies -- the u. s. and china -- will slow , obstfeld said . mark machin , chief executive officer of the canada pension plan investment board , also sounded a note of caution . `` given where asset prices have run to now , it 's unlikely we can expect very high asset-price returns over the next few years , '' he said in a bloomberg tv interview in davos . ",
        "`` i think they are going to be quite depressed . ''   "
