        "by martyn herman london - premier league leaders manchester city extended their winning sequence to 17 with a 4-0 victory over bournemouth on saturday after champions chelsea suffered a goalless stalemate at everton to fall even further adrift . pep guardiola 's side began their extraordinary run away to bournemouth in late summer with 97th-minute winner from raheem sterling but found the south coast side an easier nut to crack this time with sterling again on target . sergio aguero also scored twice and danilo completed the rout as record-breaking city reached christmas with 55 points and 60 goals . ",
        "they are 14 points ahead of manchester united who play their 19th game of the season later at leicester city . chelsea are two points further back with 39 points , a total that in an ordinary season would have put them in the title mix for christmas , but they were left frustrated at a misty goodison park after 25 goal attempts came to nothing . `` i think we dominated the game and lots of chances to score . i think it is unfair result . everton deserve credit but we deserve to win , '' chelsea manager antonio conte , deprived of suspended top scorer alvaro morata , said . ",
        "at the other end of the table newcastle united ended a run of nine league games without a win to beat west ham united 3-2 at the london stadium and move out of the relegation zone . marko arnautovic opened the scoring for west ham but henri saivet , mo diame and christian atsu were on target for the magpies who moved up to 15th with 18 points , a point ahead of west ham who slipped down to 17th . stoke city arrested their worrying slide down the table to beat second-from-bottom west bromwich albion 3-1 while bottom club swansea city , who sacked manager paul clement this week , drew 1-1 at home to crystal palace . ",
        "bournemouth joined west brom and swansea in the drop zone . brighton and hove albion eased their relegation fears as pascal gross scored the only goal against watford to give the seagulls a first win in eight games . watford have now lost four in a row and five of their last six . huddersfield town remained comfortably in mid-table as they came from a goal down to draw 1-1 at southampton . sixth-placed burnley take on seventh-placed tottenham hotspur later on saturday .
