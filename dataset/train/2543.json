        "samsung has revealed an innovative lab experiment it 's working on are glasses to help those who struggle to see . samsung is working on a new pair of glasses that aim to help the visually impaired . a project at the company called relúmĭno had previously revealed an app that uses a phone in a headset - similar to the samsung gear vr - to help those with visual difficulties see better . the company has now revealed it wants to make the tech even more accessible by including it in a pair of glasses that are a similar size to your average pair of sunglasses . ",
        "clearing things upthe relúmĭno app would usually use the processing power and battery of your phone to work , but it 's thought samsung will one day be able to shrink this down to a pair of shades and make it something you can wear on a daily basis . although this is currently just a concept technology , it has modes for different visual difficulties . the mode the company calls ` regular ' makes the outlines of images clearer to attempt to make the users vision less blurry . for reading there 's a mode called color invert that makes it easier to read the written word by putting the text on a high contrast background . ",
        "there are also modes for those who suffer from central vision loss and tunnel vision . helping the visually impaired is a big project for a lot of tech companies right now as we 've seen microsoft hard at work on its seeing ai app that helps describe what the phone can see . whether we 'll ever see these glasses make their way to market is a different question . this is part of samsung 's new concept tech it will show off at ces 2018 including a new respiratory medical device called gobreath as well as a speaker that uses super directional sound to limit its volume .
