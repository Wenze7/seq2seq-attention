        "welcome to the world of `` melt-up '' , a phrase we could be hearing a lot in coming months . it describes the idea that the us stock market , despite currently looking absurdly expensive by traditional yardsticks , could be set for one last euphoric hurrah before the inevitable crash happens . there are a couple of reasons why the `` melt-up '' theory may not be as wacky as it sounds . first , it comes from jeremy grantham , an investor who has rightly earned a reputation for knowing how to read financial bubbles . he dodged the end-of-the-century dotcom bubble and the 2007-09 blowup in the us housing market - two of the best calls anybody could have made in the past 20 years . ",
        "grantham 's default setting , as you would expect , tends to be bearish , or at least cautious . if he 's talking `` melt-up , '' that 's newsworthy . besides , gmo , the boston-based fund management group he founded , manages $ 75bn of assets - he 's a player . a second reason is that grantham is certainly not arguing that shares are cheap . `` we can be as certain as we ever get in stock market analysis that the current price is exceptionally high , '' he states . instead , his melt-up thinking is driven by a `` mish-mash of statistical and psychological factors based on previous eras '' . ",
        "global markets end on record high after adding $ 9tn in 2017on the statistical side , he points out that the global economy is in sync , profit margins are fat and president trump 's corporate tax cuts could make them even fatter and `` perhaps provide the oomph to keep stock prices rising '' . then there 's the fact that the current strength in the stock market is fairly broad-based . in past bubbles , the end was nigh when gains were concentrated in an increasingly small collection of `` winners '' . the likes of apple are roaring this time , but the same divergence has not occurred - yet . ",
        "for `` touchy-feely '' evidence of excess about to appear , grantham looks at media coverage . us newspapers and tv stations are getting interested in financial markets but not yet with wild obsession of the frenzied dotcom years . `` keep an eye on what the tvs at lunchtime eateries are showing , '' he says . grantham 's guess is that there is more than a 50 % chance of a melt-up , or end-phase of the bubble , within the next six months to two years . if it happens , then there 's a 90 % probability of a melt-down , which could mean a halving of share prices from the peak . ",
        "a credible theory ? well , yes , anything is possible . a year ago , when the dow jones industrial average passed 20,000 , few thought it would hit 25,000 within 12 months - but it happened on thursday . is that a case of extreme euphoria , or just early signs of it ? given the impossibility of knowing , grantham 's advice to `` brace yourself '' sounds reasonable . brace , and keep a clear eye on the exit . debenhams christmas tidings not as joyful as chief predictedeight months ago the chief executive of debenhams , sergio bucher , was telling investors he would make the tired-looking department store group `` a destination , digital and different '' . ",
        "he did n't quite disavow discounting , but the tactic would be deployed less often and with more impact . nice idea , shame about the results . even before the completion of one lap of a three-year plan , debenhams has coughed up a horrible profits warning that imperils shareholders ' dividends , even if nobody is saying so yet . profits for the full year will arrive at £ 55m - £ 65m . call that a plunge of a third from last year 's £ 95m . poor christmas at debenhams prompts surprise profit warningdebenhams 's christmas grumbles sound familiar . ",
        "the report was a long complaint about the `` highly competitive '' and `` promotion-driven '' state of the market , especially on `` gifts '' , which is shorthand for everything from booze to christmas crackers . that wo n't cut much ice with investors . the likes of b&m , with its cheap 'n' cheerful sheds , are n't going away . one ca n't , of course , judge a three-year revival plan on the basis of one bad christmas . equally , however , you ca n't blame investors for taking a gloomy view - the shares plunged 15 % and debenhams is now worth just £ 370m . ",
        "five years ago , the business was making £ 139m of pre-tax profits and the downwards trend has been consistent . borrowings are lower than they were in the bad old days of private equity ownership , as the company keeps saying , but the current `` medium-term financial leverage target '' is to reduce net debt to 0.5 times top-line operating profits . the new profits forecast may mean no progress whatsoever from last year 's 1.3 times . that is why a dividend costing £ 42m a year looks unsustainable - the theoretical dividend yield of 11 % says as much . ",
        "bucher came from amazon , where they do n't have to worry about excess store space , long leaseholds or even shareholders ' dividend expectations . good luck - this job looks much harder .   "
