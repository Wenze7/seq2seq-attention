        "albanian lawmakers from the rightwing opposition on monday threw smoke bombs into a hall of parliament to protest the election by the ruling socialists of a new attorney general . before the vote , rightwing opposition leader lulzim basha had criticised socialist prime minister edi rama for wanting to appoint a `` puppet '' to follow his commands . the accusation comes amid an investigation into saimir tahiri , a close ally of rama 's and until march albania 's interior minister , who is accused of having links to international cannabis trafficking . opposition mps tried in vain monday to stop the proceedings , but arta marku was eventually sworn in as interim attorney general as smoke still filled the room . ",
        "marku 's appointment `` is a constitutional violation and can lead to a destabilisation of the country , '' basha had said sunday night . he said the job of naming a new attorney general should fall to the prosecutor 's office high council , as a plan to reform the current law , which has not yet been voted on , has laid out . rama `` is asking us to violate the constitution because he wants an attorney general under his thumb , '' basha added . marku is due to fill the role for the next two to three months , or until a new prosecution high council has been created . ",
        "several thousand activists also protested outside parliament , chanting : `` rama , go away ! '' some demonstrators tried to enter the cordoned-off building , which led to stampedes .   "
