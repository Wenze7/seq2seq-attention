        "in a complicated case , a mexican man was n't found guilty of a white girl 's death . that 's angered conservativesmatthew rozsa2017-12-01t13 : 03:56 z • 2017-12-01t13:03:56z • 0 commentsan undocumented immigrant who shot and killed a young woman in 2015 on a san francisco pier was acquitted of homicide charges . it could be proof that the justice system is imperfect , and guilty people sometimes go free . but that 's not how conservatives are seeing the verdict . kate steinle was shot in the back by jose ines garcia zarate while walking with her father on the pier . ",
        "the trial itself focused extensively on the testimony of ballistics experts . prosecutors argued that zarate had deliberately shot steinle ; the defense claimed her death was a freak accident . the jury ultimately sided with the defense , finding zarate guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm but deciding that he had not intentionally taken steinle 's life . an important fact , per nbc , was , `` the bullet that felled steinle ricocheted off the pier 's concrete walkway before it struck her . `` zarate was in the custody of the local sheriff 's department prior to the shooting . ",
        "he had completed a federal sentence for illegal re-entering the united states and been transferred to a san francisco jail in march 2015 on a charge of selling marijuana . that marijuana charge was subsequently dropped , however , and the sheriff 's office released him even though federal immigration authorities wanted to keep zarate so that he could be deported . after the verdict was announced , trump used it in a twitter rant to promote his wall-building and anti-immigrant agenda , as well as take swipes at democratic leaders . trump was incorrect when claiming that zarate had been `` exonerated . '' ",
        "zarate may even wind up serving time in jail ; since the crime for which he was convicted carries with it a sentence of 16 months , two years or three years , he could be incarcerated once the two years he already served for his previous offense is credited to him . despite san francisco 's status as a sanctuary city , garcia will be deported , because its policy is to turn over undocumented immigrants if the federal government has a warrant for their arrest . notably , this observation came from sarah rumpf of red state , who despite the website 's right-leaning perspective argued , `` the main issue is that the defense was able to present a credible case that the shooting was an accident , and the prosecution aggressively overplayed their hand . ",
        "add in a misguided police interrogation strategy and you have reasonable doubt . `` these facts did not stop trump 's attorney general , jeff sessions , from using the case 's verdict to push for his long-time goal of harsher anti-immigrant policies . matthew rozsamatthew rozsa is a breaking news writer for salon . he holds an ma in history from rutgers university-newark and his work has appeared in mic , quartz and msnbc .
