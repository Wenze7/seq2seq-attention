        "crypto-currencies have many advantages . do n't overlook the disadvantages . here begins a series exloring the pros and cons of crypto-currencies . `` that would have made a perfectly reasonable title , '' you 're thinking , `` simple and easy to understand : exploring the pros and cons of crypto-currencies . '' yea , sure , but experience has taught that dramatic titles pique curiosity and motivate people to expend the energy of clicking from twitter to medium . so we 're sticking with `` demons in digital gold '' for the duration . notwithstanding the title , the objective of this series is a balanced understanding of crypto-currencies . ",
        "pros and cons . advantages and disadvantages . yin and yang . given that the advantages of crypto-currencies get a lot of ink , i am going to spend less time on that side of the debate and most of the time on the disadvantages side . i am not overtly biased , i am simply being practical . you want a full treatise with equal time spent on both sides of every facet ? wait for the book . motivationcrypto-currency discussions tend to extoll the advantages at great length . trade-offs and compromises -- to say nothing of weaknesses -- are breezily dismissed or just plain overlooked . ",
        "the motivation for this series is to provoke balanced thinking . so we need to put stuff on both sides of the balance , hence the focus on little-addressed disadvantages . i 'm here to lay out facts that you may have overlooked . you 're here to reach your own conclusions . the importance of contextdemons in digital gold will spend more time on crypto-currency challenges , shortcomings , vulnerabilities , and the ilk . these issues are presented to develop a more complete and more balanced understanding . prepared with the additional knowledge , you can weigh the evidence and reach better informed conclusions . ",
        "please keep the context in mind as you read the series , it will make the journey more constructive for all of us . bitcoin this series addresses crypto-currencies in general . any such discussion quite naturally included bitcoin , and i will use the term `` bitcoin '' as an alternative to `` crypto-currencies . '' sometimes i 'll use plain-old `` bitcoin '' as the same general placeholder , because i can be lazy like that . many elements are broadly applicable across crypto-currencies , for example , custodianship . some elements are the opposite , for example , transaction fees . ",
        "in the latter case , i will strive to be specific : `` the recent jump in transaction fees impacting bitcoin and ether is not an issue for bitcoin cash and litecoin . '' so i will strive to differentiate between the general and the specific ... but do n't be too surprised if you catch the occasional over-generalization . perspectives : past , present , futurein the land of crypto-currencies , theses are often built on one perspective ... past : `` as the original whitepaper clearly articulated ... '' present : `` transaction fees are absolutely unacceptable ... '' future : `` mining will consume more energy than produced by the sun ... '' ... and by `` built '' what i really mean is `` myopically focused . '' ",
        "for example , someone will argue a section of the whitepaper until they are blue in the face , without paying heed to the situation on the ground here and now . someone will be consumed by a just-over-the-horizon challenge , without recognizing that the machinery is working surprisingly well right now . this series focuses on the present perspective , because we live here . i will often incorporate the past perspective , because a lot of people and a lot of the literature lean on `` satoshi 's vision . '' no dig there : it is useful to consider intentions from the start of the journey , as it helps explain how we got here . ",
        "we will also talk about the future , to illustrate if we are headed in the right direction for an objective . valuea reoccurring element will be value , specifically customer-perceived value . i have lived in silicon valley quite some time , and i quickly recognized the siren song of technology : we are often blinded by cool technology and lose focus on delivering actual value to normal humans . that is how someone thought `` people want to buy vegetables in foil packets with a $ 700 machine to press them into juice ! '' and someone else gave them $ 120m to run with such a batshit crazy idea . ",
        "full disclosure : i have personally fallen for the siren song of technology over the years . i built an internal checklist to keep away from the rocks . it includes questions such as : what problem are we solving ? do real humans -- outside of silicon valley -- consider it a problem ? is our solution better than the alternatives in the customers ' eyes ? what value will customers ascribe to our solution ? posts in this series ... bitcoin you 're hodling may be a derivative the ` gold ' is fairly obvious ... the ` digital ' is kind of implied ... the ` demons ' require imagination .
