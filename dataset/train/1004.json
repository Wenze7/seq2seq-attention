        "lagos - long queues formed at petrol stations across nigeria tuesday , with motorists sometimes waiting up to 24 hours to fill up their tanks , as africa 's number one oil producer faces a crippling fuel shortage . `` i could n't travel . i would have loved to travel to osun state to spend time with my family , but i cancelled on that one , '' motorist tope alake told afp as he waited at one of the few petrol stations still open in lagos , nigeria 's economic capital . `` i am supposed to be at home now , '' said another driver , alex ogunsola . ",
        "`` i am supposed to take the kids to the beach . i am on queue and i am not even sure if i am going to see fuel today . '' monster traffic jams have clogged up nigeria this christmas , which had been hoping to enjoy a happier holiday season this year than in 2016 , when the country was deep in economic recession . given the scale of the shortage , everyone involved is eager to lay the blame at somebody else 's door . the distributors are pointing the finger at the nigerian national petroleum company , which does not have sufficient resources to meet the demands of the country , with its population of 190 million people . ",
        "under orders from the government in abuja , nnpc 's chief maitanki baru unveiled a national plan on monday to deliver an additional 300 million litres of petrol to `` support the current consumption of 45 million litres per day '' -- much higher than the normal demand of 27-28 million litres per day due to the holiday period . baru also pointed out that the national refineries in port harcourt and kaduna were producing 3.8 million litres of refined petrol per day , a paltry amount give that nigeria is africa 's biggest exporter of crude . the nnpc chief also blamed black market vendors for purposely paralysing petrol stations so as to push up parallel selling prices to 400 naira , compared with 145 naira normally . ",
        "at the same time , consumers suspect the government of creating a chaotic situation in order to justify an increase in diesel and petrol prices at the pump next year . the crisis is particularly serious in a country where the public electricity supply is weak and where businesses and private individuals rely on their diesel generator for lighting .
