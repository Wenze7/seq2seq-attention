        "ash puriri feels like `` a cat landing on its feet '' , now that he 's completed his phd in māori tourism . his research is unprecedented , and uses a kaupapa māori methodology -- the first time this has been done in a business doctorate . he is the first of his tribe , ngāti kahungunu , to receive a phd in tourism and is the first doctor of his family . he 'll graduate from the university of waikato on december 11 . read more : * double reason to celebrate * huge crowd for hamilton party puriri has always been aware of the importance of tourism . ",
        "the crooner spent more than 20 years performing on cruise ships around the world , after winning the first episode of australia 's star struck as barry white . since then , everything `` exploded into a whole new stratosphere , '' he said . as waikato tourism limited director , puriri now manages cultural performances on cruise ships , so travellers can earn a `` beautiful , touchstone experience '' before they 've arrived in the country . there are 132 ships docking in new zealand every cruise season , he said , and the performance team recruit 157 contracts a year . ",
        "`` i 've got teams of māori that have come from normal homes , who are now working on five and six-star cruises . it 's a phenomenal opportunity . '' puriri 's doctoral thesis is a research project that will help māori and new zealanders develop and navigate through the challenges of establishing a cultural tourism experience . he worked with a māori family over the four year period who had this particular vision . puriri found that new zealand 's east and west coast had an unrepresented supply of māori tourism , despite māori owning most of the cultural land . ",
        "`` tourism is $ 34.7 billion contributor to the new zealand economy and in that , māori play a distinctive role in our unique tourism experience , '' he said . `` the waitangi tribunal treaty settlements have reached over $ 800m dollars . and māori tribes that have settled have all expressed an interest in wanting to invest into māori tourism but have n't known how . '' puriri said the thesis acts as a `` road map '' for māori , iwi and the government to navigate through the milieu of challenges that māori potentially face developing and investing in the tourism industry . ",
        "he is the first person to apply a kaupapa māori methodology for a business doctorate . this means his research has been conducted without using any western methods , something that has dominated a business setting . `` initially , i was using a mixed method , but as i engaged more with this māori whanau , i could see the lack of relevance a western mixed method would provide them . '' there is a long way to go until māori tourism reaches its full potential , puriri said . he is registering through the process of starting a post-doctorate , which will include the printing and publication of an academic textbook of māori and indigenous tourism development .
