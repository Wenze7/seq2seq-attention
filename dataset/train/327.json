        "some 1,800 people , including hesder yeshiva students , have signed a letter of support for safed chief rabbi shmuel eliyahu after he called for idf chief of staff gadi eisenkot to be fired for his stance on mixed-gender service in the army . eliyahu spoke last week in defense of rabbi shlomo aviner , another conservative national-religious leader , who ruled that religious men should not enlist in the army at present because , he claimed , it can not be guaranteed that they will not have to serve in a unit with women . `` if he has reached this situation where he said what he did , then apparently eisenkot needs to wake up , and the prime minister needs to tell him to go home , '' eliyahu told army radio . ",
        "in the letter of support published on wednesday , the 1,806 signatories said they wished to `` give support to the rabbi against the attacks on him from the press and different politicians , '' saying that these elements were trying to dictate what a rabbi may or may not say . `` we , the sons and daughters of religious zionism , including hesder yeshiva students , vigorously protest the injury to the honor of the rabbi , '' they wrote . the signatories said that eliyahu `` bears good will to every jew as he is , '' and is devoted to jewish law . ",
        "`` anyone who tries to paint as a benighted person , god forbid , is mistaken and is deceiving others due to their total lack of acquaintance with the rabbi . '' they said that the idf was important to them , and see it as `` a central part of the redemption of the jewish people and the return to the land of israel . '' but , they added , `` jewish law , the spirit of the torah , and spirituality are no less important to us -- and even more so , '' and therefore thanked eliyahu and other rabbis for fighting for their ability `` to serve the jewish people without injuring the principles that are important to us . '' ",
        "the jerusalem post was unable to independently verify the number of signatories to the letter . despite eliyahu and aviner 's claims , the new idf joint service protocol states explicitly that mixed-gender combat units must have tracks for gender-separate training and service at the company level for enlisted religious soldiers who do not want to serve in the mixed-gender track . likewise , any officer or non-commissioned officer who is placed in a mixed-gender combat unit has the right to appeal this decision to the head of the idf manpower directorate , whose decision should be based on the opinion of the idf chief rabbi `` and consideration for the faith of the officer or nco . '' ",
        "later on wednesday , idf spokesman brig. - gen. ronen manelis described eliyahu 's comments about eisenkot as `` unnecessary , '' and called on the safed chief rabbi , as a public servant with heavy influence , to behave responsibly . manelis also rejected arguments that a recently recorded decrease in motivation to enlist in combat units in the idf had resulted from the new joint service protocol . `` in the places where we have mixed-gender service , it is n't only that there is no problem with motivation but rather that there is too much motivation , '' manelis said on radio 103fm , implying that those units receive too many applications . ",
        "`` the units where there is a challenge regarding motivation , for all sorts of reasons , there is no problem of joint service . therefore , this idea that people connect between the joint service protocol and the motivation of combat soldiers is contrary to the facts . '' during his interview , manelis also stated that claims that a meeting between sephardi chief rabbi yitzhak yosef and idf chief rabbi brig. - gen. eyal karim were canceled by defense minister avigdor liberman because of comments made by yosef in support of eliyahu were wrong , saying that the meeting had been canceled due to technical reasons . ",
        "he said the meeting would be rescheduled in the coming days . however , liberman 's office later issued a statement which appeared to contradict manelis 's version of events , saying that `` liberman has approved the idf to hold a meeting between karim and the sephardi chief rabbi , '' implying that until now he had not consented to such a meeting .
