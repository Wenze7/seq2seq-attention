        "graeme murty has claimed that rangers ' goalless draw at celtic is the first step on their `` journey '' back to success . the visitors put in a solid display at parkhead , with alfredo morelos coming close to scoring through several clear-cut openings . gers boss murty was proud of his team 's display against the champions and insists that the performance must be built upon . `` it was well deserved , '' the 43-year-old told sky sports news . `` they had moments in the first half where we were fortunate and made good blocks , good saves . ",
        "but we had opportunities to go and win the game . i 'm really proud of the way the players stood up to a big challenge at a great stadium . `` we could have won the game . but i ca n't fault the guys , they gave me absolutely everything today . i feel now as though we 're at the start of a very big job but it was a fantastic first step to take today . `` you have to accept what the players give you and today they gave me top notch levels that we have to use as fuel going forward . ",
        "we ca n't take a backwards step from here . `` i said to the players when i walked out of this place last time it was with a sense of ` well done ' , i sit here now with a real sense of a journey we are just starting out on and we have to use that moving forward . the stalemate keeps third-placed gers 11 points behind the scottish premiership leaders .
