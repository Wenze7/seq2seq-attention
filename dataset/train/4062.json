        "sydney - after years of futile efforts , a fresh hunt for mh370 has set off for the remote indian ocean -- and the top australian scientist who helped pinpoint the new search zone is hopeful the missing jet can be found within weeks . armed with oceanographic analyses and a high-tech search vessel , the latest search for the boeing 777 , which vanished in march 2014 carrying 239 people , kicked off on monday run by private exploration firm ocean infinity , in the hope of solving one of aviation 's most enduring mysteries . an earlier australia-led search -- the largest-ever in aviation history -- scoured 120,000 square kilometres far off the island continent 's west coast for 28 months but found no trace of the aircraft , and the hunt was suspended last january . ",
        "`` we 're hopeful that they could find the aircraft within the first month of the search , '' oceanographer david griffin of csiro , australia 's leading national agency for scientific research , told afp . `` malaysia has given them three months to complete the search . so we 're into the first week now . we could hear something from them in the next couple of weeks , '' said griffin , who met with the ocean infinity team in london last month . - no find , no fee - ocean infinity has a huge incentive to find the plane . ",
        "as part of the deal , the private team will only be paid if they find the jet or its black boxes , with up to us$ 70 million on offer if they are successful . the search relies on a multitude of evidence and analysis that has allowed scientists over the past four years to zero in on likely crash sites . the new findings also allowed griffin and his team of experts to identify a specific starting point for the search ship seabed constructor some 2,000 kilometres west-southwest of perth in western australia . the remote site is just north of the former search zone and near the `` seventh arc '' , a long stretch of water where the plane was calculated to have emitted a final satellite `` handshake '' . ",
        "a 25,000-square-kilometre zone north of the previous probe area was first identified by experts in late 2016 , and the team worked to reduce it further . they used drift modelling to analyse where three confirmed mh370 fragments found on western indian ocean shores between 2015-16 may have originated . but the light-bulb moment came when they realised the absence of debris washing up in western australia was also a key clue , griffin said . only a malaysia airlines towelette was found on australia 's west coast in july 2014 , but authorities said then it could not be conclusively linked to mh370 . ",
        "`` it 's fairly specific advice about where the plane crashed there are n't many places along that arc which are consistent with the absence of debris on the australian coast , '' griffin told afp . ruling out areas north and south along or near the seventh arc that were already searched , they analysed the middle band of latitudes and found only 35 degrees south had a current flow that was to the west towards africa . the refined search zone also fitted in with four french satellite images taken two weeks after the crash that showed at least 70 identifiable objects floating close by . ",
        "although analyses of the satellite imagery did not conclusively identify the objects as coming from mh370 , griffin said it showed an unusually high number of large pieces of floating debris . `` we saw all these large white objects , some of them 60 square metres ... right at the location where you would expect them to be if the aircraft had crashed at 35.6 s 92.8 e , '' he said . - high-tech hunt - the satellite analysis fuelled calls from grieving relatives for a new search , with the malaysian government eventually commissioning ocean infinity . ",
        "hopes that the new mission might finally find the wreckage have also been raised by the high-tech tools being used . seabed constructor carries eight autonomous drones equipped with sonar and cameras that can operate in depths of up to 6,000 metres . they are `` free flying '' vehicles , allowing them to move deeper and collect higher quality data than the tethered drones used in the earlier search . this means the priority search areas are likely to be scoured and the data collected much faster . but griffin warned that even if the new search area contains the final resting place of mh370 , the most visible parts of the wreckage such as the engines could be in areas that are difficult to see or embedded deep in the ocean floor . ",
        "australia 's former transport minister darren chester , who was in charge during the previous hunt , likewise cautioned that the difficult underwater conditions in treacherous waters could throw up challenges . `` i 'm hopeful for a successful search in the weeks and months ahead but lets not pretend it 's going to be easy , '' he told sky news australia .
