        "by bruce levine -- . -- with a stagnant free-agent market , the cubs continue to look at numerous ways to improve their starting pitching with just seven weeks until spring training . the cubs have added right-hander tyler chatwood on a three-year contract , with vision of him replacing the innings that john lackey filled . replacing right-hander jake arrieta -- or possibly bringing him back ? -- is now the top goal of the cubs . on dec. . 18 , cubs executives theo epstein and jed hoyer held a face-to-face meeting with free-agent right-hander yu darvish in the dallas area . ",
        "darvish , 31 , is the cubs ' top target at this point . talks with agent scott boras , who represents arrieta , have been hushed to this point . epstein indicated during the winter meetings earlier in december that he would get to talking with boras , but nothing regarding those conversations has been made public since then . the cubs are well aware of what arrieta is expecting in the way of an offer , sources said . six years and $ 160 million was said to be the beginning point in negotiations in november , sources said . ",
        "both darvish and arrieta want five-year deals or longer . at one point it seemed that free-agent right-hander alex cobb would sign with the cubs . that 's still a possibility , but his market jumped in both years and money at the winter meetings . it once looked like a three-year , $ 45-million deal would get it done for cobb . now , it appears a four-year or five-year deal is expected . dan horwits , cobb 's agent , has denied a report that the cobb camp was asking for $ 20 million annually . the cubs have also continued to explore the trade market for starting pitching . ",
        "rays right-hander chris archer , pirates right-hnader gerrit cole and tigers right-hander michael fulmer are top-of-the-rotation pitchers who are available , per sources . trading resources off of their 25-man roster would be painful for the cubs and hurt their depth , but they do have room to maneuver there . the cubs have an abundance of outfielders who could be trade chips in the form of ian happ , kyle schwarber and albert almora . middle infielders addison russell and javier baez would bring back a top-flight pitchers if one is moved . both russell and baez are under team control for for four more years . ",
        "russell turns 24 in january , while baez turned 25 earlier this month . it would be a difficult , multi-layered decision for the cubs to trade russell or baez . russell missed about six weeks with a foot injury last season , and baez filled in admirably in his absence . there 's no clear depth in the farm system by way of middle infielders , as most of the next wave of cubs prospects will be young pitchers . the free-agent market has been extremely slow to develop . chatwood 's three-year , $ 38-million deal is the biggest for any pitcher this offseason . ",
        "carlos santana 's three-year , $ 60-million deal with the phillies is the biggest for any player . bruce levine covers the cubs and white sox for 670 the score and cbschicago . com . follow him on twitter @mlbbrucelevine .   "
