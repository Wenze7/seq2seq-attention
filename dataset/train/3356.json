        "why is it that every time we try to achieve a big goal or pursue that dream we sometimes feel we ca n't make it and quit ? i certainly experienced it before . the feeling of `` i ca n't take it anymore '' and drop whatever i was aspiring to do . it 's funny ... we get so motivated by all the possibilities but when it 's time to actually get stuff done , we seem to wander . we procrastinate and postpone our big dreams to a later time . we enjoy the results . better yet , we enjoy the fantasising about the lifestyle but when it comes to putting in the work , we do n't feel like it . ",
        "we think `` if it 's meant to be , it will be '' or `` it 's just not the right time to do it '' . after these thoughts , we slowly find ourselves succumbing to short-term gratification . so why does this happen ? is it the fear and pressure of not making it ? for some . is it because it 's not our purpose or destiny ? maybe . i am tremendously passionate about this question : what does it take to create lasting change in our life ? why do we do what we do ? ",
        "i believe it 's because of 2 things . these 2 factors will determine if you will ever get what you want . it 's simple , but it 's not easy . if you are able to become a master in these 2 areas ... then my friend ... as scarface said , `` the world is yours and everything in it '' . the first one is visionv i s i o n. i wrote it a second time because it is so important ! without a vision , a clear picture of who we want to be and how we want our life to be like , we will never get there . ",
        "whatever that `` there '' is for you . we have to be masters at seeking clarity . not only about our goals , but about who we want to be , how our lifestyle will look like , and how we treat others . being clear on what we want is not enough . we also need to be clear on how to get there . this seems simple . but , the main reason most people do n't get what they want is because they have no clue of how to get there . after you define what is that you truly want . ",
        "define how to get it . this is where research comes in , studying others that are doing the job or living the life you want to live . learn from them . study them . like tony robbins , one of my personal influencers , said : `` success leaves clues '' . it does . and if you look for them , you will find the path . or even better , you will use it to create your own path . now , let 's assume you got really clear on what you want , and how to get there . ",
        "you have detailed 1-year goals , and an action plan with monthly metrics , and a vision of who you want to become . that 's good . but once again that is not enough ... i do n't want to be a buzz killer , but this is the reality . it 's not easy and you would n't want it to be . if it was , everyone would be doing it . so what is the second factor that will determine if you will succeed ? the second one is discomfortyeah , you read that right . ",
        "`` but andre , does n't following my dreams and working on my passion makes me happier ? '' yes ... and no ... but ultimately yes ... let me explain . yes , because it 's what you should be doing . your passion gives you creativity and makes you work harder and better because you enjoy it . it will give you the most meaning in your work . no , because to get good at something and achieve tremendous success , you will need to go through discomfort and resistance . the whispering of immediate gratification and procrastination will always be there . ",
        "it will be right in your ear when you need to finish that project or hit the gym or work on something important . but that does n't matter . what matters is how you react to it . do not give in , at least not now . do what you 're supposed to be doing to get to where you 're supposed to get . if you want to be successful you will inevitably leave your comfort zone . do it step by step . but do it . it 's a pre-requisite to be great . every impactful individual did it , so can you . ",
        "it takes time but it 's worth it . so , yeah sometimes pursuing your dreams and goals will kinda suck but so does that 9 -- 5 or living with regrets . ultimately yes , it will be awesome . because as humans , we are the happiest and most engaged when we develop ourselves . when we have something to go for . facing your fears , battling resistance , and comfort will make you stronger and happier . it is what we are here to do . to surpass ourselves . the competition is not with others . ",
        "it 's with ourselves . every day is a new opportunity to do just that . enjoy the process and the journey because if you do this , you will get there . you will be like the ones you admire . they did it . all the great ones do . every successful individual comes to a point in their lives where their vision of who they want to become is greater than their need for comfort . once you get to that point ... then my friend ... it 's a matter of time until you become who you know you are . ",
        "accept the challenge every day . give your best . the world needs more of that . until next time , stay strong , andr√© valente .   "
