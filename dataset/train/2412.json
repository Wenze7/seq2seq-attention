        "palestinian president mahmoud abbas denounced us president donald trump 's middle east peace efforts as the `` slap of the century '' on sunday after the white house recognized jerusalem as israel 's capital . abbas also said israel had `` ended '' the landmark oslo peace accords of the 1990s with its actions , while branding the us ambassadors to the un and to israel , nikki haley and david friedman , a `` disgrace '' . `` we said ` no ' to trump , ` we will not accept your project ' , '' abbas said at the start of a key meeting of palestinian leaders on how to face trump 's declaration . ",
        "`` the deal of the century is the slap of the century and we will not accept it , '' he added , referring to trump 's pledge to reach the `` ultimate deal '' -- israeli-palestinian peace . abbas made his comments at the opening ceremony of the meeting taking place on sunday and monday in a marathon speech that lasted some two hours . the meeting was called in the wake of trump 's december 6 declaration on jerusalem that deeply angered the palestinians . abbas had previously said the united states could no longer play any role in the middle east peace process after trump 's move . ",
        "on sunday , he said the palestinians were calling for an internationally led process in which the united states was not the mediator . he said the ramallah meeting must take decisions on how to move forward . `` i am saying that oslo , there is no oslo , '' abbas said , referring to the agreements that led to the creation of the palestinian authority and envisioned a final resolution to the conflict . `` israel ended oslo .
