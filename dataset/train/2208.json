        "by maureen langley , news 221 , ball state universitymuncie , ind. . -- if you 're short one ingredient for dinner , where do you go ? maybe you 'll drive to wal-mart , target or aldi to get what you need . if you live in muncie 's northeast side , which is a food desert , and do n't have transportation , your options may be limited to whatever gas station or convenience store is within walking distance . what is it ? according to the united states department of agriculture , a food desert is `` urban neighborhoods and rural towns without ready access to fresh , healthy , and affordable food . ",
        "instead of supermarkets and grocery stores , these communities may have no food access or are served only by fast food restaurants and convenience stores that offer few healthy , affordable food options . `` they do n't have enough nutritious food but a lot of what they eat are empty calories , '' said adrienne knight , wic dietitian . `` so on top of that , they 're gaining weight and long-term have more health problems . '' but , there are a couple more parameters from the usda that are defined geographically using census tracts , which are comparable to neighborhoods . ",
        "food deserts qualify as low-income communities based on having a poverty rate of 20 percent or greater . food desert communities qualify as low-income communities based on having a poverty rate of 20 percent or greater or a median family income at or below 80 percent of the area median family income . one-third of the population in these neighborhoods live more than one mile from a grocery store . `` many factors contribute to different problems when it comes to food accessibility , such as transportation , location of food sources , income , funding , culture , and more , '' said chelsie jaramillo , the community wellness coordinator with the delaware county purdue extension office . ",
        "the problemaccording to sarah ponto-rivera , programs manager of second harvest food bank , the decrease in grocery stores in the muncie community has put a significant amount of stress on community members when it comes to accessing food . `` they may be feeling a crutch on their budget due to an increase in travel to a further store , and may have troubles with a two-hour bus ride to get groceries because it does n't fit into their busy schedule of balancing their work schedule and family life , '' she said . it 's greater than just not having access to healthy food . ",
        "`` when someone is hungry they ca n't reach their full potential as a productive employee , community member , or parent , '' ponto-rivera said . `` and when children are hungry they ca n't focus on learning and growing because they are focused on getting their basic needs met . '' the united states census reports a third of muncie 's population lives in poverty . furthermore , according to `` the grocery gap , '' a research publication by the food trust and policylink , low-income zip codes have 25 percent fewer chain supermarkets . it 's not easy for people living in food deserts to purchase healthy food . ",
        "`` it 's cheaper to eat mcdonalds than to take two buses and buy produce , and there 's only so much you can take home on the bus , '' knight said . decreasing the burdenas with many socioeconomic problems , there may not be a concrete solution to this problem , but there are a few things on the federal and local levels that could lessen the strain on the people in these communities . snap , or the federal government 's supplemental nutrition assistance program , is the program formerly known as food stamps . it 's designed to help you stretch a budget and buy healthy food . ",
        "in this program , you receive benefits via an ebt card , which works similarly to a debit card . it 's a federal entitlement program , so anyone who needs help will receive help . according to jaramillo , prior to 2018 delaware county was one of only two counties in the state of indiana that did n't offer snap , or food stamps , at local farmers markets . at the end of the 2018 season , the county will have five markets or farmers approved to accept snap . do you live in a small area such as a tiny apartment or a college dorm ? ",
        "small space gardening could be for you . edible muncie is an non-profit organization that brings together a community of food pantries in the area . they 've partnered with the united way , muncie urban gardening initiative , and the second harvest food bank . `` each organization works towards a different aspect of the problem , '' jaramillo said . second harvest food bank has a program called school pantry , which aids in providing healthier options to children . `` we provide at least 3 to 4 fresh produce item options and at least one protein item to families at the school , '' ponto-rivera said . ",
        "`` though this is only one step to help relieve that issue and is not the only solution . '' throughout the summer months , the open door food market located downtown in front of the open door health services building , allows community members to use snap and wic benefits so they can purchase up to $ 25 in fresh fruits and vegetables . if you need food assistance or would like to help relieve hunger in muncie , visit ediblemuncie . org . do you live in muncie 's food desert or another one ? find out using the usda 's food desert locator .
