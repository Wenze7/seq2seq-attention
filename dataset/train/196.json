        "cnn host brooke baldwin was shocked and surprised by what rep. debbie wasserman schultz responded when she was asked what democrats gained by forcing the government shutdown . here 's the video of the exchange : here 's what she said : `` what one thing can you point out that the democrats , that leader schumer , what one thing did he get from republicans to justify shutting down the government in the first place ? '' baldwin asked . `` so the one thing i would say that he did get , is the potential for momentum , '' schultz responded . ",
        "`` because if , and i 'm certainly hopeful that uh , that 's what occurs , '' she explained , `` but if the majority leader , mr. mcconnell can be taken at his word , and over the next three weeks , before february 8th , they can negotiate on protecting the dreamers , on making sure that we can have a full year comprehensive budget that lifts the caps , that really makes sure that we can responsibly budget again , then maybe we can be in a position to get the house and the president to come on board . ''",
        "`` congresswoman , i 'm still hung up , '' baldwin interrupted , `` and i know americans are listening and they heard you say , and it 's reverberating , potential for momentum , and they 're thinking potential for momentum ? '' `` was that really worth shutting the government down for ? '' she added . `` the potential for something ? '' `` i will tell you that republicans should be asking themselves that question , because they shut the government down , '' schultz responded . `` this is a trump shutdown , brooke , they control the white house , the house and the senate . '' ",
        "`` they have the full ability to have passed a budget , done whatever they wanted , and they could n't because they know the way they are trying to approach funding the government is irresponsible , '' she added . mcconnell 's word senate majority leader mcconnell told democrats that he would have a vote on former president obama 's daca amnesty program for illegal aliens brought into the country as children . `` should these issues not be resolved by the time the funding bill before us expires on feb. . 8 , so long as the government remains open , it would be my intention to take up legislation here in the senate that would address daca , border security and related issues as well as disaster relief , '' he explained monday .
