        "when dirk nowitzki passed the 30,000 point mark last season , everyone thought he had hit his final milestone . however , the dallas mavericks long time forward may still have one more mile marker on his road to the hall of fame . aside from being number 6 on the all time scoring list , dirk nowitzki has some other pretty amazing accomplishments in his career . he has a championship ring , a finals mvp award , and nba mvp award , and is among a very select group of players who has played an entire 20 seasons with one franchise . ",
        "looking at dirk 's stats , however , you can see that he is among the all-time league leaders in many different categories . dirk 's current rankings in various stats include : 6th on all-time scoring list , 6th in career games played , 6th in career minutes played , 8th in career field goals made , 20th in 2-point field goals made , 11th in 3-point field goals made , 6th in career defensive rebounds , 28th in total rebounds , 53rd in career blocks , and 16th in career free throw percentage . if you are like me , then you want to know exactly what dirk needs to do to move up on all of these lists . ",
        "well look no further , because here is everything you need to know . for dirk to pass wilt chamberlain on the nba all-time scoring list , he needs to score a total of 724 points before he calls it a career . dirk is currently sitting at 30 , 695 while wilt is at 31,419 . to score those 724 points in the remaining 46 games of the season , dirk would need to score an average of 15.8 points per game . he is currently averaging 12.1 so far this season . although this seems fairly insignificant for the most part , it would be really something amazing if dirk nowitzki was a top 5 scorer in nba history for a time . ",
        "there is no doubt that lebron would pass him in no time , but the fact would still be there . dirk has been underrated his entire career and that would really put him in the conversation with the most elite scorers of all time . another stat that dirk can move up in would be career games played . dirk is 32 games away from kevin garnett and 46 from karl malone . if he plays the entire season , nowitzki could be tied for 4th in career games played , which is no small feat for a guy with dirk 's height and build .

        "dallas , tx -- december 2 : dirk nowitzki # 41 of the dallas mavericks looks on against the la clippers on december 2 , 2017 at the american airlines center in dallas , texas . note to user : user expressly acknowledges and agrees that , by downloading and or using this photograph , user is consenting to the terms and conditions of the getty images license agreement . mandatory copyright notice : copyright 2017 nbae next would be career minutes , as dirk would need only 411 minutes to pass elvin hayes and 522 minutes from jason kidd . ",
        "dirk is currently averaging 25.4 minutes per game and would need to average 9 minutes per game to pass hayes and 11.4 minutes to pass kidd . if he can keep his average over 18 minutes a game for the rest of the season , dirk could also overtake kevin garnett for third overall . for dirk to move into 7th overall in all-time made field goals , he would need to make less than 3 shots per night in order to pass elvin hayes . he only needs 4 more 2-point field goals to pass jerry west for 19th overall , while his chances of moving up in made 3-point field goals is very slim . ",
        "dirk would need to pull down an average of 1.7 defensive rebounds per night to pass hakeem olajuwon for 5th overall , while he would need an average of 3.6 total rebounds per night to pass dolph schayes for 27th overall . for blocked shots , dirk would need 34 in the rest of the season to move forward to 52nd , or he can just get 7 more blocks than deandre jordan over the next few games . needless to say , dirk will be moving up on many lists and making his case even more obvious for a first ballot hall of fame career . ",
        "it would be really amazing to see dirk nowitzki sneak into the top 5 all-time scoring list , but even if he does n't , no one can take away what he has done on the court . despite what kareem abdul-jabbar thinks , it is very clear that dirk does a whole lot more than just shoot . it 's time for kareem to get a prescription in those sports goggles . dirk may or may not be hanging it up this summer , but if he decides to leave , his legacy will live on as one of the best to ever step on the court and certainly one of the best to ever step off of it .
