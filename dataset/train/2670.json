        "doha - one of the season 's traditional curtain-raisers , the qatar open , begins monday but with the late withdrawal of novak djokovic the tournament is shorn of its usual a-list headline acts . djokovic , the champion in doha for the past two years , pulled out on saturday because of continuing problems with a niggling elbow injury . his absence was bad news personally -- placing doubts over his participation in january 's australian open -- and potentially also for the tournament , which in the past few seasons has earned a growing reputation . last year the serbian superstar beat britain 's andy murray , then world number one , in a thrilling , three-set final in front of a sell-out doha crowd which included members of bayern munich 's football team , in qatar for winter training , and paris saint-germain chief , nasser al-khelaifi . ",
        "the year before , djokovic destroyed rafa nadal in the final , dropping just three games against the spaniard in a breathtaking display to take the title , an ideal warm-up before claiming his sixth australian open crown a few weeks later . this year , though , the field in qatar is less eye-catching but may provide an opportunity for the new stars of tennis to push through . with djokovic gone , the number one seeding has been handed to the world number five , dominic thiem . the austrian is looking to rebuild on an initially promising 2017 , when he reached the semi-finals of the french open before losing in paris to eventual champion and current world number one nadal . ",
        "thiem warmed up for qatar by appearing at the mubadala world tennis championship in neighbouring united arab emirates , where he lost on friday to eventual tournament winner kevin anderson . thiem , 24 , could be one of the next generation of tennis stars to capitalise on the current woes of the sport 's biggest names , even as soon as next month 's first grand slam in melbourne . with djokovic and murray recovering from long-term injuries , and nadal still recuperating from a knee problem , the time could be right for players such as thiem to push through to the next level . ",
        "he has been handed a first-round match , due to take place on new year 's day , against russia 's evgeny donskoy . number two seed in doha will be pablo carreno busta , 26 , the world number 10 . he has been drawn against croatia 's borna coric , another player tipped to emerge over the next few years as the old guard eventually leaves the world stage . these two could be pushed hard in doha by veteran tomas berdych . the czech star , 32 , has gone close on two occasions in qatar , being eliminated in the past two seasons in the semi-finals . ",
        "the top quartet of seeds is completed by spain 's albert ramos vinolas , the world number 23 . also in the field is fellow spaniard fernando verdasco , who reached the semi-finals last year before losing to djokovic in three sets , and france 's gael monfils . by david harding .   "
