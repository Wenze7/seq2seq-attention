        "los angeles -- `` just money . lots of money . `` so goes will smith 's tongue-in-cheek summation of why he took on what has turned into one of the worst reviewed films of the season , the big-budget netflix release `` bright . `` the seasoned film cop and science fiction star does it all over again , playing a police officer with racist feelings against his otherworldly partner who happens to be an orc in a land also occupied by elves , fairies and at least one centaur . smith 's officer ward has just returned to the job after being shot and is assigned to reunite with the rookie nick jakoby , the first orc to serve with the lapd . ",
        "jakoby is played by joel edgerton . edgerton joined smith during a recent round of interviews in los angeles and agreed that the issue of racism grew more and more important as filming went on . `` not because the topic suddenly became a more kind of evolved or new topic , '' edgerton said . `` it just so happened that there are a lot of really bad things happening that were newsworthy . and when things become newsworthy , unfortunately the subject of how we treat each other and the policies on a bigger scale that are in place in order to allow people to feel ok about treating other people badly became more and more a sort of magnify thing , i think , as we were making it . ",
        "`` smith considers science fiction `` emotionally distant and safe for the audience , so you get to talk about things and say and do things that you really could n't if you were trying to hit the subject on the head . `` that 's exactly what his character does , he said , going `` straight down the middle on the insanity of these racist concepts , but it does n't feel like that because of the nature of the world . `` smith has been in the business for 30 years and said his expectations are quite different now with every job . ",
        "`` the release of a film used to be everything and my entire career and everything was on the line , every time i put something out . and now i 'm looking at my life is my art , more than one film or one piece of entertainment , '' smith said . `` it 's just kind of a brush stroke . so i 'm just looking to make something that if one person finds some joy or some assistance with moving forward in their life then that 's successful for me . `` edgerton 's take ? ",
        "`` but it would be better if there were like 200 million . `` when it came to `` bright , '' smith said , he actually enjoyed the freedom netflix provided . the film is in select theaters and on netflix starting friday .   "
