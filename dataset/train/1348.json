        "the new york rangers ' center depth is being sorely tested after an injury to kevin hayes . the new york rangers ' season is seemingly teetering on the edge . with no regulation wins in their previous ten games before beating philadelphia on january 16 , questions abound . one of the more interesting is the status of kevin hayes , who was banged up against vegas before the rangers ' bye week . he played in their first game after , a 7-2 loss vs. the islanders , but was on the injury report against pittsburgh and philadelphia . ",
        "absent his top shutdown center , head coach alain vigneault elected to send boo nieves back to the ahl , call up peter holland , and shift j. t. miller to center . vigneault 's move paid off in the short term -- the rangers beat the flyers , 5-1 . holland had a shorthanded assist , but it was the play of rick nash that moved the needle . most of all , it was miscues on philadelphia 's part that led to multiple breakaways . without hayes , it would be foolish to assume the rangers will consistently win games like that . ",
        "a center lineup of mika zibanejad , miller , holland , and david desharnais is among the worst in the league . related story : moves rangers should make before trade deadline hayes ' evolving valuesince the derek stepan trade , hayes has become the new york rangers ' most important even-strength center . vigneault depends on hayes to duel opponents ' best players . on top of that , hayes has evolved into a key penalty killer . while the rangers ' power play has been inconsistent at times , their penalty kill is among the best in the league . ",
        "though his scoring is down this season , it 's more important for the rangers that hayes keeps rounding out his game . under vigneault 's system , which depends on defensive turnovers and rush attacks , hayes ' role must be effective . besides , hayes ' reduced offensive numbers are in part due to his reduced power play time . vigneault 's insistence on playing desharnais on the second unit means hayes has gotten very little opportunity with the man advantage . the result is that hayes must produce at even strength against other teams ' top lines . ",
        "it 's a lot to ask from a young center in just his fourth season , but that 's the reality under vigneault . related story : is it time for rangers to wave white flag on 2017-18 ? managing healthperhaps most concerning for the new york rangers is hayes ' health . he has missed two straight games , and played only three minutes against vegas before being injured . while injuries happen to everyone , and there 's no predicting them , it 's troubling how the team handled hayes . he played against the islanders after the bye week . ",
        "but he was clearly not 100 % healthy , as he has n't played since . there was no indication that hayes aggravated a healed injury , as he played big minutes against the islanders . if he was n't totally healthy and was sent onto the ice anyway , it smacks of desperation . ryan mcdonagh was forced into a similar situation this year , too . the fact that the rangers are in such a poor situation that they must play injured players simply to stay afloat is an indictment on both the coaching staff and the trainers .
