        "louisville , ky. . -- in the fall of 2015 , global spirits producer heaven hill was on its way to becoming a corporate villain in louisville 's poverty-stricken california community . the family-owned company had been linked to a proposed methane plant that had west louisville residents outraged . and though the project ultimately folded , a wedge had been driven between the distillery and its neighbors . in the past two years , however , heaven hill has quietly shifted its image from enemy to hero . west louisville leaders now praise the company for its participation in community services and events . ",
        "they say they would n't be able to assist as many people without heaven hill donations . and they wish more corporations would follow suit . how did this change take place ? first , heaven hill admitted its mistake . the company -- known for producing evan williams and other bourbons -- has operated a distillery on breckinridge street in the california neighborhood since 1999 . when it first moved in , owner max shapira and his family members promised then metro councilman george unseld that the distillery would serve as a good neighbor by getting involved with the surrounding community , said larry kass , director of trade relations . ",
        "but over the years , heaven hill failed to become a strong player in the neighborhood 's revitalization efforts -- something made evident to the shapira family during the methane plant protests , kass said . `` it is one of those things where , at the end of the day , our relationship with the community was strengthened by that experience , '' kass said . '' ... it did force us to talk to a lot of people . today , a lot of people that were very much opposed to that project are people that support what we 're doing . ",
        "`` now , heaven hill runs a charitable giving program that 's donated thousands of dollars to nonprofits doing work in california and other west louisville neighborhoods . projects funded through the program include turkey giveaways with community connections in portland ; cold food storage for dare to care food bank ; and the restoration of vacant homes through jesus and a job . the donations have enabled leaders of the assisted nonprofits to stretch their operations and better address residents ' needs . but more than the money , the leaders say they appreciate heaven hill 's desire to spend time with nonprofits ' participants . ",
        "`` they show up at every event , they want to know how they can help behind the scenes , '' said james linton , co-founder of community connections . `` that 's a great partnership . i was shocked how much they worked and work with us on putting these events together . `` rev. charles elliott , the pastor at king solomon missionary baptist church , said heaven hill has supported the california church 's jesus and a job program , which puts unemployed men to work renovating vacant homes . last year , the distillery also provided a free ride on the belle of louisville for 50 families who 'd experienced homicides . ",
        "`` when i got acquainted with heaven hill , they had not been involved as much as they should have been involved , and they admitted that , '' elliott said . `` some of the reason was they did n't know who to get involved with . `` i can say a lot of good things about them . but they put their money and their heart in it . that 's what counts . `` heaven hill has facilities and offices in downtown louisville , st. matthews and bardstown , kentucky , as well . but kass said a disproportionate amount of the company 's charitable funds go toward educational , health and cultural enrichment efforts in the west end . ",
        "in fall 2017 , the company completed a $ 25-million expansion of its california distillery . and this year , it plans to use momentum from that project to continue its work with west louisville organizations . `` i want to stress that we are fairly quiet in what we do , '' kass said . `` we do it because it 's the right thing to do . ... we 're happy to be now looked at as really a kind of very positive force in louisville in general and the west end .
