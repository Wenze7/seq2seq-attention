        "jerusalem - israeli archaeologists announced sunday they have uncovered a rare site dating back some half a million years -- just next to a modern highway and only several metres underground . archaeologists envision the site at jaljulia , northeast of tel aviv , as a sort of `` paradise '' for prehistoric hunter-gatherers , with a stream , vegetation and an abundance of animals . they have uncovered hundreds of flint handaxes as part of the dig just next to route 6 , one of israel 's busiest highways , the israel antiquities authority said . `` it 's hard to believe that between jaljulia and highway 6 , five metres below the surface , an ancient landscape some half of a million years old has been so amazingly preserved , '' ran barkai , head of tel aviv university 's archaeology department , which participated in the dig , said in a statement . ",
        "he added that `` for people , it was like a paradise , so they came here again and again . `` the site is associated with homo erectus , a direct ancestor of today 's humans . the dig began at the site squeezed between jaljulia and the highway because of construction plans for the area , which required archaeological approval beforehand , the antiquities authority said . according to the authority , prehistoric humans may have returned to the area as part of a seasonal cycle .
