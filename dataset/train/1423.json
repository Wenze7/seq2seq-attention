        "what is blockchain ? i first heard about it in 2010 : bitcoin , the currency of the future . apparently some software nerds and cryptography hobbyists had come up with a virtual currency concept which used a shared online registry to track and verify all transactions and ownership , the `` blockchain '' . the original thinking behind this concept was that this would allow for highly secure anonymous currency transactions without the involvement of pesky financial institutions or governments . users who assigned computational power to verifying the transaction registry and discovering new cryptographic `` blocks '' that further add to the security of the blockchain were awarded with new bitcoins in order to incentivize involvement with this distributed currency network . ",
        "this process is called bitcoin mining . early bitcoini do n't know if bitcoin was meant to be an actual global currency solution in some utopian future , a thought exercise , or some sort of new security . however , i would bet on thought exercise . for the first 2 -- 3 years of its existence , the only users of bitcoin were silicon valley nerds . the `` currency '' could not be used for much , it was mainly a novelty . right through 2014 , there were few vendors accepting bitcoin and the perceived buying power and corresponding transaction volume was low . ",
        "the value of a bitcoin is completely uncoupled from any other currency or commodity . this is fine , the gold standard by which paper currency could be traded for a fixed amount of gold bullion was abandoned by nearly every country after world war 2 . however , bitcoin has no insurance agency like the fdic backing up the registry , no pegged exchange rate , and no virtually no regulation . bitcoin was started in 2009 . by 2012 there were as many as 7,000 bitcoin transactions per day . by 2014 , there were as many as 50,000 per day . ",
        "i remember reading about how this could be the currency of choice for terrorists and drug dealers world wide . correspondingly , the price increased from less than $ 10 per coin to around $ 200 per coin over the same 2012 -- 2014 time period . bitcoin started out 2017 priced around $ 1,000 per coin with almost 300k daily transactions . by june it was above $ 2,000 . i initially looked at the uptick in bitcoin value as an anti-trump hedge against a new recession ; i sold a bunch of positions myself right after the election , and i doubt it was trump 's base bidding up bitcoin in the first half of the year . ",
        "when investors get nervous , they flock to things that are uncoupled from the dollar/us economy , gold started a record run from 2008 -- 2010 right on the heels of the great recession . maybe bitcoin was just another hedge against the dollar ? what it is nowsince june things have gone crazy . the bitcoin transaction volume has n't really increased at all , still around 300k per day , but the price has exploded to around $ 20,000 per coin at the peak and i bet it goes higher . there are 100,000 vendors that accept bitcoin , although i ca n't say i have come across many of them and i bet there are only a handful that matter . ",
        "since the number of `` mined '' coins can only increase , and the apparent usefulness of bitcoin has not changed , this price increase seems to be entirely driven by speculation , more and more investors ready and willing to trade real dollars for bitcoin . there has been no underlying change in value , there is no interest rate , no central bank , and nothing preventing bitcoin from going to zero . unlike a share of stock , there are no underlying business fundamentals , dividends , or expectations for future earnings . it gets worsebitcoin has hit peak hype . ",
        "bitcoin `` mining '' , the use of computational power to verify and expand the registry , now consumes more power than the country of ireland . this somehow seems wrong when most of the african continent sits in darkness . the increasing complexity of the blockchain has further contributed to the uselessness of this non-currency : it now takes hours-to-days to verify a single transaction . can you imagine buying a gallon of milk or tank of gas with bitcoin now ? unscrupulous `` wantrepreneurs '' have gotten in on the action , building their own cryptocurrency products on the same basic premise as blockchain . ",
        "the most recent estimate has identified 1,324 cryptocurrencies built on the same blockchain principles . most of these will be defunct by the time you finish this article . in order to launch a new cryptocurrency , the new hotness in silicon valley is the `` i. c.o '' , or initial coin offering . it 's just like an ipo , except there are no underwriters , banks , established markets , or regulators to worry about . a piece by tech writer kevin rose describes an ico thus : `` if you 're having trouble picturing it : imagine that a friend is building a casino and asks you to invest . ",
        "in exchange , you get chips that can be used at the casino 's tables once it 's finished . now imagine that the value of the chips is n't fixed , and will instead fluctuate depending on the popularity of the casino , the number of other gamblers and the regulatory environment for the casinos . oh , and instead of a friend , imagine it 's a stranger on the internet who might be using a fake name , who might not actually know how to build a casino , and whom you probably ca n't sue for fraud if he steals your money and uses it to buy a porche instead . ",
        "that 's an i. c.o. '' the futurethis can not and will not continue . regulators and governments have been warning consumers to stay away , but nobody is listening . i especially like the warning from the people 's bank of china : `` one day you 'll see bitcoin 's dead body float away in front of you . '' poetic . jamie dimon , chairman and ceo of jpmorgan has come under fire on internet forums for calling anyone who buys bitcoin `` stupid '' . what does that guy know about investing , anyways ? more and more unsophisticated non-accredited investors are making bets on different new cryptocurrencies . ",
        "i heard about undergrad lab techs from my last company trading on icos , people in my extended family investing in new blockchain-based currencies , new mit startups raising millions through a coin offering and going out of business weeks later ... there are two possible scenarios : there is a major blockchain correction event in which investors lose their shirts , which will prompt swift regulation of these markets or sudden international regulation of these markets will lead to a major correction . either way , investors will lose . i worry it will be those who can least afford total loss of invested capital who will be hurt the most .
