        "boston -- gordon hayward 's extensive rehab is progressing nicely , but being sideline for so long can get a bit monotonous . so to break things up a bit , the celtics gave hayward a change of scenery and sent him out west last week . and in another bit of promising news for the injured c 's star , those travel plans may ramp up in a few months . hayward 's trip to the left coast not only allowed for a change of scenery , but an opportunity to join the team on tuesday night as they took on the los angeles lakers . ",
        "he 'll be in the staples center with his teammates again on wednesday when they take on the clippers , looking to end a four-game skid . `` one of the things that we wanted to do with him was change his environment just to move a little bit , '' head coach brad stevens told reporters ahead of tuesday night loss to the lakers , via masslive 's jay king . `` so he 's going to be here for these two games and then he will stay here in southern california for a week or 10 days with a couple of our staff and then rejoin us in boston . '' ",
        "hayward has n't traveled with the team yet since suffering that brutal opening night injury , but that could change soon . stevens said hayward could start joining the celtics for road trips full-time by march , depending on how his rehab progresses . do n't get too giddy about a late-season comeback just yet , as stevens stressed that hayward still has a long way to go . but like most of us , the c 's head coach saw the video of hayward shooting set shots in a gym earlier this week , another promising sign for the injured forward . ",
        "`` he 's a really good spot shooter , '' stevens grinned .   "
