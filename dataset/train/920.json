        "society hill resident and cyclist jon williams was fed up with the city 's response to the snow storms earlier this month , especially as it pertained to the bike lanes outside his house . so he grabbed a shovel , put on some warm clothes and shoveled out the bike lanes on fourth and fifth streets along spruce , near his home . `` the goal was just to try to maintain this block of the spruce bike lane for fun when i have time , '' he said . `` i cleared leaves in the lane in december as well , since i think those get slippery . '' ",
        "every winter , bicycle commuters continue braving the snow and ice , but bike lanes themselves are rarely plowed -- even when the adjacent street is . this is a problem for which , so far , the city has n't seemed to figure out a solution . but as more people commute via bicycle all year in philadelphia , we need to find a way to keep bike lanes clear of ice and snow to better ensure the safety of cyclists , pedestrians and drivers . i reached out to people all over the city , and the common refrain was this : bike lanes from north philly to west philly , northeast to northwest , were all covered in ice and snow right up until the weird heatwave and rain at the end of last week . ",
        "so were crosswalks and ada-compliant curb ramps . in some cases , snow had been piled up in bike lanes and next to ramps . what was plowed ? the protected bike lane that runs behind the old yards brewery to sugarhouse casino and the trail behind the casino itself . east snyder avenue was reported `` cleared , '' as well , and so was the ben franklin parkway . i reached out to the city , too , about their policy toward bike lanes in the winter . `` bike lanes are part of the overall street operation and cleared as part of the general snow emergency , '' they said in an email . ",
        "`` if users of the bike lanes encounter specific issues , they are encouraged to call 311 . '' that lack of specifics is why people like jon williams have taken out their shovels . so what 's there to do ? philadelphians are , of course , free to call 311 and make requests for plowing . the more people who complain about a given issue , the more likely the city will have to solve the problem , if only out of sheer pressure . at least you 'd hope that would be the case . long-term , though , the city will need more resources to get the job done . ",
        "in washington , d. c. , the district department of transportation has small plows , specifically for bike lane plowing . many other cities have these , too . philadelphia does not . a small , dedicated team that only works on complete streets issues , like plowing bike lanes and wheelchair ramps , fixing broken bike lane bollards and restriping faded crosswalks and bike lanes , would go a long way toward keeping the city 's streets up to date .
