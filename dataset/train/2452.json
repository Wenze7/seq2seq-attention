        "aden - saudi-led air strikes have killed 28 huthi rebels around yemen 's west coast , medics and security sources close to the insurgents said friday , as government forces reported deadly clashes in the south . the security sources said air strikes on thursday and friday hit five towns controlled by the huthis around 70 kilometres south of hodeida . medical sources said 28 huthis were killed and 17 wounded in the attacks . yemeni government forces retook beihan district in shabwa province from the huthis , their last stronghold in the oil-rich southern province , a senior officer said friday . ",
        "the capture of beihan came during clashes that killed 14 rebels and nine pro-government troops , the officer said . there has been no let-up in the air campaign against the rebels that a saudi-led coalition has been waging since march 2015 . the air strikes have intensified since the december 4 killing of ex-president ali abdullah saleh at the hands of the huthis after his alliance with the rebels collapsed . at the same time , forces of the saudi-backed yemeni government have stepped up attacks on the rebels and last week retook the red sea town of khokha from the huthis . ",
        "the security sources said new clashes broke out on friday as government forces tried to push towards hodeida . the un refugee agency unhcr said it was `` bracing for further displacement and a spike in humanitarian needs as hostilities intensify in frontline areas on yemen 's west coast '' . hodeida is the main conduit for un-supervised deliveries of food and medicine , but the port is controlled by the huthis and remains closed , forcing the un to divert aid supplies to other areas . `` to date we have deployed emergency relief items for 2,000 families in hodeida , and a further 2,000 aid kits are on their way along with 2,000 emergency shelter kits , '' the unhcr said in a statement . ",
        "`` as the port of hodeida remains closed an additional 43 containers with emergency , shelter and household aid , including plastic tarpaulins and blankets for more than 20,000 families , had to be diverted to aden , '' it added . more than 2,000 people have died of cholera in yemen this year , adding to the 8,600 killed in the conflict between the saudi-backed government and rebels since 2015 .
