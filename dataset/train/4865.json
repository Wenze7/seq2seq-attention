        "jan 03 , 2018on a cold january night , i got off from my work and reached home at 11 o'clock . the main gate is always open because i work night shifts . i reached for the door and knocked -- i never liked ringing bells in the night as it disrupts the peace . the dogs next door are always there waiting for the pin to drop , it 's their reasoning for the chaos they bring . i think it happens all around the globe , more likely in the night when it 's quiet . i did n't want the dogs to be alarmed and just because of that , i moved with a little bit of stealth . ",
        "one wrong move and the houses would descend into entropy . there was no answer to my knock . i knocked again , '' aaya ekchin '' , my mom answered . i know it can be so annoying , being summoned just to open the door while you 're deep in your sleep and perhaps in the midst of a wonderful dream . leaving the comfort of the warm bed on a cold winter night , sucks so much . this is why i always wait , letting her take her time . sometimes she falls asleep again . ",
        "so in the meantime , i started taking photos of the yard . i was just trying to frame a photo . my friends at work , sudeep , rishi and sometimes bipin often talk about photos and video related things . listening to their interesting photography talks and sometimes eavesdropping is what drew my interest in photography . i was also introduced to a local photographer by the name photokhichuwa . he has this knack for capturing some everyday objects , and the portraits of locals in action , in such a way that it adds life to the photos . ",
        "one can find his passion in his work from his photos which stands for itself . the bottom line is that his way of seeing things and capturing them in an original way changed my perception of photography . thanks to sudeep i got to know such a wonderful artist . also , it 's because of him i now know a couple of things about photography . one of the things i learned from him was the rule of third , so keeping that in mind i started taking random photos . all i wanted was a good frame . ",
        "i was just getting started and a thought came to my mind . seeing my endeavours with these strange angles anyone could have questioned my intentions . it was almost midnight and i was there being a weirdo . no sane person does that . will they take me for some crazy guy or a thief in the worst case scenario ? sometimes even when i 'm in a simple situation , i tend to overthink , only to make things worse for myself . despite these thoughts , i carried on . and the door was yet to open , no one had come to the door . ",
        "dead set on my mission . until and unless i was satisfied with a decent shot i would carry on with this task . i made a commitment there . then came that cat out of the darkness . yellow glowing eyes , black in color , moving swiftly . this had my attention as it stopped on every meter it moved . in my country where we still talk about black cats being associated with a witch and her spells . black cats here is an ominous sign . i know some people who would have freaked out seeing a black cat in a similar situation . ",
        "but that is not who i am . after seeing the cat i aborted what i was so committed to , for another side quest . so much for me being dead set on a good frame . i was there trying to take a quick snap of this cat regardless of the frame . i could only take one shot that was n't blurry . it was n't enough . i wanted more . the funny thing is that this cat powered by agility had cat-like reflexes . while moving ahead it stopped for a second and there i tried my luck but to my dismay , in a blink of an eye , the cat would have had its position changed . ",
        "it became interesting and challenging at the same time . i could feel that wildlife photographer in me . but the cat left the scene , apparently , the cat was screaming from the top of its lungs whose your daddy huh ? now i wanted a shot more badly , i followed it across the wall but it was nowhere to be found . i snapped out of it when i found myself climbing the wall in pursuit of the cat . i knocked the door again with more effort this time . the door opened after some time . ",
        "on my bed , i questioned to myself what in the blue hell was i doing , following a nocturnal creature in the dark . it was cold out there . then i thought how quickly things escalated . i was only there for a frame and how i winded up failing in both my endeavors . thanks for reading .   "
