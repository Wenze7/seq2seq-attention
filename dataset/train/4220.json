        "former indian team manager , lalchand rajput . former indian cricketer and the world cup winning team manager , lalchand rajput , has made some bold predictions ahead of india 's upcoming tour of south africa . rajput feels that the indian team will surprisingly dominate the proteas on the tour . as per the quotes in pti , lalchand predicted a 2-1 win for india in the test series . explaining his point , he remarked that the indian team is very aggressive . and with virat kohli as their leader , they look firmly balanced to challenge the opposition . ",
        "the indian top order has struck a purple patch too ahead of the big tour . `` the way the indian team is playing , they are playing tough cricket . with virat kohli being the leader , the aggression which he shows , seems to be imbibed in other players too and they want to win at any cost . they want to crush the opponents . this is the team that would do wonders and i am hopeful that they will do really well in south africa , '' quoted lalchand rajput . data-ad-client = `` ca-pub-7785168419440214 `` data-ad-slot = `` 6042301080 '' > on india 's bowlingspeaking further on the same note , the former indian team manager conceded that the bowlers win matches . ",
        "he rightly mentioned that in order to win test games , the bowlers should be able to scalp 20 wickets . and he feels that the current crop of indian bowlers is very much capable of doing so . `` to win a test match , we need to take 20 wickets . we have the bowlers who can take 20 wickets . bhuvneswar kumar is in peak form , umesh yadav has done exceptionally well , shami , after injury , is bowling superbly . if they get a little bit of help from the wickets then these bowlers are dangerous , '' rajput quoted . ",
        "on ajinkya rahane 's current formwhile the bowling unit looks in good form with all bowlers contributing in the recent past , india 's concerns lie with their middle-order in the batting department . ajinkya rahane , who is one of the most successful players for the team in overseas conditions , has had a horrid time in the recently concluded sri lanka series . he could only aggregate 17 runs in 5 innings . commenting on him , lalchand rajput feels that rahane is just one good knock away from striking good form . all he needs to do is to spend some time at the crease to feel at ease yet again . ",
        "`` for any batsman , who has done so well on foreign soil , it is just one step away from a big score . he had a very bad series in last couple of months . but he is such a good player , if he spends time in the middle , i want him to spend more time in the middle , forget about scoring runs , '' feels lalchand rajput . `` he has to be there for an hour , once he is there for an hour , automatically his batting form will come . he just has to spend time and the first game will be crucial for him , '' he added further .
