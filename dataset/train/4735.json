        "pan gang , ceo of inner mongolia yili industrial group co ltd. . there are two photographs you wo n't fail to notice at the office of pan gang , ceo of inner mongolia yili industrial group co ltd , china 's biggest dairy producer . one shows him communicating with farmers and herdsmen at a pasture about cow breeding . the other one shows him interacting with tim cook , ceo of apple inc , and ellen kullman , former ceo of dupont co , in 2015 . the common theme they signify is that for pan , quality means a lot , be it educating farmers on how to care for cattle in a way that they produce top-quality milk , or associating with leaders of companies known for making quality products . ",
        "for a long time , pan has been focused on the quality of yili 's products . his goal is to make yili one of the most trusted providers of healthy food globally . to achieve his goal , he wants to integrate various resources at his disposal and help yili compete with dairy giants worldwide . currently , yili group is the largest dairy producer in asia , and the eighth-largest in the world . in the past decade , yili has been selected for case studies at harvard business school twice . no other chinese food company has received such attention from a top business school . ",
        "pan has also been invited to teach harvard 's mba students twice . `` if there is no innovation , then there is no future for a company . '' that 's one of pan 's famous quips , and yili 's motto . in the eyes of pan , there are only two kinds of people in the world : those who drink milk and those who do n't . yili 's mission is to convert those who do n't to milk-drinkers . back in 1999 , pan introduced liquid milk production line in china , and extended the quality guarantee period of milk to six months . ",
        "the move has helped the milk produced in inner mongolia to be sold to far-flung areas in china , and drive the dairy industry 's growth in the country . many years ago , pan found that a large portion of chinese consumers has lactose intolerance . so , yili invested significant resources to develop china 's first lactose hydrolyzed milk , which enabled such consumers to drink milk without facing problems . such consumer-oriented strategies helped yili to earn more than 60 billion yuan in sales revenue in 2016 , with almost 23 percent coming from new products . ",
        "yili commands a 20-percent market share in china 's dairy industry , topping the list , according to the company . in 2016 , sales of its flagship greek-style yogurt ambrosial , which it co-developed with the greek academy of agricultural sciences , surged 106.7 percent year-on-year . in the first six months of 2017 , yili 's net profit rose 4.5 percent year-on-year to 3.37 billion yuan . besides promoting innovation in products , pan insists on every member of the management team having a sense of innovation , as only that will help yili to take the lead in a fiercely competitive market . ",
        "to this end , pan has been taking yili 's management team on overseas visits so they could communicate with their counterparts at other leading companies , such as dupont , philips , google , facebook and linkedin , and gain some new experiences from other industries . during such visits , pan was impressed by the silicon valley 's spirit of innovation . he has been constantly looking for new opportunities and strategies abroad to raise the global impact of yili and china 's dairy industry . currently , china 's per-capita consumption of dairy products is 36 kilograms a year , while it is about 50 kg in japan and south korea . ",
        "`` the trend of consumption upgrade in china indicates there is still a significant growth potential for the dairy market , especially for unique products , '' pan said . `` we will speed up our layout globally , grasping the business opportunities presented by the belt and road initiative , and enable chinese enterprises to have a bigger voice , '' he said . together with wageningen university and research in the netherlands , yili established a dairy research and development center in europe . in 2014 , the company founded the world 's largest integrated dairy production center in new zealand , named yili group oceania dairy ltd , with an investment of 3 billion yuan . ",
        "in the united states , it also cooperates with a number of top universities and institutions in certain areas like food safety , product development and nutritional research . as one of the representatives who attended the 19th cpc national congress in october , pan said enterprises can achieve sustained and vigorous growth only if they pay heed to quality , and needs of consumers . in this context , yili shall endeavor to create a national brand and serve more people , he said .
