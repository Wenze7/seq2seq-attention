        "one of several women who say they dated roy moore when they were teens -- incensed he has disavowed any knowledge of her -- has presented more evidence of their relationship , the washington post reported . debbie wesson gibson showed the newspaper a scrapbook from her senior year of high school that contained a graduation card from moore . `` happy graduation debbie , '' it read . `` i wanted to give you this card myself . i know that you 'll be a success in anything you do . roy . '' a total of nine women have now come forward to say they dated moore when they were teenagers and he was an assistant district attorney in his 30s , the post reported . ",
        "gibson said she `` wore like a badge of honor '' her relationship with moore until she began re-evaluating it in light of the accounts of other women -- and his denial last week , a video of which gibson said she has on her cellphone . `` at 34 minutes and 56 seconds into the video , he says , unequivocally , ` i did not know any of them , ' '' gibson told the post . `` in that moment , it changed my perspective . i knew he was a liar . '' gibson , 54 , of delray beach , fla. . ",
        "-- a registered republican -- says she not only openly dated moore , but later joined him in passing out fliers during his campaign for circuit court judge in 1982 and exchanged christmas cards with him over the years , the post reported . `` roy moore made an egregious mistake to attack that one thing -- my integrity , '' she told the post . `` he called me a liar , '' she added . she also told the post that an interview by beverly young nelson , who alleged moore sexually assaulted her when she was 16 , and who presented her own yearbook as proof of their relationship , also spurred her to come forward again despite misgivings . ",
        "`` i just could n't imagine him doing something like that , '' gibson told the post . `` and then when i saw the interview from beverly , and i saw his handwriting in her yearbook , my heart just sank . and when i saw what i knew to be roy moore 's handwriting , i just began to sob openly . '' gibson 's yearbook is filled with remembrances of moore as a guest at her graduation , and of her first date with him . she said when she became engaged , moore insisted on meeting her fiance to make sure he was `` good enough for me , '' the post reported . ",
        "`` it takes what i thought was a very lovely part of my past , and it colors it , and it changes it irrevocably , '' she said . `` it changes it permanently . ''   "
