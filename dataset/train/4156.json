        "ryanair 's traffic growth halved last month as the prospect of a pilot strike and the airline 's cancellation of thousands of flights this autumn finally appeared to take its toll , it emerged on wednesday . traffic increased by just 3 % year on year at the irish airline in december , in what is normally a bumper month when london 's irish population goes home for christmas . in november traffic was 6 % up on a year earlier . the budget airline , which began cancelling flights in september because changes in the rota had made it a struggle to find pilots , carried 9.3 million passengers in december , up from 9 million passengers 12 months earlier . ",
        "however , the figures revealed a sharp slowdown in passenger growth from a year earlier when flyer numbers grew by 20 % . a planned pilot strike days before christmas was averted . ryanair revealed this week that it had begun making contingency plans for brexit by applying for a british air operating licence to ensure its domestic uk routes can keep flying after the uk has left the eu . the irish airline has repeatedly warned that flights could be grounded after next march unless a new framework for aviation is agreed between britain and the eu . hungarian budget airline wizz air took a similar move in october . ",
        "wizz today saw its traffic grow by 20 % in december . the airline carried 2.2 million passengers during the month and has taken advantage of the collapse of monarch to expand at luton .   "
