        "former arsenal striker ian wright has claimed that mesut ozil would `` sprinkle stardust '' if he joined manchester united . ozil will see his contract with arsenal expire at the end of this season , and the german international has been strongly linked with a move to united , where he would link-up with jose mourinho once again . wright has said that the 29-year-old would light up old trafford if he completed a move to the 20-time english champions as he would be operating alongside better players . `` i do n't think he 's that type of player who will drag a team by its bootlaces through a game , but if your team is playing well , he will sprinkle stardust , '' wright told sky sports news . ",
        "`` with the players he 'd be playing with at united as well , he is unbelievable . he is just awesome , and with the right team , and the right movement in front of him , he is easily one of the best i 've seen . he 's amazing . `` is this difficult to say ? yeah . and we ca n't keep arguably two of the best players , arguably in the history of the club , ability-wise . it 's sad times . `` united are also currently being linked with a shock move for ozil 's teammate alexis sanchez as they look to beat manchester city to the chilean 's signature .
