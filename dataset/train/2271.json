        "comment : with jose mourinho criticising henrik mkhitaryan 's lacklustre performances , a new name has emerged from la liga as the perfect replacement should the armenian leave in january . carlos soler , a midfielder for valencia , has been rumoured to have caught the glimmering eye of mourinho this season as the spanish side continue to rejuvenate under marcelino . at just 20 years of age , he has become one of the success stories at the mestalla so far this season and netted in an impressive 2-2 away to real madrid at the start of the 2017/18 campaign . ",
        "what stands out though is his importance to the team and his ability on the ball . a calm player , his crossing and passing accuracy has garnered him 4 assists so far this season , one more than isco of real madrid and ivan rakitic . his long-range ability could be likened to paul scholes and david beckham , but he can also dribble effectively and at a tender age has the years ahead of him to become a better player . a first spanish cap may be not far round the corner if his performances keep improving . ",
        "both the sun and daily star say mourinho is willing to splash out over Â£ 40 million to get his man , but the midfielder refused to say whether he would be willing to join the red devils , speaking last week : `` you already know it . i 'm focused on valencia . regarding those things i know nothing . `` it would be foolish to think about those things right now . i have to be focused on valencia . i have a lot of years left and that 's what i have to do '' . ",
        "of course , with his team doing so well in the league - just 5 points off barcelona after a 1-1 draw against them last saturday - staying at a redeveloping club with new ambitions may be the long-term aim for him . but if mourinho wants to improve and get the club as far as they can in the champions league , then a move for soler may hold the key . mkhitaryan has struggled to hold down a starting position at the club , and paul pogba , although becoming more influential and scoring goals this season , has yet to lead the midfield by example . ",
        "soler may be the partnership and link-up between pogba and lukaku , along with his calm range of passing and shooting , which could ensure they become a force to challenge for the premier league title in the coming years and the champions league . perhaps though , it would be fair to give mkhitaryan a chance to find form before splashing out on a player , and if soler does come in , he is not guaranteed instant success , despite being a highly-promising player . it took a while for both spanish duo herrera and de gea to settle into the english game . ",
        "if mourinho is keen to sign the valencia however man , then he will do so in the aim to develop long-term future of , and indeed himself at old trafford .   "
