",
        "what makes this recent run unusual is that both the s&p 500 and the vix have been moving higher . and , in fact , both the spx and the vix closed yesterday at a 2-month high . that does not happen very often . as proof , this was the first time since the final day of the last millennium . additionally , yesterday , obviously , also marked the first day ever in which the spx closed at a 52-week high while the vix closed at a 2-month high . the following chart shows all of the incidents in which the vix closed at a 2-month high and the spx was within a half of 1 % of its 52-week high .

        "there have been 15 such days . one more study we looked at on the topic has to do with the term structure of the volatility market . as a refresher , when traders get nervous about stocks , they typically bid up the price of closer-dated volatility indices , e. g. , the 1-month vix , versus longer-dated ones , e. g. , the 3-month vxv . that typically occurs as a result of market declines . not this time . while the spx closed at a 52-week high yesterday , the vix/vxv ratio closed at a 4-month high . ",
        "that has never happened before . in fact , the spx is typically an average of 4.2 % below its 52-week high when the vix/vxv ratio is at a 4-month high . so what is the message being sent here ? are stocks pointing to further gains , or is the vix sending a subtle warning sign regarding a coming uptick in volatility ? which price series , if either , is correct ? * * * if you are interested in the premium version of our charts and research , check out `` all-access '' service , the lyons share .
