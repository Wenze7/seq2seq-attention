        "it might be more by the time you read this , but sad fan petitions are n't worth talking about . the revolution will not be televised . it 'll be sent to your inbox by us . abc appears to have quietly canceled inhumans , its extremely cheap-looking adaptation of one of marvel 's less-popular superhero franchises that premiered in imax theaters to a 10 percent rotten tomatoes rating . over the weekend , spoilertv noticed that abc had totally scrubbed any mention of the show from its press site , which sure seems like a sign that it wo n't be coming back for season 2 . ",
        "to the vast majority of people , this cancellation means nothing , but inhumans did have a few fans , and some of them are apparently desperate to save the much-derided series . presumably , one of those fans started a change . org petition , and a couple of news outlets are reporting on the petition . as of the time i wrote this , fewer than 1,000 people had signed it , so the petition really , really does n't matter . inhumans was canceled because almost everybody hated it and the ratings were abysmal . fewer than 2 million people watched the finale . ",
        "those are two very good reasons for a major network to cancel a series , and it 's doubtful that a few hundred jabronis on change . org are going to make disney , a company worth tens of billions of dollars , do an about-face . also , anybody can make a change . org petition . i could log on , right now , and make a change . org petition demanding that nbc bring back the 2011 superhero drama the cape . my petition would not be news , and would n't be a signal that there 's a huge groundswell of support for a revival of the cape , let alone that nbc is going to listen to some pseudonymous fans who clicked a button to sign a petition . ",
        "all it really means is that a small group of people have access to an official-looking platform that makes their demands look more serious than they are , especially when news websites add legitimacy to these petitions by covering them . heck , the only reason that the inhumans petition might have cracked 1,000 signatures by the time you read this is that folks heard about it from these news websites . some might 've signed it as a joke . even fan petitions with more impressive numbers , like that fan petition demanding that waner bros. . release a zack snyder cut of justice league , are unlikely to make an impact , but with 170,000 signatures , the petition is somewhat newsworthy , at least . ",
        "that 's not enough people to get warner bros. . to do anything , probably , but it is a somewhat interesting look at fan culture . the inhumans petition is an uninteresting look at what a couple hundred people are clicking online . i will eat all of the hair shaved off of medusa 's head if i am wrong , and this petition goes mega-viral , forcing abc to capitulate and renewed inhumans for a sophomore series . that 'll probably be when disney removes the last jedi from star wars canon because some change . org users were mad online , so i feel pretty safe .
