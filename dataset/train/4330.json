        "it 's very closely related to the viziv performance concept from the tokyo auto show last year , but it 's been given a bevy of flashy sti parts to make it aggressive . up front , a deep lip spoiler complements a redesigned front bumper that does away with the two outboard air intakes and opens up the center one . according to a subaru designer , it improves the cooling and aerodynamics . having the blocked off intakes on each side with sti logos is also a nice throwback to old impreza sti models that often had blank panels with the logo over the foglight openings . ",
        "around the side are side skirts , and at the back are small extensions to the same diffuser from the concept . and of course , there 's a massive wing at the back . what 's interesting is how much of the normal viziv remains under the sti logos , decals and wings . the fenders look nearly untouched , the hood scoop is the same size and shape as the standard concept . even the exhaust , taillights , and headlights are all the same . then again , between the wrx and wrx sti , the only real visible differences are the rear wing , wheels , and front spoiler . ",
        "and if the viziv performance concepts preview future wrx and sti models , following that model makes sense . of course the big differences between wrx and sti models are under the skin . unfortunately , subaru does n't reveal a thing about what hypothetical powertrain is under this sti . maybe we should n't be so surprised though , since the company did n't say anything about the regular one either . only the use of a flat-four and all-wheel drive are certain . for that matter , even the styling is n't truly certain . while we can hope that the next wrx and wrx sti have the muscular look of these concepts , we have reason to be skeptical . ",
        "but instead of getting cynical and sad , let 's just enjoy this for what it is , a cool sti concept .   "
