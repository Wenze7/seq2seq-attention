        "recently we started a program for startups and small businesses in japan to help them use the latest digital tools and resources to grow their businesses in japan . if you want to learn more or participate , check it out here . however , within that process we 've learned a lot about startups in japan , what it takes to survive , and how startups can get the most out of their time here . with that being said , the biggest question that comes up over and over again is this , `` how can we raise the type of funds that it takes to be successful ? '' ",
        "good question , raising funding in japan is n't easy , as a matter of fact it 's kind of a nightmare which one could write an entire book on . however , there is hope , with a small startup revolution starting to take place there are new resources that are available to startups here in japan , these are just a few . check out government resourcesfirst , the government is on a funding rampage . i just talked to someone the other night that got an email from the government and then a check for $ 30,000 usd a few weeks later , true story . ",
        "with china destroying japan on the startup and global expansion market , the government needs to find new ways to invest in entrepreneurship , even if those ways make no sense at all . this goes for foreigners too , they 've even created a new visa just for highly skilled expats in order to attract more talent and give them opportunities to create startups in japan . if you want some practical tips , here is a great story from tim romero 's podcast , disrupting japan on how a foreigner was able to launch his startup with the governments help , check it out . ",
        "start building relationships with foreign investment firmsokay , so if the government gives you the cold shoulder , there 's another option in the form of any of the many foreign investment firms such as 500 startups and others who are looking to invest and build in the next generation of startups in japan . just here it was announced over the summer that 500 startups closed $ 35 million in japan funding , softbank invested $ 300 million in wework , and much more is going on behind the scenes . these companies are looking for young japanese talent they can invest in here and at one point take over seas or to positively impact the rest of the world . ",
        "is that startup you ? shoot them an email or tweet and find out . try building a joint venture with a japanese startupokay , so in our experience if you 're a foreign company with no solid reputation in japan , getting vc funding from a japanese firm is going to be difficult , but not totally impossible . as a matter of fact , for a full list of japanese vc firms , check out this list from the bridge , it 's a little old but still useful . our point here is that these firms tend to invest solely in japanese talent , it 's a cultural thing . ",
        "so if you 're looking for funding for your startup , consider partnering with a local firm somehow or getting a business partner who is japanese and try out one of these firms to see how they can help you scale . ultimately getting funding for your startup in japan is more of adventure than it is an opportunity , you 'll have to ride it out from the beginning to end to see where it takes you , learn from every up and down and use it to your advantage to be the success you 've always envisioned .
