        "turkey on wednesday ordered the arrest of the relatives of a witness in an explosive us trial of a turkish banker accused of violating us sanctions against iran , state media reported . huseyin korkmaz , a former police investigator now in the united states , last week described to a new york court how he had been investigating alleged corruption in 2013 and had gathered evidence before fleeing turkey in 2016 . istanbul prosecutors are now seeking to detain korkmaz 's parents as well as his wife , older brother and two sisters after he apparently told the court `` i have given documents to my mother to hide '' , state-run news agency anadolu reported . ",
        "the agency said police officers could not find the individuals at their addresses . korkmaz told the court he provided us officials with documents used in a case against mehmet hakan atilla , deputy chief executive of turkish lender halkbank , who is accused in the sanctions case . other people have been charged but atilla is the only person in the dock and has pleaded not guilty . korkmaz is wanted in turkey over alleged links to us-based muslim preacher fethullah gulen , who turkey claims masterminded last year 's attempted overthrow of president recep tayyip erdogan . gulen strongly denies ankara 's accusations . ",
        "according to anadolu , korkmaz had used the encrypted messaging application bylock which ankara says was used by the gulen movement , especially putschists . he is also one of the suspects in turkey 's investigation into the 2013 corruption probe that targeted erdogan , which the government has since denounced as a coup attempt , the agency said . - tense relations - the warrants come as the jury will begin deliberations later on wednesday after the three-week trial which is testing already strained ties between the us and turkey . relations between the nato allies are tense over the us failure to extradite gulen and us support for syrian kurdish militia branded `` terrorists '' by turkey . ",
        "a surprise in the trial 's beginning came after turkish-iranian gold trader reza zarrab -- who was once close to erdogan and his government -- was arrested in march 2016 in miami and charged with subverting sanctions against iran . as the trial began last month , he appeared in court after a long time as the prosecution 's star witness in the trial obsessively followed in turkey . zarrab was one of the main figures of the 2013 corruption scandal in turkey which erdogan denounced at the time as a `` dirty '' plot . during his testimony , zarrab implicated erdogan in a multi-million-dollar gold-for-oil scheme allegedly designed to subvert sanctions . ",
        "the us case has provoked the ire of erdogan who has denounced the trial as a `` plot '' against turkey while analysts say one or more turkish banks face possible fines in the event of a guilty verdict .   "
