        "- manchester city defender vincent kompany believes manager pep guardiola 's teachings have helped players get their fundamentals right and credits the spaniard for the premier league club 's progress . guardiola took over at city in 2016 and guided them to a third-placed league finish last season but ended the campaign trophy-less . in his second season at the helm , the spaniard has led city to an unbeaten start , with the league leaders are eight points clear of their closest rivals and on a 19-game winning streak across all competitions . `` he 's a great teacher ... i 've got to be honest , it has made me realise how important it is for managers to be actual teachers , no matter what level the footballer is at , '' kompany told sky sports . ",
        "`` sometimes it is taken for granted that top professionals know everything they need to do , but in reality it is quite the opposite . `` when you break it down , go back to basics , and explain all of these things to these great players , it gives them another level ... being super cautious , i see progression in the team , but until we 've won silverware , it 's not enough . '' the belgian defender believes that a mix of being better-adjusted to guardiola 's tactics and cautious optimism has helped city develop into a better team this campaign . ",
        "`` i do n't think we show as many weaknesses as last season . at the same time , i think we have understood what he wants a little bit better ... we have kind of learned from the fact that nothing has happened yet , '' kompany added . `` we are not getting carried away , i think a lot of people around us are getting carried away , but if you go in the dressing room it 's calm and focused . we all felt what it 's like not to win anything , and we do n't want that to happen again .
