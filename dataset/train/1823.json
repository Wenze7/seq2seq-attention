        "new york -- corey johnson , the new speaker of the new york city council , vows to be independent and mount his own investigations of city agencies . and if johnson does not agree with mayoral policies , he says he will challenge them . cbs2 political reporter marcia kramer said tuesday that there is a new wind blowing at city hall . kramer 's full interview with speaker johnsonmayor bill de blasio was sworn in for a second term on a cold , blustery day that might have been a harbinger for things to come . kramer reported it might have been a warning that the new speaker of the city council might not look on all his ideas as warmly as the last one . ",
        "johnson : `` we will and must be a well-respected separate , coequal branch of government . '' kramer : `` so you will not be a rubber stamp ? '' johnson : `` no , i will not be a rubber stamp , and the mayor knows that . '' and if mayor de blasio had any doubt , he got the message loud and clear right after johnson beat out seven others for the top spot . one of the first things he did was set up his own investigations unit to probe city agencies . `` we 're going to look at some of these endemic issues that have plagued the city for a very long time , '' johnson said . ",
        "`` there 's placard abuse throughout the city . you have nycha , which has serious problems ; the homelessness issue . '' already , johnson is asking questions -- does the city need the 90 homeless shelters proposed by the mayor ? the speaker says probably not . `` that is a band-aid in many ways , '' he said . `` the real issue here is we need supportive housing . we need housing with social services . '' johnson , who also met with metropolitan transportation authority chairman joe lhota tuesday to discuss mta funding , also splits with the mayor on congestion pricing . ",
        "the speaker wants a surcharge on taxis and car services , fees to encourage overnight truck deliveries , and some way to curb tour buses . but as for the suggestion that drivers pay $ 11.52 to enter the central business district ? johnson : `` i think $ 11.52 is probably too high . '' kramer : `` what about a congestion fee that equals the cost of a subway or bus ride ? '' johnson : `` that 's probably a little too low , because the whole point of the congestion fee is you need to disincentivize people from driving into manhattan . '' ",
        "johnson proudly boasts of beating addictions to drugs and alcohol . one of the first things you see as you enter his office is a row of coins denoting his years of sobriety . he also loves live and makes no bones about it . `` i like to lip sync , i like to dance , i like to eat , i like to go to the movies , '' johnson said . `` i think you can do this job and still have fun . i can lip sync lady gaga and pass legislation the same day . '' ",
        "growing up with no money and living in public housing as a kid , johnson has few pretensions . he shares a 319 square-foot studio apartment with a roommate and his cat , mousse . he said he all he wants to do is get it right . johnson is 35 years old and has many years ahead of him to seek other elected office at the end of his four-year term .
