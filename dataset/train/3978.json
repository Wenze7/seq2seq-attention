        "ok , confession : i 've never actually done the whole 30 diet . i could probably get my head around skipping out on dairy , grains , legumes , alcohol , and added sugar , but the idea of living without peanut butter terrifies me . everyone has their limits . that being said , there are definitely ways to survive the whole 30 diet as a college student , and i applaud those people brave enough to undertake it to improve their health . technically , the whole 30 diet does n't encourage snacking , but hey , sometimes a girl gets hungry .
