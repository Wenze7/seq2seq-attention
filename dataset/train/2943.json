        "food security , or having consistent access to enough food for an active , healthy life , is important for the prevention of many health risks . this study , however , found that while food security has shown to be beneficial for those with hiv on antiretroviral therapy , it does not appear to be associated with hiv disease progression and access to care among those with high prevalence of substance use and not yet on art . initiating art for those vulnerable groups is an important first step . abstract and link to the article belowfood insecurity has been associated with hiv disease progression among people on antiretroviral therapy , presumably a consequence of poor medication adherence . ",
        "we assessed whether there is a longitudinal association between fi and two primary outcomes reflecting on hiv disease progression among people not on art . analyses used linear mixed effects and cox models controlling for confounders . in this cohort fi was common . most reported past month heavy alcohol use and 37.1 % reported past month injection drug use . only 50 participants initiated art during the study and mean time to art was 128 days . there were no significant differences in cd4 cell count between the groups with mild/moderate fi or severe fi versus those with no fi . ",
        "we found no significant association between fi and longer time to art initiation . food security is a desirable goal for overall health and shown beneficial for those on art , however it does not appear to be associated with hiv disease progression among those with high prevalence of substance use and not yet on art .
