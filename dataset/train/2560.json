        "the free agent market has been moving remarkably slow this offseason as teams like the phillies would rather wait to spend later and develop their players . it feels like barely anything has happened this offseason in baseball . after the giancarlo stanton and shohei otani craziness fell off , little else has occurred this winter . in an offseason that was expected to see several hundred-million dollar contracts be handed out , the phillies ' $ 60 million deal with carlos santana is still the largest signed so far . nearly every big name is still left on the market . ",
        "j. d. martinez , yu darvish , jake arrieta , and eric hosmer are all still unsigned , even with spring training set to begin in less than a month . they still may not sign until a week or two before it 's time to report . the cost to sign these players and many others could considerably fall in the near future . while general manager matt klentak told reporters thursday that the team wants to be active if the prices drop , but even then philadelphia may not make a huge splash . klentak said that the club still wants to make sure their young players get time to develop to help build for success down the road : `` we 're driven to pursue any opportunity we can to get better , '' phillies general manager matt klentak said thursday at a banquet for triple-a lehigh valley . ",
        "`` the balance that we strike is : what is the expense to get better ? and i do n't mean that in a financial way . who are we taking at-bats away from in order to get better ? who is going to lose out on important innings on the mound at the expense of us getting better ? `` that is kind of the complicating factor , more than the dollars ... `` it 's really more of baseball decisions at this point , '' klentak said . `` we 're just wanting to make sure we properly devote the development time to players that need it , to make sure we are building a team that wins and sustains its winning for a long time . ",
        "`` it was easy to find holes in the team last year . they addressed some of them by signing pat neshek , tommy hunter , and santana . they still need to upgrade the rotation , which looked like a complete dumpster fire behind aaron nola . more from that balls outta here phillies history : grover cleveland alexander elected to hof in 193823h ago phillies catcher jorge alfaro ranked sixth-best catching prospect1 d ago ten philadelphia phillies `` one and done '' players since 19802d ago phillies invite eight prospects to spring training , including scott kingery2d ago phillies prospect sixto sanchez ranked no . ",
        "10 right-handed pitcher3d ago however , klentak and the front office are n't quite willing to break out the checkbook to fill all the holes at once this offseason . as he said , they would rather let some of their young players develop this year to make sure they can win in the long-term . this likely means that we will see plenty of vince velasquez , zach eflin , nick pivetta , and ben lively in the rotation this year . rather than trying to replace maikel franco , they will let him try to work the kinks out this season and figure out if it 's really worthwhile to give manny machado a supermassive contract next year . ",
        "while letting the young players develop is certainly important , it means the front office does n't really plan to contend in 2018 . gelb posited that they may be content with being a `` middle-class '' team in the national league this year . he stated that if they thought the team was one or two moves away from a playoff run this year , they would be more likely to make a significant move . instead , 2018 will be another year of figuring out which players are worth keeping around . next : today in history : grover alexander elected to hofit 's somewhat unfortunate to think that this year will likely be another the phillies do n't contend , but in the end the hope is that they are building to a future , sustained , long-term run of success .
