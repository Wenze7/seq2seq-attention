        "found across most of north america , the bird spends its winters in central and south america , and flies as far north as alaska and the arctic circle in the summer , filling wildlands and backyards with color and song along the way . using more than 200 blood , tissue and feather samples from across the breeding range , the researchers discovered genes that appear to be responding to climate , and found that bird populations that most need to adapt to climate change are experiencing declines . ucla evolutionary biologist kristen ruegg , adjunct assistant professor and senior author of the study , said previous studies focused on how long-term changes in temperature and precipitation cause bird species to shift their geographic ranges . ",
        "genetic mapping offers the opportunity to look at another option -- the capacity to adapt to climate change . `` with this research , we can say ` based on these gene-environment correlations , here 's how populations will have to adapt to future climate change . and here are the populations that have to adapt most , ' '' said ruegg , who also is co-director of the bird genoscape project . whether the yellow warbler will be able to adapt is another matter . `` that 's our next big question , '' ruegg said . valuable information for conservationiststhe new study uncovered some of the challenges yellow warblers already face . ",
        "in some populations , genes associated with climate adaptation are mismatched to environments . these populations will likely have the hardest time adapting quickly enough to future climate shifts . that 's been the case in the past , too . comparing the genetic findings to breeding bird surveys dating back to the 1960s that track changes in bird abundance , the researchers determined that the populations that need to adapt most are already in decline . using genetic maps , the habitats of the populations most vulnerable to climate change can now be targeted for protection , said rachael bay , lead author of the study and a national science foundation postdoctoral fellow . ",
        "the findings offer valuable information for conservationists who hope to protect species like the yellow warbler in the future , she said . `` evolution has the potential to matter a lot when it comes to climate change response , '' bay said . `` it 's a process we should start to integrate more when we make decisions , and it 's shown a lot of promise that has n't been realized yet . `` the yellow warbler is not currently endangered . it was selected for the study to give researchers a better understanding of how genes relate to climate variables across its broad range . ",
        "but the bird may serve as a canary in the coal mine for species that are more at risk . `` this is an alarm bell , '' said tom smith , a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at ucla and director of the center for tropical research . `` we spend a lot of time asking what is going to happen under climate change , what the effects will be and what we need to do to manage it . our results shocked us -- it 's happening now . `` the study sets the stage for two important next steps , smith said . ",
        "first , it means additional studies need to be done to learn how other species adapt to climate change . second , the findings can be used now to tailor and inform future conservation management . more information : genomic signals of selection predict climate-driven population declines in a migratory bird . science , 05 jan 2018 : doi : 10.1126 / science . aan4380provided by university of california , los angelesthis story is republished courtesy and copyrighted by phys . org , a popular site that covers news about science research . read the original article .
