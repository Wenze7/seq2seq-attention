        "san leandro 's city manager admitted this week that he successfully pushed the city council to award a $ 1.5 million loan to a community organization directed by a woman with whom he regularly met in her suv and who now accuses him of sexual harassment . city manager chris zapata said he is stepping away from his dealings with the nonprofit organization , the davis street family resource center , and its leader , rose padilla johnson . san leandro officials have retained an investigator to probe allegations of misconduct . zapata , in a 23-page letter to the center 's board of directors emailed tuesday , disclosed that he lobbied for the loan even after a council member raised concerns about the organization 's ability to pay the money back because it was having financial difficulties . ",
        "in addition , he admitted that he initially did not properly record the center 's property that it had put up as collateral for the loan . his letter responded , in part , to allegations by johnson that he retaliated against her for rejecting his sexual advances by demanding immediate repayment of the city loan . in a letter her attorney sent to san leandro city officials last month , johnson accused zapata of inappropriate behavior that included romantic overtures and frequent comments about her physical appearance . she said he would make remarks about her outfits and painted toenails and once suggested , `` if you were not married , i would really go for someone like you . '' ",
        "he gave her spanish music mixtapes , johnson said , which contained sexually explicit lyrics . the letter from attorney and former oakland city councilwoman jane brunner asked the city to investigate the claims and demanded that zapata stop making defamatory statements about johnson . san leandro city attorney richard pio roda declined to comment . johnson said that during one of their first encounters , zapata said they should meet at a fosters freeze near her workplace , rather than at either of their offices . once they got there , he suggested they sit in her car . ",
        "the setup and location of their meetings became a common occurrence , and the pair would discuss topics both professional and personal . zapata , who did n't respond to requests for comment , denied all inappropriate behavior and wrongdoing in his letter , but acknowledged he should n't have met with johnson in her lexus suv . he described it as a convenient meeting place . in an interview with the chronicle , johnson said she considered zapata a friend and that his comments did n't overly disturb her at the time . but after the 2014 death of her husband , retired alameda county fire chief bill mccammon , johnson said , some of their interactions became uncomfortable . ",
        "johnson said the city loan came about after she told zapata about her organization 's financial troubles as it sought to open a health clinic . she said he suggested that she apply for a city loan . he claims it was she who asked him whether the city could provide a loan . late tuesday , zapata sent a letter to the nonprofit , firing back with his own accusations of impropriety by johnson and the president of davis street 's board of directors , gordon galvan , a former san leandro city council member and businessman . zapata detailed a series of shadowy political back channels and dealings , some involving the nonprofit and others with no connection to the group . ",
        "and he accused johnson and others of holding ulterior motives for their charges against him . galvan said the letter from zapata included inaccuracies and fabrications . the letter , at times incoherent , acknowledged that his job was on the line and claimed that johnson and galvan were retaliating against him for perceived delays in obtaining a cannabis permit for the davis street wellness center , a separate organization that will give a portion of its profits to the davis street family resource center when it opens this year . the name resemblance and relationship between the two groups created some confusion in the city during the permit process , zapata and others said . ",
        "the resource center gives low-income families and people with developmental disabilities services such as child care , food donations , counseling , free clothes and health care . some city council members voiced concerns about the location of the cannabis dispensary , which will be next door to the nonprofit . mayor pauline russo cutter , seen as a political ally of zapata 's , said wednesday she was in a daylong meeting and could n't immediately respond to questions but confirmed the investigation into possible misconduct . cutter and pio roda , the city attorney , both said they had no knowledge of zapata 's letter prior to him sending it tuesday . ",
        "`` although the city hired the investigator , the investigator has full control over the investigation and is completely independent , '' she said in a statement . `` the investigation is confidential , so at this time , the city does not have additional information about the investigation . the allegations are allegations at this point . the city does not know when the investigation will be complete , but will update the community when there are developments in the investigation . '' according to johnson 's telling and her lawyer 's letter , zapata helped fast-track the $ 1.5 million loan 's approval , placing it on the counsel 's consent calendar after a short presentation in the summer of 2014 . ",
        "the money was leveraged to open a primary care clinic at the center that provides dental , medical and behavioral health services to low-income patients . after getting an initial three-month extension on the two-year loan , johnson said she still could n't yet pay it back . she said reimbursements from the federal government were n't coming as fast as she had anticipated . around that time , in october 2016 , during their last car meeting -- this time in zapata 's vehicle -- johnson said she asked him again for an extension on the loan , to which he replied , `` rose , you have the key . '' ",
        "she took his words to be a sexual suggestion . `` i remember looking at the door handle and thinking i need to get out , '' she said . johnson said that after she exited the vehicle , zapata tried to block her path as she walked to her car . within hours of the incident , johnson confided in her assistant , adrian williams , who recalled the same details as johnson and said her boss appeared shaken and distressed . a few weeks later , zapata sent a letter demanding repayment of the loan , writing , `` the repeated failure to meet contractually obligated payments , coupled with promises and representations made in writing that were clearly broken or untrue , creates serious doubt '' that davis street would be able to pay back the loan . ",
        "johnson said she eventually got a lender to repay the city and that davis street is back to having a surplus . in the months after her falling out with zapata , johnson said , she heard from a series of influential people in the community , including donors to her nonprofit and old friends , that he was saying `` nasty '' things about her and casting her as a liar . kimberly veklerov is a san francisco chronicle staff writer . email : kveklerov@sfchronicle . com twitter : @kveklerov .
