        "here 's a thought experiment . think of an suv that immediately screams ` that person has money . ' land rover ? nah , the various vehicles are getting close to each other and are more often seen on the roads . no , the statement suv is and will always be the mercedes g-class . and it 's getting an upgrade in all the right spots . it 's having its coming out party at the detroit auto show , and you can see the iconic design remains , with some throwbacks to the vintage years . the new model saved most of the upgrades for the interior . ",
        "it makes sense . the gle had surpassed it when it comes to the bells and whistles . the g-class needed a serious upgrade to keep with the times . taking a look inside , you can see the old physical dials are gone , replaced by two 12.3-inch touch screens arranged to form a widescreen panel . if you miss the physical dials , the default theme for the instrumentation replicates the look of analog dials . one item that 's missing from the 2019 g-class is the mbux , mercedes next-generation infotainment system . it was debuted at ces , but will likely make its debut in a new a-class model . ",
        "while it 's always been a box on wheels , the redesign does offer up more room on the inside thanks to a slightly longer and wider wheelbase . passengers in the back will enjoy the extra 5.9 inches of additional legroom . when does it go on sale ? you have plenty of time to save up for the sticker shot . the 2019 4.0 l turbocharged v8 g550 hits dealerships in fall 2018 . pricing has n't been announced , but expect the $ 120,000 range as a start . no amg models have been announced , but expectations are the mad scientists at amg will be unleashed on the 2019 model . ",
        "the popularity of the g-class has only grown , and it makes you wonder why land rover let its defender model to automotive history . the market is there , and competition would benefit the consumer . for now , if you want the statement suv , the 2019 mercedes g-class is your ticket . the post 2019 mercedes g-class is still the statement suv appeared first on news ledge .
