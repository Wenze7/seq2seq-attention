        "watford , england -- abdoulaye doucoure sent the ball into the net with his right hand to score watford 's equalizer in the 90th minute in a 2-2 draw against southampton in the premier league on saturday . video assistant referees were used for the first time in domestic english soccer this week but because they still are n't deployed in the premier league , doucoure 's goal was allowed to stand . james ward-prowse scored southampton 's goals in the 20th and 44th minutes , with watford jeered off by its own fans at halftime . the hosts improved after the break , mainly thanks to the introduction of club captain troy deeney up front , and his strike partner andre gray reduced the deficit in the 58th minute . ",
        "deeney was involved in the controversial equalizer , heading the ball across the six-yard box where doucoure arrived late to get in front of goalkeeper alex mccarthy and push it into the net . southampton 's players protested in vain . since fighting hard to retain manager marco silva 's services in november following interest from everton , watford has won just two of its 10 premier league matches , losing seven of them . from contending for the top four , watford has plunged to 10th place and is only six points above the relegation zone because of the congested nature of the bottom half of the standings . ",
        "silva has been widely hailed since he arrived in england last season for his work at hull , which still went down under the portuguese coach , and watford . silva recently dismissed suggestions that everton 's interest is behind watford 's slump , instead blaming it on injuries and players getting sent off in games .
