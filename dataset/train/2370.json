        "president donald trump pitched his efforts to help rural america , promoting his tax overhaul law and economic development plans on a visit to tennessee on monday . he 's also reserving a seat at the national college football championship game . trump became the first president in a quarter-century to address the annual convention of the american farm bureau federation . with the trip to nashville , he unveiled a report the white house says will include proposals to stimulate a segment of the national economy that has lagged behind others . trump said most of the benefits of the tax legislation are `` going to working families , small businesses , and who , the family farmer . '' ",
        "the $ 1.5 trillion package that trump signed into law last month provides generous tax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest americans , and more modest reductions for middle - and low-income individuals and families . the president warned against voting for democrats in this november 's midterm elections , saying they would undo the tax bill . `` if the democrats ever had the chance , the first thing they would do is get rid of it and raise up your taxes , '' trump said . trump also highlighted the doubling of the threshold for the estate tax -- earning a standing ovation from the audience -- and the ability for companies to immediately write off the full cost of new equipment . ",
        "he said that `` in every decision we make , we are honoring america 's proud farming legacy . '' central to the report is the assessment that the `` provider for an equalization among rural america is connectivity ; that high-speed internet should remain a high priority for the administration , '' said ray starling , the special assistant to the president for agriculture , trade and food assistance . the report calls for expediting federal permitting to allow for broadband internet expansion in rural areas and for making it easier for providers to place cell towers on federal lands . ",
        "trump was set to make two moves on rural broadband monday , with plans to sign an executive order and a memo that the white house described as `` incremental , '' but the start of an effort to make progress on the issue . white house officials said all work was in the early stages and did not offer an overall timeline . officials noted the price tag for rural broadband expansion has been estimated at $ 80 billion , but said the administration had not determined a cost . the president also took credit for working to roll back the obama administration 's interpretation of the clean water act , which had greatly expanded the list of bodies of water subject to federal regulation . ",
        "the farm bureau ran a public relations campaign against the rule and called it `` dangerous and unlawful . '' the agriculture and rural prosperity task force report highlights the importance of addressing the opioid crisis , which has disproportionately affected rural communities . trump also called on congress to renew the farm bill this year , adding he supports providing for federal crop insurance . the massive federal legislation funds federal agriculture and food policy , and it provides for rural communities . trump formed the task force , which includes representatives from cabinet agencies and independent agencies like the federal communications commission , in an april executive order . ",
        "from nashville , trump will travel to atlanta to watch alabama 's crimson tide and georgia 's bulldogs face off monday night in the college football playoff national championship . the game is set for mercedes-benz stadium , the new $ 1.5 billion home field of the atlanta falcons . espn , which is televising the game , said sunday that it appeared unlikely trump would be interviewed during the game . stephanie druley , espn senior vice president for events and studio programs , said the network had been in contact with the white house and she did not `` get the sense '' that an interview would be arranged . ",
        "trump criticized espn in october in response to `` sportscenter '' host jemelle hill tweeting that the president was a `` white supremacist . '' a network often seeks an interview with the president when he attends a game it 's televising .   "
