        "the first vulnerable child refugee stranded in greece who qualifies for sanctuary under the dubs amendment has arrived in the uk , more than a year after the government pledged to bring over hundreds of children . the home office had accepted that the boy was vulnerable and eligible for transfer 16 months ago . the dubs amendment , part of the 2016 immigration act , was passed after a campaign to transfer 3,000 unaccompanied child refugees stuck in camps to britain . there are more than 3,300 unaccompanied children in greece , 11,186 in france and 13,867 in italy . ",
        "the home office has agreed to resettle 480 under the dubs scheme . conditions for lone children in greece have been condemned by human rights watch , which found filthy cells infested with bugs and vermin , sometimes without mattresses or access to showers . hammersmith and fulham council in west london has stepped in to offer the boy a home and one of its social workers travelled to greece to assess the child , who has lost contact with his family in syria . the boy , who is said to be deeply traumatised , was detained until last month in a police cell with no access to medical professionals , and forced to sleep on an inch-thick mattress on the ground . ",
        "police said the boy had repeatedly self-harmed , tried to kill himself and was at `` imminent risk '' of doing this . according to antonia moustaka , a lawyer for the humanitarian agency praksis , he spent more than 380 days in psychiatric clinics , 124 days in shelters for unaccompanied minors and six weeks in police detention . the boy has been taken to a flat in hammersmith provided by the local authority and will receive 24-hour care . council officials will begin the process of assessing his long-term needs . a social worker was permitted to meet and accompany him through the airport when he landed on friday morning . ",
        "a council spokesman said he appeared well but anxious . `` we have a greek-speaking mental health specialist social worker with him who worked with him in greece , '' he said . the council is already accommodating and supporting 13 dubs children from france . george gabriel , the project lead at the charity safe passage , said : `` there are more than 3,300 unaccompanied children in greece and only 1,130 spaces in shelters . the winter is bitterly cold and conditions are getting worse . over a year and a half ago , the dubs amendment brought hope that hundreds of these kids would be brought to safety , as the uk committed to do its fair share protecting lone minors arriving in europe . ",
        "`` it has been appalling to watch these minors wait , month after month , on bureaucratic delays ... we have been working closely with one of the children arriving today , and watching him suffer due to the delays has been heartbreaking . `` hammersmith and fulham council 's leader , steve cowan , said : `` we worked closely with safe passage who alerted us to this case . this child has a legal right to come to britain and deserves so much more . `` josie naughton of the charity help refugees said : `` while we are thrilled to hear of this child being brought to safety , we are heartbroken at how long it has taken . ",
        "one child in two years is unacceptable under any circumstances . ' naughton said help refugees , safe passage and the refugee rights data project have written a joint letter to the home secretary demanding the immediate identification , assessment and transfer of child refugees under the dubs amendment , to meet the government 's target of 480 . a home office spokesperson said : `` we remain committed to transferring 480 children from europe to the uk under section 67 of the immigration act . we have accepted further referrals this year and transfers are ongoing . we will continue to work closely with eu partners and local authorities to transfer eligible children here quickly and safely . ",
        "`` our wider focus remains helping those in need of international protection in the region , which is why we have committed to resettle up to 23,000 refugees from the region - almost 9,000 are already rebuilding their lives in the uk - and the government has pledged Â£ 2.46 bn to the humanitarian response to the syria conflict .
