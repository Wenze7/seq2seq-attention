        "as prime minister theresa may prepares for the next round of brexit negotiations , her government has held back publication of secret files relating to the creation of the european union . the documents from 1992 were due to be released friday at the national archives under british rules that allow government papers to enter the public domain . out of 495 files from the prime minister 's office that year , a total of 114 were held back . of those , 12 related to european policy . the main opposition party was quick to pounce . jon trickett , a high-ranking labour politician described it as `` profoundly shocking , particularly given the current state of the national debate . '' ",
        "may 's government has had a series of problems with information around brexit . last week , after months of ministers trying to keep them secret , the government published an assessments of how different segments of the economy will cope with leaving the eu . lawmakers commented that the documents contained little that could n't be found on wikipedia . not deliberatethe cabinet office , which supports may in the running the government , said in an email that `` there is no question that any files are deliberately ` withheld ' from the media . '' a further 26 files covering the eu were sent to the archives too late for journalists to read them before publication . ",
        "it explained that `` we have to ensure all files are properly reviewed and prepared before they are transferred , so that they do not harm national security or our relations with other countries or disclose the sensitive personal data of living individuals . '' the files that were released reveal the extent to which britain 's 1992 expulsion from the exchange rate mechanism turned conservatives against europe . that year , sept. . 16 was christened `` black wednesday '' after the government 's failed attempt to keep the pound within the system by pushing interest rates up to 15 percent . ",
        "euroskepticsat a cabinet meeting a week later , then-prime minister john major told his colleagues that opposition to the maastricht treaty , which created the eu , had grown within his conservative party . he reckoned it was now up to 100 tory lawmakers -- almost a third of them . they were egged on by major 's immediate predecessor , margaret thatcher . newly-opened files show that at the start of 1991 , thatcher had warned major against pegging the pound against the deutschmark at too high a level . `` she believed there was a danger of repeating winston churchill 's historic error , '' the files say . ",
        "in 1925 , churchill , as chancellor of the exchequer , had returned to the gold standard , fixing the pound at a level that caused deflation , unemployment and ultimately a general strike . while some of the 25-year-old files have contemporary echoes , others highlight how much brexit has changed british priorities . since taking office , may has placed great emphasis on getting a u. s. trade deal . one of the files opened today covers 11 years of meetings between british prime ministers and u. s. trade representatives . it contains just four pieces of paper , and one of those describes thatcher being too busy to meet the american .
