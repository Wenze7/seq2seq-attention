        "british model amena khan , who had been chosen by l'oreal to feature in their latest shampoo ad campaign , has stepped down from her role after tweets emerged of her criticising israel 's brutality against the palestinians . just days into her role , khan announced yesterday that she would be leaving the beauty brand after right-wing media outlets published her tweets from 2014 , in which she condemned the israeli bombardment of gaza . `` championing diversity is one of my passions , i do n't discriminate against anyone . i have chosen to delete them as they do not represent the message of harmony that i stand for , '' she said in a statement . ",
        "a l'oreal spokesperson told the jerusalem post that the company agreed with khan 's decision to step down . both l'oreal and khan have come under criticism on social media for portraying condemnation of israel as racist or anti-semitic . founder of lifestyle webiste muslimgirl amani al-khatahtbeh , also criticised the move , questioning why israeli actress gal gadot , an ambassador for makeup house revlon , had not been similarly censured for her views . `` we have to ask why it 's ok for us to have spokeswomen like @galgadot for @revlon , who use their platform to express support for israel 's military against palestinian women , while we take down spokeswomen like amena for their vocal support of palestinian women , children and people , '' she wrote on twitter . ",
        "last week , al-khatahtbeh turned down a changemaker award from revlon , saying that she could not accept the accolade that `` with gal gadot as the ambassador . '' she said gadot 's `` vocal support of the israeli defense forces ' actions in palestine goes against muslimgirl . com 's morals and values . ''   "
