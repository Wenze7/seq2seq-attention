        "there 's a certain amount of box-ticking with this gloomy swedish crime drama but beyond the cliches , marie richardson 's seductive character hooks us in . plus , britain 's favourite dogs : top 100sam wollastonat a party , somewhere in stockholm , a young man called christian is selling drugs , to a woman called inez , with a z. uh , oh , christian 's mum , hanna , a cop , suddenly shows up , with a couple of uniformed colleagues . empty your pockets , son . `` happy ? '' he asks her , when they find a load of guilty little plastic bags on him . ",
        "`` remember what i said ? '' she relies . that 's some pretty hardcore parenting , but she had warned him , i approve . now he 's going to jail , two years in the naughty room . i 'm not sure christian 's going to forget it for a while , though , even after he 's released and gets a job as a washer-upper hanna 's own career is not going so well . she 's been shifted to financial crime , which is boring her to tears . plus , she is being encouraged to take early retirement by her younger boss . ",
        "so her son hates her , her career 's gone down the swanee , and her colleagues do n't rate her . at least she 's shagging one of them , a married investigator named sven . but then he goes and gets kidnapped , carelessly , and there may be a link with inez . oh , and it all involves warring leather-clad motorcycle gangs , the mobsters and the delincuentos . they 're into that over there , biker gangs . plus , what is krajina ? make that where is krajina , because it 's a place and the answer is in croatia . ",
        "there 's a balkan connection . balkan noir , it could be a new thing . you can do a certain amount of box-ticking with before we die . the tricky family situation , : check . the complicated relationship status . an impatient boss and a new mistrustful colleague . a spattering of pretty sickening violence . and they 've done the usual excellent job of making a scandinavian city look like a thoroughly miserable place to be , wet and dark and inhabited , sparsely , by unhappy people . there 's a lot of driving around at night , looking for missing people with lights reflected in rain-flecked windscreens . ",
        "now hanna and björn are out of town , it 's daylight , but still bleak as hell : grey skies and gloomy woods . great car chase though , dark pickup truck v volvo estate , which ends up flying through the sky . and the pickup , with sven tied up in the back , drives on , into a thickening plot . before we die is not just nordic noir by numbers though . i may not be feeling the intense humanness of the killing , which never let you forget that crime is n't just about bad dudes and cops and violence , it 's about personal tragedy as well . ",
        "nor does it have the ingenious blind alleys , switchbacks and red herrings of the bridge -- again , yet . but hanna is a seductive character , her relationships -- family , personal , work -- are intriguing . as for the plot -- well , it 's a bit like that volvo estate of hers . it takes a bit of getting going , but with a foot to the floor it carries on picking up speed and momentum , until , by the end of this first episode , it 's flying . literally . ah , and i knew christian would n't be entirely back on the straight and narrow . ",
        "perhaps hanna 's parenting was a teeny bit too hardcore after all . a keeper for sure then . and obviously from now on , when asked what i am currently enjoying , i will be referring to it as innan vi dör , with a couple of dots on the o , because i 'm a pretentious tosser . britain 's favourite dogs : top 100 is an awful lot of dogs to sit through -- two and half hours of them . not just the dogs , but their owners , and ben fogle and sara cox presenting , and celebrity dog lovers . ",
        "and heart-warming tales of dogs helping people , and rescuing orphaned kittens , and dogs that are no longer around , and ones with wheels instead of back legs -- wheel dogs , if you will . all to find out that britain 's no 1 favourite dog is ... a labrador . as usual . ben fogle pretty much is a labrador is n't he -- golden , loyal , waggy , posh . oh , and here 's prince harry too , because one of the dog owners is a wounded war hero and took part in the invictus games . ",
        "and because you ca n't keep the windsors off the telly at the moment . `` if i jump around , will you give me a biscuit ? '' harry asks . go on then .   "
