        "antonio cassano says it is a joke to compare paulo dybala and lionel messi , with the barcelona superstar at another level to the juventus forward . dybala 's second full season in turin saw him shine as the bianconeri marched to a sixth serie a title in a row , the 24-year-old scoring 11 goals across the campaign . his low centre of gravity , creativity and quality in the final third led to suggestions he is the heir to lionel messi 's throne with argentina -- and possibly barca . despite rising tensions within the club amid concerns about his off-field behaviour , dybala has continued to impress this season with 14 goals in 19 league appearances , but former italy international cassano thinks he remains a long way off messi 's level . ",
        "`` he is a great player but not a champion , '' cassano told the corriere dello sport . `` last year when he was riding the crest of a wave he was compared to messi and i was laughing . `` we can not even joke . please , leo is another level . higuain , pjanic and buffon are the only three champions in serie a. `` cassano was also less than complimentary about napoli head coach maurizo sarri , despite the 59-year-old leading his side to the top of the table . napoli hold a one-point lead over juve , but that is not enough to impress former ac milan , roma , inter and real madrid striker . ",
        "`` sarri makes a good team play well , '' he added . `` but managing the champions and getting the results that allegri , mourinho , ancelotti , capello and guardiola get is much more complicated . asked if he would like to be coached by sarri , cassano responded : `` no . ''   "
