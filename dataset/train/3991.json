        "on the final denver broncos fanzone interview of the 2017 season , i got to chat with ben phillips and get his takes on the denver broncos season . broncos country , we are just a few days away from the season ending . the denver broncos have fallen apart from the 2016 campaign . from 9-7 to 5-10 with a possibility to go either 6-10 or 5-11 is just tough to see . it may not be the josh mcdaniels season , but it feels as if the team came out flat for the most part of the year . ",
        "going through three quarterbacks , running game not working , turnovers turning into points . it has been a rough ride for all of us . there could be a chance at optimism when the broncos take on the kansas city chiefs for the final time in 2017 . if the broncos can win , and that is a big if , then there is some optimism for the future . vance joseph is likely playing for his job in this game . for his sake , he better hope his coaching does not lead to the team falling flat . ",
        "we shall see what happens . for now , we must conclude the denver broncos fanzone . i want to thank all the individuals who took part in the fanzone this season . i enjoyed every interview . let me welcome our final guest for the season . ben phillips is a denver broncos fan who i had the pleasure of talking broncos over the offseason and during the season . it is a great pleasure to have him on board for the 2017 finale . we talked about the broncos and the game against the chiefs . here is what he had to say . ",
        "the denver broncos brief two game winning streak was snapped on sunday . what went wrong for the team against washington ? oh boy . the game against washington ... . i 'm not sure you could really say what one thing went wrong . the penalties on the offensive line hurt . not to mention the lack of blocking all day . i do n't want to say the offense has little respect for brock , but you could see it during his moment of shouting on the sideline . i think some of that spilled onto the field . ",
        "brock did n't play well at all yesterday . and with the defense sitting back on their heels all day , it just made for a perfect storm of bad . to many guys just seem to have given up on sunday . except for chad kelly , do you think the denver broncos will keep any quarterback on the roster or will they clear house ? it depends on the final game . if paxton can shock us all and play well against the chiefs , hes got a shot to come back . otherwise , i think they toss in the match and burn the quarterback room to the ground and start over . ",
        "i personally do n't see the current three guys in a broncos uniform next year . as a denver broncos fan , what is your favorite memory of all time ? my favorite memory of all time ? that 's a tough one . there are too many good ones . if i had to pick , i would say watching elway get his first super bowl was the best . seeing him take the hit at the goal line when he did the spin in the air , i knew it was on . that guy was not leaving the stadium without that trophy . ",
        "then seeing his reaction when the defense got the final stop on the packers , it was priceless . it all kind of chokes me up thinking about it . the broncos take on the chiefs in the regular season finale . the chiefs could rest most of their starters . with paxton lynch starting , what will it take to get a win ? even against the chiefs second string , they can rush the passer pretty well . o-line has got to play big and keep lynch on his feet . if he has to constantly tuck and run , it 'll get out of hand in a hurry . ",
        "and if the chiefs play mahomes instead of smith , the defense has got to be ready . patrick may be `` underwhelming '' to a lot of people , but he showed at texas tech . he can hurt you if you sit back on him . they ca n't ignore him . is there one player on the broncos roster that has impressed you this season ? shaq barrett really kind of impressed me this year . sitting opposite von miller , you kind of get overlooked . but he really stepped up when he was needed . ",
        "i think he really improved over the last year . ca n't wait to see what the future holds with him . i have to say though , he may not have gotten a lot of playing time , but jamaal charles was pretty impressive to me as well . to come back from the kind of injuries he 's had is nothing short of amazing . thank you ben for taking the time out to chat with me . hopefully the denver broncos have one more win left in them . more from predominantly orange john elway expected to watch sam darnold at usc-ohio state3h ago denver broncos : evaluating mason rudolph after bowl game15h ago denver broncos mock draft update : all in on baker mayfield21h ago denver broncos vs. kansas city chiefs preview1 d ago john elway 's comments suggest big qb move is coming1 d ago on the final denver broncos fanzone interview of the 2017 season , i got to chat with ben phillips and get his takes on the denver broncos season .
