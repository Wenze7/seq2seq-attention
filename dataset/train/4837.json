",
        "the blues had spent the evening locked in talks with besiktas president fikret orman who had jetted into london in the afternoon after negotiations had become more complicated over the fee after everton director of football steve walsh had previously travelled to istanbul on friday . earlier in the day , orman sent a warning to everton saying they must meet their valuation of the turkey international or a deal would not happen and claimed he has already rejected a big money offer for tosun who seemingly had his heart set on a move to the premier league . ` sevilla interested in sandro ramirez as everton open talks over steven n'zonzi ` he said : `` a 35 million euro bid came from china but we did not bring it up . ",
        "`` however due to his willingness to play , we have not brought it up . the big issues surrounding everton 's new stadium - and blues attempt to tie up tosun `` cenk tosun 's future is important for us . `` there is no finished situation right now . if the conditions are what we want the transfer takes place .
