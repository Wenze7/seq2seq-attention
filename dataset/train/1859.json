        "norishige kanai of the japan aerospace exploration agency , anton shkaplerov the russian federal space agency and scott tingle of nasa . nasa the human body is meant to exist under the force of gravity . so when we do crazy things like send it up into space where the weight of this force is slim to none , weird things are going to happen . here 's one : on twitter this past monday , japanese astronaut norishige kanai proudly claimed that after spending three weeks on the international space station , he had grown three and a half inches . ",
        "what ? it 's indeed a well-established fact that spending time in places with zero-g can cause the spine to lengthen a bit , but three and a half inches sounded too good to be true to his fellow astronauts . he remeasured , and it turns out he 's only grown around two centimeters -- not quite an inch . perhaps he was excited about that holiday gift of height . unfortunately , once he returns to earth and all its gravitational pull , his body will quickly shrink down even from this more modest increase . still , two centimeters is not nothing , and it 's a reminder that spending time in space changes our bodies in strange ways . ",
        "kanai is not the first astronaut to report a height increase while spending time in space . when nasa 's scott kelly returned to earth back in march of 2016 , having spent almost a year on the international space station , he came back about two inches taller . spending time in a zero-g environment like that of the international space station causes the spine to stretch . on earth , gravity keeps the vertebrae in place by constantly pushing them together . but without gravity , the vertebrae will naturally expand slightly , causing a person to become taller . ",
        "typically , astronauts in space can grow up to three percent of their original height , but no more -- which is why kanai 's announcement took his fellow spacefarers by surprise . after a few days or weeks back on earth , gravity compress a person back down to their original height . zero-g environments also come with a large list of other potential side effects to the human body , and not all of them are as fun as a sudden boost in height . unfortunately , not many humans have spent enough time in space for scientists to truly understand those downsides . ",
        "we are beginning to understand a few . we know that a lack of gravity can change how blood and other bodily fluid naturally flows throughout the body , pushing all the fluid upward . this creates pressure and swelling in certain areas , particularly behind the eyes , which can cause vision problems . another big issue is , of course , radiation . within the confines of earth 's magnetic fields , humans are protected from much of the radiation spewed by our powerful sun . but up in orbit , we are far more vulnerable . this constant exposure can increase your risk of cancer . ",
        "but just as health on earth can vary quite a lot from person to person , space affects individual astronauts in unique ways . for this reason , nasa is studying both scott kelly and his identical twin mark . the two are both astronauts . but scott spent an entire year on the iss while mark remained on earth . during that year , nasa and other researchers monitored both brothers ' health , and have continued to do so in the hopes of better evaluating the temporary and long-term physiological changes associated with spaceflight . this is going to be particularly useful in the coming years , as plans to bring people to mars -- an extended space trip indeed -- press on . ",
        "so if you do wish you were slightly taller , consider becoming an astronaut who participates in longterm space missions . but remember to relish your extended height when you 're up there , because it 's all downhill once you 're back on earth . a version of this article originally ran on march 3 , 2016 . it has been updated .
