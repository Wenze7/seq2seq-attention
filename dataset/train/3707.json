        "let 's get this straight : i generally hate beets . there is nothing about this root vegetable to that appeals to me . i 've sent back a salad before because it was laced with cooked , shredded beets that were tossed in there unbeknownst to me . however , after i recently tried a salad recipe that called for thinly sliced golden beets , my sentiments towards the vegetable became far more tolerant . do n't get me wrong , i have given beets a fair chance . i 've eaten them roasted , boiled , mashed , and pickled , but eating them raw in a salad might be the only way i actually enjoy them . ",
        "unlike their red counterpart , golden beets have a milder flavor and wo n't stain your hands as dramatically with their juices . along with the beets , the salad included thinly sliced carrots and radishes , all tossed with leafy greens and coated in a lemony tahini dressing . not only did the creaminess of the tahini dressing coated the raw vegetables well , but the slight bitterness and acidity in tahini mellowed the earthy golden beet slices perfectly , and sold me on the very vegetable that i 've spent a lifetime disliking . since beets are one of those vegetables that people generally either like or despise , there is not much space for middle of the road feelings . ",
        "it 's like cilantro . i can sprinkle cilantro on just about anything with no problem , but for others , it tastes like soap . and for a long time , beets tasted like fertilized soil to me . thanks to science , there is an explanation for that distinctive dirty-sweet flavor that can be off-putting to some . beets have an organic chemical compound called geosmin that gives them their earthy flavor . each person has a different sensitivity to geosmin , causing some to like or dislike the natural earthiness . ultimately , it 's also just a matter of personal preference . ",
        "it takes baby steps in order to come around to liking beets , but when you do , the health benefits will make you glad you did . eating beets can help lower blood pressure , improve endurance performance , and increase blood flow to the brain . beets are rich in fiber and improve overall digestion . once you come to appreciate their flavor , beets are truly the gift that keep on giving .
