        "the teaser trailer for atlanta 's new season dropped during the golden globes sunday night , somewhere in between a brilliant speech from oprah and a tommy wiseau appearance -- giving us even more reason to be excited for the show 's upcoming march premiere . the minute-long teaser is just a single , sustained panning shot as donald glover and the show 's stars pose in diners , driveways , and a club full of levitating strippers . there 's also an alligator in there somewhere , but sadly no sign of the `` very tan caucasians '' glover was searching for to play `` floridians . '' ",
        "the whole thing is soundtracked by sonder 's `` too fast '' and is lit like caravaggio was the dp . the teaser does n't seem to give us a look at any actual footage from season two , but the minute-long clip perfectly captures atlanta 's strange , beautiful , and surreal tone . it 's only fitting that fx decided to premiere the season two teaser during the 2018 golden globes since the first season of atlanta took home a pair of awards at last year 's ceremony . but ultimately , the clip would be just as exciting if it was dumped on youtube one day without any fanfare -- it 's just good to know we 'll be getting more atlanta soon . ",
        "the first episode of season two , called atlanta : robbin ' season , drops march 1 and the show 's creators have promised that the new season will have a more cohesive , season-long arc , vulture reports , inspired by , uh , the 1992 cartoon tiny toons : how i spent my summer vacation . `` tiny toons summer vacation was broken up into a bunch of episodes , but if you watched them all together they were a movie , '' co-creator stephen glover said at a panel last week . `` we took that idea . ",
        "it 's a whole story , but told in a bunch of little parts . '' sunday 's new trailer does n't exactly give off the tiny toons vibe , what with all the chiaroscuro and lack of talking animals , but maybe season two will end with earn enrolling at acme looniversity or something . we 'll have to wait until march to see .
