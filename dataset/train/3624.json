        "tuesday 's 7.9 magnitude earthquake in the gulf of alaska sent vibrations through the earth that caused water to rise and fall in wells in florida , thousands of miles away . sensors near fort lauderdale and madison showed a in water levels after the earthquake , according to the united states geological survey . the blue line is the time of the gulf of alaska earthquake tuesday . you can see the small water displacement in both wells a short time later as indicated by the sharp upward motion of the red line and the downward plunge in the black line . ",
        "a water level rise from 41.59 feet to 41.77 feet was recorded at the well near madison before it returned to normal . at the well near fort lauderdale , the water level fell from 1.42 feet to 1.31 feet . why did water levels in these wells some 3,800 miles away from the earthquake 's epicenter change ? tuesday 's earthquake epicenter and the location of the two wells in florida where water movement was detected . vibrations that move through the earth called seismic waves are the culprit . seismic waves are depicted by the upward and downward lines on seismographs used to detect earthquakes around the world . ",
        "`` water levels in wells respond to the seismic-wave induced expansion and contraction of the aquifer tapped by the well , in turn causing step or oscillatory fluid-pressure changes , '' the usgs says . the changes in groundwater levels are often seen hundreds , or even thousands , of miles away from an earthquake 's epicenter . after an 8.5 magnitude earthquake near alaska in 1964 water level changes were reported at 716 wells in the united states , according to the usgs . occasionally , changes can be extreme . a 5.2 magnitude northwest pennsylvania temblor in 1998 rendered dry about 120 wells for local homes for about three months .
