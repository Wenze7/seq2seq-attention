        "what can give you rouged , bruised lips without the studied drama delivered by a proper , grown-up lipstick ? hmmm . what can supply an imperfect lip blush without the air of insanity delivered by badly applied grown-up lipstick . what if you just want a careless smoosh that also looks polished ? an approachably rosy mouth that does n't look done ? you get my drift . the answer to all these questions is clarins instant light natural lip balm perfector in red . yup , just ` red ' . it 's not called violent mood swing or tempting innards or tumescent organ . ",
        "just red . that is why everyone needs a bit of clarins in their life : for that elegant parisian clarity . from its classics such as eau dynamisante to the radiance-inducing beauty flash balm to the tonic body oil , clarins is always a thrill . back to the balm . first of all i 'm mad about the taste , which is , broadly , toffee . delicious . second i 'm nuts about the compact tube , which shuts with the pleasing click of an expensive car door . next the colour is a true red -- with none of those uncomfortable blue tones that can be so unflattering . ",
        "lastly the texture has the slide-iness and sheen you want from a balm without the more obvious , effortful shine of a gloss . annabel rivkini think it 's best to put this stuff on without a mirror ; the more naïve the better . this is the definition of a casual red lip . barely there and yet unmistakeable . clarins instant light natural lip balm perfector in red , £ 18.50 .
