        "christmas time is the best time to forgive people and give them a second chance . a lot of things are taken unspoken and you trouble yourself with the thoughts about it . but it 's a lot easier and less strenuous to talk with the person and give it a second chance . there is tension in you the whole time until you have n't got things straightened out with everybody . you loose a lot of time by thinking about that thing . as soon as the problem is solved your head will be more free than before and you can get on to other things . ",
        "of course it needs conscious effort to take the first step but it will be worth it . be honest to the other person . say what you 're thinking and feeling and also listen to the other one . risk it once again and you will see that only good things get out of it . in the worst case scenario you just tried it with the person . and then you know that you have tried everything to overcome the tension . make a move towards people and be friendly . be open for new things and other people . ",
        "give them another chance and maybe you just misunderstood something . afterwards you will feel better and you will not think about it again . a lot of times you just got misunderstood or you misunderstood the other person , just because you have a different look on that situation , you 're thinking different or you made other experiences . just be honest with the other person and say what you think and than you can solve misunderstandings really quickly . somehow like that i got together with my now ex-boyfriend . there was a misunderstanding and at first i rejected him . ",
        "but because we were seeing each other almost every day i thought about it a lot and i was in a bad mood . because there was something standing between us and i just do n't like it when i have n't got things straightened out with everybody . at that time , it was pre-christmas season , i wrote him once again because i wanted to clear up everything between us . i just took the first step and gave us another chance because i could n't stand this tension anymore . i now know that i should have taken that step earlier because i lived with this tension for about 2 months . ",
        "and within a few minutes and text messages on facebook the unpleasant feeling was over . the people are also always saying that you should have got things straightened out with everything . because then you can leave the world carefree . because afterwords everything is over . so take a risk and talk with the people . free yourself from all the unpleasant feelings you have . city hall in vienna .
