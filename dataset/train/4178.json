        "dec 30 -- hull fc centre josh griffin says he is looking forward to next season and is happy to play wherever lee radford tells him to . the 25-year-old began last season playing at left centre but was dropped later on in the campaign in favour of carlos tuimavave due to a lack of form and persistent injuries . the samoan international is likely to keep his place there for 2018 and with jake connor playing well at right centre , griffin may have to bide his time going into next season . however , the ex-salford man whose brothers darrell and george also play in super league , says he is happy to play anywhere in the 2018 season , as hull aim to win their first ever super league trophy and first top-flight success since 1983 . ",
        "`` wherever i play i 'll give it my all . i 've spoken to radders about being in the mix for the wing spot as well as the back row , '' griffin told the hull daily mail . `` there is competition right across the park and most importantly i just want to be in the team . even if i end up on the bench a couple of times like i did last season then so be it . i did n't mind that role of being tasked with making an impact . `` copyright independent content services .
