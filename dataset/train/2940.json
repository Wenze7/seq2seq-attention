        "toby young has stepped down from the office for students after a huge backlash to his appointment . toby young : social media self-obsessive still battling with father 's shadowin a statement posted on the spectator website on tuesday morning , young said : `` my appointment has become a distraction from its vital work of broadening access to higher education and defending academic freedom . `` young 's appointment to the board of the ofs , which is meant to help uphold standards at universities , caused a storm after a string of offensive tweets directed at women , and controversial writing about working-class students . ",
        "writing on tuesday , young said `` the caricature drawn of me in the last seven days , particularly on social media , has been unrecognisable to anyone who knows me '' . but he conceded : `` some of the things i said before i got involved in education , when i was a journalistic provocateur , were either ill-judged or just plain wrong - and i unreservedly apologise . `` among a number of publicly posted lewd comments about women 's breasts , young tweeted during prime minister 's questions in 2012 , he tweeted : `` serious cleavage behind @ed_miliband 's head . ",
        "anyone know who it belongs to ? `` pamela nash , the former labour mp referred to in the tweet , told the guardian : `` this is not about the odd tweet or stray comment . this is about a sustained , twisted view that has been expressed over many years . `` in an interview with andrew marr on the bbc on sunday , theresa may appeared to back young , saying he had done `` exceedingly good work in relation to free schools '' but warned that any future offensive language would result in him being `` no longer ... in public office '' . ",
        "in his resignation blog , young thanked the prime minister `` for standing by me , and drawing a distinction between my earlier life and my subsequent record in education '' . this is a breaking news story . more details to follow .   "
