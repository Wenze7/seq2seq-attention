        "surviving the change in facebook news feed algorithm is possible , thanks to messenger chatbots . mark zuckerberg has announced what social media managers have long feared : the imminent change in the facebook algorithm , that will soon disadvantage the organic reach of the pages . this problem translates into the possibility of finding new innovative solutions focused on not to lose the acquired visibility . at olyo we are convinced that the most promising solution are the messenger chatbots . olyo is the platform allowing direct marketing on messenger . currently is in private beta and free . ",
        "you can request an invitation on www . olyo . com . in this article we 'll cover : how to survive the decrease of the organic reachthe advantages of a messenger chatbotthe importance of being relevant to the userhow to survive the decrease of the organic reachfacebook will drastically reduce the organic reach of facebook pages to encourage the presence on the user 's news feed of the most relevant contents for them : those posted by their friends and those sponsored by companies . this change was already in the air since october 2017 , when a large number of facebook marketing posts were moved from the news feed posts to explore feeds . ",
        "the results in terms of reach for the pages that were submitted to the test were disastrous . the change announced globally wo n't completely ban the posts of the pages from the news feed , but will drastically reduce the presence of these contents . since facebook is still an indispensable channel for digital marketing , according to us there are two main solutions to this possible debacle : increase the investments in advertising on facebook and activate a messenger chatbot . to maintain a position of relevance , it will be important to experiment and find alternative ways to reach users . ",
        "the advantages of a messenger chatbotfrom the moment in which the contents of the pages will be less and less visible , the page managers will be forced to resort to paid sponsors through facebook . the combination of growing requests for sponsorships and its reduced availability will lead to an increase in the cost of all the paid metrics . in short , it 's likely that costs will be drastically increase to reach even a thousand people or get few clicks . potentially , costs could also rise to match those of linkedin and twitter , but only time will give us a definitive answer . ",
        "these are the moments of difficulty that lead people to look for new ways to achieve their goals . in this case , the most innovative and potentially more successful solution to reach users on facebook is to bet on messenger . below we have set out why we are convinced messenger chatbot is the solution : mobile first : it 's evident people use mobiles more than desktop and the constant growth of this channel is unstoppable from year to year . 80 % of users would never leave home without their smartphone and 50 % watch notifications as soon as they wake up . ",
        "so what 's better than a push notification coming from messenger ? not only is the message delivered to the user directly , but it is also clearly visible on the smartphone without having to open the app . you 're still on facebook : facebook is the most used app worldwide in terms of number of registered users and average number of hours spent on it . by sending a message on messenger users will be notified both via push notification and within the facebook app . messenger is an uncrowded channel : there are still very few companies that have included messenger in their digital marketing strategy . ",
        "this channel has been underestimated for too long , relegating it mainly to the customer care function . at the moment , users send the first message to companies . changing this practice could have a lot of benefits . the potential to stand out in comparison to competitors is enormous . sent messages have a 100 % reach : content sent via a messenger chatbot reaches all subscribers at the same time . olyo allows you to create a landing page dedicated to this purpose , as well as inserting a button embed on your site . you can also gain new users by sending automatic messages to anyone who comments a post on their page . ",
        "the open rate of the messages can reach 98 % : this means that almost all recipients open the content . this open rate is exceptional for any direct marketing tool to achieve , particularly via email . the potential ctr is 50 % : if a link is incorporated within the message , the ctr has a potential to reach remarkable levels . this is another example of how direct messaging on messenger attracts user attention more than any other marketing channel . increasing investment spend is not required to achieve increased profit . in one of our most recent internal campaigns , for example , no additional investment has been made and yet we have seen a return of â‚¬ 2000 in just a few hours ; -rrb- the importance of being relevant to the userthere is a principle that applies to any channel , and that of course , is relevance . ",
        "when a user sees a post that has no relevance to them , they will either ignore it , or try to block it . even for content sent via messenger , the rule less is better is valid : sending less content , more accurate and more relevant will result in greater interest from users . with olyo , you can segment your database based on user actions thanks to the tag and filter system . for example , when utilizing ` sport ' as a tag , you will then be able to deliver other sport-related content to all those users who have previously clicked on content associated with this tag , hence providing more personalized content , specific to that user -- and hence achieving relevance to the user !
