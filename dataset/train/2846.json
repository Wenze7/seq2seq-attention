        "a spokeswoman for roy moore said that doug jones wants to kill a cnn anchor 's unborn baby , among other thingsmatthew rozsa2017-12-05t15 : 45:21 z • 2017-12-05t15:45:21z • 0 commentsjane porter , a spokeswoman for embattled republican senate candidate roy moore , told cnn on tuesday that she does n't believe the women accusing the alabaman of sexual misconduct -- and that she does n't understand why people were n't focusing on the many women who have n't accused him of similar misdeeds . after being played a clip of accuser leigh corfman describing moore 's alleged attempt to seduce her , porter was asked by host poppy harlow whether she believed the accusers . ",
        "`` i do n't believe her at all ! '' porter replied , before proceeding to pick apart corfman 's story , including claiming that she was `` sought after '' by the washington post and that corfman 's own mother had contradicted aspects of her story . when harlow pointed out that corfman 's story had been reluctant to come forward until other women had already done so and that this had made her life more difficult , porter replied that the media should n't be taken in by an `` academy award-winning performance . `` after harlow noted that corfman 's story had been corroborated by 30 people between 1977 and 1982 , porter insisted that this was n't true , before arguing that the media was biased against moore because it would n't report on the women who had n't accused him of sexual misconduct . ",
        "`` poppy , we need to make it clear that there is a group of non-accusers that have not accused the judge of any sexual misconduct or anything illegal , '' porter exclaimed . earlier in the interview , porter also took a swipe at moore 's democratic rival , doug jones . `` congratulations on your unborn child . that 's the reason why i came down as a volunteer to speak for judge roy moore , 'cause he 'll stand for the rights of babies like yours in the womb , where his opponent will support killing them up until the moment of birth , '' porter told harlow .
