        "no , donald . just ... no . the president of the united states sent out an irresponsible and flat-out wrong tweet on thursday that shows his total ignorance on the issue of climate change . in case you had n't heard , it 's very cold in the midwest and northeast u. s. and parts of canada . here 's what donald trump had to say about it : . let 's examine why this tweet is such a mess , shall we ? first of all , trump has confused climate and weather . as nasa so helpfully explained , weather is the way the atmosphere behaves in the short-term . ",
        "is it cold and raining outside your window ? that 's the weather . now , consider the weather in an area over a period of years or decades or centuries . that long-term pattern is the climate . so , just because it 's colder than usual in your city this week does n't mean it 's not trending warmer over time . and the science proves that the earth is getting warmer . globally , 2017 is set to be one of the five warmest years on record . the warmest on record is 2016 . before that it was 2015 , and before that was 2014 . ",
        "you get the picture . and yeah , it 's likely to be frigid on new year 's eve in the northeast . but it wo n't be colder than usual everywhere . here 's a global map of temperatures from today . global temperature departures from average on dec. . 28 , 2017 . image : climate reanalyzerthe red does n't mean it 's hot -- those areas are just experiencing milder than usual temperatures . and even if it was scorching hot everywhere , that 's only data from a single day , not over time . so no , this map does n't show climate change . ",
        "it just shows that temperatures are n't colder than average across the globe today , but the u. s. is currently experiencing the most unusually cold weather on the planet right now , which is notable from a weather standpoint . trump 's tweet also grossly mischaracterizes the paris climate agreement , which committed countries to take voluntary emissions reductions in order to keep global warming `` well below '' 2 degrees celsius , or 3.6 degrees fahrenheit , above average through the year 2100 . the u. s. was not required to pay trillions of dollars under the agreement , and every country on earth aside from the u. s. is moving forward with implementing it . ",
        "trump 's own administration published a climate study in november that found that global annually averaged surface air temperatures have increased by about 1 degree celsius , or 1.8 degrees fahrenheit , during the past 115 years . `` this period is now the warmest in the history of modern civilization , '' the report states . it also said : . climate change is real . whether trump is just being ignorant or irresponsible is the only real unknown factor here .
