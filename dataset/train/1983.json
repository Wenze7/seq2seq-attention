        "the countdown to the 21st world cup can now well and truly begin following friday 's group-stage draw in moscow . all 32 teams learned their fate for next year 's finals in russia , and one from those nations will enter football history on july 15 when the final will be contested at the luzhniki stadium . before we get that far , though , the pool stages must be contested and -- with the help of opta data -- we have analysed groups a-d . group a : russia , saudi arabia , egypt , uruguay . russia could hardly have asked for a better group as they aim to avoid being just the second host nation to exit at the group stage . ",
        "however , as an independent nation , russia -- currently the lowest-ranked team of the 32 -- have never reached the knockout stages and have lost their last five games at the tournament , but uruguay are their highest-ranked opponents . uruguay , whose boss oscar tabarez is making a fourth world cup appearance , won the tournament on their first two outings in 1930 and 1950 , and their only loss in their past eight group-stage games came against costa rica four years ago . edinson cavani will spearhead the attack having scored 10 goals in qualifying , while luis suarez has been involved in seven of uruguay 's last 13 world cup strikes . ",
        "saudi arabia are playing their fifth world cup and first since 2006 , but they do not have a win since 1994 . incredibly , this is egypt 's first world cup since 1990 and mohamed salah 's penalty that secured qualification sparked mass celebrations . boss hector cuper manages at a world cup for the first time , while egypt are yet to win a match at the finals . group b : portugal , spain , morocco , iran . with the lack of a true `` group of death '' , this pool is among the toughest of the eight , with european champions portugal hosting spain in the group 's opener . ",
        "the last two world cup winners , which includes spain , have been knocked out in the group stages at the following tournament . spain are at their 11th straight world cup and will be desperate to bounce back from the ignominy of being eliminated before the knockout stages last time out . spain came up against portugal en route to winning the 2010 edition , david villa scoring the only goal in 1-0 win . portugal , boosted by their not-so-secret weapon cristiano ronaldo , who was involved in more goals than any other player in european qualifiers , won their first major tournament at euro 2016 and will aim to become the fourth nation to win the european championship and world cup back to back . ",
        "morocco will appear at the finals for the first time in 20 years and have history against portugal having beaten them 3-1 in 1986 . iran have qualified for successive world cups for the first time and head coach carlos queiroz will come up against the country of his birth portugal . iran have just one world cup victory , a famous 2-1 triumph over the united states in 1998 . official | these are @sefutbol 's opponents for the world cup group stage ! #worldcupdraw pic . twitter . com/cqalflhvly . -- selección española de fútbol december 1 , 2017 . ",
        "group c : france , australia , peru , denmark . france are among the favourites to triumph in russia , and with the likes of paul pogba , antoine griezmann and kylian mbappe in their ranks it is not hard to see why . les bleus have reached the last two finals in europe , triumphing on home soil in 1998 and losing to italy on penalties in 2006 . didier deschamps is heading into a third major tournament as boss , leading france to the last eight four years ago and the final of euro 2016 , where they lost to portugal on their own turf . ",
        "denmark were beaten by france at world cup ' 98 , but gained revenge four years later when les bleus were knocked out in the group stage . christian eriksen will be the danes ' dangerman having been involved in 56 per cent of their goals in qualifying . australia toiled in qualifying and needed an inter-confederation play-off to progress , though they are currently without a manager following ange postecoglou 's resignation . the socceroos have only two world cup wins to their name , but veteran tim cahill has a fine personal record , scoring five of his countries goals at the global showpiece . ",
        "peru are returning to the world stage for the first time since 1982 , the biggest gap of years between participations of any of the 32 teams . group d : argentina , iceland , croatia , nigeria . argentina will face familiar foes in the form of nigeria . the super eagles will be taking on argentina for the fifth time in six world cup appearances and have lost all four of their previous matches against them . argentina are two-time winners , but were beaten in the final by germany four years ago . jorge sampaoli 's men almost missed out on the tournament altogether before talismanic skipper lionel messi , scorer of seven goals in conmebol qualifying , saved them with a hat-trick against ecuador in a win-or-bust encounter . ",
        "expect to see argentina in the knockout stages - they have gone past round one in 11 of their last 12 appearances . at the other end of the scale , iceland are one of two tournament debutants . with just 334,000 inhabitants they are the smallest nation to reach a finals and will look for more memorable moments having knocked england out of euro 2016 . croatia needed a play-off against greece to reach a fifth world cup and have lost their opening fixture at the past three editions of the competition . croatia are aiming to channel the class of ' 98 , when they finished third on their first appearance .
