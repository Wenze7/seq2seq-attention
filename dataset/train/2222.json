        "the sticky tray of orange juice and coffee wobble on my palm when i see him . hot dad and his two cute kids again . i do n't understand why after all this time i still get butterflies just seeing him . i can see the other waitresses eyeing him and inching towards the door , but i can beat them . i pretend i do n't see my table 's eager eyes as i set their tray of drinks down on the back counter and grab three menus , waving over the heads of two waitresses and smiling . ",
        "hot dad nods , grabbing a hand of each kid and follows me to one of my tables . i ignore the glares of my other customers while we make stilting small talk . by the time food comes out , their table 's gained a few more admirers . two little blonde girls stand in the corner , giggling at hot dad 's son , a cutie with blonde curls and green eyes . the kid , who looks like he 's probably ten or eleven , blushes scarlet and stares fixedly at his plate , pushing cut pieces of blueberry pancake around , not eating . ",
        "`` hey , '' i say to the kid , another tray of someone else 's drinks in one hand . `` got girl problems ? '' i see his dad smile and my stomach flutters . `` yeah , '' mumbles the kid . `` well , '' i say , not knowing how i 'm going to finish this sentence . then words flash in my mind , rolling to my tongue before my brain can stop them . `` if you grow up to look anything like your dad , '' my mouth continues while my brain says shut up , shut up , shut up , `` you wo n't have any girl problems . '' ",
        "when i realize what 's come out of my mouth , my heart drops to my stomach . i start inching away from the table , but hot dad is watching me . i notice he is n't wearing a ring as he leans his arm on the table . `` oh , yeah ? '' hot dad asks , eyes on mine . i giggle , but it is n't convincing . there 's no chance he 'd be interested in me , and i hate myself for opening my big gob . `` yeah , '' i say with another step away . ",
        "hot dad is smiling , he 's painfully gorgeous . tall with broad , muscled shoulders , light grey eyes and big lips framing a contagious smile . he 's so far out of my league we 're not even in the same country . `` how many problems will i have ? '' he asks . `` umm , ninety-nine ? '' i offer with another weak chuckle , painfully aware of my clunky , non-slip white sneakers and my zoo-keeper waitress uniform -- a shapeless polo tucked into long khaki shorts . `` and what wo n't be one ? '' ",
        "he 's egging me on now , and i 'm getting more and more nervous . i 'm unnaturally aware of how large my tongue feels in my mouth . `` uh ... ladies ? '' hot dad laughs a real laugh now and i laugh with him , taking my chance to exit before i make things worse . i spend the rest of their meal as far away from their table as possible , afraid of what else my mouth will say without permission . i see him grab the check off the table and head to the register as his kids run out ahead . ",
        "i 'm weighed down by another tray when he stops next to me , slipping me a folded napkin tab . i see numbers scrawled in red crayon as he bends down slightly and whispers , `` if you ever want to go to a meal you do n't have to serve , i 'd love to take you to dinner . '' i smile noncommittally , trying to keep my eyes from popping out of my head in shock . he does n't give me a chance to respond , but keeps moving to the register . i shove his number deep in my pocket and watch as my crush of years walks out the door , his number in my pocket and a dinner in our future .
