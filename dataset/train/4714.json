        "las vegas -- cherry , one of the leaders in mechanical keyboard switches , and often a must-have for keyboard enthusiasts , is releasing a new low-profile switch , the company announced here at ces 2018 today . the switch is called the cherry mx low profile rgb , and it will come in the company 's red variety . the first keyboards with the new switches will come in the second quarter of 2018 . credit : andrew e. freedman/tom 's guidethe switch is aimed at new , thinner keyboards and , potentially , upcoming gaming notebooks . in some hands-on time with prototype keyboard , it felt almost exactly the same as a keyboard at my desk with full-size cherry red switches , although these key had lower travel . ",
        "the first version of the new switch is based on cherry 's existing mx rgb reds . the switch is 11.9 millimeters thick , or 35 percent thinner than the existing 18.5 mm mx standard . a representative for cherry told me that some gaming-laptop companies are looking into these new switches . making the switches was a challenge , i was told , because while some users wanted lower travel , they wanted the same classic feel . unfortunately , that was hard to reproduce with science , they said , so cherry had to keep making prototypes until they got it right . ",
        "but the new switch is not exactly the same as the old one . there are a few changes . for instance , the signature cross-shaped stem is now surrounded by a cylinder . this makes each switch tougher against water and dust , although it wo n't be 100 percent water - and dust-proof . the force curve is ever so slightly different , but very close to mx switches , and the actuation point , by necessity , is lower . the rgb back lighting shines evenly across each key , thanks to a groove in the switch that allows more light , which will be great for gaming laptops that tend to offer a wide variety of colors . ",
        "cherry did n't say exactly when the first keyboards will come , but it was showing off its own prototypes as well as early prototype keyboards by companies like ducky and vortex . best gaming keyboards - mechanical , wireless & rgba guide to mechanical keyboard switcheshow to buy a gaming keyboard .
