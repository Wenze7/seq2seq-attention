        "washington - some 200,000 salvadorean nationals who have been living in the us for at least 17 years face the prospect of deportation after their special residency status was revoked on monday . the trump administration on monday said it was cancelling salvadoreans ' temporary protection status that allowed them to come and live in the us after devastating earthquakes in 2001 in their native country . their protected status was renewed several times in following years . homeland security secretary kirtjen nielsen said in a statement on monday that she had concluded , `` based on careful consideration of available information , '' that conditions in el salvador have improved meanwhile , and an ongoing protection status is no longer justified . ",
        "the salvadorean nationals have until september 2019 to leave the us or find other legal means of remaining in the country . in the statement , the department cited the repatriation of more than 39,000 people to el salvador in the last two years as proof that the country 's `` temporary inability '' to bring back citizens no longer applies .
