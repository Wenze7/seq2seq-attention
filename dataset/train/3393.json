",
        "`` speaking to people attending the rally , he said : `` you all come for one beautiful cause : to build a society where life is celebrated , protected and cherished . `` you love every child , born and unborn , because you believe that every life is sacred , that every child is a precious gift from god , '' he added . the president reiterated claims he has made previously that abortions can be carried out as late nine months in some us states . `` it is wrong and has to change , '' he said .
