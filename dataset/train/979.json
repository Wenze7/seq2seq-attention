        "philadelphia , pa -- november 27 : the cleveland cavaliers bench reacts in the fourth quarter against the philadelphia 76ers at the wells fargo center on november 27 , 2017 in philadelphia , pennsylvania . the cavaliers defeated the 76ers 113-91 . note to user : user expressly acknowledges and agrees that , by downloading and or using this photograph , user is consenting to the terms and conditions of the getty images license agreement . history shows that the cleveland cavaliers will make a trade this winter , but this time , it might be a blockbuster deal that they pull off . ",
        "the cleveland cavaliers have won fourteen of their last fifteen games . however , i think even lebron james knows that this team is still one key superstar behind the golden state warriors . while thomas , james , and love can form a dynamic trio along with wade to create a resilient four-player combination , that fifth player must improve . other players like jr smith , who has proven to be a fantastic shooter , and kyle korver , who has also been of the league 's most effective shooters and a dynamic distraction , just do not match up well with the warriors . ",
        "smith 's heat checks are normally uncalled for shots basically surrendering a possession , and while korver is a fantastic shooter , his playmaking is non-existent against good defenses . to be fair , kevin love usually disappears when facing the warriors also . love averaged 16.0 points per game in the 2017 nba finals , three less than his season average . he also shot less than 31 % in three of those games , showing his ineffectiveness when given the ball . that said , even with isaiah thomas dominating the warriors , the cavaliers would still be one player away , since they lost kyrie irving this past offseason . ",
        "over the course of the last two seasons , both channing frye and kyle korver have been the midseason acquisition for the cavaliers , a move made to try to quickly enhance their roster to compete with golden state . well , this season , a role player will just not cut it . but , one of these three superstars might do the trick . orlando , fl -- november 29 : paul georgepaul george and intriguing oklahoma city thunder situationcoming into this season , the oklahoma city thunder along with the cleveland cavaliers and houston rockets were thought to be the only true contenders to even be in the same ballpark as the golden state warriors . ",
        "at this point , even though they have beating golden state once this season , they just are n't a quality team . the experiment of combination russell westbrook , carmelo anthony , and paul george just has not worked out . as a team , okc is 12-13 and a horrific 3-10 on the road . more from king james gospel the houston rockets believe they can sign lebron james in the offseason13h ago jae crowder is the cleveland cavaliers ' x-factor13h ago the cleveland cavaliers ' best lineups for when isaiah thomas returns14h ago 5 lessons we learned from the cleveland cavaliers 13-game win streak15h ago cleveland cavaliers ' player grades : cavs look lethargic in loss to pacers1 d ago personally , i think george just has n't felt comfortable playing alongside a ball-dominant superstar like russell westbrook , who prefers to create his own shot then differ to others . ",
        "carmelo anthony is the same way , shooting over 45 % of his 15.4 shots on pull-ups . while westbrook and anthony have played with dominating superstars like kevin durant and kristaps porzingis , playing with isolation superstars is a new and unfamiliar thing for paul george , and he just has not become accustomed to it . george , however , is still a superstar . he still puts up fantastic numbers even in the dismantling losses that okc has taken . george is averaging 20.7 points per game , three less than last season , and he is shooting just 41.6 % from the field which is far less than his 46.1 % which he shot in indy . ",
        "george has been used less yet still averages 2.8 turnovers per game . ultimately , paul george was a rental , and if the oklahoma city thunder , who currently sit in 9th place in the west , do not get it going , their management may have no choice but brace for the future and trade paul george . that said , if paul george were ever to be shopped , i hope the cleveland cavaliers are ready to offer everything it takes to bring him to cleveland , a place he might possibly re-sign this offseason . how does kevin love , iman shumpert , and the brooklyn nets 2018 first-round pick sound ? ",
        "new orleans , la -- december 06 : demarcus cousinsthe failing experiment in new orleansthe one key that these three superstars have in common is that they are all apart of a team that is slowly failing . the new orleans pelicans traded for demarcus cousins last season . cousins plays alongside superstar anthony davis , who has been the face of the franchise since drafted in 2012 . the second thing that each of these superstars have in common is that they have the option to leave their franchise following this season . so , just like the oklahoma city thunder , if this train heads further downhill , the new orleans pelicans might want to avoid losing cousins in free agency . ",
        "unlike paul george who has taken a step back , demarcus cousins have thrived in new orleans . he 's scoring 26.3 points per game , grabbing 12.6 boards per game , and even dishing out 5.1 assists per game . however , demarcus cousins just has not seen team success in new orleans . on the season , he has a net rating of -1.8 , and the pelicans are just 14-13 , sitting seventh in the west . for cousins to be on the market , the pelicans might have to drop out of playoff contention before the trade deadline , but that is certainly possible though . ",
        "even if they make the playoffs , if cousins tells new orleans his intent is to not re-sign , then he will be gone , and just like for paul george , the cleveland cavaliers should be there with the best offer . this scenario might only happen with the pelicans ' if their season taking a steep downhill turn . watch for the pelicans and how they perform heading in the new year . cleveland , oh -- november 17 : deandre jordandeandre jordan and the 9-15 clippersdeandre jordan and his situation with the los angeles clippers is one of the most talked about scenarios in the nba , and unlike both paul george and demarcus cousins , teams have actually shown interest in deandre jordan . ",
        "it will just be a matter of time before the goliath 7-footer is traded . while jordan averages just 1.1 blocks per game , he secures 14.3 boards per game , 9.5 being on the defensive end . jordan 's defensive numbers are not eye-popping , but his ratings certainly are . in three straight seasons from 2013-2016 , jordan had a net rating of 20 + and a defensive rating of less than 100 . both of those are seemingly unheard of in the modern-day nba . jordan 's numbers do not do him justice ; the impact he has on an opponent offensive schemes is game-changing . ",
        "to add to that , cleveland should value jordan even higher because defense is their weakness . the cavaliers started the season as one of the worst defensives in nba history , and their current defensive rating of 107.6 is still in the bottom half of the league . that said , they could certainly use jordan to balance out their offensive firepower . it 's slightly unlike that the cavaliers will acquire jordan though . it 's mainly because several other teams also want him . the cavaliers do not have the future assets , outside of the 2018 brooklyn nets pick , to give to a team that wants to rebuild but still stay relevant . ",
        "must the cleveland cavaliers ' best lineups for when isaiah thomas returnsat the end of the day , the cleveland cavaliers might not get their hands on any of these stars , but it is certainly worth their while to monitor each of these situations . history shows that the cleveland cavaliers will make a trade this winter , but this time , it might be a blockbuster deal that they pull off . the cleveland cavaliers have won fourteen of their last fifteen games . however , i think even lebron james knows that this team is still one ...
