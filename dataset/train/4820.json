        "tips & tricks to swallowing pillsa pill swallowing guide -- based on my own experienceone pill . two pill . red pill . blue pill . for many that are fighting diseases , the road to recovery is lined with pills . cancer recovery is no different . of course , we 'll have chemotherapy , radiotherapy , transplants , surgeries and more , but at every step of the way , a plethora of pills dictate your journey . there are pills to treat every part of cancer . firstly , there are the pills that you need to fight the disease itself . ",
        "then , there are the pills that help treat the symptoms of the disease . and then there are the pills to treat the side effects from the medication . i was on a clinical trial with a very strict regimen . so , at any one time , i would have up to 6 different drugs that i needed to take . each one would have varying dosages that needed to be taken on specific days and at specific times . on any given day , i would take around 3 -- 6 pills with each meal . however , each medication had its own set of specific instructions on when i needed to take it and how often . ",
        "they could follow any of these dosage times : morning , 5 times a weekafternoon , 5 times a weekdinner , 5 times a weekone every 4 hoursone every 6 hourson the weekend , take 1 & 1/2 one 7 times a weekto make things more complicated , i would have my blood cell counts constantly monitored . since these drugs have strong side effects , they frequently affected my body with adverse reactions . if my white blood cell counts fell too low , i would be taken off a cycle to give my body time to heal . ",
        "so , the drugs that i needed to take could completely change from one day to another . as you can imagine , it quickly became a challenge to manage . but if keeping track of the schedule was n't enough , the greatest difficulty for me was actually swallowing them . first , there was the size . some of these pills were abhorrently large , especially for a child . then there was the taste . many of them tasted terrible . the extreme bitterness would immediately make me gag . compounding this , i had to receive intravenous drugs as well . ",
        "whenever i was hooked up to a line , it made my entire mouth taste of the medicine . i still remember the strong metallic taste . with this flavor lingering in my mouth for entire days , it made taking those bitter pills that much harder since the flavors of both would mix on my tongue . but there were also psychological issues with each swallow . it is so easy to develop a mental barrier to the pills . these are strong chemicals that you are putting into your body and there is bound to be a reaction . ",
        "even if you want to take them , your body can take steps to prevent you from doing so . anything from developing a gag reflex to becoming nauseous once you 've swallowed them . for me , it only took one adverse reaction to make that pill much more difficult to swallow . because of this , i had to change the way that i was taking the pills . before cancer , i took pills like everyone else does -- poppin ' them in , then taking a swig of water to get them down . but during treatment , i had get much more creative to take them . ",
        "so , i tried many tricks to swallow them . some worked well and others ... . not so much . here are some of those highlights and hopefully one of these will do the trick for you . as always , review any change with your doctor before trying any of these out ! how to swallow pillswater first , then then pillthis is one of the simplest tricks , but so many people forget about it . once that pill touches your tongue , you will taste it . so instead , try drinking some water so your mouth is full . ",
        "then tilt your head back and drop the pill in your mouth . before it starts to dissolve in the water , swallow everything in your mouth . this way , you avoid even giving that pill the chance to touch your tongue . cut em down ! who knows what those pharmaceutical companies are thinking when they make these giant and impossible to swallow pills . no one likes that feeling of a large pill getting caught halfway down . therefore , for those ridiculously big or awkwardly shaped pills , i always found it super helpful to break them into halves or quarters . ",
        "before doing anything , just check that your pill can be cut in half since not all of them can be split . next , i 'd recommend using a pill cutter . i got mine from my hospital for free , so definitely check if yours offers anything for patients . then break them down to whatever size is most comfortable for you . just be sure to keep track of the dosages and do n't mix up different days . crushing it into a powder and putting it into a liquidif the pills tasted too strong , were too big , or too numerous , i started crushing them up and mixing it up into a strong-tasting juice . ",
        "cranberry worked best for me . but i 'd advise some caution on this route . the flavor of some pills can still cut through the juice . one day , all i could taste in this drug-laden cocktail was one of the pills i found exceptionally foul . this taste , combined with some diluted grape juice concentrate , ended with me throwing up everything into the toilet bowl . that was the end of this little trick of mine . making it into jellopersonally , i love jello . hence , i hoped my love for the jiggly would help overcome my disdain for some of these pills . ",
        "i would make some jello normally , and while it was halfway solidified , i added the pills in . from there , i let it solidify through the night so they would be suspended in the middle . but for me , it only took the taste of one bad pill to make this route too risky and time consuming . this method may also work with other food like mashed potatoes , mac & cheese , or some other food that you enjoy . just make sure that the pill can easily incorporate without dissolving and the food is strong enough to mask the taste . ",
        "chasing it with foodfor the braver at heart , one thing to try is taking your medicine with some food . gobbling down some food and drinks after taking the pill might just be enough to keep it down . i tried this with soup , mac 'n' cheese , cereal , and pancakes . some foods worked better than others . stuffing it into candythe only thing i loved more than jello was candy . i had a special thing for sour candy and this was the trick that helped me take most of my harsher tasting pills . ",
        "i would grab a bunch of my favorite candy and stuff pills into each one . i loved sour punch straws , so i would break the pills and insert the fragments into the candy . the overtly sour flavor easily hid the bitterness of the pills . i found sweeter candy to work really well too , like taffy . and as mary poppins said , `` a spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down '' . taking pills and making yourself stronger along the wayno matter what method you choose to help swallow your medicine , the important thing is that you remember to congratulate yourself . ",
        "it 's not easy to have all these chemicals running through your body . recovery is a long and hard process . i 've definitely broken down and cried about taking my pills . but at the end of the day , i refused to give up . these were the various methods i came up with through trial and error so hopefully it will help those of you struggling to get your meds down . nowadays , i 've gotten so used to taking pills that i easily swallow them without any food or water . it 's proof that you can become stronger and overcome the obstacles you have to face as a cancer patient . ",
        "if you have any other methods to take your meds , i 'd love to hear it and hopefully someone can benefit from your suggestion .   "
