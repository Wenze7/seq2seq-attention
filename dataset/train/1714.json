        "recent news about alleged child abuse and sexual assaults in several kindergartens in mainland china has aroused heated discussion online . when angry parents criticised the kindergarten managers , and the government looked into the imperfect management policies , it was overlooked how our current early childhood education is headed the wrong way . childhood education in china is deficient in various ways , including overlooking social and emotional development , potential psychiatric disorders , and educational inequality due to mono-standard utilitarianism . the two most important benefits that children should get from education -- self-awareness and civic awareness -- are missing in the education system . ",
        "my six-year-old niece complained about the six mandatory extra-curriculum classes each weekend . `` they are far from enough ; other kids are learning more , '' said her mother . my 31 - year-old cousin who has worked for nine years in different fields , spoke of her confusion . she said she felt like a loser , as she did not even know what she was passionate about . the real purpose of education has been lost in the `` competitions '' that make superb test-takers and differentiate students . there is one area where we do n't seem to believe in education at all and just leave people to figure it out themselves : self-awareness . ",
        "who are you ? what do you care about ? what are you good at ? how can you manage relationships and protect yourself ? there is an odd silence in education when it comes to those broad questions . successful k-12 curriculums should cultivate the students who can answer the above questions and speak for themselves in any circumstances . another area we neglect is citizenship education . passive learners rarely have clear life goals based on self-discovery and citizen responsibility . lacking citizenship education undercuts one of the most important traits as a citizen : willingness to subordinate private interests to the public interest and maintain a sustainable development of the society . ",
        "future k-12 curriculums should emphasise training in self-awareness and civic awareness . schools can offer classes on morality and ethics , and topics that help students learn basic cultural , economic and political systems of the world . parents must also promote the right values and a broader vision for their children . chenzi song , new york , us .
