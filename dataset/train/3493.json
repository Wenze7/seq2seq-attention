        "december 13 , 2017 by petervanpetervan production 2017 - acryl on canvas - 60x60cm2017 was a special year for me . i decided to disconnect from corporate life for a yearlong sabbatical focusing on art creation , and reflecting on the possible role of artists to enable structural change in organisations . over the last 10 years or so , i experimented creating immersive learning expeditions , but i wanted my work to progress and resonate at a level beyond the conscious . i started a research on high quality change , ill-named `` deep '' change , and i subscribed as a painting student at the royal art academy of ghent .

        "begin december my good friend rudy de waele -- he recently launched human works design with canay atalay -- invited me to write down my five humanistic future trends 2020 . it found it a good moment to condense my sabbatical thinking into a couple of levers that could enable high quality advancement for a humanist future . to drill down , click the appropriate link . any of the trends described could evolve in a good or bad direction , but as an optimist , i chose for the path of `` advancement '' vs. the path of decline and degradation .
