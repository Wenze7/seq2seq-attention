        "manawat큰 women 's sevens coach mike pettman has the kind of problem every coach wants - too many quality players . after battling low numbers at trainings last year , pettman was spoiled for choice this year as he attempted to narrow his 20-woman squad to just 12 for the central regional sevens in levin on saturday . `` this time last year with a few girls being out , some trainings we only had six , this year we have had 20 . it is great we can have games against each other and everything , '' he said . ",
        "read more : * from schoolboys to black caps * arbuthnott targets commonwealth games it has also meant that pettman has been able to focus on coaching rather than filling in as the extra number for team runs . pettman had so many options he opted to rest new zealand sevens captain sarah goss after a heavy workload with the national squad in dubai last week and loan a further three players out to other teams . jessica pease and lizzie gould will both play on loan for poverty bay and rici malanicagi will play for hawke 's bay . ",
        "`` it is really handy because we can see them operate against us . they are definitely in contention as well , '' he said . the squad he settled on is packed with class . the team will be captained by selica winiata , who will also be the key to the side 's attacking opportunities . she is joined by fellow black fern kristina sue , 2017 new zealand sevens players rebekah tufuga and crystal mayes and international quality back janna vaughan . hayley hutana is another former new zealand sevens player in the squad with plenty of experience , while rhiarna ferris is a highly regarded player of the future . ",
        "lauren balsillie , krysten cottrell and nicole dickins have been regulars in the team for the last couple of years , while kahurangi sturmey is a multi-code star and georgia ponsonby has been one of the best school girl players in the country . while the squad lacked numbers last year at trainings , that did not impact their results on the field . they won the central regional sevens and were runner 's up at the national tournament . defending their title in levin would be top of the side 's priorities , but pettman said they were not focusing on results this year . ",
        "`` for us it is just about working out combinations and working our own structure a little bit , '' he said . `` this time last year i was really stressing out about results and this year i have taken it out of the equation and it is just so much easier . '' the women 's division is run in a single pool with manawat큰 facing wellington , taranaki , hawke 's bay and poverty bay . the top four teams qualify for nationals in january . manawat큰 women 's sevens : rebekah tufuga , georgia ponsonby , kahurangi sturmey , crystal mayes , rhiarna ferris , nicole dickins , selica winiata , kristina sue , krysten cottrell , hayley hutana , lauren balsillie , janna vaughan .
