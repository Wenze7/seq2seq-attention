        "by dahee kim and marius zaharia seoul/hong kong - threats of a potential cryptocurrency trading ban in south korea have scared many investors away , but some veterans of the young market are defiant , saying restrictions would be relatively easy to circumvent . although the cryptocurrency market lost about $ 200 billion this week , or a third of its value , these investors - known within the community as `` hodlers '' after a misspelled meme that went viral during bitcoin 's early days - are used to rollercoaster rides . china 's shutdown of local exchanges in september , for instance , caused a 50 percent drop in bitcoin , but prices rebounded eight-fold to almost $ 20,000 . ",
        "currently valued around $ 10,000 , bitcoin could be poised for a similar whirlwind this time around , some say . `` in case the government shuts down all local exchanges , investors can always go abroad and open an account there , '' said a south korean student who declined to be named because of legal risks . `` i can ask my friends who study abroad or travel there myself . it 's not that big of a problem . '' cryptocurrency experts say the student probably has good reason to be relaxed . a ban could discourage new market entrants , but the anonymity of buyers and sellers and the ability to move digital assets anywhere in the world with a click makes it hard to impose restrictions on existing participants without a global consensus . ",
        "places like singapore and hong kong maintain light regulations , while neighboring japan has encouraged a vast ecosystem of companies and investors around digital assets by pioneering a set of rules for the industry . germany has said national restrictions may be useless . vpns , offline wallets according to industry experts , the first step to circumventing a ban is hiding ip addresses from authorities via virtual private networks . traders can then continue business as usual . decentralized exchanges , such as shapeshift or stellar dex , do not require identification and can be accessed from anywhere . ",
        "cryptocurrency wallets such as exodus and jaxx are linked to such exchanges , so trading and storing the assets can still be anonymous . authorities in countries with strong legal protections may need a warrant to check computers or smartphones for proof of such activity . even then , unless caught in the act , the holder can claim no trading has taken place since the legislation was approved and has forgotten the password for the wallet . some decentralized exchanges offer derivative products that allow betting on the price of a cryptocurrency against a fiat currency , including the korean won and chinese yuan . ",
        "but cashing out in fiat is not possible on such exchanges . an option in that case is to trade all cryptocurrencies for a top one such as bitcoin , ethereum or litecoin , and sell it at one the 2,064 crypto atms in 61 countries , although the transaction fees can exceed 10 percent . if need be , coins can be stored on offline `` wallets '' the size of a usb stick . alternatively , holders can open bank accounts in countries that have not banned bitcoin , then join a local centralized exchange where they can trade cryptocurrencies for fiat . ",
        "`` i hold everything in a hard wallet the size of my thumb . i have copies of my private keys in a safe . i have accounts on four exchanges on three continents . if any government wants my money , good luck to them , '' said a hong kong-based investor who claims to hold `` about $ 1 million '' in various cryptocurrencies . crossing borders a 30-year-old nurse in seoul said she had already switched to hong kong-based exchange binance before the government 's warnings hit the market . company officers at seoul-based exchanges say , anecdotally , such moves have accelerated . ",
        "`` all this could lead to serious money outflow and only the government is not aware of it , '' one officer said , requesting anonymity . south korea accounts for between 5 and 15 percent of daily bitcoin trading . the value of all bitcoins is around $ 200 billion . if opening accounts overseas proves difficult , friends , family or the local bitcoin community can help . another option is to find someone with access to an exchange - preferably using encrypted social media apps such as whatsapp or telegram - and sell to them at a discount . ",
        "but fraud is a risk . `` there could be a black market where people who can cash out offshore can pay you in won for your bitcoins , '' said aurelian menant , chief executive of hong-kong based exchange gatecoin . but that leaves the door open to `` dodgy stuff , '' menant said , adding that the fear of scams in the aftermath of a ban may deter new investors , potentially shrinking korean trading volumes `` from billions to millions .
