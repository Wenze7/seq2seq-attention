        "lasers cut across the sea of ravers bouncing to the beat at ' 808 festival yangon ' , as asia 's $ 1 billion edm money machine careers into myanmar , whose youth are at last able to connect with their global peers . with its high-voltage staging and superstar djs , edm is scooping up devotees with dollars to ... lasers cut across the sea of ravers bouncing to the beat at ' 808 festival yangon ' , as asia 's $ 1 billion edm money machine careers into myanmar , whose youth are at last able to connect with their global peers . ",
        "with its high-voltage staging and superstar djs , edm is scooping up devotees with dollars to spend in the poor but emerging frontier market . martin garrix , armin van buuren and hardwell , each of whom bill hundreds of thousands of dollars per set , have led the vanguard of big names to play myanmar in the last year , adding the country to their mega tours of asia . myanmar was for decades locked down by its paranoid former junta , which viewed modernity and outside communication as a threat to its rule . but that has changed under the civilian government and the slick branding of edm 's djs and festivals is now streaming in , priming the country 's millennials with a soundtrack played in bars , clubs and festivals across the world . ",
        "and as myanmar opens up , social mores are also shifting . dressed in hot pants , her eyes rimmed by sparkling silver makeup , 21-year-old khin wint war myint looks a long way from the long-skirted , demure paradigm of femininity upheld by myanmar 's conservative culture . `` i wear traditional clothes in my day-to-day life . this outfit is only for when i come to edm events , '' she tells afp . she joined 12,000 other edm fanatics at ' 808 festival yangon ' , one of several major events studding the city 's party calendar . ",
        "young women in skimpy tops danced hands aloft alongside shirtless guys with dyed hair and shades , hypnotised by the pounding bass , pyrotechnics , lasers and huge led screens . `` mingalabar ! , '' ` hello ' in burmese , shouted australian dj timmy trumpet before dropping ` party till we die ' , the masticating jaws and diluted pupils around the vip areas suggesting some may have taken the `` always getting crazy , always getting high '' lyrics literally . the line-up included israeli psytrance pioneers vini vici and canadian duo dvbbs , playing for the second time in myanmar . ",
        "`` if you look at the global scene , asia is the only region where edm is growing , '' kaung sett from 808 festival yangon promoters h-life , tells afp . `` in the west , hip hop is coming back ... but asia is where the money is , where the market is . '' -- millenials = money -- with more than four billion people and growth economies stacked with millenials hooked on social media , asia is in the crosshairs of dance music 's money men . each year edm nets around $ 7.4 billion globally , according to the ims business report 2017 , whose research estimates around $ 1 billion pours in from asia-pacific . ",
        "korea is asia 's biggest market and china its fastest-growing , with major global festivals such as ultra partnering up in the region . but festivals curated by asian promoters , including zoukout , dwp jakarta and 808 bangkok , are also flourishing as social media and streaming sites soften up fanbases in unlikely corners . `` the 20-year-old kids in yangon are listening to the same thing as the 20-year-old kids in la , '' says kaung sett . many major asian cities boast edm festivals , despite the unique challenges posed by countries with reams of rules controlling nightlife and law enforcement prone to bribery . ",
        "while the scene has exploded in myanmar , there are in-built checks to its growth . superstar djs charge the same jaw-dropping rates for emerging markets -- even though tickets cost a fraction of the price elsewhere . general admission to a festival that would cost over $ 100 in the west is less than $ 20 in myanmar , one of southeast asia 's poorest countries with a pool of just some 14,000 edm fans with enough cash to burn . `` if 5,000 people come , we do n't even break even so we push for 8,000 , 10,000 ... we have to try different marketing strategies to pull more and more people in , '' explains kaung sett . ",
        "sponsorship deals are plugging the gap ; 808 festival yangon is backed by giant myanmar beer . but with the cost of the talent outweighing ticket sales , there are questions over the sustainability of hosting festivals in myanmar . -- homespun headliners ? -- to prolong the boom , asia 's music honchos are hunting for homegrown headliners , who are cheaper to book and more tightly bound to the market they serve . myanmar djs are bringing a local twist to mainstream music , mixing traditional instruments into big party tunes , says si thu tun of promoters zeekwat collective . ",
        "`` i 'm very confident will make the breakthrough , '' he says , explaining `` young creatives '' have used the relative immaturity of myanmar 's scene to build broad production skills . `` they are not just one dimensional ` djs ' ... a lot would describe themselves as mixture of producers , photographers , videographers , graphic designers and content creators . `` m-invaders , a foursome who are regulars at clubs across myanmar , have their sights set on making it to the global party outside their country 's borders . two years ago they played at ` together festival ' , myanmar 's first major edm event , alongside dvbbs and belgian dj wolfpack . ",
        "`` you 're playing on the same stage as the international djs , '' explains 30-year-old dj lu lu . `` you all wear the same badges and bracelets saying ` artist ' . it 's just really exciting . ''   "
