        "austin - doctors just want to get paid . that 's been the refrain since i wrote a column blasting physician groups that operate emergency rooms and then choose to remain out of the hospital 's insurance networks . some groups do this to charge higher rates , and when insurers do n't pay them , they demand payment directly from patients , a process called balance billing . this business strategy begs the question , what is a fair payment ? and whenever you dig deep into the problems with america 's health care system , it all comes down to this question . ",
        "after reading my colleague jenny deam 's investigative story about balance billing , titled `` blindsided , '' i called er doctors who intentionally balance-bill highly skilled price gougers , which enraged them . they pointed out that federal law requires them to evaluate and stabilize every patient , regardless of their ability to pay . they said that if an er doctor thinks an insurance company 's payment is insufficient , then they should bill the patient for the balance that evil insurers wo n't pay . health insurers , though , say they have a duty to limit how much they pay for doctors ' services , because that 's the only way to slow inflation on premiums . ",
        "when a patient wants the insurer to pay the balance bill , that patient is complicit in driving medical inflation . therefore , when doctors send big bills and insurance companies refuse to pay , and patients get stuck with a balance bill , the patients complain to their local lawmakers . `` this whole system seems to be upside down on all sides . that 's what 's so frustrating to me , '' a visibly irritated rep. larry phillips , republican chair of the texas house 's insurance committee , said at a dec. . 6 hearing . ",
        "`` everybody in this room is necessary for us to have successful health insurance and health care . we just have to figure out how to get that done . `` state regulators and advocates for doctors , insurers and patients were waiting to testify before the committee , prepared to blame the other guy for the high cost of health care . they came with statistics ripe for manipulation and misrepresentation , ready to baffle even well-informed observers with the health system 's intricacies and quick to deny the outsized profits most of them enjoy . `` insurers are offering physicians unacceptable take-it-or-leave-it reimbursement deals that are so low that providers in hospitals are increasingly forced to practice out of network , '' said michele kimball , ceo of physicians for fair coverage , a doctors ' advocacy organization . ",
        "kimball said the solution is for texas lawmakers to limit a patient 's cost to whatever he or she would have to pay for an in-network doctor , and then establish a minimum bill-charge payment standard based on a database created by a nonprofit called fair health . fair health collects billing data , not reimbursement rates , from doctors who volunteer to share it . in return , kimball said , doctors would agree to mandatory dispute mediation with insurers , and a ban on balance billing , ending patient complaints . not so fast , said jamie dudensing , ceo of the texas association of health plans . ",
        "`` when you have that bill-charge payment standard , you see more claims go out of network , '' she told phillips , because fair health is based on what doctors want , not what they are paid . `` if 50 percent of the providers in texas increased charges by 50 percent , that would show up in the fair health data the next time . there is nothing that controls that inflation , and you turn us into their personal atm machines . `` consider a doctor 's bill for a high-severity er visit that requires urgent evaluation . ",
        "medicaid will pay $ 80 for that service , medicare pays $ 117 , texas workers ' compensation insurance pays $ 185 , and average in-network insurance pays $ 556 , according to aggregated claims data . but according to fair health , the average doctor 's charge for that billing code is $ 908 . if the fair health rate were guaranteed , insurance premiums would shoot up , something that patients would find even more frustrating . one might reasonably ask doctors to show what a procedure actually costs , and then add on a reasonable profit margin . ",
        "one might ask an insurance company to reveal how it calculates in-network rates . but those are the most closely guarded secrets in health care . phillips says he is reluctant to intervene , preferring to allow participants to duke it out in the marketplace . but new york lawmakers have effectively banned balance billing , ordering doctors and insurers to argue over bills . florida guarantees doctors the greater of the medicare rate , the usual and customary rate for that community , or a negotiated amount . connecticut declared balance billing an unfair trade practice , forcing doctors to take in-network rates . ",
        "doctors and insurers are never going to work this out themselves , and both sides use patients as pawns . but as helpless as patients may feel , power really is in their hands to demand that their elected officials fix this whacked-out system .   "
