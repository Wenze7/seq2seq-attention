        "how to fail in your fitness goalsthe dreaded `` resolution '' and how to actually succeed ! as a new addition to the rypt online blogging , i have decided that i will be looking at one idea of psychology each week and reviewing how it can help with your fitness . this week : new year , same mei genuinely despair at this time of year with the abundance of fitness marketing out there . everything you could possibly think of is thrown in the face of masses with reckless abandon . i do feel sorry for people who do n't succeed in their fitness goals because it 's practically all that everyone talks about this time of year and the pressure to succeed is huge .

        "unlike a new toothbrush , a fitness product is n't guaranteed to work regardless of what the item promises . it requires self discipline and also knowledge . here are the top 10 reasons for fitness failurenot knowing what to do - not understanding why your are doing it - doing too much - trying to change too many ingrained habits - not having the rewards in place to succeed - quitting too early - not setting clearly defined goals with short term achievements - going it alone - doing the same thing - getting stuck in a fitness rutall of these problems can be solved by one thing : guidance . ",
        "if you know what you are doing then you naturally become more motivated , see the results faster and know that despite small setbacks , you wo n't quit . doing things on your own initiative is great but it certainly has it 's limitations . afterall , spending some money on yourself that will actually improve your quality of life , enjoyment and help you feel better mentally is surely worth it ! when i started fitness , it was using a workout plan from a book , i had no idea if i was doing it right and i had lots of unanswered questions about my plan . ",
        "in hindsight , invested in a gym plan from a coach or even personal training would have sped up the process dramatically . it essential boils down to how much you can preserve with the knowledge you have and whether you have the time to expend with it . it was by trying to help many people getting fit that the rypt app was born . there had to be a way to provide a fantastic service to my clients and for a lower cost ... the rypt app was developed for beginners fitness levels with the goal of making a healthy lifestyle and exercise more accessible whenever , wherever you workout and regardless of your past experience .
