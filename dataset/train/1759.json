        "to say that 2017 has been weird would be a huge understatement . it 's been a year packed with political unrest , tech gaffes and security breaches , but through it all we 've been able to rely on nasa to provide some distraction -- and , dare i say , relief -- with new discoveries from around our solar system and beyond . the year might be just about over , but the us space agency is n't done amazing us , and an absolutely incredible new photo taken by the juno spacecraft should lift your spirits , if only for a moment . ",
        "the image , taken by juno of the swirling , twisted cloud tops of jupiter , is a seriously awesome sight . taken at a height of nearly 12,000 miles above the planet 's iconic storms , the photo is a reminder that we do n't even have to leave the solar system to see some truly awe-inspiring wonders of nature . `` because of the juno-jupiter-sun angle when the spacecraft captured this image , the higher-altitude clouds can be seen casting shadows on their surroundings , '' nasa explains on its website . `` the behavior is most easily observable in the whitest regions in the image , but also in a few isolated spots in both the bottom and right areas of the image . '' ",
        "the photo was taken back on october 24th , and was provided to the public via nasa 's junocam image hosting site . it was further processed by citizen scientists who enhanced some of the smaller details , and the result is a view of jupiter 's twisting towers of clouds that you can stare at for an hour and not get bored . as you can see in the full-resolution image the massive clouds look like blue milk swirling in a cup of coffee , obscuring whatever lies below . jupiter 's weather has always been an incredibly interesting scientific topic . ",
        "the planet 's great red spot is a colossal storm that has been raging on the planet for at least 350 years , and likely much longer . the storm is so large that you could put three earths inside of it .   "
