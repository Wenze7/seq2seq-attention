        "the newly minted austrian government will grant citizenship to the descendants of holocaust victims , haaretz reported tuesday . the decision comes in the wake of a diplomatic spat between israel and vienna as austria 's new coalition between the conservatives and the far-right freedom party was sworn in on monday , rekindling an alliance from the early 2000s which prompted unease around europe . the freedom party , led by heinz-christian strache , has a past stained by frequent anti-semitic incidents and instances of nazi propaganda , which is why a harsh israeli response was widely expectedaccording to a statement released by the israeli government , `` israel will continue to work with civil servants of the ministries headed by members of the freedom party '' , but will also `` continue to struggle against anti-semitism '' and `` for the commemoration of the holocaust . '' ",
        "some israeli media have interpreted the statement as a `` boycott '' of the freedom party ministers at the political level , since it says that `` working relations '' will continue with `` civil servants '' . others have emphasized that working relations will go on , reading the statement as a weak reactionthe reaction is certainly milder than in 2000 , when the freedom party first joined a coalition government and israeli authorities withdrew the ambassador from vienna . freedom party leader heinz-christian strache has traveled to israel a number of times , and developed ties with representatives of the israeli right . ",
        "in one of his last trips , however , late israeli president shimon peres had refused to meet him .   "
