        "most people do n't want to actively deny access to disabled customers . more often , digital accessibility is seen as a low relative priority , compared to other projects and tasks . presenting legal or emotional ultimatums may create initial movement , but they 're not sustainable motivators and they can breed resentment towards an accessibility practice . in my previous job , we took a different approach . we practiced a `` show do n't tell '' approach , and gave teams the information to determine relative priority themselves . i was impressed with the creativity and engagement we saw with this approach , so i 'm capturing the approach here with some basic tenets , specific to reporting digital accessibility issues . ",
        "drawing of a character pondering before his shadow . focus on conversionsfocus remediation on user journeys that lead to conversion . when you 're looking for issues , it 's tempting to go for lots of easy wins across different , unrelated parts of an application . instead , focus on user journeys that lead to conversion . your customers are there for a reason , and usually that reason aligns with your bottom line . make it possible for them to accomplish their goal . for example , if your customer ca n't complete a purchase , they 'll be more frustrated than a poorly described image on the home page . ",
        "you 're also more likely to get buy-in from product managers and leadership when you focus on conversion . describe human impactdescribe an issue 's impact in human terms . include customer feedback if you can . standards and rules are useful for identifying issues and assessing solutions , but they do n't inspire . teams care about people , in either emotional or business terms . compliance talk also invokes the specter of lawsuits . that can be useful in leadership conversations , but not in the context of bug reports . describing impact also helps teams to decide on relative priority of the issue against other issues in their backlogs . ",
        "this brings us to the next point . let teams prioritizegive teams the information they need , then trust them to be professional and organized . when you describe issues in terms of customer impact and severity , you then trust teams do their jobs to prioritize . it 's up to the product or engineering manager to decide on relative priority of the issue . have a conversation with the team 's pm before adding an issue to their backlog , and add it to the icebox or lowest priority . follow the ticket and keep an eye on activity . ",
        "set a reminder for yourself to followup if there 's no movement on the issue , but assume a team is professional and organized . if they 're not , that 's an issue beyond the specifics of accessibility . give technical guidance , but avoid prescribing solutions . trust engineers and designers to learn and ask questions . it 's their job , and also the best way for a team to grow their accessibility knowledge , and you may be surprised by the creativity and ingenuity of solutions . attention , not assignmentbring attention to an issue , then let teams decide how to assign . ",
        "when you let people self-assign accessibility issues , they 'll be more engaged . you do n't know what other teams ' priorities are , or what an individual 's personal situation is . instead of assigning , @ mention the owner of the backlog to get attention on the issue . use this as an opportunity to communicate your opinions on priority and required expertise , then let them decide . celebrate successfocus on wins and celebrate success . accessibility remediation is a long-haul , and you 'll need to sustain motivation and investment . you can do this by mentioning a team 's work in a monthly accessibility changelog , and where appropriate celebrate individual contributions . ",
        "drawing of two characters jumping for joy . in summary , document issues comprehensively , describe their impact and severity , and then let teams do their jobs . stay engaged , follow up , and answer questions when asked , but ultimately trust the professionalism and organization of your teammates to address issues . originally published at www . ckundo . com .
