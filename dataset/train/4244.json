        "johannesburg -- africans woke up on friday to find president donald trump had finally taken an interest in their continent . it was n't what people had hoped for . using vulgar language , trump on thursday questioned why the u. s. would accept more immigrants from haiti and `` shithole countries '' in africa rather than places like norway in rejecting a bipartisan immigration deal . the african union continental body told the associated press it was `` frankly alarmed '' by trump 's comments . `` given the historical reality of how many africans arrived in the united states as slaves , this statement flies in the face of all accepted behavior and practice , '' au spokeswoman ebba kalondo said . ",
        "`` this is particularly surprising as the united states of america remains a global example of how migration gave birth to a nation built on strong values of diversity and opportunity . `` african governments quickly found themselves in an awkward position . as top recipients of u. s. aid , some hesitated to jeopardize it by criticizing trump , especially as his administration has sought to slash foreign assistance . `` unless it was specifically said about south sudan , we have nothing to say , '' south sudan government spokesman ateny wek ateny told the associated press . ",
        "but botswana 's government called trump 's comment `` reprehensible and racist , '' saying the u. s. ambassador had been summoned to clarify whether the nation is regarded as a `` shithole '' country after years of cordial relations . south africa 's ruling african national congress called trump 's comments `` extremely offensive . '' deputy secretary general jesse duarte said developing countries do have difficulties but the united states itself has millions of people out of work or without health care , and `` we would not deign to make comments as derogatory . `` south african opposition leader mmusi maimane called trump 's comments `` abhorrent ... the hatred of obama 's roots now extends to an entire continent . '' ",
        "uganda 's state minister for international relations , henry okello oryem , called the remarks `` unfortunate and regrettable '' and said he hopes african heads of state will reply at an african union summit later this month . african media outlets and the continent 's young , increasingly connected population were not being shy . `` well , that is the perfect definition of racism . that is all i have to say , '' kenyan entrepreneur wangui muraguri told the ap in his nairobi office . `` casual friday at the white house is soon to include hoods and tiki torches at this rate , '' south african media outlet daily maverick wrote . ",
        "many on the world 's second most populous continent reached for their smartphones , long-practiced in defending the vast and varied region from easy stereotypes . while 40 percent of the world 's poor live in sub-saharan africa , according to the international monetary fund , the region also has billionaires , reality shows and a growing middle class . some quickly decided to own trump 's vulgar language or throw it back in his face . `` good morning from the greatest most beautiful ` shithole country ' in the world ! !! '' south african broadcasting corporation anchor leanne manas tweeted . ",
        "`` as someone from south shithole , trevor is deeply offended by the president 's remarks , '' the daily show tweeted of its south african-born host , trevor noah . in kenya , east africa 's economic hub , political activist boniface mwangi pleaded : `` please do n't confuse the #shithole leaders we africans elect with our beautiful continent . `` trump 's comments were `` shocking and shameful '' and `` i 'm sorry , but there 's no other word one can use but racist , '' said a spokesman for the u. n. human rights office , rupert colville . ",
        "`` this is n't just a story about vulgar language , it 's about opening the door to humanity 's worst side , '' he said . trump 's comments highlighted months of concerns about his lack of focus on africa , including empty ambassadorial posts in key countries like south africa , egypt , congo and somalia . a list maintained by the washington-based american foreign service association says eight such posts are vacant . trump has expressed negative opinions about the continent in the past . `` every penny of the $ 7 billion going to africa as per obama will be stolen - corruption is rampant ! '' ",
        "he tweeted in 2013 . the u. s. president is hurting himself both at home and abroad with his latest comments , some africans said . `` he has not only insulted africans , he has also insulted african-americans , '' said sylvester odion akhaine , associate professor of international relations at the lagos state university in nigeria . `` internationally , such language will deepen the isolation of the united states , a country that is already losing its global prestige . `` as outrage spread , the u. s. government 's own africa media hub tried to put out the flames . ",
        "without directly referring to trump 's statement , it tweeted that `` us remains committed to working together w/africans to realize the promise of a more peaceful , more productive , more prosperous 21st century africa . us deeply respects the people of #africa & values its partnerships with them .
