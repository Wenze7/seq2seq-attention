        "more than ever , companies at ces 2018 are highlighting car technology . as the show winds down , we take a moment to reflect on the trends we 've seen this year . we 've been saying it for years at this point , but there 's so much car tech at ces that you could almost call it the las vegas auto show . but this year more than ever , cars -- from evs to dashboard technologies and more -- were at the forefront . however , one of the most interesting trends was the way the tech and automotive industries doubled down on partnerships and cooperation at ces 2018 . ",
        "and not just partnerships between automakers and suppliers , but also partnerships between companies that may have historically competed with one another . it 's as if the industry collectively realized that the road to autonomy moves faster in the carpool lane . working toward autonomy togethernvidia announced a partnership with vw that will let future cars recognize drivers and respond to their needs . the silicon peddler also announced its new xavier computer , hardware designed especially for autonomous cars and ai that will be used in partnerships with audi , bosch , zf , here and zenrin .

        "uber 's future fleet of self-driving cars will also pack nvidia chips . speaking of uber , the car sharing service featured prominently in toyota big announcement . toyota 's showcased a new e-palette autonomous vehicle concept and announced a new e-palette partnership with amazon , uber , pizza hut , didi and mazda to share autonomous technologies and explore smart cities of the future . meanwhile , ford and qualcomm were also partnering up to bring v2x and v2v communication to the automaker 's vehicles , allowing them to communicate with traffic infrastructure and other vehicles . hints of a 5g future for ford cars is also implied in the partnership . ",
        "there was also room on ford 's dance card for it to also partner up with waze to bring the mapping , navigation and traffic monitoring app into its sync 3 dashboard systems . self-driving cars hit the striphowever , ces 2018 was n't a show where every just sat around and talked about self-driving technology -- although , we did do a bit of that at our cnet autonomous car panel . automakers , suppliers and software developers were demonstrating real-live autonomous cars all over the las vegas strip . early on , we got a demo of aptiv and lyft 's self-driving bmws which showgoers were actually able to hop into and grab rides to over 20 locations around las vegas . ",
        "torc robotics was also showcasing its self-driving car on the vegas streets , alongside many other companies vying for attention in this now crowded space . talking to carsamazon alexa is kind of a big deal in tech these days and everyone rushing to figure out how to integrate the voice assistant into everything from smart speakers to dishwashers to cars . aftermarket alexa adapters like the speak music muse could be found at every turn . meanwhile , garmin sought to differentiate it 's garmin speak plus alexa-enabled car kit from the pack with the addition of a forward-looking camera that also adds a compliment of driver aid technologies to it 's inexpensive and universal package .

        "however , 2018 will go down as the year that google strikes back with its own google assistant software . the search giant made a huge push by integrating assistant into it 's established android auto system and partnering with automakers and , particularly , aftermarket suppliers like pioneer , alpine and jvc kenwood to highlight android auto 's new wireless connection tech and google assistant smart . mercedes-benz , on the other hand , chose to highlight its own technology , debuting the new mbux infotainment system which features its own smart voice control , artificial intelligence and a much cleaner interface . ",
        "we can expect to see more of mbux in the new mercedes-benz a-class soon . electrifying carselectric car manufacturers and startups have chosen also ces as the stage to highlight their vehicles . the evs showcased ran a broad gamut . the speed demons included genovations gxe , an 800-horsepower electric corvette , and the faraday future ff91 , which returned to ces to show off its sub-3-second zero-to-60 sprint . we saw more electric and electrified suvs entering the market , including the kia niro ev concept , the nearly production-ready hyundai 's nexo hydrogen fuel cell suv , and the byton electric concept . ",
        "the byton , in particular , burst onto the scene with big claims of 5g connectivity , tesla fighting performance and range , and a platform built from the ground up with autonomy in mind . the massive displays on its dashboard and steering wheel also helped turn a few heads . we also saw one of the first electric pickup trucks in the workhorse w-15 , which can drive and haul for 80 miles under full ev power before firing up a gasoline generator for an additional 310 miles of range . bmw , on the other hand , almost managed to steal the show by just hanging out in the parking lot all day giving demos in its drift-record-setting bmw m5 , but that 's a very different sort of electrifying ride .
