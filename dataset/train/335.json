        "stop what you 're doing . call in sick . sit the f down . hang on to your butts . kim kardashian 's third baby just arrived and it 's officially a national holiday . elite daily reached out to kardashian-west 's team but did not hear back by the time of publication . the news came tuesday morning , jan. . 16 , via a report from tmz , and we could n't be more thrilled . welcome baby kardashian-west ! kardashian said in a statement , `` january 15 , 2018 , 12:47 a. m. 7 lbs 6 oz .

        "kanye and i are happy to announce the arrival of our healthy , beautiful baby girl . we are incredibly grateful to our surrogate who made our dreams come true with the greatest gift one could give and to our wonderful doctors and nurses for their special care . north and saint are especially thrilled to welcome their baby sister . love , kim kardashian west . `` traditionally , pregnancy has not been an easy task for kim , making this news extra exciting . kardashian suffered difficult medical issues and struggled emotionally and physically while carrying her first two babies , north and saint .

        "for her third bundle of joy , she and husband kanye west were advised to go a different route for health purposes , and they did exactly that . baby west arrived via surrogate , and the world is so happy she 's finally here . i guess if we 're using logic , we must have first heard about kardashian 's third baby nine months ago , but call me kris jenner if it has n't felt like literal years in the making . kim was incredibly open about the decision to use a surrogate on her series keeping up with the kardashians , and officially confirmed the good news in a promo video for season 14 . ",
        "since then , the family 's done a wonderful job protecting the identity of the surrogate mother from the public , and has been low-key preparing for baby number three . in november , kardashian threw herself a truly epic baby shower , mostly to help her two children get excited for their incoming sibling . she added , kim also spoke candidly about the difficulties of going through with a surrogate . while promoting her new kkw fragrances , kardashian explained to entertainment tonight that it really came down to a control factor . she said , she added that despite hating being pregnant herself , she still would have preferred to carry her own child if she could . ",
        "... and what it is is a beautiful baby girl ! fans are waiting to hear from the rest of the kardashian clan , and are paying especially close attention to sisters khlo√© and kylie , who are reportedly pregnant with their first babies as well . more than anything , we are just so happy to hear the family is happy and healthy . congratulations , everyone ! we did it ! check out the entire genwhy series and other videos on facebook and the bustle app across apple tv , roku , and amazon fire tv .
