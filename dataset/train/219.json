        "chicago -- the oswego school district has a difficult job of filling an $ 11 million deficit , which could mean big cuts in the classroom , including layoffs . district 308 is the 7th largest school district in the state , and is facing a $ 3.5 million budget deficit next year . officials say cuts are necessary , but they want the public 's help . `` we 're also not looking to raise taxes for the community , '' said therea komitas , who is the communications director of district 308 . instead , the district set up a virtual suggestion box for ideas on what to cut . ",
        "right now , suggestions include changing school hours , cutting extracurricular activities and increasing class size . `` the schools do so many great things in the arts , and everything else , i really just hope the cuts do n't come from there , '' lars schweig said , who is a district 308 parent . the assistant superintendent says the district has 18,300 students in 22 schools . rising expenses contributed to the shortfall , but komitas says so did state funding cuts and failed payments . `` that adds up to about $ 50 million that we did not receive from the state of illinois , '' she said . ",
        "district officials say they need to cut $ 3.5 million from the budget to stay in the black for next school year , but they need to cut a total of almost $ 9 million to stay out of debt for the foreseeable future . no final decision on what cuts will be made will come before the end of january .
