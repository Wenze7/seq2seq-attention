        "the last few years have been active for canadian miner teck resources ltd. . . it worked through a deep commodity downturn and started to reduce its leverage in a material way . throughout it all , however , the metallurgical coal , copper , and zinc miner never gave up on one key project -- and this is the year that the company 's fortitude will start to pay off , which should make 2018 teck 's best year yet . commodities rule the day . there 's no way to get around it : teck resources ' top and bottom lines are tied to commodity prices . ",
        "that 's no different than any other miner , but it helps explain the rough patch during the deep commodity downturn , which started in 2011 and finally began to abate in early 2016 . to give you an idea of how bad it was , teck earned 4.50 canadian dollars per share in 2011 , with earnings falling each year through 2015 , when the miner lost ca$ 4.29 a share . in 2016 , however , teck earned ca$ 1.78 a share . through the first three quarters of 2017 , it made ca$ 3.03 a share . ",
        "clearly , things are starting to look a lot better as commodity prices have rebounded . the earnings jump in 2016 and 2017 also helps explain the roughly 36 % reduction in teck 's long-term debt between the start of 2016 and the end of the third quarter of 2017 . it simply had the financial wherewithal to pay back its lenders . like other miners , teck did all of the usual things during the downturn , including cut costs and focus on enhancing productivity so it could get to the other side in one piece . but there 's one thing it did n't stop doing : spending on the fort hills oil sands project . ",
        "it owns 20 % of this asset , which is run by 50.8 % owner suncor energy inc. . . total holds the remaining stake . this project got the green light in 2013 , just before oil prices started a precipitous fall . about to reach the goalpost . it was hard to keep justifying any new investment , let alone an oil investment , during the deep commodity downturn . for proof of that , just look at freeport mcmoran 's disastrous foray into the oil business . at this point , the copper and gold miner has given up on oil and refocused on its core . ",
        "a lot of damage has been done , however , with freeport 's debt roughly 3.5 times higher than it was before the oil investment with virtually nothing to show for the effort -- and that 's after reducing debt by around a third from its peak following the ill-fated oil effort . things are vastly different at teck . for starters , it did n't throw in the towel despite material concerns in the market that it would have trouble paying for its share of fort hills ' construction expenses . those costs were part of the reason why its debt load kept rising through the commodity downturn . ",
        "the company 's grit , however , is about to pay off , since oil is set to flow in 2018 . the canadian oil sands mine is expected to come close to its nameplate capacity of 194,000 barrels per day by the end of the year . that means each quarter this year should see a progressively larger boost from this new business . some market watchers will counter that oil sands are expensive , though that 's only half right . as fort hills partner suncor pointed out during an early 2017 conference call , oil sands mines are expensive to build but relatively cheap to operate on an ongoing basis . ",
        "so the high costs are in the past , and teck is about to diversify its business with a low-cost oil asset that has a 50-year life span and stable production flows . it should be a good year for oil-focused suncor , too , but it wo n't be expanding into a new area -- it will just be doing more of the same . that difference is why fort hills should set 2018 up to be one of the best years yet for teck . its top and bottom lines will get a boost from the new asset . ",
        "the benefit will grow as the year progresses . and , perhaps even more exciting , the miner will go from producing three main commodities to four . greasing the wheels . so 2018 will be a big year for teck as oil starts flowing from the fort hills oil sands project . that said , when it comes to teck 's top and bottom lines , a lot will still depend on how well met coal , copper , zinc , and oil behave . these are commodities , and there 's nothing the miner can do about that . ",
        "but do n't let that fact distract you from the huge business shift that 's taking place at teck this year . it has the potential to be a major game changer , and should set 2018 up to be the miner 's best year yet .   "
