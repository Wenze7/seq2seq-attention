        "i won hq trivia . confession : i cheated . you should know that it still was n't easy to do , and it 's not a foolproof strategy . but it works , and the key is an android phone . that 's right , the most important tool for cheating at hq is the phone that you ca n't play hq on - at least not yet . for those not familiar with the app , hq has burst onto the scene as the hot new live trivia app , complete with a quiz daddy , hundreds of thousands of users , and cash prizes . ",
        "so , naturally , we tried to cheat at it . with only 10 seconds to tap your answer to hq 's trivia questions , you do n't have a lot of time to cheat . but we here at mashable have spent roughly the last two weeks devising some very complex hacks to test hq 's system . on friday , we won -- with some help from google assistant . here 's the setup . managing editor annie colbert played and i sat beside her with my thumb hovering over the google search bar shortcut on my home screen . ",
        "the fastest way to do it is to use the google voice search on an android phone . we tried other ways -- typing into google or even some complex player grouping systems -- but nothing quite worked . just how you use the app is crucial . do n't bother starting with `` ok , google . '' you 'll lose precious time you ca n't afford . but if you hit the mic icon and make a very strategic query , you should be able to get a pretty reliable google result with 2 to 3 seconds to spare - just enough time to process it and tap the right option . ",
        "phrasing is key . plenty of hq questions are put in a way that make this tough for a search engine to answer . we found that the trick is not to try to ask the exact question , but rather focus on the keywords and trust google 's powerful search algorithm to surface the needed info . one of the afternoon 's questions was about which pedro almodovar movie featured a female bullfighter . repeating the whole question would have taken too long , but a quick voice search of `` pedro almodovar female bullfighter '' returned talk to her as the first hit . ",
        "it was one of the answers so we went with it -- and we got it right . there 's not a ton of time . we put in many of our answers with maybe a second to spare . you 're definitely not winning every time with this . and it did n't get every answer , meaning you 'll still need to have some knowledge and get a little lucky . but it can work . you can win . the moment at @mashablehq when @anniecolbert won at @hqtriviathere 's more to this story , though . might rhyme with `` seating `` story to come on @mashable pic . ",
        "twitter . com/v8zmxhizl8 -- pete pachal december 8 , 2017is cheating at hq through a voice google search unethical ? maybe . certainly it has to be something the game designers anticipated , and the time limit alone suggests that they 're trying to make it hard to do . for a trivia purist , it also sucks out a bit of the show-off-your-brain fun . but this is about winning -- and taking home nearly a dozen dollars . it 's important to note here that this is n't a foolproof strategy . firstly , it works best with straightforward questions that lend themselves well to searches . ",
        "an early question about categorizing spotify , netflix , and hulu probably would n't have worked . the question is too long , and the results too awkward to get through it all in time . second , sometimes you 'll screw it up and have to guess . one question about a german painter was n't caught correctly in the voice search , and you only have enough time to try once . so we did what everyone does - guessed ... and got lucky . the same thing happened on the final question , about what the washington post considered the `` game of our era '' . ",
        "we bungled the search and ultimately listened to that little voice inside . quiz daddy scott rogowsky drew out the answer to the question . with our newsroom at a standstill , we waited patiently to hear if our combination of hacks , knowledge , and luck had paid off . scott finally let it rip : the answer was settlers of cataan . we celebrated . and i 'm $ 11.76 richer -- which , by the way , i ca n't cash out until i get to $ 20 in the bank . we reached out to hq for comment and will update if they get back to us .
