        "there is no mystery behind these grassy knolls : brooklyn parkgoers love them , and the city wants to flatten them . the landmarks preservation commission has green-lighted a $ 10.5 million parks department plan to replace fort greene park 's two green , 20-by-40-foot mounds leading to the iconic prison ship martyr 's monument and replace them with a flat 43-foot-wide concrete plaza . the 30-acre park , which lies in fort greene 's historic district , will also see 54 trees bulldozed . `` the new design is cold and sterile and nobody wants it , '' local lucy koteen , 68 , told the post . ",
        "`` you want to feel a difference from the street when you walk into a park , not just a bunch of concrete . '' the 4-foot-high mounds were added to the park by landscape artist a. e. bye in 1971 . `` i bring my kids here after school and they love to run around and play on them , '' said local mother gloria cressman , 39 . `` we 'll be really disappointed to see them go . '' others use the mounds to do workouts or as stages for shows . trees along the park 's northwestern walkway will be removed as part of the new design , costing the city $ 900,000 to replace them with new saplings , according to parks documents . ",
        "`` this whole thing is a vanity project and a big waste of money with no real benefits for residents , '' said geoffrey croft , who heads nyc park advocates . `` the money should go towards fixing things like the restrooms and repaving old crumbled concrete and maintaining them . '' locals worry the flattened plaza may allow vendors to set up shop . `` it will make it easier for them to wheel in their carts , '' said koteen . `` we 're supposed to use our parks to escape the bustling streets , not to go shopping . '' ",
        "but fort greene resident camila dante , 30 , thinks the changes will attract newcomers . `` it 'll make the park feel more inviting and attractive and liven up the area , '' said dante . renovations are to begin in 2019 .   "
