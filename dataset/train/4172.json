        "with gender pay and equality the hot topic in the media and among me and my girlfriends at the moment , it got me thinking . as long as women produce and provide primary nurturing for tiny humans -- in whatever manner that may be -- can there ever be true equality in the workplace ? stewart williams - the sunthis may seem like a weighty way to look at it from myself , an ex-model turned writer who is also a mum . but i do feel like women everywhere start on an uneven footing . there are the obvious stumbling blocks , such as prejudice against giving women the top jobs , or the hiring process and how it might hinder women of childbearing age . ",
        "what company wants to hire a woman , only for her to go on maternity leave for a year so they have to pay her and also her replacement ? there are n't many -- but there should be . then , once a woman has a child , it is assumed she is the more willing or able spouse to sacrifice whatever demands may be on her at work to attend to childcare dilemmas . stewart williams - the sunin all my years as a working mum , i can honestly say i am always the one called on when our children need help .

        "when one of them is sick or injured at school , is it my husband -- the other 50 per cent contributor to this small life -- who is called for the collection ? nope . is it seen as my husband 's duty to sort childcare when one of them is under the weather and ca n't attend school ? nope . it 's mine . i am aware that a quick call to mark -- while he is hauling his butt up a mountain at the tour de france -- to let him know delilah has grazed her knee in the playground might be a tad impractical . ",
        "but this assumption spans far wider than my little family set-up . it 's a rule of thumb that the mum is the first port of call for any child-related dramas . i can honestly say i am always the one called on when our children need help . is this just habit , protocol or nature ? i 'm not sure about the answer . what i am sure of is that being a mum has made me always feel the need to go above and beyond , to work harder , always be on time and to exceed expectations . ",
        "this was amplified because i was a young mother . i never wanted someone to say i was good `` considering i had a child '' . i just wanted to be good . in fact , at times my journey as a mother with these little creatures has been my biggest asset . it has taught me more about people and life than any book ever could . but i wonder , does biology and centuries of stereotyping mean the odds are stacked against us ever getting true equality , or is there a change coming ? i hope it 's the latter .
