        "mercedes are just 50 horse power shy of the landmark 1000hp breakthrough with their current f1 ` power unit ' . auto motor und sport reports that gps measurements made by a rival of the german marque 's engine output at the end of 2017 showed 949hp . however , the report claims that mercedes engine chief andy cowell is `` confident mercedes will succeed '' in breaking through the 1000hp barrier before the regulations conclude in late 2020 . `` if the world champions maintain their approximate development speed , 1000hp will be reached in 2019 , '' the report said . ",
        "ferrari are next in the power rankings with 934hp , followed by 907 for renault and honda 's 860hp . finland 's ilta sanomat reports that ferrari are pushing to get an extra 40hp from their engine in 2018 , even though engine boss lorenzo sassi is moving to mercedes . `` i do n't know who said sassi is a phenomenon , but i do n't remember saying it , '' ferrari president sergio marchionne told marca . `` what is true is that our problems were due not only due to him . our intention was to keep him in gts , but unfortunately he decided to leave and continue his career elsewhere . ",
        "`` for the team it 's a normal change and now we have corrado iotti and we 're fine with him . `` finally , renault 's cyril abiteboul told auto hebdo that he blames former boss flavio briatore for the french marque 's current power deficit . `` we are still paying the price for flavio 's decision in 2007 to dismiss hundreds of people when engine development was frozen , '' he said . the new season gets underway on march 25 with the australian grand prix .
