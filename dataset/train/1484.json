        "the london-based arabic daily newspaper al-quds al-arabi reports this morning that former iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has been arrested by security forces for allegedly inciting unrest against the government , according to `` reliable sources in tehran . `` the newspaper describes the former president 's arrest in the southwest city of shiraz as coming after a series of provocative statements given in support of anti-government protests that have gripped the country for more than a week , and that his detention was granted approval by supreme leader ali khamenei . starting early in the protests , ahmadinejad , who led the nation from 2005 to 2013 and has long been considered a hardliner , made public statements denouncing the rouhani government as well as the clerical establishment as being detached from the daily reality of ordinary iranians . ",
        "image source al-quds al-arabistarting in november 2017 ahmadinejad began making what was widely viewed as a surprise political comeback while running a populist message , focusing on the fight against corruption as his main emphasis and attacking the rich and corrupt , along with severe criticisms against the government for squandering public funding intended for the people 's welfare . he 's also reported to have broadly utilized social media for aggressive rhetoric targeting the judiciary and challenging iran 's supreme leader . al quds al arabi cites ahmadinejad 's visit to the western city of bushehr on december 28 as raising concern among authorities .

'' he also allegedly charged tehran with `` mismanagement '' and directed attacks against president hassan rouhani , saying his regime `` believes that they own the land and that the people are an ignorant society . `` previously this week there were rumors that his arrest was coming amidst an ongoing investigation , as multiple regional and international reports cited a commander of the islamic revolutionary guard corps as indicating that `` a former leader of the country '' had provoked people to protest . ",
        "al quds al arabi is currently describing ahmadinejad 's detention as a `` house arrest '' . on friday at an emergency session of the un called by the united states , iran 's ambassador told the meeting that his government has `` hard evidence '' that recent protests in iran were `` very clearly directed from abroad . '' iran has primarily blamed external enemies for seeking to exploit major internal economic difficulties the country is currently experiencing . us ambassador to the un nikki haley characterized the week long unrest in iran as a `` spontaneous expression of fundamental human rights , '' claiming the protests were simultaneously playing out in `` over 78 locations '' - though according to many reports anti-regime protests have largely died down while giving way to possibly larger pro-government rallies .

        "it is possible that this latest news of ahmadinejad 's arrest on charges of incitement , however , could renew mass anti-government protests . this is a developing story ...   "
