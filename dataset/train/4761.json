        "republicans in the state senate will remain in charge to negotiate a $ 153 billion budget early next year despite a plan backed by gov. andrew cuomo for fractious democrats to unify and create a slim majority , the post has learned . gov. cuomo said tuesday he `` strongly '' backs a new proposal ... that 's because conservative dissident brooklyn democratic state sen. simcha felder will continue caucusing with the republicans -- at least until after the budget is approved -- giving the gop a swing 32nd vote in the 63-member chamber . felder said prominent democratic officials are trying to coerce him to switch sides , but he wo n't budge . ",
        "`` some people think they can bully me , intimidate me to move around . that 's not going to happen , '' felder said . `` extreme leftist radical organizations and well-respected democratic party elected officials are trying to get me to change . i will not consider any conversations for democratic unity until a budget is in place . `` we deserve a budget that is thorough and timely -- not factionalism or chaos because of political gamesmanship , '' he said . `` we want stability , not a circus . '' asked if cuomo was among the democratic power brokers personally appealing to get him to flip , felder declined to comment . ",
        "eight other renegade democrats who 've been allied with the gop in running the senate -- collectively known as the independent democratic caucus -- have agreed to rejoin 21 other mainline democrats in a power-sharing arrangement . two vacant seats in the bronx and westchester are expected to be retained by democrats in special elections early next year , bringing their total to 31 . counting felder , the democrats have a majority ; without him , the gop remains in control . felder represents largely orthodox-jewish and conservative borough park . unlike most democrats , he supports steering more tax dollars to yeshivas and other parochial schools and backs charter schools -- the bane of the teachers union and mayor bill de blasio . ",
        "meanwhile , jessica ramos , 32 , a former de blasio communications aide , plans to run against an idc member , queens state sen. jos√© peralta , in the 13th district . `` there is an upswell of support in my community to elect a real democrat that fights for working families and helps call progressive legislation to the floor for a vote , '' ramos , the mother of two public-school kids , told the post . peralta 's response : bring it on ! `` i 'm confident in putting my long record of democratic achievements up against anyone 's , '' peralta , who defected to the idc in january , said in a statement .
