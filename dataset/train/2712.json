        "after a monster `` bomb cyclone '' and frigid arctic blasts that set some new records on the us east coast , temperatures have been a bit more merciful this week . and that 's setting the stage for some pretty cool phenomena -- like this ice jam on the ausable river in au sable forks , located in upstate new york . in a time lapse video posted on twitter by the national weather service office in burlington , vermont , you can see the frozen river very quickly rise up , and then break up into chunks almost out of the blue . ",
        "the chaotic mess of ice and tree branches then flows downstream , bringing the river level back down . the whole video condenses three hours of footage , taken today by a nws webcam that runs 24/7 . ice jams happen when ice-covered rivers get extra water from rain or snowmelt , rising up quickly and breaking up the ice in big chunks . they usually occur where the river narrows or goes under a bridge , or where the river slope flattens out , allowing the ice pieces to accumulate and clog . this happens usually in the spring , in march or early april , when temperatures are starting to rise , says john goff , lead meteorologist at the nws burlington office . ",
        "but ice jams are not unheard of at this time of the year either . it 's been raining in new york today , and temperatures hovered between 50 and 60 degrees fahrenheit . that allowed for the snowpack to melt and raise the ausable river by 10 feet , goff tells the verge . in fact , there were several ice jams along the river , not just at au sable forks , he says . usually ice jams result in a little bit of flooding : if the ice functions as a dam , the river will start flowing around it , flooding the surrounding fields and lowlands . ",
        "but at times , the jams can cause serious damage . in 1992 , one of these ice piles changed the course of the winooski river in vermont , burying parts of montpellier in six feet of water and interrupting power in the process . in that case , big ice lumps had wedged under a bridge and had to be dislodged by a crane , according to a new york times article about the event . the ice on the ausable river shown in the video was probably only about 8 to 10 inches thick , goff estimates , and it flowed downstream fairly quickly . ",
        "in fact , the nws office received just a few reports of minor flooding , not connected to the ice jam at au sable forks . still , the time lapse looked so cool that the nws decided to post it to social media . `` that one was the most dramatic , '' goff says .   "
