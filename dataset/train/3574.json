        "the rolling stones on air ★ ★ ★ a half century after they released their first single come on in june , 1963 , the rolling stones remain as relevant in an ageist society as the term that was originally coined by robert neil butler in 1969 , to describe `` the dismissive and contemptuous attitude towards the elderly '' . without the rolling stones , rock music would have no context and while it might be accurate to suggest that they are now a legacy band and irrelevant to contemporary music , on air -- a collection of `` rarely heard radio recordings with most of them live from the bbc studios between 1963-65 '' -- captures the raw and unrefined essence of a band , which achieved a lasting currency that some modern artists can only dare to dream of . ",
        "on air does n't rate among the greatest of so many classic rolling stones albums - beggars banquet , sticky fingers , exile on main street , goats head soup black and blue , some girls and , maybe , voodoo lounge - but there are few artists around nowadays that you could say will still be relevant in 40 years . mike alexander midge marsden the midge marsden collection ★ ★ ★ ★ is there a name as synonymous with new zealand blues as midge marsden ? the diminutive bluesman has made a career out of playing a type of music that , let 's face it , is n't top of the charts in this country . ",
        "yet he 's stuck at it , and the midge marsden collection - purportedly celebrating 50 years in the business , although he 's actually been playing longer than that - is a fine testament to a long career . the two-disc collection stretches from marsden 's days with the breakaways up until two years ago . it 's primarily blues-based , but not all straight blues . highlights include big hit burning rain , oddly delightful early cut rangitoto and the rollicking believe it 's over . travellin ' on , featuring marsden 's friend stevie ray vaughan , would be worth a listen for the guitar work alone .

        "jack barlow eno x dirty evil adventures & happy endings ★ ★ ★ ★ after a series of stunning singles and eps , grey lynn 's premier rap duo drop a stunning eight track exploration of peak performance kiwi hip-hop . a central component of auckland 's illustrious rap crew young gifted and broke , eno x dirty display many of the lush jazz and soul influences the collective is known to incorporate . producer eden jouavel is clearly one of new zealand 's fastest rising beat makers with an aesthetic that could almost stand alone as an instrumental hip hop record .

        "rapper manu walters has a distinct feel and flow that has the ability to be as laid back as it is aggressive . evil adventures & happy endings is the soundtrack to your next grey lynn house party . hugh collins .   "
