        "a month prior to ` the last jedi ' coming out i never expected it to have any impact besides being a great star wars film . if you 'd told me in november that people were literally muting twitter mutuals because of their polarizing opinions i would 've laughed at you . yet , that 's exactly what happened . now , films in general are something people disagree on all the time . for example , you have those who think quentin tarantino is a god among men but you also have those of us who are n't really all that awestruck by him . ",
        "it 's common to have a difference of opinion but , at least in my lifetime , i 've never seen a more split group of fans than the star wars fandom in december , 2017 . i think it 'd be dishonest if i did n't lay out my feelings about the film in order to present the least biased coverage that i could of this issue . i loved ` the last jedi ' and i thought it was what the franchise needed . i did n't disagree with many of the choices made but , with that said , i understand why people would have the polar opposite view to me . ",
        "at first i was absolutely fuming that people disliked the film but after a few days i realized how extra i was being . so what if someone dislikes a film i like ? will i die ? will i become broke ? will all the vines that are left vanish ? no . so i figured you have to let people have their views as long as they are n't harmful . * cough * reylo * cough * . there are rational takes of ` the last jedi ' but what fun would this piece be if i went with the rational views rather than the extra ones ? ",
        "so , in order to show both sides of this argument let 's split the camps . we have if you hate ` the last jedi ' you do n't deserve to see films twitter who think that this film is the best thing since sliced bread , and then we have rian johnson ruined star wars twitter who think this film is worse than episode i. let 's tackle the most vocal camp first which is easily rian johnson ruined star wars twitter : firstly , saying that rian johnson stole his plot from a fanfic is absolutely absurd . ",
        "come on now , if you truly liked film and knew how they were made you 'd know that his script would 've taken years to write and would 've been submitted to lucasfilm at least a year prior to ` the last jedi ' coming out . which it was , as the script for ` the last jedi ' was completed around the same time ` the force awakens ' was still in production . secondly , using the fact this was carrie fisher 's last role before her death in 2016 is abhorrent . i 'm sorry , but carrie put her heart into this film and even had a part of writing her lines in the script . ",
        "you do not need to milk the fact this was her last film to explain why you dislike the film . it 's immensely disrespectful . thirdly , telling us that star wars has been undoubtedly ruined is the wildest thing i have heard in awhile . star wars has undeniably had some of the worst prequels in history and yet this is what ruined star wars ? not george lucas 's cheap and easy cash-grab in the 2000s ? fourthly , because yes we 're doing this , how on earth does this film support nazis ? rian johnson and all his reyloness did n't make the film become pro ` the first order ' because he presented a backstory for kylo . ",
        "in order to have a good villain , even one you hate , you need them to be well written . you can not just have a villain and never explain why they do what they do . i mean , you can , but it would n't be a good film . rian gave us the reason he finally turned . and guess what ? it was sad as hell , but that does n't mean i 'm suddenly going to be like , ` hmm yes kylo becoming a space nazi is okay i guess ' . some may do that , but anyone who can critically digest a film will not . ",
        "now let 's hit on if you hate ` the last jedi ' you do n't deserve to see films twitter : this is less of a bunch of things you guys have said wrong but the general attitude of this side of twitter because oh boy , have you guys become unbearable . saying that anyone who dislikes ` the last jedi ' does n't understand how film works is n't a valid point . if someone says something like ` do n't let holdo save the rebels ' sure say they do n't know about character growth or arcs but if someone says they think finns arc was kind of redundant you do n't need to be mean and snobby towards them . ",
        "simply ask them why they think that and have a calm debate on how you think elements of the film should 've been dealt with . the fanon and theories camp you guys take is more understandable , but even so i feel like you 're coming from a side disregarding how much people love these characters . someone being mad luke made that mistake is actually not that wild to think about . whilst i agree with the move they made with his arc , i also get why someone who 's grown up with a certain type of view of luke would be upset . ",
        "as long as they are n't saying something as messy as , ` poe is a latinx stereotype because he got mad and he 's reckless which never happened in tfa , ' does it really warrant harassing someone and getting your friends to attack them ? if you do n't agree then do n't give it more limelight than it needs . maybe nobody will read this , or maybe i 'll be attacked who knows . but if anything take from this the idea of a non toxic discourse surrounding something we all love so dearly . we do n't need to reach the pits of our rage because of a film . ",
        "that 's not what this film intended . editor : chichi amaena .   "
