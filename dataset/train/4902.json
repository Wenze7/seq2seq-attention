        "a christchurch property owner is considering a different strategy after his offer to have a buyer `` lock in '' a price and pay it in five years received a backlash online . les collins , who owns a four-bedroom property in christchurch , made the offer in the hope it would appeal to young buyers starting out without a deposit . he offered to have them agree to buy the house at its current registered valuation of $ 420,000 in five years ' time . between now and then , they could live in the property , paying a premium rent on a five-year lease . ",
        "then , in 2023 , they could tap into their kiwisaver accounts or other savings for a deposit , get a mortgage for the difference , and complete the purchase . the property is listed on trade me with an asking price of $ 398,000 . `` the house is going up at 3.5 per cent a year and will be worth in the order of $ 500,000 in five years , but the price will be $ 420,000 . the canny will have already realised that they could buy and sell the house and make $ 80,000 . '' ",
        "real estate institute statistics this month showed canterbury prices fell 0.7 per cent year-on-year in the month . collins said the offer had provoked harsh comments . `` i am thinking through what people have said and might change tack completely . '' infometrics chief forecaster gareth kiernan said whether it was a good deal or not would not be clear until it was known what house prices would do in the city in the next five years . `` if they surge , then locking in the price at $ 420,000 now could be good for the purchaser -- even if they 're paying a ` premium rent ' in the meantime . ",
        "of course , capital gains requirements might also mean the new purchaser could have to own the house for a certain period of time before selling again without attracting tax . `` at the moment , though , i 'd say the cards are stacked in the owner 's favour . even in the context of a soft outlook for house prices nationwide over a three-year horizon , prospects for house prices in christchurch do n't look great given the post-quake oversupply of housing in the city . the purchaser would be paying additional cash - rent - in the meantime for the privilege of their five-year futures contract , and presumably would be inconveniently tying themselves up for five years to have to live in the property . '' ",
        "he said , if he were buying it , he would pay $ 400,000 and be done with it . `` sounds to me like the buyer has n't had much interest over the last month and is a bit desperate . perhaps they just need to drop the price a bit ? ''   "
