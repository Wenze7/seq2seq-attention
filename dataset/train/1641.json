        "when you were younger , december was a time of pure , unbridled enthusiasm . the joy and excitement were palpable . in fact , if excitement were holiday food , it would be handfuls of multi-colored sprinkles . when you were younger , the holidays could never come fast enough . time seemed to stand still as you waited for time off from school , time with family members you did n't see very often , and -- most important of all -- presents . free stuff that you would play with nonstop until you imploded with childish glee . ",
        "this was your time , and you were going to make the most of it . and mental health ? if you even had the words to describe your feelings , your emotional wellness was the farthest thing from your mind . things are different nowas you get older , times change . interests change . and as you move into college and then into the working world , stress compounds until you reach the optimal , fully-formed state of adulthood : fully responsible for your own life and fully overwhelmed . you would think that holidays would always remain the time for relaxation , for basking in the soporific splendor of good food and good company . ",
        "but that 's not the case . with holidays comes big expectations -- along with big questions , big comparisons , and big feelings . what are you doing now ? are you dating anyone ? why is n't so-and-so here ? do you have a job yet ? you do n't ? why not ? and on and on until you want to escape from the interrogation session dressed up as a holiday party . it can all get to be way too muchfamily members think they are being helpful and considerate when they rapid-fire questions at your face , but they are n't always well received . ",
        "holidays are the time to touch base , to catch up after long hiatuses of the raucous rock group called `` family . '' you know the group can put on a pretty good show , but the feelings start to sour after a few days on tour . it 's no one 's fault . most families do n't get a very good education in processing their emotions . so , when family members get together who do n't get to be together very often , big emotions manifest in questions , comments , gestures . you know that the question `` so , what are you going to do next ? '' ",
        "seems innocuous on the surface . but dig a bit deeper , and you 're liable to think , what 's wrong with what i 'm doing now ? i was n't even thinking of a next thing -- why are you ? for most people , this back-and-forth never gets out into the open , and tensions increase . which is why you turn to any form of escape to make it more manageable -- to alcohol , to over-eating , to telling awkward , inappropriate jokes . you know you are guilty of one of them . holidays are tough because we do n't often treat people as they are , we treat them as we are . ",
        "we project our thoughts and feelings in the hope that we can quickly catch up with them and display our worth through our advice and well wishes . it all seems so lovely and innocent . but still , the december of today is not the december of your youth . you struggle . you hope to appease everyone while being kind to yourself , but those ideas seem to be mutually exclusive . in december , with some of the biggest holidays and family-gathering times of the year for most people , you try to be everything to everyone . ",
        "but that 's impossible . you 'd be much better off if you learned some lessons from your younger , egomaniacal , over-excited , little-kid self1 . take your time back . be excited about what you 're doing for you . paradoxically , we become so focused on pleasing everyone during the holidays that we forget to care for ourselves . take your time back by choosing some activities that you know will make you happy and pursue them with reckless abandon . of course , be considerate to others , but approach your time -- and your life -- with the excitement you did as a child . ",
        "2 . live in the moment . all kids are tiny buddhas . they see everything with wondrous excitement . they explore , they run around , they climb trees , and they ride their bikes and crash them into other trees . and then they bounce up from the ground and do it all over again . channel some of the feeling you had when you were a kid by focusing on the moment , focusing on only what you can control . 3 . but also step back and appreciate the time that you have . when you were a kid , you wanted the time to speed up so that you could get to your favorite parts -- to presents , to eating good food , to seeing your family and friends . ",
        "when you get older and have innumerable responsibilities , you get stuck in how much you have to do and forget to remember that this life is precious . time goes by quickly , and this is especially true as you get older . savor it . the rock band might be getting together for one of its last tours . you never know what could happen in the next year or so . if you still find holidays tough , know that these too will pass . holidays come and go . family and friends gather , and then they leave . ",
        "if you are struggling , know there are others struggling , too . december is a tough month . but you 're in it . you 're experiencing it . it may not be what you want at this moment , but know that the feelings you have are shared by many . remember , it 's the wild times that shape your perspective and help you better understand the calmer times . to get where you 're going , you need a reference point to point you in the right direction . did you like this post ? please start an awkward slow clap below for as long as your heart desires . ",
        "then other medium users will hear it and come running . and thanks for reading . i really appreciate it .   "
