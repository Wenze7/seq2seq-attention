        "we 've got a few days left , so it 's not a lock , but unless a muellerian thunderbolt suddenly strikes the oval office , it looks like the clear winner for the most important political event of the year was the women 's march . the inauguration of trump was mandated by the constitution . his behavior since then appears to be mandated by his constitution . neither was a surprise . the success of the women 's march was different , in two ways . first , no one could have predicted how big it would be . ",
        "there 's no official count , but the estimate is that roughly 4 million people took to the streets . for a sense of scale , that 's roughly twice as many people as currently serve in the united states military . and the largest protest in american history did n't just happen in d. c. and l. a. over 400 marches took place across the country , with another 200 occurring worldwide on all seven continents -- yes , even antarctica . second -- and more important -- is the explosive surge of activism the march inspired . one of the central messages of the women 's march was , `` after we march , we organize . '' ",
        "no one knew whether the second part would happen . after all , organizing is harder than marching . it clearly has . since the women 's march , women have used social media to organize countless grassroots groups . these groups typically have a loose structure but a clear goal : flip seats . and to flip those seats , we 're seeing more women run for office than at any time in history , with many of them pointing to the women 's march as the event that put them on the path to becoming a candidate . ",
        "as a local elected official , after the election i started getting invited to a lot of new grassroots groups . i remember going to three or four and thinking it was interesting that they all seemed to be organized and largely attended by women . now i 've been to over a dozen . folks , every single one is organized by women . 80 % of the attendees are women . women are running the whole show . refreshingly , at these meetings i do n't hear much debate about what it means to be a `` true '' progressive or whether bernie would have won . ",
        "they do n't spend a lot of time obsessing over bylaws or holding internal elections . you know what they 're talking about ? how to raise money . how to build a volunteer army . how to bounce back after a tough day of canvassing or phone banking . in other words , they 're talking about what it actually takes to create change , and then they 're really doing it . 2017 was brutal . but while some of us froze in despondence and disbelief , millions of women picked this country up , put it on their backs , and marched us forward . ",
        "if we 're talking politics , nothing more important happened this year .   "
