",
        "meanwhile a balance of 23pc anticipate hiring more workers next year - though that level is down from 28pc in november , and is below the study 's long-term average of 29pc . `` despite a slight increase in overall business confidence , firms continue to remain concerned about the outlook for the economy , '' said hann-ju ho , senior economist at lloyds bank . `` the results point to the economy continuing to expand in the fourth quarter at a similar pace to recent quarters . however , larger companies reported weakest business prospects as well as the biggest concerns about the impact of brexit . '' ",
        "the better performance among small - and mid-sized companies may reflect their more domestic focus , as larger companies are more likely to operate across borders , and so could be more affected by changes in the uk 's border with the eu . one factor aiding exporting firms , and which may mitigate this impact on larger companies , is the strength of the global economy . the us economy is growing at its fastest pace since the start of 2015 , expanding at an annualised rate of 3.2 pc in the third quarter , the latest figures revealed . ",
        "however that figure was a touch below the 3.3 pc growth that economists had expected . the bureau of economic analysis said extra government spending and inventory-building helped the acceleration of gdp growth , while a small slowdown in consumption and exports held it back .   "
