        "i recently cut my bangs . if you are someone who has ever cut their bangs you will understand that the past few months of my life have been stressful to say the least . cutting your bangs is quite often the last resort when it feels as though your life is crumbling around you . the joke is that everyone pretty much knows that i hate the way i look with bangs . i 'd somehow convinced myself that bangs were once again in `` high fashion '' . even my pinterest board wanted me to cut my bangs after showing me countless picture after picture of vanessa hudgens with fucking bangs . ",
        "so much like when i decided to convert to christianity i said `` what 's the worst that could happen , '' and i let this woman i 'd never met before cut my bangs . the fact that i was surprised when i turned to face the mirror to see that the stylist had done exactly what i asked her to do when i drove to her place of business , signed my name on the check-in form , and shown her pictures of what i wanted for reference i think says a lot about who i am as a person and as a byproduct of my mental disorder . ",
        "it probably says something like `` i 'm not too good at thinking through things critically , '' or `` i refuse to learn from my previous mistakes '' . the problem at it 's face value probably seems innocuous . i got a bad hair cut , big deal . it 's not that simple though . the problem is more like , i have real issues ; i have a mental illness that i refuse to be held accountable for . i have known this for years now that i have things i need to deal with . ",
        "however , talking about those things makes them real , in such a way that would be uncomfortable and expensive . so instead i pretend that everything is fine for months at a time . then it becomes too much to handle , so i cut my bangs . it is n't always my bangs , sometimes i spend my rent on a new pair of shoes , sometimes i get into a meaningless relationship for a month , or i post something scandalous on social media . it 's not like i actually forget that i do n't like the way i look with bangs . ",
        "it 's not like it was actually time for a new hairstyle . i 'm quite fond of the way i typically wear my hair . whatever it is in my chemistry that perpetuates my cycle of bad decision making , i have not a name for . some people probably just think i like attention , and who does n't ? some people might just assume that i am quirky so much so that i become socially inappropriate , but i know the truth . i know that i continuously pursue surface level albeit temporary solutions to my deeply manifested and evergrowing mental anguish . ",
        "i used to think that i was just a sad , edgy , `` angsty '' teenager , but i am wrapping up 20 years of the same escape artist tactics with no intention of stopping . it 's obvious to everyone who is close to me that i need to be working through my problematic behaviors . i am aware that my short term answers are shallow , and that they wo n't do anything substantive for the problem at large ; but they carry me through until the next time i feel like my life is spiraling out of control . ",
        "that 's about all i can ask of them . finally as i was turned to face a giant mirror , the hairstylist proudly asked me how i felt that she 'd just cut my bangs . these are the bangs that i 'd now grow out for another six months , so that i could hit yet another dry spell of passion and/or mania and get the all too familiar sudden urge to cut my fucking bangs . i looked at my mother , then back in the mirror and calmly stated that i felt like i `` wanted to throw myself off a bridge , '' but that i `` felt that way before i came in to get a haircut '' .
