        "the bbc faces a growing crisis over its alleged `` secretive and illegal '' pay culture . following the recent very public resignation of its china editor carrie gracie , who accused the british broadcaster of breaking the uk 's pay laws , the guardian reports that the country 's equalities and human rights commission plans to seek answers from the corporation . a spokesperson for the public body said : `` we are aware of claims by carrie gracie of unlawful pay discrimination at the bbc . women have a legal right to equal pay with men for equal work . ",
        "`` we will be writing to the bbc and requiring them to provide us with information on their pay policy and the facts in this individual case . we will consider whether further action is required based on this information . '' read more : * female bbc host details gender salary gap the ehrc not only has the power to name and same organisations , but can also bring legal action , something the bbc also potentially faces from its female employees who believe they have been paid less than men for doing the same jobs . after 30-year veteran gracie revealed in an open letter on her website that she did not trust bbc management to deal with gender inequality , after a proposed pay increase left her still well behind the company 's male international editors , she received support on social media from many of her colleagues , including today presenter mishal husain and newsnight host evan davis , with many using the hashtag #istandwithcarrie . ",
        "however , despite more than 130 female employees signing a statement expressing their support for gracie and calling for action on pay equality , their attempts to present on-air segments about the dispute were blocked by the bbc . defending the company against allegations of censorship , the bbc spokesperson told the guardian : `` where a presenter or reporter has publicly expressed a view on a particular issue , they would no longer be perceived as an impartial voice , therefore it is right they do not conduct interviews on that issue . this is in keeping with editorial guidelines . '' ",
        "it is believed that up to 200 women at the bbc have made a formal complaint about pay . this includes a collective grievance lodged on behalf of 121 women by the national union of journalists . the pay row began in the middle of 2017 when the bbc published a list of its top-earning stars , which revealed that only a third were women and the top seven were all men .
