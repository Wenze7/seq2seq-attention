        "the potential is there for reign to be supergirl 's greatest foe . in supergirl 's two-and-a-half seasons , we 've seen kara battle a number of foes , but pinning down the best is a difficult task . where astra and non took the role of big bad in season one and mon-el 's mother , rhea , became the main villain of season 2 , it 's safe to say that they were n't quite as good as they could have been . however , with the approach they 're taking with reign , it 's possible that season 3 could produce supergirl 's best villain yet . ",
        "a different kind of villainthe writers have taken a different approach to the villain this year in that we have actually met her and built a rapport with her . odette annable 's sam does n't seem the villainous type at first glance : a single mother struggling to balance her work-life and her home-life . but as the season progressed , we learned more and more about her . sure , we already knew that she was the baby who was shown being sent to earth at the end of season 2 , but aside from that , we knew little about her . ",
        "our first glimpse of her true potential was actually in her debut when she managed to lift the scaffolding off her daughter . interestingly , it seemed that sam was shocked by her strength and she seemed scared by what she 'd just done . as the episodes passed , we discovered that sam was haunted by visions of a mysterious robed woman who told her that she would reign over earth . as these became more frequent , and she noticed other strange things happening , she decided to investigate and visited her mother . sam learned the truth of her heritage and discovered her own fortress of sanctuary which explained the truth of her origins -- she would become a world killer . ",
        "immediately after this , reign was born . a formidable foein the mid-season finale , we got our first glimpse of reign in action and it 's safe to say that she packed a punch . after goading kara to meet with her , the two began a battle across national city . it was here that we saw just how dangerous reign really is . she comfortably beats kara , knocking her out cold and seemingly into a coma . never before had supergirl met with an opponent as dangerous and as powerful ; even non never made her bleed before . ",
        "the fact that reign defeated her so publically spoke volumes as well , the people of national city saw their idol brutally defeated and now know that there is a threat worth fearing . the problem with villainsone of the biggest problems with the previous villains was the fact that they were underdeveloped ; their motivations were slightly sketchy and they seemed to be evil purely to give kara something to fight . astra and non seemed bent on world domination purely because they were more powerful than the humans . yes , there was the family connection , but once astra was killed , non did n't really hit the mark . ",
        "season two suffered from a bit of an identity crisis when villains are concerned , the first half of the season seemed to imply that lillian luthor 's cadmus would be the big threat facing supergirl , but that was all but forgotten about until kara joined forces with them in the season finale . rhea appeared about three-quarters of the way through the season and muscled her way into the role of big bad . where supergirl has never had an iconic villain like the other arrowverse shows , it seems like reign could finally be a step in the right direction . ",
        "much like deathstroke in arrow and the reverse flash in the flash , it seems that we may finally have an iconic villain to battle the girl of steel for the remainder of the season . `` they will call you worldkiller -- and you will reign ! `` more from bam smack pow suicide squad 2 reportedly has a filming start date3h ago spider-man : into the spider-verse trailer brings miles morales to life4h ago jeffrey dean morgan to become batman ? 7h ago spider-man : homecoming 2 casting video surfaces for gwen stacy8h ago star wars : all 8 movies , ranked from worst to best9h ago the potential is there for reign to be supergirl 's greatest foe .
