        "any signs you can do or things you can say to a guy ? there is a guy who i am attracted and i guess he likes me too . we had gone out just twice and in btoh dates we ended up making out . still we dont have a lot of contact when we are apart . , i mean like texting and talk randomly . in fact it could pass weeks and weeks without seeing each other or even communicating at all . for isntance imagien that for the 2nd date to take place just one month ago it took one year and a half ago since the 1st date to make it happen , due to some circumstances in the guys life that made us stop communicating at all . ",
        "we are not really a couple though , we act more like friends at this momento . i do want the guy to still be interested in me and go out iwth him once again on our 3rd date , but how to do it without acting too bold in order to get his attention as acting too bold is not my cup of tea . i ddo want him to know i still like him though . i dont want to make him look im easy or something , as i believe the guy wants some kind of intimacy if we go out again , but i want a normal date , and not focus yet on the intimacy issue , i want a nromal date with talks , laughs , coffee or lunch or dinner and keep it that way for the momento and enjoy the date like that .
