        "cleveland indians pitcher trevor bauer throws hard . he averaged 94.39 mph on his fastball last season , according to brooksbaseball . net , one of the best pitching sites on the planet . he 's looking to top that in 2018 . for the past couple offseasons , bauer has worked with driveline baseball in an attempt to refine his game . the company does a lot of work with weighted balls , which can help a pitcher gain some velocity . on wednesday , bauer threw a ball that registered 116.9 mph during one of their drills . ",
        "in other news , here 's @baueroutage pulling down a new facility record of 116.9 mph with a 3oz pic . twitter . com/a21va55hyn -- driveline baseball january 10 , 2018you already know the catch , right ? that 's not a pitch . bauer is taking a running start and whipping a 3oz ball a short distance . he threw a ball 116.9 mph , not a pitch . it 's semantics , we know . but still . we were up front `` a catch . `` if you feel you 've been duped , allow us to try and explain why we still think the above video is worth your time . ",
        "• first off , it 's pretty fun to see 116.9 mph on a baseball radar gun regardless of how that figure was produced . it takes an incredible amount of effort to hit that figure . • driveline baseball is considered a facility on the cutting edge , so we 're getting a brief look into the types of things they preach to pitchers . • bauer 's throw was a record in this drill , that seems to be worth something . • bauer 's throw came in nearly seven mph higher than this toss from chicago white sox pitching prospect michael kopech 's last offseason . ",
        "that was a similar drill , and kopech is known for being a flamethrower on the mound . bauer obliterated that number . it 's important to note that this video does n't mean bauer is suddenly going to start averaging 100 mph on his fastball in 2018 . if anything , it 's more proof that bauer is still trying to take his game to another level . it 's also an inside look into some of the newer methods pitchers are using to improve their performance .
