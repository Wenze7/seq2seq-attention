        "british prime minister theresa may invited trump to visit the country last year during her sojourn to the white house after the u. s. election . but the specter of such a invitation has been increasingly contentious . london mayor sadiq khan called on may to cancel the invitation after trump retweeted anti-muslim videos from a far-right twitter account in november , accusing the u. s. president of promoting a `` vile , extremist group , '' the associated press reported at the time . `` many brits who love america and americans will see this as a betrayal of the special relationship between our two countries , '' khan said in a statement .
