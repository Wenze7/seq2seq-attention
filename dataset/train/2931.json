        "washington -- a divided house voted thursday to prevent a government shutdown after an eleventh-hour deal brought conservatives aboard . but the gop-written measure faced gloomy prospects in the senate , and it remained unclear whether lawmakers would be able to find a way to keep federal offices open past a friday night deadline . the house voted by a near party-line 230-197 vote to approve the legislation , which would keep agency doors open and hundreds of thousands of federal employees at work through feb. . 16 . the measure is designed to give white house and congressional bargainers more time to work through disputes on immigration and the budget that they 've tangled over for months . ",
        "house passage was assured after the house freedom caucus reached an accord with house speaker paul ryan , r-wis . the leader of the hard-right group , rep. mark meadows , r-n . c. , said ryan promised future votes on extra defense spending and on a conservative , restrictive immigration bill . meadows also spoke to president donald trump . but most senate democrats and some republicans were expected to oppose the measure when it reaches that chamber later thursday . democrats were hoping to spur slow-moving immigration talks , while a handful of republicans , including sen. lindsey graham , r-s . ",
        "c. , were pressing for swifter action on immigration and a long-sought boost in pentagon spending . senate rejection would leave the pathway ahead uncertain with only one guarantee : finger-pointing by both parties . the gop controls the senate 51-49 and will need a substantial number of democratic votes to reach 60 -- the number needed to end democratic delaying tactics . republicans were all but daring democrats to scuttle the bill and force a shutdown because of immigration , which they said would hurt democratic senators seeking re-election in 10 states that trump carried in 2016 . `` if there 's a government shutdown -- and let 's hope there 's not -- it 'd be the democrats shutting it down , '' said sen. richard shelby , r-ala . ",
        "democrats said voters would fault republicans because they control congress and the white house and because trump shot down a proposed bipartisan deal among a handful of senators that would have resolved the conflict over how to protect hundreds of thousands of young immigrants from deportation . `` you have the leverage . get this done , '' house minority leader nancy pelosi of california said about republicans . trump himself weighed in from pennsylvania , where he flew to help a gop candidate in a special congressional election . `` i really believe the democrats want a shutdown to get off the subject of the tax cuts because they 're doing so well , '' he said . ",
        "if the measure stalls in the senate , the next steps were murky . barring a last-minute pact between the two parties on spending and immigration disputes that have raged for months , lawmakers said a measure financing agencies for just several days was possible to build pressure on negotiators to craft a deal . also imaginable : lawmakers working over the weekend with a shutdown underway -- watched by a public that has demonstrated it has abhorred such standoffs in the past . shadowing everything is this november 's elections . trump 's historically poor popularity and a string of democratic special election victories have fueled that party 's hopes of capturing control of the house and perhaps the senate . ",
        "as he 's done since taking office a year ago , trump was dominating and confusing the jousting , at times to the detriment of his own party . he tweeted that the month-long funding measure should not contain money for a children 's health insurance program -- funds his administration has expressly supported -- then the white house quickly said he indeed supports the legislation . congress must act by midnight friday or the government will begin immediately locking its doors . though the impact would initially be spotty -- since most agencies would be closed until monday -- the story would be certain to dominate weekend news coverage , and each party would be gambling the public would blame the other . ",
        "in the event of a shutdown , food inspections and other vital services would continue , as would social security , other federal benefit programs and most military operations . hoping to garner more votes , republicans added language providing six years of financing for the widely popular children 's health insurance program and delaying some taxes imposed by president barack obama 's health care law . the children 's health program serves nearly 9 million low-income children , and some states have come close to exhausting their funds . but pelosi compared the gop bill to `` having a bowl of doggy-doo and adding a cherry on top and calling it a chocolate sundae . ",
        "`` senate majority leader mitch mcconnell , r-ky . , taunted democrats , saying , `` my friends on the other side of the aisle do not oppose a single thing in this bill '' and `` ca n't possibly explain '' their opposition to voters . most democrats remained opposed anyway , though saying they 'd relent if there also was a deal to protect around 700,000 immigrants from deportation who arrived in the u. s. as children and now are here illegally . trump has ended an obama-era program providing those protections and given congress until march to restore them . ",
        "republicans were demanding that a separate budget bill financing government for the rest of this year include big boosts for the military , and they accused democrats of imperiling pentagon funding . democrats were insisting on equally large increases for domestic programs for opioid treatment and veterans -- efforts that many in the gop also back . while that tradeoff seemed achievable , it was the immigration dispute that loomed as the biggest hurdle , and democrats were trying to use the need to keep government financed as leverage . `` if this bill passes , there 'll be no incentive to negotiate , and we 'll be right back here in a month with the same problems at our feet , '' said senate minority leader chuck schumer , d-n . ",
        "y.talks among top lawmakers and white house officials were moving slowly on an immigration package . trump and republicans want it to include money for the president 's promised wall along the mexican border and other security measures . ___ ap reporters jill colvin , marcy gordon , matthew daly and kevin freking contributed .
