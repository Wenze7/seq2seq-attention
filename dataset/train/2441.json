",
        "`` a real competitor , dan was phenomenal in the 2016 grand final and put in a performance that will live long in the memory . `` he has been desperately unlucky with the injury he sustained whilst at gold coast but is fit again now and will arrive in the uk on saturday and join the rest of the squad on a three-day training camp in wales as they continue to prepare for the 2018 season .
