        "asked if it would be issuing a set of commemorative stamps to mark brexit , the royal mail replied with a firm and distinctly snooty `` no '' . it has n't deigned to give a reason . and yet the first new stamps it will issue in 2018 will commemorate game of thrones . a gripping television drama , to be sure , but also an american commercial product . after yesterday 's outcry , with one senior tory mp branding their decision `` inconsistent , irritating and annoying '' , many reasonable people assumed royal mail would think again . ",
        "how on earth could the company justify its determination to ignore the largest democratic vote in british history ? printing a set would cost them no extra cash , and they have previously marked political events with commemorative issues . pa : press associationyet still , answer comes there none . just a grim repetition of the original `` no '' . i think i know what 's going on . like many creaking british institutions , royal mail -- now private but infected from top to bottom with a public-sector mentality -- is living in an escapist fantasy every bit as imaginary as the seven kingdoms of westeros in game of thrones . ",
        "it 's the parallel universe of the remoaners , a `` safe space '' in which brexit can be stopped , even though the government has triggered article 50 , our formal notification of leaving the eu . in well-heeled parts of this country , university lecturers and yummy mummies rush to bookshops to buy how to stop brexit by the freshly knighted yesterday 's man , sir nick clegg . this silly book belongs on the science-fiction shelves next to author george rr martin 's game of thrones novels . diehard remainers , poor things , really believe clegg 's claim that the referendum result can be swept under the carpet . ",
        "and they 're encouraged in this delusion by the yacht-hopping fantasist tony blair , whose grip on reality is becoming more tenuous by the minute . why is the royal mail -- which has no problem decorating its stamps with peppa pig , mr men , `` sustainable fish '' or notable locomotives of wales -- pandering to the doctrinaire anti-brexit lobby ? is it terrified of twitter storms ? or is this just another symptom of its failure to engage with the modern world ? pa : press associationevery time i go into my local post office i feel like i 'm visiting a 1970s theme park , complete with eastern bloc-style queues and semi-comatose counter service . ",
        "whatever the reason , royal mail needs to change its mind . and there 's still plenty of time -- which is why the sun is mounting a campaign for stamps marking the brexit we demanded . you might ask : does it matter , given that we 're definitely waving farewell to brussels in march next year ? yes , it does matter . pa : press associationin 1973 the royal mail issued stamps to celebrate us joining the common market , even though millions of britons opposed the move . as the referendum two years later -- won by the yes campaign with 67 per cent of the vote -- showed , most people thought the decision a necessary step in our national journey . ",
        "now we are taking another step -- not in the opposite direction , but a step forward into a very different globalised world , in which we need the freedom to regulate our own businesses and negotiate our own trade deals . foam-flecked remoaners , who make up only a minority of those who voted to stay in the eu , will hate the stamps . well , tough . by the time we leave , we 'll have had to put up with nearly three years of hissy fits , futile plotting and crudely twisted reporting by the anti-brexit bbc . ",
        "but make no mistake about it : by then , the `` stop brexit '' movement will have fallen apart , just as george osborne 's project fear backfired and the news that blue passports coming back cheered us rather than provoked outrage . when the royal mail does respect the will of the people and gets on with printing brexit stamps , we will enjoy sending them around the world to exhibit our pride in this great nation . no doubt some daft remoaners will refuse to open their letters and create embarrassing scenes in post offices , but let them enjoy their one last tantrum . ",
        "like hyperactive children , they 'll calm down when they run out of energy . the rest of us can afford to smile , not just at their antics but because we 're beginning an exciting new chapter in our island story . and that is indeed something to celebrate -- by putting the stamp of history on our mail . damian thompson is associate editor of the spectator .
