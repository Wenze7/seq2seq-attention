        "shares in ground engineer van elle tumbled on tuesday morning after it revealed it had a £ 1.6 m exposure to collapsed construction giant carillion , warning that it would suffer if it was not paid . carillion went into compulsory liquidation on monday , owing about £ 1bn in unpaid costs to as many as 30,000 businesses , and running up a £ 2bn loss for its lenders . van elle , which has carried out regular work as a sub-contractor for carillion on rail improvement and maintenance work for network rail , said on tuesday that it had not been paid for work it did in december . ",
        "the engineer estimated that the outstanding debt and work-in-progress exposure was £ 1.6 m. shares in van elle fell by as much as 10pc in early trading and were down 7.8 pc late morning , at 88.5 p . the company said it would talk with carillion and its advisors , including the official receiver , `` to determine the status of outstanding payments '' . `` but shareholders should note that , in the event that van elle is unable to recover any monies owed , there would be an adverse financial impact on the group , '' it told the stock market . ",
        "van elle 's order book includes more work with carillion up to its financial year-end in april and beyond that was expected to produce revenue of about £ 2.5 m. `` it is too early to say whether there will be any effect on the commencement or completion dates of contracted work with carillion , or what impact these developments will have on future work programmes , either in the rail sector or elsewhere , '' the company said , adding that it would be monitoring the situation closely . van elle said in november its chief executive jon fenton would be stepping down due to a serious medical matter within his close family , once a suitable replacement is found . ",
        "mr fenton said : `` while it is disappointing to note the carillion announcement we continue to develop further our strong relationship with network rail and its principal contractors . '' meanwhile john laing infrastructure fund said that carillion was the facilities manager on nine of its projects , worth about 8.5 pc of its total portfolio and 9.6 pc of its net asset value , but added that the collapse `` should have no material impact '' . the company revealed it was already in discussions with potential replacement service providers on all nine of the projects , which it said it expected could be done `` with minimal service disruption and minimal additional cost '' . ",
        "the infrastructure investor said it had one construction project , now more than a decade old , on which carillion is liable for construction defects , but none were found in a recent survey .   "
