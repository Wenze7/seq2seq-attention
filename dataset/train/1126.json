        "`` sorry , that page does n't exist ! '' was the only message facing disheartened visitors who tried to access julian assange 's official twitter account on monday . it was not immediately clear whether the leader of the transparency organization wikileaks deleted the account @julianassange himself , or whether it was expunged by malignant hackers . it reportedly vanished in the early hours of monday morning . it does not appear that the account has been suspended by twitter , as a message about the account having been blocked is lacking . the handle has been inactive since friday , although @wikileaks is operating as usual . ",
        "no official comments have been released by assange , who has resided in the ecuadorian embassy in london ever since his application for political asylum . while in may sweden dropped an extradition request that it previously placed based on sexual abuse allegations , the uk maintained that assange would nevertheless be arrested if he left the embassy . ecuador and human rights activists worldwide have been calling for london to grant assange safe passage , while a un panel found he has been in `` arbitrary detention . '' assange has been using twitter as a crucial medium for his whistleblowing activity , as well as keeping his subscribers up to date on the paradoxes surrounding his asylum conundrum . ",
        "in spite of his prolific tweeting , his journalistic work , and an abundance of copycats using assange 's picture , twitter refused to grant the whistleblower the blue check-mark it confers on `` verified '' accounts .   "
