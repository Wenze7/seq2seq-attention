        "it 's been an important year for council with some big ticket items announced while some key projects were completed like the victoria st/cambridge rd roundabout and the commencement on an eight month project to upgrade cambridge 's wastewater infrastructure . there were some popular announcements for the future , the main one being the decision to spend $ 16.5 million on a new swimming complex for cambridge . other decisions were made to alter growth plans , releasing more land for residential housing and to reject easter trading . and there were the unpopular ones like the water meter decision for residents on cross leases . ",
        "discussions took place about destination playgrounds and water companies but sadly no discussions on a third bridge over the waikato . looking back on the year , the highlight for mylchreest was hosting the world masters games which took advantage of the district 's facilities . the event provided cambridge with huge international exposure . `` my number one goal for 2018 is to finally get the construction for the new covered swimming pool for cambridge underway , '' he said . `` the construction period will be longer than 12 months but we should be able to see some real progress by this time next year . '' ",
        "chamber of commerce chief executive tania witheford said she is looking forward to the challenges of the new year to deliver on her organisation 's vision to lead a supportive and connected business community . `` being a part and seeing the evolution of cambridge as it continues its steady and positive growth was a plus for me but there were so many highlights , it 's been hard to pick one , '' she said . witheford is another who is looking forward to taking some time out . `` on christmas day we will be at the lake with family and friends and dinner , well if santa is listening , something light and tasty from the barbecue which will include prawns and crayfish .
