        "a blockbuster media consolidation deal announced this morning sees fox handing over nearly its entire empire to espn 's corporate parent disney , with the exceptions of fox news and the national fox sports networks fs1 , fs2 , btn , fox deportes , and fox soccer plus . disney will now possess 22 fox sports rsns that hold exclusive local rights to 44 mlb , nba , and nhl team broadcasts . here 's what to expect in our newly-monopolized sports future . first , look for your local rsn to be rebranded under the espn umbrella . fox has been cornering the market on most of these -- buying out network minority shareholders , which in many cases included professional sports teams themselves -- and slapping `` fox '' onto the names of networks previously known as sportstime ohio or sun sports . ",
        "but fox did n't get around to buying out everyone ; espn 's parent company will now be joint stakeholders with the new york yankees in yes , the padres in fox sports san diego , and the reds in fox sports ohio . whether disney or fox will look to buy those teams out in the process of completing this deal is unclear , but the future of espn 's reporting is , at least potentially substantially complicated by the unique employment contracts of team broadcasters , who in many cases are both employees of the teams they cover and the network on which they appear . ",
        "fox , for its part , never seemed to leverage its ownership of the rsns into content on the national channels , other than the three fox college-sports networks which we assume will cease to exist . espn has dabbled in localizing its brand on several occasions , with limited success . but the established fox rsns are consistently among the most-demanded channels by local viewers -- in some markets , people want their local rsn more than they want espn -- and this now gives espn 's parent a massive amount of clout when it comes to bargaining carriage deals with cable and satellite providers . ",
        "more importantly -- to disney/espn , at least -- establishing a new and confident voice behind the rsn ownership should allow a sports megalith bully teams into smaller contracts . the history of each fox sports rsn is different , and usually features a long string of various majority and minority owners ; now that disney/espn owns almost all of them outright , with fox having already bought up almost any possible market competitor , teams whose games currently air on a fox sports rsn will have the choice of either taking what disney/espn is willing to give them or starting their own network -- which has been and continues to be a disaster for teams like the l. a. dodgers . ",
        "disney 's acquisition of a solid chunk of nhl local broadcast rights may be a boon to ice hockey fans who miss espn 's presentation of the sport , but whether that access will lead to more coverage on espn proper is anybody 's guess . again , the national fox sports networks never really made much use of the assets provided by the rsns , so if espn were to implement more of that it would require years of relationship-building . so , too , will constructing the rebranding efforts , which would go beyond removing `` fox sports '' from each network 's name and adding espn . ",
        "fox sports has an elaborate system that ensures graphics and sound assets are consistent across all of its networks , be they national or regional ; disney/espn would have to build its own centralized system for this . fox sports has invested a tremendous amount of money in its most recent revision of its most recent graphics branding , with the assumption that it would be utilized across its entire portfolio of networks . depending on when the disney-fox deal is finally completed -- and that could be years from now -- espn may either be scrambling to generate its own centralized graphics resource or extending its current system until whatever its new branding approach is launched . ",
        "in all this seems likely to amount to a mess . advertisementthis sort of thing should make little difference to you , the viewer , but it 's an example of the many obstacles that will have to be surmounted for the fox sports rsn empire to be absorbed by espn . of course , it may not be ; there are a variety of reasons why disney might want to keep them separate , brand them as something else , and treat them as completely separate from espn . that wo n't prevent espn from exploiting their assets , or vice versa -- look at how much ` synthesis ' we get between espn and abc , for example -- but it 's very possible that disney could elect to keep everything formerly fox in its own division for the time being . ",
        "that might be easier , in the short term , for management 's sake ; it would also be the worst possible outcome for viewers who may not keep up with the news , unaware that the biggest step in what has been a long march toward media monopolization has taken place .   "
