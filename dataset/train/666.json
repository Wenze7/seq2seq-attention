        "denver , co -- april 7 : nolan arenado . photo courtesy of getty images . with less than 50 days until pitchers and catchers report to spring training in arizona , the colorado rockies have a lot of things that need to be discussed in order for this team to make it all the way one of those would be their defense setup . bud black and gm jeff bridich have some serious decisions to make before opening day . bridich started making moves with signing catcher chris iannetta and , then , at the winter meetings , bridich may have developed a super bullpen with resigning left-handed reliever jake mcgee and signing closer wade davis and bryan shaw . ",
        "however , that is only one factor into making a good team . one of those factors is defense . the rockies are already known for having an incredible defense . they even came in 3rd according to espn out of all 30 teams . the key to winning it all is to keep that up . with questions looming about who could play first base and right field , their defense is up in the air . internally , the rockies have some options at both areas but to start off , at first base , we propose an option at first base that you may not be thinking of ... but he could be an effective option at first base . ",
        "next : what do you think of this ? 1st base : pat valaika goodyear , az -- march 10 : pat valaika . photo courtesy of getty images . if the rox decide to stay internal with their search for a 1st baseman , i believe pat valaika will be the best man for the job . it may be an out of the box choice but valaika , 25 , showed a lot of promise last season putting up a . 258 batting average , 13 home runs , and 40 rbi . the times this guy came in clutch were his pinch hitting situations . ",
        "valaika had 66 pinch hit appearances , he boded well with 12 extra base hits as well as 12 rbi and a . 328 / . 344 / . 672 slash line in those pinch hit appearances . that 's the job he can get done by just coming off the bench cold . he even did it during the wild card game . it may have been one at-bat but he came in clutch once again with a double . now imagine him starting everyday . there is serious potential with this guy . even though valaika has the least experience at first does n't mean he should be counted out . ",
        "in his five games at first , he maintained a fielding percentage of 1.000 . he only had 12 opportunities but in the very small sample size , he was not bad . the only way is up for pat valaika and starting him at first would be the right road . starting a guy with little experience at first base is crazy ? well , the rockies signed a big-name free agent last offseason to supposedly do just that ... so it has happened before . other internal options will be ryan mcmahon and ian desmond , who we will discuss a little bit later on . ",
        "next : the rest of the rockies infield 2nd base : dj lemahieu 3rd base : nolan arenado ss : trevor story denver , co -- june 20 : shortstop trevor story , third baseman nolan arenado , outfielder carlos gonzalez , second baseman dj lemahieu , and first baseman mark reynolds . photo courtesy of getty images . these are all no brainers . we know these guys will be starting in their respective positions next year . dj lemahieu is coming off a stellar year defensively . he got another gold glove and was also named wilsons ' defensive player of the year . ",
        "lemahieu is like a brick wall when it comes him at second mainly because of his his 6 ' 4 stature . he put up a solid fielding percentage of . 989 . that much is to be expected from him this season . of course , nolan arenado is at third . what 's not to love with this guy ? arenado had a stunning season with a . 979 fielding percentage . his awing defensive skills got him another gold glove , his first platinum glove and another spot at the all-star game . the expectations are always high for nolan arenado yet he always surpasses them . ",
        "trevor story had a noble season for his second season in the big leagues . he posted a . 982 fielding in his 142 games last year . i expect him to do the same or just a small amount above that . these three no doubt hold together the infield and will this season too . lf : ian desmond san francisco , ca -- june 27 : ian desmond . getty images . just listen to me on this one . ian desmond is definitely going to be playing a lot more this season . hopefully , he will be injury free . ",
        "recently looking at the rockies depth chart , i saw desmond was the projected starter for the team . it 's a smart move by the rockies , this lets the chips fall exactly where they should . desmond has experience playing left field as he played in left for 66 games in 2017 and 29 games in left with the texas rangers in 2016 . he had a nice fielding percentage of . 972 and only allowed 3 errors in 2017 in left field . at that rate , if he 's made primary left fielder , he could potentially be in talks for a gold glove . ",
        "cf : charlie blackmon phoenix , az -- april 28 : charlie blackmon . getty images . another obvious starter charlie blackmon has been a mainstay for this team and comes in clutch when needed . blackmon put up a . 988 fielding percentage and only allowing 4 errors . it 's expected that charlie blackmon will put up equal to or more than what he did last season . essentially , blackmon is the leader of the outfield for the rockies and will continue to be a mainstay at coors . rf : gerardo parra denver , co -- may 30 : outfielder gerardo parra . ",
        "this is really what you wanted to hear . if the rockies do n't get a free agent right fielder , gerardo parra will most likely be the starter . his primary position last season was left field , but he did have 22 starts in right field . while over in right field parra had a perfect 1.000 fielding percentage and 30 putouts . if the rockies stay internal , gerardo parra is the key to solidifying the outfield in order to keep the rox as a top defensive team . more from rox pile colorado rockies close to drawing a blessing from lil b ?

        "as backup catcher , tony wolters and tom murphy will be battling each other for the spot in spring training . wolters had a disappointing 2017 season as the rockies made him their starting catcher but he struggled offensively and defensively so the rockies acquired jonathan lucroy just before the july trade deadline . murphy had an injury plagued 2017 season as he only played in a combined 50 games between aaa and with the rockies . next : four interesting quotes from the wade davis conference call more projections for this seasonalong with the defensive setup , roxpile contributors have also gone over imperative things that make a baseball as a whole : rockies batting orderrockies startersrockies outfieldwith less than 50 days until pitchers and catchers report to spring training in arizona , the colorado rockies have a lot of things that need to be discussed in order for this team to make it all the way one of those would be their defense setup .
