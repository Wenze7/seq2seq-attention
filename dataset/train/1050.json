        "-- earth last year was n't quite as hot as 2016 's record-shattering mark , but it ranked second or third , depending on who was counting . either way , scientists say it showed a clear signal of man-made global warming because it was the hottest year they 've seen without an el nino boosting temperatures naturally . the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and the united kingdom 's meteorological office on thursday announced that 2017 was the third hottest year on record . at the same time , nasa and researchers from a nonprofit in berkeley , california , called it the second . ",
        "the agencies slightly differ because of how much they count an overheating arctic , where there are gaps in the data . the global average temperature in 2017 was 58.51 degrees , which is 1.51 degrees above the 20th century average and just behind 2016 and 2015 , noaa said . other agencies ' figures were close but not quite the same . earlier , european forecasters called 2017 the second hottest year , while the japanese meteorological agency called it the third hottest . two other scientific groups that use satellite , not ground , measurements split on 2017 being second or third hottest . ",
        "with four teams calling it the second hottest year and four teams calling it third , the united nations ' world meteorological organization termed 2017 a tie for second with 2015 . `` this is human-caused climate change in action , '' said nobel prize winning chemist mario molina of the university of california san diego , who was n't part of any of the measuring teams . `` climate is not weather , can go up and down from year to year . what counts is the longer-term change , which is clearly upwards . '' which year is first , second or third does n't really matter much , said princeton university climate scientist gabriel vecchi . ",
        "what really matters is the clear warming trend , he said . noaa 's five hottest years have been from 2010 on . during an el nino year -- when a warming of the central pacific changes weather worldwide -- the globe 's annual temperature can spike , naturally , by a tenth or two of a degree , scientists said . there was a strong el nino during 2015 and 2016 . but 2017 finished with a la nina , the cousin of el nino that lowers temperatures . had there been no man-made warming , 2017 would have been average or slightly cooler than normal , said national center for atmospheric research climate scientist ben sanderson . ",
        "on the other hand , nasa calculated if the temperature contributions of el nino and el nina were removed from the global data through the years , 2017 would go down as the hottest year on record , nasa chief climate scientist gavin schmidt said . carbon pollution is like putting the earth on an escalator of rising temperatures , with natural variation such as el nino or the cooling effect of volcanoes like hopping up or down a step or two on that escalator , scientists said . not every year will be warmer than the last because of natural variations , but the trend over years will be rising temperatures , they said . ",
        "the observed warming has been predicted within a few tenths of a degree in computer simulations going back to the 1970s and 1980s , several scientists said . it has been 33 years since the last month that the globe was cooler than normal , according to noaa . northern illinois university climate scientist victor gensini has never lived through a month or year that was n't hotter than normal . `` i look at pictures of the great winters of the late '70s from my parents and wonder if i 'll ever experience anything like that in my lifetime , '' said gebsini , who 's 31 .
