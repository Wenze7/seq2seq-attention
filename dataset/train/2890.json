        "french president emmanuel macron 's eu reform ideas are a central issue between cdu , csu and spd while discussing european affairs during the german coalition talks . for macron , the outcome might be of crucial importance when it comes to the realisation of his plans . euractiv germany 's media partner `` der tagesspiegel '' reports . every day of the talks has a major theme , to which the small group of party and faction leaders devotes themselves . on day two , the future of the community was on the agenda . first outcomes on climate and taxationthe plan was to keep everyone quiet during the five negotiation days . ",
        "but on monday , a steady stream of whispers from the working groups working in parallel with the bosses on 14 agreed subjects became public . the intended silence did not work . thus , the audience learned that cdu , csu and the spd no longer consider germany 's national climate protection target for 2020 to be achievable . another silent message was delivered by the first agreement of the tax and financial working group : in the future , the top tax rate of 42 % will only apply to incomes above € 60.000 instead of the current € 53.700 . ",
        "that is not surprising at all . both , christian democrats and spd want to relieve skilled workers . although the higher limit does not bring great relief to the individual , it symbolically reduces the bad feeling that even the man working on the automobile production line is treated as a top earner by the state . different views on europeeurope is a central topic for two of the negotiation partners : party leader and european-by-heart martin schulz recently declared progress in the european integration one of the main concerns for the spd . on the other hand , the csu in general and the smaller circle around state group leader alexander dobrindt in particular pursue a rather sceptical stance towards ` brussels ' . ",
        "german coalition negotiators agree to scrap 2020 climate targetgermany 's would-be coalition partners have agreed to drop plans to lower carbon dioxide emissions by 40 % from 1990 levels by 2020 , sources familiar with negotiations said on monday -- a potential embarrassment for chancellor angela merkel . in between , there is the chancellor . angela merkel wants to give an answer to macron about his reform proposals which does not consist only of ` no 's ' . with the spd , this might be easier than in the jamaica quartet with fdp leader christian lindner , who rejected the compromises of his own european affairs experts . ",
        "now , it is rather merkel who will have to decelerate . macron can count on the social democratsmacron here might belong to the group of non-german politicians having a special interest in the negotiations of the european affairs working group . because the french president is urgently seeking allies for his reforms -- and knows that he depends on the german social democrats . after the end of the jamaica talks , macron urged schulz repeatedly to enter a grand coalition and take responsibility for the future of europe . for the spd leader , who supports macron 's ideas and cultivates good contacts with the french president , an agreement with the christian democrats on further eu development is important as well : being a long-term president of the parliament , he can credibly lobby for the fact that the grand coalition is not only about the fate of the spd , but also about the future of the european project . ",
        "nevertheless , the transformation of the eu into a ` united states of europe ' by 2025 -- as schulz has demanded during a party congress in december -- is not a demand pursued by his party in the negotiations . german coalition talks : ` speed-dating ' for old partnersfive days have been scheduled for exploratory talks between the cdu , csu and spd to negotiate the formation of a new german government . in case there is a common declaration at the end of the negotiation marathon , it nevertheless is still unclear , if the parties will agree to form a government coalition . ",
        "euractiv germany reports . in its congressional decision , the spd demands `` concrete and substantial progress on the way to a social europe '' . together with france , the german government must take the initiative for an investment budget for the eurozone . a `` broad-based european investment program '' , the introduction of european minimum wages and the drying up of tax havens would be needed . because of brexit , the fight against flight causes and the development of a common security and defence policy , the eu would need more additional resources on its own in addition to more financial resources from national budgets , the socialists predict . ",
        "the spd negotiators have looked closely at what cdu/csu had agreed on europe in the jamaica talks with the fdp and the greens . strengthening the economic and monetary union and `` adequate '' investment was mentioned in the protocols . however , at that time , the liberals rejected macron 's proposal for a separate eurozone budget to finance future investment and emergency aid for countries in economic crises . the fdp back then blocked out the sentence saying that even if there was no automatic transfer or debt consolidation , it would still be necessary to cushion emergency situations in individual eu states .
