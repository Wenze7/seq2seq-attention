        "kuala lumpur - the last surviving female sumatran rhino in malaysia is seriously ill , a wildlife official said wednesday , with vets racing to save the critically endangered creature . iman is one of just two sumatran rhinos known to still be alive in malaysia . she lives in a wildlife reserve on borneo island , where she is part of a captive breeding programme with the last surviving male , tam . but the female , who was captured several years ago from a jungle-clad valley , is suffering severe bleeding from a tumour in her uterus , said sabah wildlife department director augustine tuuga . ",
        "she has emerged from her mud wallow at the reserve in sabah state and is being treated by experienced vets , but is only drinking and has refused to eat , he told afp . `` we hope to be able to treat the illness , '' he added . iman has suffered from the same problem before but in the past vets managed to deal with it more easily , tuuga said . in june another female rhino at the same reserve was put down as she was suffering from skin cancer , leaving iman and tam as malaysia 's only surviving sumatran rhinos . ",
        "the smallest of the rhino species and the only asian rhino with two horns , the creatures were declared extinct in the wild in malaysia in 2015 . there are fewer than 100 sumatran rhinos left in the wild in neighbouring indonesia , existing in tiny herds on sumatra island and the indonesian part of borneo . their numbers have fallen dramatically due to the rapid expansion of agricultural plantations , which has devastated their natural jungle habitat , and as they have been increasingly targeted by poachers for their horns and hide . sumatran rhinos are born covered in shaggy , reddish-brown fur , earning them the nickname `` hairy rhino '' .
