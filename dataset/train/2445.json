        "san francisco -- the sexual misconduct allegations that have cut a swath through congress brought down a prominent member of the judicial branch monday with the resignation of alex kozinski , a federal appeals court judge known for his blunt and colorful legal opinions . kozinski , a 67-year-old member and former chief judge of the 9th u. s. circuit court of appeals , the nation 's largest federal appeals court , said in a statement that a battle over the accusations would not be good for the judiciary . he retired , effective immediately . the move came days after the 9th circuit opened a misconduct inquiry following the first in a pair of washington post stories that said 15 women -- some of whom worked for him as law clerks or in other positions -- accused him of groping them , making lewd comments or showing them pornography . ",
        "kozinski , who was known to have a bawdy side well before his resignation , said that while speaking in a `` candid way '' with male and female clerks , he `` may not have been mindful enough of the special challenges and pressures that women face in the workplace . '' `` it grieves me to learn that i caused any of my clerks to feel uncomfortable ; this was never my intent , '' he said . `` for this i sincerely apologize . '' the 9th circuit hears cases from nine western states , including california and arizona , and has been bitterly criticized by president donald trump following rulings that blocked his travel ban against mostly muslim countries . ",
        "some legal experts said kozinski 's resignation may help the judiciary avoid an embarrassing , drawn-out investigation that would damage its reputation and potentially imperil its independence . federal judges are appointed for life and can be removed only by impeachment by congress . the goal is to maintain judicial independence by preventing the easy removal of judges for unpopular decisions . `` i take him at his word that he probably understood that this could be very detrimental to the federal judiciary and to individuals in the judiciary and his colleagues , '' said carl tobias , a professor at the university of richmond school of law . ",
        "it was not clear whether the investigation of kozinski by the judiciary will continue . an email to a 9th circuit spokesman was not immediately returned . complaints against judges rarely result in their forced removal from the bench . but some federal judges have stepped down in recent years amid controversy . mark fuller , a trial judge in alabama , left the bench in 2015 following an allegation that he beat his wife during a fight in a hotel room in atlanta ; and richard roberts , the chief trial judge in washington , d. c. , retired on a medical disability on the same day in 2016 that a woman filed a lawsuit accusing roberts of sexual assault in 1981 . ",
        "the son of holocaust survivors from romania , kozinski was appointed to the appeals court in 1985 when he was in his mid-30s by republican president ronald reagan . he is known as a libertarian . clerkships in his office were prestigious , and many of his clerks landed positions working for u. s supreme court justices . heidi bond , who clerked for kozinski from 2006 to 2007 , told the post she worried that leaving without a good recommendation might ruin her career . bond told the newspaper kozinski called her into his office several times to look at images of naked people , asking her if she thought the pornography was photo-shopped or if it aroused her sexually . ",
        "christine miller , a retired u. s. court of federal claims judge , told the newspaper kozinski grabbed her breasts during a car ride in 1986 after a legal community function in the baltimore area . she said it came after she declined his offer to go to a motel and have sex . on the bench , kozinski was an eccentric . he crammed over 200 movie titles into a 1990 opinion in a lawsuit involving a movie theater chain . in another case , he wrote that lethal injection should be scrapped in favor of the firing squad , saying , `` sure , firing squads can be messy , but if we are willing to carry out executions , we should not shield ourselves from the reality that we are shedding human blood . ",
        "'' `` if we , as a society , can not stomach the splatter from an execution carried out by firing squad , '' he added , `` then we should n't be carrying out executions at all . '' the los angeles times in 2008 reported that kozinski maintained a publicly accessible website of pornography , some of which he defended in an interview to the newspaper as funny . a judicial investigation at the time concluded that kozinski showed poor judgment but had not intended for the material to be seen by the public . he was also accessible and a passionate advocate for the rights of people accused of crimes . ",
        "he often picked up the phone at his chambers and regularly invited members of the legal community to movie screenings -- dubbed `` kozinski 's favorite flicks '' -- that he hosted at the courthouse with food and drinks . allegations of sexual misconduct have toppled powerful men in hollywood , media and politics in recent weeks . three capitol hill politicians have announced their resignations : rep. john conyers , d-mich . , rep. trent franks , r-ariz . , and sen. al franken , d-minn . by sudhin thanawala .
