        "was it a dumb mistake ? you tell me . i am a big-dreamer , and always will be . i am also a creative . i started writing when i was an 11-year old child . in some ways , i am still a child . j. k rowling and dan brown inspired me , and still continue to do so . they 've inspired millions of readers worldwide , whilst amassing millions of dollars in book royalties . to the world , they will always be the definition of writing success . and they had one thing in common . ",
        "they were not poets . throughout the 90s , i 've been drawn in by many writers . roald dahl and enid blyton were my childhood friends . their style of writing drew me in like a bee to honey -- always making me curious ; never satiated . they would 've spent as much time writing poetry as michael jackson would 've spent playing baseball , which is a far cry from ` much ' . before i knew it , my childhood passed me by . my love for writing faded when along with my forgotten schooldays , and my days and hours were replaced with high-intensity book cramming of a medical student 's lifeless life . ",
        "writing was the last thing on my stressful mind . but when my country 's medical schools went on an 8-month nation-wide boycott , my days and hours blew wide open . writing greeted me like an old friend -- the years we 'd spent apart did n't seem to matter to him . so i started writing again , this time online . and i started with poetry , because writing poems always seemed to destress me better than the best pharmaceuticals of the modern-day world . the search for every rhyme and non-rhyme seemed to help me forget my pains . ",
        "it was an easy fix for my problems . whenever i felt my heart ache , poetry always seemed to find me . and i published every poem that i ever wrote , to a jury of online readers . but the internet was crueler than i could 've ever imagined . and my poetry was n't always loved . some of the most moving pieces i 've ever written have been simple pieces of poetry -- long and short . some rhyming , others non-rhyming . some heart-warmingly nostalgic , others heartbreaking . some based on true life events , others as fictitious as harry potter and narnia . ",
        "but they were all creations of my deepest states of consciousness , something that comes much sparingly with my essays and op-eds . because poetry is always about pleasing my own mind . it 's tasteful food for my ageing soul . op-eds and essays are always about pleasing others -- giving back to an insatiable community , continuously hungry for ` productive ' and ` self-improving ' words . i gave in to the world . and with it died my love for poetry . i stopped publishing poetry online . because i had become a prisoner of the internet . ",
        "i 'm a born people-pleaser -- i lived to please others , and the internet took me hostage . with it , i began to forget my inner child . i began to forget what it was like to be creative . i was writing about ` creativity ' and ` inspiration ' , but the original fire that lit my creativity and my inspiration -- my poetry -- was slowly dying away . without knowing it , i had killed my own friend -- a friend that had kept me company through my darkest of days . this went on for months and months , and i began to forget that my friend ever existed . ",
        "then my girlfriend gave me a christmas gift . it was a vintage writing book -- like a replica of an anne frank notebook . it brought back nostalgic memories from when i first watched the notebook , and my mind could n't contain the waves of emotion . within the pages of this book , my girlfriend had scribbled a poem in french . her closing words caressed my heart like no other words could , and transported me back to my own poetry . `` allons ne cesse jamais de crayonnen et d'inspirertes lecteurs innombrables et passion√©s . '' ",
        "english translation : `` come on , never stop pencilling and inspiring , for your readers and enthusiasts , innumerable . '' that was my sign from god to start writing poetry once again . and i used her beautiful gift to start scribbling my random musings , once again . every naked emotion after another . feelings i can keep to myself , without the looming fear of judgement . feelings that the world might not appreciate as much as my girlfriend does . but they are my feelings . and they deserve to be written . so do yours . ",
        "so start writing poetry . because it makes you feel good , and makes your pain go away . at least for a few borrowed moments -- just enough time for your mind to forget what your heart ca n't . poetry is medicine for my soul . poetry is my friend . the time that we spent apart made me realise what i had missed in him . like all good things in life . distance does make the heart grow fonder . thanks for reading . my life is a mission . so is yours . never give up .
