        "people who are flexible , original thinkers show signature forms of connectivity in their brains , study shows ian sample science editor @iansample share on facebook share on twitter share via email share on linkedin share on pinterest share on google + share on whatsapp share on messenger donatella versace finds it in the conflict of ideas , jack white under pressure of deadlines . for william s burroughs , an old dadaist trick helped : cutting pages into pieces and rearranging the words . every artist has their own way of generating original ideas , but what is happening inside the brain might not be so individual . ",
        "in new research , scientists report signature patterns of neural activity that mark out those who are most creative . `` we have identified a pattern of brain connectivity that varies across people , but is associated with the ability to come up with creative ideas , '' said roger beaty , a psychologist at harvard university . `` it 's not like we can predict with perfect accuracy who 's going to be the next einstein , but we can get a pretty good sense of how flexible a given person 's thinking is . '' creative thinking is one of the primary drivers of cultural and technological change , but the brain activity that underpins original thought has been hard to pin down . ",
        "in an effort to shed light on the creative process , beaty teamed up with colleagues in austria and china to scan people 's brains as they came up with original ideas . the scientists asked the volunteers to perform a creative thinking task as they lay inside a brain scanner . while the machine recorded their white matter at work , the participants had 12 seconds to come up with the most imaginative use for an object that flashed up on a screen . three independent scorers then rated their answers . one of the barriers to creative thinking is the ease with which common , unoriginal thoughts swamp the mind . ",
        "some people in the study could not get past these . for example , when asked for creative uses for a sock , soap and chewing gum wrapper , less creative people gave answers such as `` covering the feet '' , `` making bubbles '' and `` containing gum '' respectively . for the same items , more original thinkers suggested a water filtration system , a seal for envelopes , and an antenna wire . reported in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences , the study found distinct patterns of brain activity in the most and least creative people . ",
        "in the highly original thinkers , the scientists saw strong connectivity between three networks of the brain . one , known as the default mode network , is linked to spontaneous thinking and mind wandering , while a second , the executive control network , is engaged when people focus in on their thoughts . the third , called the salience network , helps to work out what best deserves our attention . the first two of these three brain networks tend to work against one another , beaty said , each dampening the other down . but the scans suggest that more creative people can better engage both networks at once . ",
        "`` it might be easier for creative thinkers to bring these resources to bear simultaneously , '' he said . initial scans on men and women from the university of north carolina were backed up by further scans in austrian and chinese volunteers . to make sure enough creative people took part in the study , the researchers recruited plenty of artists , musicians and scientists . now , beaty wants to look at brain activity in different creative pursuits , such as the arts and sciences , and investigate whether training helps boost creative powers . in 2016 , david melcher , who studies creativity at the university of trento , identified brain networks used in visual art . ",
        "`` a critical open question , for future research , is whether this ability to put the brain in creative mode transfers across tasks , '' he said . `` do we learn to network our brain regions for creativity in new domains once we learn to do it , for example , in painting or freestyle rap ? '' `` there has been an educational policy , in many countries including the us , of reducing teaching hours in the arts and focusing instead on rote learning for yearly testing of basic knowledge , '' he added . `` we need to understand whether creativity is a transferable skill , a way of using the brain that students learn to use across fields .
