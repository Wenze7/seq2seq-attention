        "behind every interface , there 's a designer . more like a team of them . and those designers have a lot to consider : what should siri sound like ? what kinds of things will people ask alexa to do ? how will users expect the kuri robot to respond when they crack a joke ? we have become accustomed to relating to these interfaces , and increasingly they are able to relate to us -- taking in the world around them , talking to their users , and even inferring our emotions from how our faces change shape . ",
        "i call this layer an affective user interface , a term borrowed from the field of affective computing . affective computing is a field of computer science that develops technology that we might consider intelligent and emotionally aware . these new interfaces present a slew of opportunities and challenges because , as dr. cynthia breazeal of the mit media lab points out in her book designing sociable robots , when a technology `` behaves in a socially competent manner , '' our evolutionary hardwiring causes us to interact with it as if it were human . and once we enter into that relationship , the personas we design for these bots affect our behavior , too . ",
        "i 've heard many people say that unassertive bots often bring out the worst in kids . when there are no social checks on rudeness -- bots do n't tattle , after all -- children tend to be more blunt , and can even become abusive . that lack of assertiveness also affects adults . reporter leah fessler researched how female-gendered bots respond to sexual harassment . it turns out that the assistants ' permissive personas can reinforce some disturbing stereotypes about women , and allow the user free reign to degrade them at will . if bots can have a gender , i started to wonder whether they might also have a cultural or even racial identity . ",
        "considering the fact that these products allow us to choose between various accents , it would seem that designers have created nationalities for our bots . i 'm certainly not the first person to surface these issues . this new york times piece by ai now 's kate crawford on how `` artificial intelligence 's white guy problem '' comes to mind . and there are many people here at ideo who are thinking through what it means to be inclusive human-centered designers as we work on augmented intelligence projects . to explore this further , i decided to conduct an experiment to surface the personality of these bots by interviewing them . ",
        "the key was to ask soft questions : where are you from ? how old are you ? do you have any kids ? what do you look like ? even , tell me a story . these interactions were not actionable queries , and thus triggered purely conversational responses that revealed the `` personality '' that the bots ' creators had designed . i recorded a video interview with each voice assistant and handed these over to a number of illustrators commissioned via the social gig site fiverr . while a few of the artists had previous exposure to the bots , i was able to source english-speaking international artists in markets where alexa and/or siri were not available . ",
        "countries of origin included indonesia , pakistan , ukraine , venezuela , the philippines , and the us . for many of them , my videos were their first meaningful exposure . here are the images that came back : gender came through clearly , but i would also argue that none of the illustrations depict a person of color . whether they were intentionally designed that way is not the issue . if users perceive the bots this way , what kind of cultural pressures are they carrying into the home ? it 's something i think about a lot as a first-generation american who has worked in and around tech throughout my career . ",
        "on my father 's side , i 'm the second us-born family member , and on my mom 's side , i 'm the first . i grew up in a diverse community , and the tapestry of cultures i experienced was simply normal , everyday life . i was aware of code-switching pretty early on ; many of my friends and family had their normal voice and their `` professional '' voice , and they chose which to use in different environments . looking back , i first learned about it when my mom gave a wedding speech . ",
        "my brother was shocked ; he did n't recognize the voice that he heard . i had to explain to him this was my mother 's work voice . code-switching is n't inherently bad -- we all do it to some degree -- but if we 're to design affective user interfaces that are truly human-centered , then we must consider that for some , the switch requires more effort . if users perceive the bots this way , what kind of cultural pressures are they carrying into the home ? inclusivity is not just an issue at the bleeding edge of tech . ",
        "we 're seeing a growing body of evidence that those who speak outside of mainstream vernaculars have a harder time being properly recognized by affective systems . this represents an accessibility challenge , but one that is resultant from a cultural rather than physical challenge . in a tech industry that is known to be monocultural , we must take steps to ensure our affective systems are not just designed to be useful to their creators , but inclusive of the full spectrum of people their products will serve . because ultimately what 's at stake is trust . studies have shown that when brands lose trust , they lose customers . ",
        "as designers , it 's our job to expand the usability of our affective devices to ensure they serve the rich tapestry of people , cultures , and vernaculars they will encounter . beyond being good design , it 's good for business , because in our affective future , the products that win will be the ones that users trust . we welcome your comments at ideas@qz . com . learn how to write for quartz ideas . this post originally appeared on ideo .
