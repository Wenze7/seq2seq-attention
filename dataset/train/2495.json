        "in light of the many high-profile news stories involving sexual harassment , employers are cognizant of the need to update policies , improve investigation procedures , and conduct training . however , there is more going on than meets the eye . several states have proposed legislation that creates a path for victims to come forward . in addition , the new federal tax law also impacts how an employer will evaluate sexual harassment claims . in new york and south carolina , proposed bills would prevent employers from requiring employees to bring sexual-harassment complaints to binding arbitration . the bills aim to prevent employees from having to use a typically confidential arbitration process . ",
        "another bill was introduced in new york that prevents harassment settlements from including a nondisclosure provision -- stripping employers of the ability to keep issues confidential between the employer and employee . other proposed state legislation include : new jersey -- a bill seeks to prevent employees from executing a release that waives the right to discuss workplace discrimination or harassment . california -- a bill proposes that would prevent nondisclosure agreements from being included in sexual harassment and sex discrimination settlements . pennsylvania -- a bill would render unenforceable contracts barring victims from reporting harassment or naming a harasser . ",
        "finally , the new federal tax cut and jobs act adds another layer onto an employer 's sexual harassment settlement considerations . under the new law , any settlement or payment attributable to sexual harassment or sexual abuse -- as well as the attorney fees related to such settlement or payment -- are not deductible if the settlement is subject to a nondisclosure agreement . an employer now must choose between a nondisclosure clause and tax deductibility when negotiating settlements of a sexual harassment or sexual abuse claims . by putting pressure on employers to avoid nondisclosure clauses , congress hopes that fewer claims will be kept silent thereby encouraging additional claims to be asserted . ",
        "and , this brings us back to where we started -- increased awareness and training is critical .   "
