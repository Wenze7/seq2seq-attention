        "it was n't expected a freshman qb would lead alabama football to its 17th national championship . but it happened . and now , a new era of alabama offense that should scare sec defenses next year and years to come . the morning of the championship game , i 'm sitting down with breakfast . i 'm watching espnu , air alabama football and georgia , 2012 sec championship game . who could forget the georgia dome , the dumb play that caused georgia to lose or aaron murray getting absolutely whopped all over again by ha-ha clinton dix ? ",
        ". icymi : nfl early entries and coaching changeswhat i had forgotten was the alabama football offensive system at that time . it was all about ground-and-pound . it relied on backfield talent instead of a spread . i saw players like eddie lacy and t. j. yeldon run right through the georgia secondary for first down after first down . a. j. mccarron was behind center at the time and , while he got some looks on offense , it was all about that run game . we fast forward to the 2017 season and offensive coordinator brian daboll 's first year . ",
        "he had to work with a qb in jalen hurts who was built to work in a lane kiffin , jet-sweep-forever offense . jalen is talented , sure . but daball 's pro-style offense is quite a jump from where jalen was with kiffin . the alabama football 2017 offense was n't inept , but it certainly was n't thriving either . it left people yearning for that ground-and-pound offense again . the reason daboll was brought in was realized in the second half of the 2018 college football playoff national championship . welcome to the new alabama offenseafter backup , true freshman tua tagovailoa came under center after halftime , the results were almost instantaneous . ",
        "after getting beat up in the first drive , tua got comfortable . suddenly , alabama was throwing deep balls and opening up the playbook , something they did n't do at all with jalen . or tua would execute quick passes to get short to medium gains . tua was letting go of the ball quickly in those scenarios and read the entire field like he was aaron rodgers at lambeau . he made mincemeat of a georgia defense that was bringing pain in the first half . it 's certainly uncommon of a nick saban team to make drastic moves like a qb change , but it was necessary . ",
        "alabama was n't going to win with hurts struggling and a limited playbook . the entire team , press box and even both locker rooms knew that . but what you saw was just a beginning . tua is clearly the right qb to fit daboll 's offense . he 's got the talent , the un-measurables and the character to lead this team to more championships . no offense to jalen is intended . he 's got a lot of character . but the message is clear . tua just fits better . it certainly would n't be the first pro-style offense to be implemented in the sec . ",
        "but i 'd argue it 's likely one with the best qb 's behind center . that should scare a lot of sec teams . just ask the defense coached by defensive guru kirby smart . they were shredded by it . next : the tide , not the dawgs , was the team of destinythe ground-and-pound offense at alabama is officially dead . it 's a new era of alabama offense and the world needs to be on watch . supplemented by the already incredible defense , 2018 is looking bright for alabama . more from bama hammer alabama football : lots of changes for the tide in players and coaches2h ago alabama basketball : tide moves to 10-6 with home win over south carolina19h ago alabama football : the tide , not the dawgs was the team of destiny1 d ago alabama football : nick saban delivers career best coaching performance1 d ago alabama football : bama defense woke up to win national championship1 d ago it was n't expected a freshman qb would lead alabama football to its 17th national championship .
