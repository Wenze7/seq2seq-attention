        "environment secretary michael gove has set a vision for uk agriculture that will abandon current eu subsidy mechanisms over the coming years and which will involve radical changes to the department for environment , food and rural affairs current regulation and inspection practices . speaking at an agricultural conference in oxfordshire , gove previewed policies expected to be detailed in a spring command paper , and praised his `` dedicated , idealistic and passionate '' staff but not the `` far too bureaucratic '' processes they currently worked to . defra is one of the departments most affected by the uk 's decision to leave the european union , and a recent national audit office snapshot of brexit-related activity across whitehall showed it had 43 separate workstreams on the issue . ",
        "last month it emerged that barely of the 1,200 brexit-related roles it hoped to fill by march had been taken . in his speech today , gove spelled out that defra faced a long period of change for which brexit was only the beginning . `` i do n't want anyone to get hold of the wrong end of the stick , '' gove said . `` the department i am privileged to lead has some of the finest public servants in the country working for it . `` whether it 's the policy professionals , economic analysts , vets , it engineers , botanists and horticulturalists or hydrologists and geologists , it is a pleasure to work with such dedicated , idealistic and passionate people . ",
        "`` but while the people are brilliant , some of the processes are not . `` while he sought to assure farmers that the eu subsidies they currently received would continue in the medium term , he insisted that change was vital both for defra and the sector . gove also predicted that some farmers may seek to leave the industry as the basic payments scheme - the eu 's largest subsidy to farmers - was wound down post-brexit . `` i want to develop a new method of providing financial support for farmers which moves away from subsidies for inefficiency to public money for public good , '' gove saidhe said he envisaged guaranteeing bps payments continued for a transition period in england that `` should last a number of years beyond the implementation period '' , depending on the outcome of a yet-to-be-launched consultation . ",
        "however the environment secretary said the largest bps payments made to farmers in england would be reduced throughout the period , while compliance with some of the current `` onerous '' eu requirements for the payments would not be enforced . he conceded that the change in subsidy regime may prompt some farmers to leave the industry , and that defra would look at ways to support them . defra - and more precisely its rural payments agency - has been strongly criticised for delays in distributing bps funds to farmers in recent years . gove said he was `` encouraged but not satisfied '' that the rpa had paid more than 91 % of farmers their bps entitlement for the year by the end of december . ",
        "`` i am looking for a new chair of the rpa to work with the chief executive and his team to drive further improvement , '' he said . elsewhere in his speech , gove said defra would need to change its approach to inspection following brexit , and freedom from common agricultural policy rules . `` we inspect too often , too ineffectively and in far too many cases for the wrong things , '' he said . `` at any moment , a farmer could be visited by the rural payments agency , natural england , the animal plant and health agency , the environment agency or their local authority . ",
        "`` each body may ask for slightly different information , or even the same information in a slightly different way . `` gove said he wanted to explore ways the number of inspections faced by farmers could be reduced at the same time as making them `` more genuinely risk-based '' and focused on areas where standards were not currently high enough . `` the cap 's inflexibilities , including the ever present fear of disallowance , means we inspect rigidly for precise field margin dimensions and the exact locations of trees in a near-pointless exercise in bureaucratic box-ticking while , at the same time , we inspect haphazardly and inefficiently for genuine lapses such as poor slurry management or inadequate animal welfare , '' he said . ",
        "gove said he also wanted to develop a `` single , scaled measure '' of how individual farmers performed against a `` sensible basket of indicators '' that brought together soil health , pollution-control , animal welfare and contribution to water quality . `` there are already a number of ways in which farmers can secure recognition for high animal welfare or environmental standards from the red tractor scheme to the leaf mark , '' he said . `` outside the eu , we could establish a measure of farm and food quality which would be world-leading .
