        "one of the biggest challenges that small business owners face is staying motivated . when you were working your standard 9 to 5 you had a routine , and someone to hold you accountable , for showing up each and every day and doing your job . it 's a lot easier to convince yourself to work when you know your boss is watching . now that you 've quit your day job to chase your daydream , it can become challenging to keep pushing through your to-do list , especially once the lustre of that daydream starts to fade a bit and become more `` work '' than you envisioned . ",
        "on pushing through , adda birnir , founder of skillcrush , said , `` one of the most important things i have learned is that businesses do n't fail , entrepreneurs give up . now sometimes , giving up is the right decision . but usually you just need to dig in and figure out how to make things better . remember : every day is a new opportunity to get up and do it better than yesterday ! '' so , what can we do to keep the skip in our step , and keep pushing forward ? taking your to-do list to a to-done listconsider reframing how you look at what has been achieved . ",
        "while we love the to-do list as a way to keep things moving , think about how motivating it could be at the end of each day to list out all that you 've done , rather than what is yet to do ? spending a few minutes at the end of each work day , or even in the middle of each work day , to write down what you 've accomplished will make you realize you 're not just swimming in the fish bowl year after year , you 're getting somewhere , and you 're spending your time doing what matters . ",
        "you can also look at efficient office solutions like greetly to take some of these mundane tasks and simplify them , giving you even more time to focus on what really matters -- in the business or your personal life . theme your daysjack dorsey , ceo of both square and twitter , says `` the way i found that works for me is i theme my days . on monday , at both companies , i focus on management and running the company ... tuesday is focused on product . wednesday is focused on marketing and communications and growth . ",
        "thursday is focused on developers and partnerships . friday is focused on the company and the culture and recruiting . saturday i take off , i hike . sunday is reflection , feedback , strategy , and getting ready for the week . '' while not everyone is stretched as thin as mr. dorsey , it 's easy to understand why he believes in theme-ing his days . what happens when you create headspace for each important item that is going to move your business forward ? you instantly see progress , you have the discipline and focus that you need , and you keep yourself motivated . ",
        "consider adopting a similar schedule , and plot out your week , or a few key days , to build that theme and routine for yourself and for your business . you may even see themed days have a halo effect on the rest of your team and coworkers , increasing their motivation and efficiency , too . build a kick-butt playlistwhen you 're out on a run and need to kick it up a notch , or when you 're at the gym and need the extra push to stay motivated , you switch songs and find one that picks you up . ",
        "why not apply that to your workday routine ? putting on your headphones and blocking out the extra distractions can also help you focus , which therefore can get those motivational juices flowing . in a shared workspace or office environment , a solid soundtrack may also improve the mood of your employees , and therefore increase productivity . so when all else fails , it 's time to pump up the tunes and put on your motivation playlist . tell us , when the work becomes mundane , or when the adulting just becomes hard , what do you do to stay motivated ?

        "and , most important , what could we offer you with greetly to help you stay motivated ?   "
