        "have you ever had an request that you could not refuse . for example , your boss tells you that you have to work overtime and you can not say no . or maybe your parents want you to marry some guy , but you do n't want to be his wife . these things happen when there is an imbalance of authority . sometimes you can solve the problem by yourself , but it can not always be solved by one person only . as a result , people ask for help from lawyers . nonetheless , the law does not always address the current social situation and so it becomes necessary to consult the public sphere by means of the media . ",
        "the public sphere generally is conceived as the social space in which different opinions are expressed , problems of general concern are discussed , and collective solutions are developed communicatively . the government can not ignore this public sphere , and so it will consider introducing new laws as a result . for instance , there were no laws to resolve the problem of bullying in japan . but after journalists started to report this problem , people became interested in this topic and , as a result , the government introduced legal reforms with regards to bullying . the idea of journalism is based on the idea of reformism . ",
        "this means the nation debates an issue , shares information , exchanges views , and discovers what it would be best . on the other hand , mass media is the way to disseminate information as much as possible and to grab people 's attention . generally , journalism is the aspect of mass media that solves problems by informing as many people as possible about a particular issue . journalism plays an important role in mass media , and therefore many people can not distinguish between the two . nonetheless , they do n't have the same purpose . ",
        "given the fact that they do n't have the same purpose and that they no longer have the funding they have been used to , journalists now need to redefine their mission . these days , journalists look for alternatives outside of mass media . in fact , acclaimed journalists now work almost entirely outside of what has been defined traditionally as mass media . to give an example , the international consortium of investigative journalists , which found out the panama papers and the paradice papers , is non-government organization .
