        "sunday december 31 , 2017 very early one morning this fall , all the power in the house went out . it was off all day . bumping around with a flashlight , i found the only radio that worked . a fifty-dollar portable with a couple of aa batteries lightened our ignorance and reassured us that outside all was right in the darkened streets . radio can do that . it has an almost luminous power to eviscerate darkness . and it has been a central part of my life since the dim days of childhood , almost beyond the reach of memory . ",
        "in our apartment , every room had its radio . the table radio in the kitchen was always on . the stand-up console in the living room was for family listening , always on for foster hewitt and hockey night in canada . and the six-o'clock news . before our first television , radio defined the outer limits of my universe . it was a life preserver , an escape hatch , a third parent , instructing , comforting , entertaining and above all distracting . there was something magical in the phrase `` on the air , '' an evanescent moment which i could lock into my imagination . ",
        "a voice is a human gift , says the writer margaret atwood , and through the voices of the men and women on the radio , worlds offered themselves to me . before budget cuts killed cbc radio drama , i came , through plays and poetry , to understand the urgent human need for storytelling , and the transcending power of the perfect sentence . radio kills distance . it shrinks time into manageable components . at its core is connection . it puts us in touch with one another . it is personal , it is immediate , it is intimate . ",
        "it is there to comfort when we hurt or tease , and distract when we relax . it is there when we need to know . it is family . it is the community meeting place in the towns and villages of newfoundland , manitoba , saskatchewan , the north . it is the newcomer 's great companion in the unforgiving city . radio , the cbc 's kind of radio , can not be wallpaper . it has to be engaged . watching television is a passive behaviour . radio demands attention and compels involvement . in the course of broadcasting a thousand radio programs , you pick up a few things . ",
        "one is the fierce loyalty of the audience . i once had a letter from a minister in saskatchewan saying he might move his 10 a. m. sunday service to the parking lot , where many of his congregation were listening to the program in their cars . we also learned that listeners will gravitate toward the unpredictable . surprise is premium currency . over the years , various executive producers have built the program on three pillars ; music , conversation and quality documentaries . plus weekly scribblings from this corner . we hope to continue that tradition as we embark on our second millennium . ",
        "the chinese , who have a proverb for everything , say , `` the tongue paints what the eyes can not see . '' you have paid for the brushes and the pallet in trust . we will , i hope , paint our pictures wisely , on your behalf . click ` listen ' above to hear the essay .   "
