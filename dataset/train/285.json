        "kenneth branagh starred in harry potter and the chamber of secrets as gilderoy lockhart . but why did n't he ever direct one of the harry potter movies ? one of the most dramatic directors of our time , kenneth branagh is pretty incredible . so why did he never direct a harry potter movie ? if you have n't seen any of his work , let me tell you that it is the pinnacle of drama in the best possible way . he has a flair for the theatrics like no other and it comes across beautifully in his work .

        "which probably would have translated really well to one of the harry potter films . to be quite honest , i do n't know why they did n't have him direct harry potter and the chamber of secrets . it 'd have made sense . so instead , we now live in a world where kenneth branagh never got to take a shot at directing one of harry 's many adventures . but who knows , maybe he 'll make a fantastic beasts and where to find them or when they finally figure out what they want to do with it , he can direct harry potter and the cursed child if they ever make it into a movie . ",
        "for now , we just have to hope that he will someday return to the series that brought him into many of our worlds and see what he 'd do with directing . i personally think that it 'd be incredible to see and , who knows , maybe he 'd somehow bring gilderoy lockhart back into the world . even if he did go crazy there at the end . do you think that kenneth branagh would have made an incredible harry potter movie ? do you think it 'd be good or a little too out there ?
