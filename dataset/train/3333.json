        "street kids climbed into carlile house one winter and lit a fire that got out of control . you can see the evidence on a blackened wall as you step inside . after the fire , a razor wire fence was installed out the front of the grey lynn building . no one goes in any more , and the entrance stays padlocked . the rubbish from the squatters remains . beer bottles , old office chairs drawn into circles that suggest late-night drinking sessions , and graffiti scrawled almost everywhere . `` these violent delights have violent ends , '' is painted on the wall of a room that once served as an orphanage kitchen . ",
        "you can see where the kids ripped 132-year-old timber balustrades out of a stairwell to light their fire . they even ripped up some floorboards . read more : james prescott , deputy chair of the united church of tonga which owns the building , has become its reluctant caretaker . he knows a bit of the history , and can remember a time the church used it as accommodation for easter camps . these days carlile house has no purpose at all , and prescott says a stalemate with auckland council means it can neither be repaired nor demolished . ",
        "he shows the odd visitor inside , trying different keys in the padlock like a warden opening a neglected tomb . `` it 's a beautiful old building , '' he tells us . `` most of the rooms have fireplaces . why those kids did n't use one to build their bloody fire , i do n't know . '' for some reason , local folklore about the former orphanage is riddled with fires . an urban legend - completely false - describes a blaze that killed 43 children there in 1912 . supposedly a neglected candle set curtains alight in the dorms of the orphanage . ",
        "on a quiet night with the right ears , believers say , you can still hear the children crying for help as you round the bend on richmond road where the building keeps its sad vigil . the tale prescott has heard is different . he speaks of a nurse burned to death in a fire while trying to rescue orphans . `` i have never seen this , but people do talk about the nurse that was burnt re-appearing . '' both versions of the story are likely just that . stories . there 's no public record of a fatal fire here . ",
        "it seems local residents , mystified by the building for decades , have filled in the blanks themselves . prescott says , `` it looks like the sort of place that would be haunted , and given that there was apparently a tragedy here many decades ago , it would fuel that sort of talk . '' the design is late victorian , with a columned entryway and arched window openings that are mostly boarded up . the facade is tombstone grey . it was built 132 years ago and has stood empty for decades . it has been an orphanage , a headquarters for evangelical christians , a remand house , a secondary school and a hostel for tongan workers . ",
        "prescott leads us through vast corridors , with original timber floors and panelled walls . some of the rooms are pitch dark , and others are awash in bands of sunlight where the boardings have come off . the fittings are surprisingly well preserved , despite exposure to the elements through a couple of gaping windows . the flooring is safe , even on the upper level . the foundations are sound , too . it has a grand and cavernous feeling , with high ceilings and impressive staircases that mirror each other , the building consisting of two symmetrical wings . ",
        "in one the upstairs washrooms , you can see a row of sinks that must have been used by the children . the building was an orphanage for 50 years , first a training academy for boys and later a home for children of both sexes . it began as a bold experiment , thanks to a bequest left by a wealthy auckland business man , edward costley . designed as a live-in academy for boys , it was built as the costley training institution in 1886 . the privately funded institution went out on a limb from the government and catholic industrial schools of the time . ",
        "it was a place where 25 boys judged to be disadvantaged but of good character , were hand-picked to live and learn a trade . the site was located in the working-class subdivision of surrey hills , which still had a semi-rural character , with much of the land used for stock grazing . the two-storey brick building with stone detailing was built in the classical-italianate style . on completion it stood behind a low brick wall with cast iron railings , a monument to costley 's objective of helping underprivileged young men where public funds could not . the boys , referred to as `` inmates , '' lived regimented lives , doing housework and gardening , attending church and learning carpentry and gymnastics . ",
        "the experiment did n't last long . the institute was soon in financial trouble , and despite a government subsidy and appeals for public donations , it was closed in 1908 . an article in the evening post from that year also hinted at deeper issues , saying difficulty had been experienced `` in getting suitable boys as inmates '' . new policies favoured boarding out boys , rather than committing them to an institution where `` boys of mature years are brought into close connection with young boys , '' the article said . `` the class of boys received , moreover , is frequently unfitted for apprenticeship to trades , and to withstand the temptations of city life . '' ",
        "the building was sold and taken over shortly afterwards as an anglican children 's home . the government 's education department was closing its institutions in favour of fostering , but churches were still interested in orphanage care . the home was founded by a nun called sister cecil and at its peak in the 1920s , eighty children lived there . most of the kids were aged under 10 and due to a low number of staff , they did much of the housework . a chapel was built on the property in sister cecil 's memory after her death in 1912 . ",
        "more than a century later , the former chapel - now part of a larger church - remains a place of worship for the united church of tonga . by the late 1920s , more stringent controls were introduced around child welfare , and the children 's home closed in 1930 . in 1935 the building was given its contemporary name , carlile house , and made the headquarters of an evangelical anglican group called the church army . guests took residential training courses there , to represent the church within the armed forces during world war two . after the church moved out around 1969 , the building was briefly leased to the department of social welfare as a remand home . ",
        "it also served as an alternative secondary school in the early 1970s . the church army sold the property to the tonga development and agency company in 1977 . the country 's pacific island population had grown rapidly as people arrived on temporary permits to learn trades and undertake tertiary study . as the tongan community in grey lynn blossomed , carlile house served as a hostel for those coming to new zealand on temporary work schemes . in 1978 the chapel built for sister cecil , which seated 100 , was redeveloped into a church accommodating 300 worshippers . ",
        "it was dedicated to the late tongan queen , sƒÅlote tupou iii . it was the city 's first tongan church . the neighbouring carlile house gradually became decrepit and vandalised as a lack of finance hampered plans for its full re-use . the property was cross-leased and transferred to the united church of tonga in new zealand trust board in 1990 . it has been falling into disrepair for the past 40 years . prescott estimates it would cost $ 10 million to bring the building back up to liveable standard . much of that money would need to come from auckland council ; the church has indicated it could cover some , but not all of the cost . ",
        "`` for the sake of just restoring and keeping a bit of heritage for auckland , we 're not prepared to do that , '' he says . `` we 're not prepared to spend 10 million just for heritage reasons , when knocking it down and putting up a $ 2 million hall , with gym facilities for the kids , would be much more functional . '' the building is protected from being demolished , but prescott says council has n't been forthcoming with any money to repair it . one option is for the church to legally challenge the building 's protected status . ",
        "`` we 're at stalemate at the moment because of the funding issues . all the while , the weather 's chipping away at it , and the place is locked off . it 's of no use to us at the moment . '' council 's heritage manager , noel reardon , confirms carlile house is protected via scheduling in the unitary plan , and says the building `` played a significant part in auckland 's early development '' . he says council has been in talks with the church for a `` number of years '' over the building 's future . ",
        "`` these discussions have canvassed a range of options , including council purchasing the building to assist the church with redevelopment and restoration plans , '' says reardon . `` we last met with representatives of the church last thursday . however , no decisions on the building 's future have yet been made . '' we ask prescott : would he really knock the building down ? he responds that he 's got a big piece of footprint land on his hands that is n't being used . the building , he adds , remains a fire hazard ; he 's worried more kids will sneak in there . ",
        "`` i like historical buildings but i do n't have $ 10 million . at a toss , which one would i choose ? i 'd probably go for knocking it down . turning it into something more usable . `` if the heritage value is that important to auckland , then auckland can pay for some of it . ''   "
