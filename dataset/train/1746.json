        "it is the most intense , critically-acclaimed role of her career , but diane kruger hardly had to act at all to play a grief-stricken woman robbed of her family in a bombing . kruger was filming `` in the fade '' -- fatih akin 's german thriller about a woman who seeks revenge on the neo-nazis who killed her husband and son -- when she was told her stepfather had died . wolfgang bieneck -- her mother 's longtime partner since kruger 's parents divorced when she was a teenager -- had been a crucial part of her life , often pictured with her on the red carpet . ",
        "she channeled her grief into the role . `` i felt like i was drowning in sorrow and grief . it just felt like there was no way out , ever , '' the german-born 41-year-old , best known for blockbusters such as `` troy '' and `` inglourious basterds , '' told afp . `` in the fade '' was filmed chronologically , allowing kruger to tap into her character 's fluctuating state of mind , and her own fraught emotions were heightened by visiting grieving relatives of real-life murder victims . `` i never felt like that tension , those feelings , like i could push them aside at night , or on weekends , '' kruger told said in an interview at the plush four seasons hotel in beverly hills . ",
        "kruger 's work as the tattooed , drug-taking katja has earned her critical acclaim and the best actress award at the cannes film festival in may . on monday , the movie was nominated for best foreign language film at the golden globes , and three days later it was named among nine overseas films advancing to the next round of voting in the oscars . - ` dream director ' - kruger was on the cannes jury in 2012 when she met akin , an acclaimed german-turkish auteur known for hits such as `` head on '' and `` edge of heaven , '' at a beach party . ",
        "`` he was definitely my dream director , i 'd seen all of his movies . i went up to him and said , ` if you ever have anything , please remember me . ' it took five years but he did , '' she said . kruger moved to hamburg a few months before shooting , contributing to the casting process and meeting two dozen people who had lost a loved one , mostly families of murder victims , in special workshops . `` it was an experience that i did n't quite understand when i first started going there -- how much it would affect me and my personal life , '' she recalled . ",
        "`` as the months went by -- i think i went for about six months leading up to shooting -- it 's even hard to describe the horror , desperation , loss , anger , the rage that people feel . `` kruger says she would feel intrusive at first probing grieving relatives for details about their experiences , but soon learned she needed simply to `` sit there and listen and just observe , and allow myself to feel . `` kruger , born diane heidkrueger in what was then west germany , left home as a teenager for paris , quickly landing catwalk jobs for marc jacobs and dolce and gabbana and print ad campaigns for yves saint laurent and chanel . ",
        "hollywood beckoned , and she got her break as helen in wolfgang petersen 's 2004 swords-and-sandals epic `` troy '' co-starring with brad pitt and orlando bloom . - ` intimacy ' - kruger went on to star as a german actress turned allied spy in quentin tarantino 's `` inglourious basterds , '' winning plaudits for her channeling of marlene dietrich for the role . her diverse resume includes roles in time-travel adventure `` national treasure : book of secrets '' and as the wife of a south african prison guard who befriends nelson mandela in `` goodbye bafana . ",
        "`` she played a us homicide cop in the fx series `` the bridge '' and has demonstrated her french language skills in films such as benoit jacquot 's erotically-charged historical epic `` farewell , my queen . `` kruger saw `` in the fade '' -- her first role in her native german -- alone in a screening room and again 10 days later at the cannes world premiere , an experience she describes as `` overwhelming . '' `` i was really , really stressed out and it 's my first really big starring role . i 'm in every frame of the film , so if people did n't like it that was definitely on me , '' kruger said . ",
        "the actress says she felt `` a real sense of connection '' with the audience , however . `` there are plenty of movies about bombs and terrorists , but it was the intimacy of this film , the small details that grief and death bring into one 's life , that i found so moving and emotional , '' she said . `` i believe it 's what connects this film to a global audience , because we can all identify with that . `` magnolia pictures is giving `` in the fade '' an awards-qualifying run at select us theaters this month and a nationwide rollout next year .
