        "hundreds of flying foxes have perished during australia 's searingly hot summer , according to environmentalists . shocked campaigners were confronted by the sight of scores of dead animals , and claimed the creatures were `` boiled alive '' in the heat . some flying foxes were still hanging from trees as they died , in a shock mass death which campaigners called `` dreadful and heartbreaking '' . the help save the wildlife and bushlands in campbelltown campaign wrote on facebook that temperatures hit over 44c in the campbelltown district of sydney , and that over 400 of the animals died . ",
        "sydney reached a nearly 80-year temperature high of 47.3 c on sunday . the campaign wrote : `` so many little lives lost due to the extreme heat and not enough canopy cover to shade them or keep them cool . `` adults sought out shade and more shelter further up the creek resulting in many babies being left behind to deal with the heat . `` people who live in the area are being urged to watch out for flying foxes which may be suffering heat stress , as those which are often move further to the ground , and to call local wildlife rescue services . ",
        "volunteer cate ryan told local media : `` it was unbelievable . i saw a lot of dead bats on the ground and others were close to the ground and dying . i have never seen anything like it before . `` a local wildlife rescue group advised : `` if the flying-fox is on the ground and it 's a hot day , you can place a cool towel or umbrella above it until the rescuer arrives to protect it from the the worst of the heat . spraying the animal intermittently with a very light mist or setting up a sprinkler to gently wet the animal can also help . ",
        "`` flying foxes are big bats and eat nectar , pollen and fruit . unlike smaller bats , they do not use sonar and instead , like humans , use their eyes and ears . the help save the wildlife and bushlands in campbelltown campaign said `` flying foxes are intelligent and remarkable . these unique animals help regenerate our forests and keep ecosystems healthy through pollination and seed dispersal . they are a migratory and nomadic ` keystone ' species ; meaning a species that many other species of plants and animals rely upon for their survival and wellbeing . ",
        "flying foxes , like bees , help drive biodiversity , and faced with the threat of climate change , land clearing , and other human-caused ecological pressures , we need them more than ever . `` the australian heatwave featured temperatures which melted the bitumen on the highway , as well as sparking bushfires which politicians warned were a danger to life .
