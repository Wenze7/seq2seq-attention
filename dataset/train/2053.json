        "in a city famous for street food , a roadside restaurant in bangkok with plastic tables and simple but sumptuous fare has earned one of the dining scene 's highest honours : a michelin star . jay fai , named after the 72-year-old proprietor who took over from her father , is located in old bangkok and features an open-air kitchen known for churning out crab omelettes and curries . though classified as street food , jay fai is more expensive than your average roadside stall , with a typical speciality costing upwards of $ 20 . it was the only streetside establishment listed in michelin 's first-ever bangkok guide released on wednesday , which said the thai capital 's culinary scene was as `` diverse as it is surprising '' . ",
        "a total of 17 restaurants in the city serving up a mix of thai and international cuisine received either one or two stars , though none clinched the coveted three-star rating . jay fai cooks the food herself while wearing large goggles to deal with the endless steam from the dishes . the accolade was a welcome one even if the owner was not so familiar with the company behind it . `` before , i knew the michelin name but i did not know it had to do with cooking , '' she told afp after obtaining the star . ",
        "`` i am very proud , '' she said , adding that she must be back in the kitchen thursday . `` we do not have a lot of staff because i 'm a bit difficult and crazy . `` jay fai 's newfound stature comes at a tough time for food stalls in bangkok . city officials , backed by the military government , are attempting to unclutter the streets by pushing vendors into hawker centres as in singapore .
