        "the value of reading & writingmost of my content online is focused around speaking and listening . however , it can also be very useful to do writing practice , especially since it can have a positive impact on your speaking ability . for example , below you will see a screen shot of a short text i sent to my mandarin teacher . it 's a story about a boy who makes a snowman . story translation . a long time ago , there was a person named dawei . his favourite hobby was making snowmen . one day dawei decided to build a very big snowman , so he spent his entire weekend doing so . ",
        "unfortunately , a problem arose : the temperature rose on monday and his snowman melted . what a shame ! dawei was not only sad , but also angry . the reason he felt this way was was that he did n't have time to show his mom and dad his snowman before it melted . although it melted , dawei still told his parents his story . his parents told him : you should have checked the weather beforehand ! in this text , i specifically made a point to use as much new vocabulary as possible . for instance , one week before this lesson my teacher had told me about the word 雪人 which means `` snowman '' . ",
        "seeing as i live in canada , which has a cold winter , i thought that this was an important word to remember . as a result , i included it a variety of times in my story to reduce the chances of forgetting it . this repetition activity has now etched `` 雪人 '' into my brain and i am able to use it in spoken speech with ease . a couple of other words and phrases phrases i went out of my way to incorporate into my story were `` although '' , `` not only ... but also '' , and `` the reason he felt this way was ... '' . ",
        "the other aspect i love about writing practice is that you can catch minor mistakes that are often missed when doing speaking practice . when you 're talking , native speakers will not always correct you . in addition , sometimes conversations move at a very fast pace and native speakers do n't even notice that you said something incorrectly . because of this , you can often repeat the same errors without ever realizing it . doing writing practice is an effective strategy to eliminate some of these habitual mistakes seeing as you can analyze written text at a much deeper level than casual conversation . ",
        "on a similar note , i also believe in the importance of doing reading practice . there are lots of ways that you can do this such as reading blog posts , novels , comic books , or even textbooks . my favourite part about this activity is that it exposes you to vocabulary that you may not come across in day-to-day speech . take the book below as an example : i was reading this french book for one of my students a couple months ago . the title translates to , `` the mouse that roars '' . ",
        "to be honest , i did n't know the verb `` to roar '' in french even though i speak at a near-native level . this is because the word `` roar '' is rarely used in regular conversations , despite the fact that all native speakers know the word . therefore , i highly recommend everybody does a little bit of reading practice on top of doing writing drills . you will notice a significant improvement not only in your reading and writing abilities , but also in your conversational skills . huge shoutout to my friend @jessietakespictures on instagram for this picture .
