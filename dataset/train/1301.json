        "-- federal regulators rejected u. s. energy secretary rick perry 's plan to bail out struggling coal and nuclear plants , instead asking grid operators to suggest their own ways to ensure reliable power supplies . in an order monday , the federal energy regulatory commission terminated a proceeding that had begun in response to perry 's september directive that suggested power plants should be rewarded for having 90 days of fuel on site . the proposal would 've largely benefited coal and nuclear power plants . `` we appreciate the secretary reinforcing the resilience of the bulk power system as an important issue that warrants further attention , '' according to the order . ",
        "`` we expect to review the additional material and promptly decide whether additional commission action is warranted to address grid resilience . `` the defeat is a setback for president donald trump 's efforts to revive the coal industry and put miners back to work . the energy department plan drew criticism from natural gas producers , grid operators and others who argued it would undermine competition in wholesale power markets . consumers in more than a dozen states would have been stuck footing the bill . perry ordered the commission to consider his plan in september , invoking an obscure 30-year-old statute . ",
        "his idea was to pay plants a premium to store at least 90 days of fuel on site in an effort to make grids more reliable . coal and nuclear generators would be uniquely suited because , unlike gas plants , they are n't fed by pipelines . wind and solar farms , meanwhile , require no fuel . the energy commission initially had a dec. . 8 deadline to act on the proposal . the day he was sworn in , ferc chairman kevin mcintyre asked perry for a 30-day extension , saying he needed time to review the flood of public comments . ",
        "critics of the proposal said it could have let some coal and nuclear plants continue to operate even if they 're not economic to run . that could slow development of gas , wind and solar projects , whose growth depends on aging power plants closing . perry has repeatedly said that storing fuel on site makes coal and nuclear plants less prone to shutdowns than other power generators in the event of disasters and attacks . an energy department study released in august does n't support that claim , finding instead that `` attempts to achieve fuel diversity in market designs explicitly would likely result in inefficient and potentially discriminatory practices that are inconsistent with the federal power act . '' ",
        "grid operators and utilities also rejected perry 's claim , contending instead that resilience has more to do with power lines than about fuel supply . to contact the reporters on this story : ari natter in washington at anatter5@bloomberg . net , catherine traywick in washington at ctraywick@bloomberg . net . to contact the editors responsible for this story : david marino at dmarino4@bloomberg . net , joe ryan , mark drajem Â© 2018 bloomberg l. p.
