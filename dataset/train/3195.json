        "when searching for life , scientists first look for an element key to sustaining it : fresh water . although today 's martian surface is barren , frozen and inhabitable , a trail of evidence points to a once warmer , wetter planet , where water flowed freely . the conundrum of what happened to this water is long standing and unsolved . however , new research published in nature suggests that this water is now locked in the martian rocks . scientists at oxford 's department of earth sciences , propose that the martian surface reacted with the water and then absorbed it , increasing the rocks oxidation in the process , making the planet uninhabitable . ",
        "previous research has suggested that the majority of the water was lost to space as a result of the collapse of the planet 's magnetic field , when it was either swept away by high intensity solar winds or locked up as sub-surface ice . however , these theories do not explain where all of the water has gone . convinced that the planet 's minerology held the answer to this puzzling question , a team led by dr jon wade , nerc research fellow in oxford 's department of earth sciences , applied modelling methods used to understand the composition of earth rocks to calculate how much water could be removed from the martian surface through reactions with rock . ",
        "the team assessed the role that rock temperature , sub-surface pressure and general martian make-up , have on the planetary surfaces . the results revealed that the basalt rocks on mars can hold approximately 25 per cent more water than those on earth , and as a result drew the water from the martian surface into its interior . dr wade said : `` people have thought about this question for a long time , but never tested the theory of the water being absorbed as a result of simple rock reactions . there are pockets of evidence that together , leads us to believe that a different reaction is needed to oxidise the martian mantle . ",
        "for instance , martian meteorites are chemically reduced compared to the surface rocks , and compositionally look very different . one reason for this , and why mars lost all of its water , could be in its minerology . `` the earth 's current system of plate tectonics prevents drastic changes in surface water levels , with wet rocks efficiently dehydrating before they enter the earth 's relatively dry mantle . but neither early earth nor mars had this system of recycling water . on mars , -lrb- water reacting with the freshly erupted lavas ' that form its basaltic crust , resulted in a sponge-like effect . ",
        "the planet 's water then reacted with the rocks to form a variety of water bearing minerals . this water-rock reaction changed the rock mineralogy and caused the planetary surface to dry and become inhospitable to life . `` as to the question of why earth has never experienced these changes , he said : `` mars is much smaller than earth , with a different temperature profile and higher iron content of its silicate mantle . these are only subtle distinctions but they cause significant effects that , over time , add up . they made the surface of mars more prone to reaction with surface water and able to form minerals that contain water . ",
        "because of these factors the planet 's geological chemistry naturally drags water down into the mantle , whereas on early earth hydrated rocks tended to float until they dehydrate . `` the overarching message of dr wade 's paper , that planetary composition sets the tone for future habitability , is echoed in new research also published in nature , examining the earth 's salt levels . co-written by professor chris ballentine of oxford 's department of earth sciences , the research reveals that for life to form and be sustainable , the earth 's halogen levels have to be just right . ",
        "too much or too little could cause sterilisation . previous studies have suggested that halogen level estimates in meteorites were too high . compared to samples of the meteorites that formed the earth , the ratio of salt to earth is just too high . many theories have been put forward to explain the mystery of how this variation occurred , however , the two studies combined elevate the evidence and support a case for further investigation . dr wade said `` broadly speaking the inner planets in the solar system have similar composition , but subtle differences can cause dramatic differences - for example , rock chemistry . ",
        "the biggest difference being , that mars has more iron in its mantle rocks , as the planet formed under marginally more oxidising conditions . `` we know that mars once had water , and the potential to sustain life , but by comparison little is known about the other planets , and the team are keen to change that . dr wade , said : `` to build on this work we want to test the effects of other sensitivities across the planets - very little is known about venus for example . questions like : what if the earth had more or less iron in the mantle , how would that change the environment ? ",
        "what if the earth was bigger or smaller ? these answers will help us to understand how much of a role rock chemistry determines a planet 's future fate . when looking for life on other planets it is not just about having the right bulk chemistry , but also very subtle things like the way the planet is put together , which may have big effects on whether water stays on the surface . these effects and their implications for other planets have not really been explored .
