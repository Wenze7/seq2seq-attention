        "investment bank citi says the government only really has two options left in brexit negotiations . the first is full membership of the single market , the second is a hard brexit which would have potentially disastrous consequences . london -- brexit negotiations are becoming `` ever more binary '' , according to a note from analysts at citi bank . uk prime minister theresa may has called for a `` creative solution '' to the issue of uk-eu trade post-brexit . the pm wants to design a bespoke deal for the uk . but investment bank citi argues that there is n't `` a full continuum of plausible outcomes to the next stage of discussions '' and the government only really has two options left when it comes to trade . ",
        "the first is full membership of the single market -- something theresa may has explicitly ruled out . the second is a hard brexit , in the form of a very narrow free trade deal that excludes servicesthe second option would see the city of london crash out of the eu 's financial passporting zone with potentially disastrous consequences . ` circles that can not be squared ` the eu on friday agreed to move brexit talks onto the second phase , which will see the uk discussing future trade relationships with the 27 member bloc . citi said in its recent note that one option for post-brexit britain is a `` soft '' exit , which would see britain retain full single-market membership . ",
        "in theory , that should be easy . the uk 's decision to convert all eu law into uk law after leaving means it start from a position of total regulatory convergence . this is the minimum necessary requirement for such a trade deal . in practice , however , citi says this option `` is not a likely outcome '' : `` first , because the level of mutual confidence required to dismantle new borders is typically insufficient , in almost all circumstances and between any countries , in all sectors that carry significant risks with regard to financial stability , public health , or any other topic to which public opinion is sensitive . ",
        "it is partly for that precise reason that the eu created a single market in the first place so that mutual confidence can be internalised in common institutions . `` put simply , the eu ca n't trust the uk not to erect a border in the future when it comes to critical services such as financial services and healthcare . this is precisely why the single market was created in the first place . theresa may has also committed to leaving the single market and described leaving the european court of justice -- which governs the free-trade area -- as a `` red line '' in negotiations on which she is unwilling to compromise . ",
        "this makes the first option even more unlikely . theory vs. practicewhat 's the alternative ? theresa may routinely talks up the prospect of striking a bespoke free trade deal which covers all sectors of the economy , and it is the stated aim of the cabinet to pursue such a deal . the `` theoretical '' reason a generous free trade deal covering all sectors of the economy should be easy is , again , because both parties start from a position of total convergence in terms of regulation and trading rules . in practice , if the stated aim of brexit is to move away from eu law , however , citi says a deal would become gradually more unstable . ",
        "citi said : `` the uk-eu discussion is an extraordinary situation of two parties negotiating a trade agreement in the context of divergence of legislation and regulation . the whole rationale of leaving the eu is for the uk to recover its ability to enact legislation separate from that of the eu . `` by contrast , almost every trade agreement ever negotiated has been in the context of convergence of legislation , regulation and enforcement . it is that convergence that typically legitimises , and stabilises , mutual recognition . `` even if the uk could initially agree a free-trade deal on the basis of alignment , that would in citi 's view become `` fundamentally unstable '' as the uk diverged and writes out key aspects of eu law . ",
        "the agreement struck between the eu and uk on the first phase of brexit negotiations last week was , by theresa may 's own tacit admission , a fudge designed to keep both leavers and remainers happy by remaining vague on crucial issues like that of the irish border . `` this is good news for people who voted leave , who were worried we were so bogged down in tortuous negotiations it was never going to happen , '' she said . `` and it is good news for people who voted remain , who were worried we were going to crash out without a deal . ",
        "`` that happy compromise must soon end .   "
