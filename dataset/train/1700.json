        "the word pescatarian is a clever mash up of two words : pesce , being the italian word for fish , and -- tarian , from vegetarian . the veg and vegan lifestyles have been going strong for years . today , many omnivores are cutting back on meat consumption , boosting their veggie intake , and turning their attention to pescatarianism . due to its flexibility , pescatarianism often gets used as a stepping-stone to vegetarianism . the pescatarian diet in a nutshellcontrary to popular belief , the pescatarian diet does n't require that you * only * consume fish . ",
        "in fact , a lot of the diet is heavily influenced by vegetarianism . pescatarians do get some of their protein from the sea , but they mostly depend on sources such as lentils , beans , nuts , seeds , dairy , and eggs . since these seafood lovers do n't eat fish for dinner every night , it 's important to be acquainted with enough vegetarian-friendly recipes to ensure a well-balanced diet . if eating fish two to three times a week is the plan , think ahead and work plant-based proteins into your other meals , like big-batch vegetarian chilis , meatless lasagnas , or plant-based tacos . ",
        "a healthy way of livingwhen done properly , the pescatarian diet is definitely healthy . on top of all the fab veggies and legumes you 'll be eating , you 'll be getting a healthy dose of lean protein and omega-3 fatty acids from fish . even in a standard diet , the american heart association suggests eating fish two to three times a week . fatty fish that are high in omega-3 such as mackerel , lake trout , albacore tuna , salmon , and sardines are especially good . on the flip side , there 's the threat of mercury . ",
        "you need to know which types of fish contain high levels of mercury , dioxins , and other environmental pollutants so that you can indulge sparingly . mercury is highest in larger fish and marine mammals like shark , swordfish , king mackerel , marlin , orange roughy , tilefish , bigeye tuna , and sadly , our beloved ahi tuna . definitely avoid these fish if you 're planning on becoming pregnant , are pregnant , or are nursing . getting enough ironpescatarians deal with the question of how to get enough iron in their diet just as much as vegetarians do . ",
        "meat eaters hardly have to try ; they get more than enough iron by simply eating meat . heme iron , which is derived from hemoglobin and comes from red meats , poultry , and fish , is easily absorbed by the human body . as a pescatarian , it 's useful to know that three ounces of oysters , clams , mollusks , or mussels contain the same amount of iron as three ounces of beef or chicken liver ; three ounces of canned sardines in oil contain the same amount of iron as three ounces of cooked beef . ",
        "however , when it comes to non-heme iron from plant-based sources , absorption is more difficult . luckily , there are solutions . pairing non-heme iron sources with foods rich in vitamin c can increase your iron absorption up to five times ! additionally , cooking in a cast iron pan will increase iron absorption . seriously , it 's not a myth . it 's worth mentioning that men need to be cautious with iron . depending on age , diet , and overall wellness , the average man needs less than half the daily amount of iron than women need . ",
        "many sources site that women aged 19 to 50 need 18 milligrams of iron per day , while men within the same age range only require eight milligrams . keep this in mind when cooking for others . shopping seafoodwhen it comes to shopping for seafood , whether it be canned , frozen , or fresh , always know where it 's coming from and make sure it 's sustainable . many companies are big on transparency these days , so they 'll have the information stamped right on the packaging . if you 're buying fresh from the counter , ask the fishmonger where the fish is from and whether or not it was sustainably sourced . ",
        "another great way to track seafood is through monterey bay aquarium 's seafood watch . they even have an app , so you can check the info right there at the fish counter ! meal planningas far as meal planning goes , snag yourself at least two fillets for the week . the rest of your seafood consumption can be made with canned fish like sardines or mackerel , which are both healthy and sustainable options that make for great lunches and dinners . away from seafood , plan for simple yet fun vegetarian meals like curries , pizzas , and pastas . ",
        "it might all seem overwhelming in the beginning , but once you get into a routine , it 's a piece of cake . are you pescatarian ? do you think you 'd ever go pescatarian ? tweet us @britandco !   "
