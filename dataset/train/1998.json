        "when rob dickinson , the lead singer for '90s british rock band catherine wheel , moved to hollywood in the early aughts , he drove a 1969 porsche 911 that he lovingly dubbed the `` brown bomber '' -- a classic car he restored to serve as a lightweight daily driver . before long he was approached all over town -- not for his autograph -- rather to field questions about and receive offers for his car . one especially appreciative motorist even handed him a glass of champagne at a stoplight . `` hollywood is a pretty tough audience to impress , and it just proved to me that the fascination that i had for the 911 went deeper than just nerds like me , '' dickinson , 52 , recalls from a glass-paneled conference room at his sun valley , calif. , office . ",
        "`` what i did appealed to other people -- not just porsche people but average laypeople who have a personal interest in cars . '' now his eight-year-old company , singer vehicle design , is charging up to seven figures to restore models from the nameplate 's air-cooled golden period of the late 1980s to early 1990s and turn them into the `` ultimate 911 . '' the final product , a porsche 911 `` reimagined '' by singer , leaves no detail unattended . a new engine , drivetrain , and suspension increase the driving performance , while painstakingly refurbished bodywork and singer touches like handwoven door panels and quilted leather trunk liners let you know this is a very special car . ",
        "after contracting with singer , customers turn over their `` 964 '' - model porsche 911 and a sizable deposit before the company puts 4,000 hours into restoring , tuning , and customizing it . singer vehicle design 's basic restoration services begin at $ 395,000 but average $ 600,000 , `` which is still way too cheap , '' says dickinson , `` for the assiduous labor and hand-built parts required . '' in 2009 , dickinson charged one of his first customers $ 300,000 and ended up spending $ 800,000 on the restoration . `` i picked a number out of thin air and of course it was nowhere near , and we 've spent the last eight years really understanding how astronomically expensive it is to do this , '' he says , reclining in his unofficial uniform of a black t-shirt , cuffed jeans , sneakers , and a jaunty green goorin bros. . ",
        "cap . the former rock star restoring six-figure porsches recalls a car-obsessed childhood underpinned by a curiosity about mechanical objects , heritage brands , and the trappings of the retro international man of mystery : sunglasses , cigarettes , and watches . dickinson 's earliest automotive memory : watching the friendly face and businesslike rear of a green porsche 911 pass his family 's vw beetle on a summer vacation in france when he was 5 . ever since , dickinson says , he 's `` had a fascination with the ultimate version of things . '' the opportunity to cross that threshold arrived when a longtime customer asked him to take his 1990 porsche 911 to the next level . ",
        "the company began a `` dynamics and lightweighting study '' with formula 1 's williams advanced engineering , eventually developing a new engine and full carbon fiber body panels , and making extensive use of lightweight materials with some help from famed porsche engine-builder hans mezger and norbert singer himself . this fall , singer and williams delivered on the dream and `` reimagined '' the pinnacle of air-cooled porsches . the modifications , part of a limited run of 75 slated to begin deliveries at the end of 2018 , will routinely fetch upwards of seven figures . the first commission , a modern , 500-horsepower sports car with retro flair , makes good on dickinson 's childhood dream `` to restore an old 911 to be the best that there will ever , ever , ever be . '' ",
        "even customers who do n't opt for the f1 treatment , however , will continue to receive bespoke service , from 75 paint choices to `` special wishes '' such as the authentic-looking nickel-plated snowboard rack the company built for a customer in moscow . `` nobody wrote the book on how to do what we 've done with the porsches , '' he says , `` and no one has really written a book on developing a brand like ours . '' a version of this article appears in the jan. . 1 , 2018 issue of fortune with the headline `` meister singer . '' "
