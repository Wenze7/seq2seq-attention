        "jordan spieth sank a 91-foot putt at the sony open in hawai'i . it was the longest putt of his career , and also matches the 91-foot putt tiger woods sank in 2014 . jordan spieth proved once again that he is the stephen curry of the golf world and he was up to his old tricks in hawai'i . while spieth is not as long as other top golfers off the tee , the one area where they ca n't match him is on long-distance putts . he proved that again during the second round of the sony open when he sank a 91-foot putt on the fifth hole .
