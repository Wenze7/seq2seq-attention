        "it 's a special time of year , one that only comes around once in a blue moon , and i think it 's high time we celebrate appropriately . forget the holidays . forget any kind of christmas cheer . forget feeling rosy and warm with the wintry spirit . things are about to get frosty and spicy , but not in the way you were expecting . no , what i 'm talking about is the special time of year when we not only get to herald the impending return of the real housewives of beverly hills , but we also get to bask in the glory of the rhobh season 8 taglines . ",
        "it 's a housewives miracle , i tell you ! more : is anyone else so over the real housewives of orange county ? it 's been a long , long time since we 've had any kind of rhobh goodness in our lives . with season 7 ending earlier in 2017 , it 's been a drag all this time as we wait for season 8 -- well , for die-hard fans of the show like yours truly , it has . but now , entertainment tonight is finally able to dish up a smashing sneak preview of the new and improved taglines for each of the housewives , including recent addition teddi mellencamp arroyave , who is sending a soft but strong message with her tagline : `` having the best is n't important to me , but being my best is . '' ",
        "it sounds like we might have a new rhobh good girl on our hands , but we should n't hold our breath that she wo n't get sucked into the drama . some of the other taglines feel extra decadent and very , very beverly hills . take lisa vanderpump 's new tagline , `` the queen of diamonds always has an ace up her sleeve , '' or even erika girardi 's , which also goes ultra-decadent with the diamonds imagery : `` some people call me cold , but that 's not ice . it 's diamonds . ",
        "`` more : real housewives of new york 's 11 most insane fights everlisa rinna 's new one-liner , `` i do n't have to buy it ` cause i already own it , '' is not only a hint at her lifestyle but also a recall to her infamous confrontation with kyle richards . she 's clearly owning her drama-inciting tendencies . oh , and speaking of richards , her new tagline fits her like a glove and hits on her quality as a consistently loyal friend : `` in this town , fame and money come and go , but friends should not . ",
        "`` more : the real housewives of dallas season 2 trailer is full of champagne problemsfinally , dorit kemsley 's new tagline is perhaps the most decadent and extra of them all -- buckle up . `` i believe in an excess of everything ... except moderation , '' she says in the promo . oh , boy . the rhobh season 8 premiere is this evening , dec. . 19 , and yet it still feels like such a long wait !
