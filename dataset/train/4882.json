        "everyone wrestles with stress ; it 's just a part of life . none of us are immune to anxiety . but when stress disrupts your ability to function normally , it can be something more . more than 15 million indians battle anxiety disorders , and like depression , it comes in varying degrees and with its own set of social stigmas . one in five urban adolescents will suffer from some form of depression or anxiety before they turn 18 . that 's a huge number . but just because you feel stressed or emotionally overwhelmed does n't automatically mean you have an anxiety disorder , either . ",
        "but when that feeling does n't go away , instead gets worse over time , and it starts to interfere with the important stuff , that moment you should consider getting help . here are seven signs that you are anxious , but do n't necessarily suffer from a clinical anxiety disorder : 1 . your heart pounds so fast that it 's almost beating out of your chest if you have heart-pounding , stomach flipping butterflies all the time , there can be a cause for worry you are being chased , you run for your life and your heartbeat races faster than a ferrari -- that 's natural . ",
        "you 're waiting to serenade your love , your heart feels like it ca n't get enough oxygen -- that 's pretty standard . this is your body thrown into fight-or-flight mode . take deep breaths and sit down for a few minutes with a tall glass of water in your hand . how you know it might be a problem : such events happen ten times a day and are accompanied by shortness of breath and claustrophobia . your heart beats savagely out of control for no apparent reason , even when you 're lying in bed at night - this needs medical attention . ",
        "if you feel like the walls are closing in on you , you might have a full-blown panic attack ! 2 . you 're fidgety well , idle hands are a devil 's plaything ! `` stop fidgeting ! '' said every parent ever . but do you really ever stop twitching and tapping in seemingly boring , awkward situations ? relax , fidgeting is a biological process which incidentally burns 350 extra calories than couching lethargically all day ! it does n't necessarily have to be a chronic issue but if you are unnecessarily tapping your pencil against the desk , stop and ask yourself why . ",
        "your body is probably over-worked and needs a little break . how you know it might be a problem : there 's a big difference between fidgeting and involuntary tremors . also described as ` full-body vibrations ' , they can show up at the strangest of times , like when you first wake up . so if you are struggling with shaking arms or sides , it 's a tell-tale sign that you need to see a doctor . 3 . you bite your nails anxiousness is n't something that can just simply be controlled , and it 's not just a phase it 's annoying . ",
        "it 's annoying as hell . but so are many other habits . like each time i fly , i tap on a certain part of the airplane 's body thrice , so it stays up in the air . go judge me , but those three extra seconds i take , ensure my safety . most people who have these quirks , including me , are aware . how you know it might be a problem : if you 're one of those gals who ca n't be seen without a finger in her mouth and your nails are gnarly and bloody , you should seriously check the level of overall anxiety you 're harboring in your life . ",
        "the moment it becomes a compulsion , get the alarm bells ringing . 4 . you get scared fear is normal but not always remember the ` zee horror show ' ? for most people , it was n't as scary as it was entertaining . for me , just one episode of the blood-sucking , green-eyed monsters jumping from the dense peepal ped , was enough to creep me out of sleep for months ! how you know it might be a problem : when your worry becomes like hydra ; you cut off the head , three more grow in its place . ",
        "you learn to live with anxiety , but its always there . did i lock the door ? i know i already checked , but am i sure ? what if something happens to me and no one thinks to check on me ? what was that strange noise because it definitely was n't the wind ! such feelings warrant a chronic condition . 5 . you avoid socializing social anxiety is more complicated than just fearing people you skip a party , or four , to spend the night binge watching netflix ? that 's standard . feel awkward at a house party because you do n't know anyone ? ",
        "happens all the time . how you know it might be a problem : you avoid social situations because you 're afraid of being judged or you might embarrass yourself . you 're increasingly terrified of being in a crowd for the fear of being humiliated or mocked . these are signs of general anxiety . anxiety can hurt , like physically hurt . it 's not just nerves . it can be dizziness , overheating , chills , increased heartbeat , chest pain , rapid breathing , headaches . it can be constant muscle tension . it can be exhausting . ",
        "get medical help immediately and know that you are not alone .   "
