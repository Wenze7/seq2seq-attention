        "the senate voted to advance a bill that would reopen the government on monday after senate democrats agreed to vote for legislation that funds the government through feb. . 8 , on the condition that republicans put an immigration bill to a vote . the bill advanced by a vote of 81 to 18 , with a handful of rumored democratic presidential hopefuls voting no . the bill is expected to pass the house , which also needs to vote , ending the nearly three-day-long shutdown . as part of the deal senators worked out , senate majority leader mitch mcconnell agreed to bring an immigration bill that codifies the deferred action for childhood arrivals program into law to a vote , on the condition that the government remains open . ",
        "`` should the issues not be resolved by the time the funding bill before us expires on feb. . 8 , so long as the government remains open , it would be my intention to take up legislation here in the senate that would address daca , border security and related issues , '' mcconnell said monday morning in a speech on the senate floor . roughly 800,000 undocumented immigrants who came to the u. s. as minors have been legally residing in the country under daca , so long as they 're attending school or have a job . ",
        "former president barack obama created the program after years of inaction by congress to address this class of undocumented immigrants . however , president donald trump -- who said obama did n't have the legal authority to create daca -- announced the program will end on march 5 if congress does n't pass a bill codifying the program into law . democrats are choosing to trust mcconnell 's word that he will put daca legislation to a vote . however , mcconell has broken promises to take up legislation before , including some made to members of his own party . ",
        "in december 2017 , mcconnell promised sen. jeff flake that if flake voted for the tax reform bill , he 'd take up a bipartisan compromise on daca in january . a bipartisan group of lawmakers did reach a compromise on daca in early january , but mcconnell did n't put the bill to a vote -- moving the goal post by saying he would n't bring anything to a vote that trump did n't agree with . mcconnell also promised sen. susan collins in november that if she voted for the contentious tax reform bill , he 'd put a bipartisan bill to shore up the affordable care act insurance marketplaces to a vote before the end of 2017 . ",
        "that did n't happen . in announcing the deal on monday , senate minority leader chuck schumer made the point that if mcconnell did n't hold up his end of the bargain , he `` will have breeched the trust of not only the democratic senators '' but republicans , too . even if an immigration bill passes the senate , however , it 's unclear whether house speaker paul ryan would bring up the same bill in the republican-controlled house . it 's also still unclear what bill trump would sign . trump has changed his position numerous times about what kind of daca solution he supports , and has ratcheted up his anti-immigration talk in recent days , calling certain nations with majority-black populations `` shithole countries .
