        "melo just wanted to feel wanted . in one particular moment in tonight 's epic triple-overtime classic between the oklahoma city thunder and the philadelphia 76ers , carmelo anthony wanted to make his mark for his team , which held a single-digit lead with just over five minutes to go . camped out on the elbow , he felt he was in the ideal position for a catch-and-shoot . russell westbrook did n't see it that way . he may not have seen melo at all : the body language from anthony is incredible here , and totally speaks for itself . ",
        "carmelo is surely in a constant state of crisis since making his big move from the knicks to okc . though the team has managed some quality wins of late to make up for a rough start to the season , the future hall of famer has struggled to find a proper niche on his new team . with westbrook and paul george getting the lion 's share of the usage on offense , every single opportunity is precious . this one just was n't meant to be . sorry , melo . do you want a hug ? you look like you could use a hug .
