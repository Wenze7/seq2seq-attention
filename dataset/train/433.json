        "hangovers take a lot of the fun out of a night out . we 're going to rip the plaster off quickly here - there is no ` cure ' for a hangover , you will most likely be stuck with a sore head if you 've drunk too much the night before . however , there is some good advice for best practice , to minimise the discomfort . and we 're here to provide that . 1 . do n't drink too much . we 're assuming this has been and gone at the stage you 're reading this , but if possible always check yourself to make sure you 're not putting in more alcohol than your body can handle . ",
        "this is always the best prevention . 2 . eat a meal beforecarbs are your friends here . the food will help slow down the body 's absorption of alcohol . the nhs recommends pasta or rice , or fatty foods . 3 . stay hydratedlisten to your friends at the nhs here : drink a pint or so of water before you go to sleep . keep a glass of water by the bed to sip if you wake up during the night . this rule continues into the morning : dealing with a hangover involves rehydrating the body to help it deal with the painful symptoms . ",
        "the best time to rehydrate is before going to sleep after a drinking session . 4 . do not partake in the ` hair of the dog ` the old adage is the ` hair of the dog that bit you ' ; ie . the healing properties of the thing that got you ill in the first place . it did n't work for rabies in the 1800 's and it does n't work now . drinking more alcohol will not solve the problem of having drunk too much alcohol . you are simply delaying the appearance of symptoms until the next bout of alcohol wears off . ",
        "you need to give your body time to recover . 5 . bouillon soupthe nhs specifically recommends this as a nutritious source of vitamins and mineral to top up the depleted resources after a drinking session . it 's also easy on a fragile stomach . 6 . visit a hangover clinicit 's not a miracle cure , and it 's incredibly expensive . but if you have money to burn to the tune of Â£ 200 , book in a session with an iv drip . with an anti-inflammatory , rehydration medication and vitamins to eliminate your headache , it 's a solution . ",
        "but , as jonathan chick , professor of health sciences at queen margaret university , edinburgh told the daily mail , he saw : no benefit other than rehydration , and the feeling that comes when someone gives you care in a sympathetic style in a comfortable setting . if that 's what you need , though , have no shame in that .
