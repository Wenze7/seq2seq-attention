        "how on earth can solar energy be the world 's cheapest energy source , highly efficient and also so `` green ? '' to answer this question , we need look at some other questions . questions like : what materials are required , and how does manufacturing play a role in the `` green-ness '' of photovoltaic panels . what materials are in solar panels ? silicon . silicon dioxide to be exact . that 's the raw material we collect from nature to create the pv grade silicon semiconductors used in solar panels . i guarantee you have seen , walked on , or played with this interesting and abundant material before ... because it 's actually just sand ! ",
        "silicon is the second most abundant element in the earth 's crust , making it a plentiful resource helping to sustainably advance technology . other materials used in the pv panels are the aluminum frame and glass casing . aluminum is also highly abundant in the earth 's crust , and glass , like silicon is made from common elements in sand ... so far , so good . sio2 , commonly found in sandanother important consideration is recyclability . when a solar panel has finished its long life and needs to be deconstructed , what happens to all that material ? ",
        "aluminum , glass , and thermoplastic polymers are recyclable , giving solar panels an overall high recyclability of about 95 % . what about manufacturing ? energy used to manufacture the panels creates a `` dirty energy '' output , right ? well yes , but it has already been offset by the `` clean energy '' of the solar panels . researchers in the netherlands found that when the capacity for solar installation doubles , the energy used to manufacture the panels decreases by 12 -- 13 % . furthermore , greenhouse gas emissions also drop by 17 -- 24 % . ",
        "as a result of this , in 2011 , nature commissions , found that solar energy has paid off it 's carbon debts . the implications of this are two-fold . since the creation of the pv panel industry in 1975 , it has prevented more emissions than it has emitted ; and , it has produced more energy than has been originally required . solar panels are 200 times cheaper today than they were 40 years ago . a typical house can now eliminate their electric bill with a $ 20 -- 30k system . if someone had tried to do that 40 years ago , it would have cost them more than $ 500k . ",
        "this has allowed solar to be an affordable and environmentally beneficial solution for both individuals and all of society .   "
