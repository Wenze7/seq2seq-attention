        "why did n't you watch the best show ever made about silicon valley ?"

        "it 's hard to make good tv about silicon valley and its predecessors . especially a drama . watching a bunch of nerds talk about coding and cpus is appealing to a only a painfully small fraction of the population -- but someone definitely thought that same thing about advertising before matthew weiner trundled into amc and pitched mad men . that show proved even the most boring subject matter could be riveting with the right approach . over the course of its four seasons , halt and catch fire , which ended earlier this year , discovered the fascinating , frustrating human side to the soulless monsters who built silicon valley . ",
        "but nobody watched it . the show never cracked a million live viewers after the pilot episode . it sat firmly on the bubble every season , getting greenlit only by the grace of amc . but because no one was watching , and because amc was content to let it carry on , halt and catch fire had the opportunity to retool and experiment and become one of the best shows on television . it all starts in 1983 dallas -- known as the silicon prairie . tandy , texas instruments , radio shack , and dozens of other big tech companies called dallas/fort worth home in the late 70s and through the 80s . ",
        "gordon clark spends his days barely awake working for the fictional cardiff electric . his wife donna is a hardware engineer at ti . they live a pleasant and perfectly mundane life with their young daughters in dallas . then joe macmillian , a mysterious former ibm man , shows up at cardiff with a plan to build the next big thing . he 's brought along his sort of hook up , cameron howe , a genius college drop out and computer programmer . what these four end up building in the painfully uneven first season does n't actually matter . ",
        "what 's being built in each season of the show never actually matters . sometimes it 's a shade of what would make compaq a dominant force in the 90s , other times it 's mcafee or aol or even an algorithm that would make google great . the `` thing '' is n't what matters on halt and catch fire . rather it 's the people themselves , a mad mix of geniuses and those who consider themselves geniuses . frequently the show is a scathing condemnation of what makes the tech business tick and why the big ideas seem to so often fail . ",
        "friends and partners screw each other over for a buck after trying to build something refreshing and innovative . money always triumphs over vision . the ordinary excel while the extraordinary frequently find themselves restricted . these are n't the rockstars of the tech scene . they 're not steve jobs or bill gates . they 're the other guys . the ones best remembered as a name in someone else 's wikipedia entry . it could be a positively pessimistic show , but there 's an engine of optimism at its heart . the main characters are ultimately not driven by the need to succeed or make a billion dollars or wind up on the cover of forbes or wired . ",
        "they 're driven only by the need to see an idea , no matter how initially nebulous , to fruition . they want to create , even if its a ripoff of what everyone else is doing , or doomed to fail because we , the viewer , have the luxury of hindsight and know what happens to companies like gateway and compuserve . but what 's really extraordinary , and what had me start a rewatch almost as soon as the perfect finale was over is the epic , if platonic , romance at the center of halt and catch fire . ",
        "as the first season was winding down the writers realized they 'd miscalculated . people were n't interested in the gangly mystery man that was joe macmillian or the tortured genius of gordon clark . instead it was cameron , the brash kid genius , and donna , the consistent working mom that had viewers attention . so the show leaned in , letting gordon and joe drift while donna and cameron worked together to build a company and take on a wealthy and sexist establishment . as retoolings go , it was one of the most successful of its kind , and each season just built on that central relationship . ",
        "it was actually thrilling to watch two wildly different women forge a work romance , than fall apart , and then struggle to reunite , professionally speaking . late in the final season donna plays a universally panned video game cameron designed and she notices what all the critics missed and i was stuck half standing on my couch begging for donna to call cameron to tell her she 'd beaten a video game . that 's a helluva a feat : to bring emotional resonance to a crummy game . halt and catch fire is full of moments like that . ",
        "instances that have no right to punch you in the gut as often as they do . all four seasons are currently on netflix so if you find yourself needing something to think about besides star wars or the purposeful crumbling of our internet infrastructure , you should give it a binge . just be forewarned , the first season can be a slog , but every season after makes it worth it .
