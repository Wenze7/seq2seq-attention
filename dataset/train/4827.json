        "i worked in the legal industry for 12 years in two different countries -- singapore and london . one of the hardest things i found when working in a male dominated industry is being heard . being a woman and asian , no one really expects you to speak coherent english , never mind be a competent lawyer . being invisible is a common thing for women in the legal world and in many industries that is skewed towards men . so , i had to learn a few rules along the way , none of which was taught at school or at university . ",
        "here 's what i wish someone told me before i started working in the legal world : 1 -rrb- make statements , do n't ask permission . too often , women ask questions rather than make a statement , even when they 've already decided . we are a collaborative and consensual bunch . we like harmony and do n't like hierarchy much . so , when we are in a group , we tend to ask questions like `` how will this work for you ? what do you think about this ? '' it sounds like we are asking permission . ",
        "however , when it comes to working in a male dominated industry , not asking questions is one of the best methods i found that worked for me . instead , make a statement that you are , or are n't going to do something . do n't ask what your colleagues or bosses think , if it is n't necessary . to men , asking permission is a sign of weakness as it lacks decisiveness and authority . even when you do n't think so . to us , it might be collaboration we seek , or a way to smooth the waters by asking for thoughts on a potentially explosive decision . ",
        "but men do n't see it that way . questions = indecisiveness . so . if you have already made a decision , tell them . do n't ask them for permission . 2 -rrb- speak up in the first five minutes of a meeting . i am used to attending meetings where i am the only female . in fact , i was on a team where i was the only female lawyer out of 7 . the only other female on the team was the secretary . attending a meeting is a matter of limited time and competing attention . ",
        "and men will compete for both . so do n't take your time about it . come to the meeting well prepared and if you have something to say , take charge and dive in . do n't be shy , do n't be coy . it 's not about being polite . it 's about being heard when you need to be . 3 -rrb- do n't take notes . or if you need to , take down pertinent points . like the important ones and not verbatim . because once you are seen scribbling away furiously , you get treated like the pa or secretary which is fine if that is your job . ",
        "but it is n't . because you are there to contribute positively with your input and your opinions . so do n't take notes all the time . 4 -rrb- do n't pour the tea or coffee . when tea and coffee is served , do n't be the first to jump up and offer to get everyone else 's drink . leave it alone for a while . then get your own drink or none at all . the moment you are seen as serving drinks , men will assume that you are subservient . it is n't your job to serve the coffees and teas so do n't be perceived as being only good for that . ",
        "now if you are hired to do that , that 's fine . but you are n't . you 're there to speak up . 5 -rrb- sit forward . posture and body language do matter . like a ballet or piano performance , what you do with your arms and body do matter . when in a meeting or talking with colleagues , try this : sit up straight in the center of your seat and put your arms on the table and tent your fingers . men prize size and by sitting with your arms by your side , hunched and low in your seat , you make yourself smaller . ",
        "and that indirectly says that you do n't want to be heard , that you want to be small and unnoticeable . make your presence known , and shine in that meeting ! sit up and be noticed . so that 's my 5 things i learned in legal practice . this applies to the legal world , the tech world , and almost any professional industry whether it is a male dominated one or not . you could even try it at home . one of the differences between men and women is how hierarchy is viewed . i am no psychologist but i have worked in the industry for a long time . ",
        "and women and men do view hierarchy differently . how we present ourselves will decide whether we are at the top of the food chain or not . i 'd love to hear from you ! what is the hardest thing you find when working in a male dominated industry ? did you agree with my 5 things ? email or message me and let me know your story -- reach me at fern@taylograceconsultancy . com or leave a comment . i 'd love to hear from you .
