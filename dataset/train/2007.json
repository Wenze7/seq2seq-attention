        "after years on top of the world of as a global marketing information services company , whatever that may be , adversity has struck j. d. power & associates for the first time : today at noon , several prominent associates introduced articles of impeachment against power . though the corporation has not put out an official statement in the midst of the turmoil , several associates have spoken off the record about what one associate describes as `` an inevitable step against power . '' `` you know , j. d. 's not even his real name , '' said the associate , who asked not to be named . ",
        "`` and i do n't even mean , like , oh it 's actually john david . no . it 's lance . this is part of a pattern of half-truths we want to prevent from infecting the good name of j. d. power . and , yes , his associates . `` upon learning of the actions of the associates , power issued a terse response , delivered via a hastily spoken disclaimer at the end of a custom-made honda commercial played on a closed-circuit television for this reporter . `` this is a power play , plain and simple . ",
        "not a power play , which as you might imagine is something i approve of . make sure you get the caps right in your story -- send me any questions you have , and i 'll deliver my answers at the end of a commercial for the 2017 hyundai elantra . best in its class three years running , by the way , with no shortage of help from yours truly , and very little thanks to the associates . '' `` anyway , it 's a power play , '' he continued . `` they know that if they bring me down , one of the associates will become j. d. power . '' ",
        "`` that new j. d. power will then improve the lot of the rest of his former associates . but i ask you this : if j. d. power lets the associates have it as good as he does , what 's the difference ? where will the associates ' motivation be to strive to one day become j. d. power ? i tell you , it 's a fine line between socialism and assoc ... iat ... ism . '' `` by the way , '' he added at the end of a commercial that , despite it being quickly spoken was becoming quite lengthy , `` i freely admit that it 's not my actual name ; it 's a title , a mantle that passes from deserving recipient to deserving recipient -- like james bond . ",
        "and i 've earned that title , and believe that i capably execute its powers . `` a second unnamed associate -- which definitely gets confusing , you 're not the only one confused here -- said that power has grown complacent after so many years atop the associates . `` one day we were supposed to announce which hotel had been named best in its class . i could n't reach j. d. , nor could any of the other associates , '' said the associate . the first one , i guess , who really knows anymore ? ",
        "`` finally he called us back -- he still uses a pager , by the way . he called us back and he was on vacation . we said we needed an answer immediately regarding the top hotel , and he took two seconds and said ` how about this one ? ' the one he was staying in at the time ! '' `` another associate grabbed the phone from me and said , ` on what basis ? ' and he said , ` well i 'm having a pretty nice time . ' '' `` a pretty nice time ! ",
        "! no charts , no surveys , no 10-person panels . a pretty . nice . time . this kind of thing ca n't go on any longer , so we need to act now in order to maintain the dignity of the office of j. d. power . not to mention that of the associates . `` at press time , we had not been able to reach the aforementioned hotel for confirmation of mr. power 's stay , though a different hotel , the niagara marriott , spoke highly of power and said called him a leader in `` industry solutions , '' whatever those may be . ",
        "we do n't know what a lot of this is .   "
