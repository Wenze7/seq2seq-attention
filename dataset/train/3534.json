        "some of facebook 's former friends are starting to express some serious doubts about the social network they helped create . facebook exploits a `` vulnerability in human psychology '' to addict its users , sean parker , the company 's first president , said in a public forum last month . chamath palihapitiya , a former facebook vice president who joined the company in 2007 , recently told an audience at stanford that the company is `` ripping apart the social fabric of how society works . `` and roger mcnamee , a venture capitalist and early investor in both facebook and google , wrote that both companies `` threaten public health and democracy '' in an august usa today op-ed . ",
        "it has been a rough year for the tech industry , especially social media companies . it opened with concerns about fake news and `` filter bubbles '' that can shield people from contrary beliefs , segued into pressure on facebook and twitter to clamp down on trolling and online harassment , and culminated with congressional hearings into russian agents ' alleged use of their platforms to meddle with the 2016 presidential election . all of that , of course , came against a steady drumbeat of tweets from president donald trump , who used the service to praise his allies and castigate his foes , often in inflammatory fashion . ",
        "but the unkindest cut of all may have come from three people who helped build facebook in its early days . in early november , parker told the news site axios that facebook was built to answer the question , `` how do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible ? '' he called its stream of comments , `` likes '' and reactions a `` social validation feedback loop that exploits how human brains work . `` a few days later , mcnamee wrote another essay for the guardian in which he argued that facebook and google have used `` persuasive techniques developed by propagandists and the gambling industry , '' combining them with modern technology to maximize their profits while pushing `` appeals to fear and anger '' and other material that reinforces filter bubbles and addictive behavior . ",
        "palihapitiya piled on too , saying at a stanford graduate school of business talk last month that he feels `` tremendous guilt '' about helping create tools that have widened social divisions . he recommended that people take a break from social media . facebook , in an emailed comment , said it is `` working hard to improve , '' and noted that it 's not the same company it was when palihapitiya , who left six years ago , worked there . `` we 've done a lot of work and research with outside experts and academics to understand the effects of our service on well-being , and we 're using it to inform our product development , '' the company 's statement read . ",
        "`` we are willing to reduce our profitability to make sure the right investments are made . `` not all early investors are critical . linkedin co-founder reid hoffman acknowledged in an interview concerns around how social media systems are causing what he called `` lightly addictive behavior . '' but , he added , `` that 's also been true of television , that 's also been true of sugar . ''   "
