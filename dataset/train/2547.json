        "dear companies hiring a `` ui/ux designer '' , i 'm increasingly confused by the term `` ui/ux designer '' . if you 're using this term anywhere in your job specification you 're doing it wrong . let me explain . if you 're a ui/product/digital / interface designer , then , of course , you should have an understanding of the ux design process . you will understand what problem you 're trying to solve and how to use the various techniques of the ux designer to refine and test your assumptions . likewise , if you 're a ux designer , you should have an appreciation of the craft of the ui designer . ",
        "you will have an understanding of the systems thinking it takes to ensure a consistent experience . you 'll also appreciate the artistry in making a visual brand work . my problem is with taking these two district roles and smashing them together . in my experience , ux and ui designers working together to solve a problem produces the best work . hiring one hybrid is reductive . if you 're committed to becoming a design lead organisation , then do yourself a favour and hire specialists in both areas . you 'll allow each person to concentrate on their area of expertise , and to collaborate to solve your customer 's problems efficiently .
