        "under a new rating system , retail food stores in new york will receive letter grades reflecting the results of the most recent sanitary inspection . stores will get `` a , '' `` b '' or `` c '' letter grades after an inspection by the state department of agriculture and markets and will be required to post the inspection results in a visible location near the entrance , or pay a $ 600 fine for not meeting the requirements . an `` a '' grade means no critical deficiencies were found at the stores , a `` b '' grade means that though deficiencies were discovered they were corrected when the store was inspected and a `` c '' grade means that deficiencies that were discovered were not or could not be corrected , according to the department . ",
        "the grades are intended to better inform consumers about dining conditions , state agriculture commissioner richard ball said in a statement . `` consumers want to know now more than ever about their food , including how it was handled from farm to table , '' he said . `` that means our retail food establishments need to be doing their part , making sure they are implementing good food safety practices and posting the results of their inspection in a location visible to all consumers . we hope this change will not only inform consumers but also help educate our store owners . ",
        "`` the new system , announced wednesday , went into effect on jan. . 1 . inspection data for restaurants , caters , food service at schools , children 's camps and other facilities is available online at .   "
