        "in one of the most vivid accounts yet of harvey weinstein 's alleged abuse and harassment , salma hayek says the mogul turned the making of the frida kahlo biopic `` frida , '' into a nightmare after the actress refused weinstein 's relentless advances . `` for years , he was my monster , '' hayek wrote in an op-ed published wednesday by the new york times . her refusals - of massages , showers and sex - enraged him , she wrote . `` i do n't think he hated anything more than the word ` no , ' '' wrote hayek . ",
        "hayek , who regularly starred in films released by weinstein 's miramax in the 1990s , credited weinstein with helping her start her career . but she said that the movie mogul would turn up at her door `` at all hours of the night , hotel after hotel , location after location . '' when hayek brought `` frida , '' which she was producing , to miramax to distribute , weinstein made outrageous demands as payback . hayek said he insisted on rewrites , more financing and , most heinously to her , a sex scene with full frontal nudity . ",
        "he even threatened to kill her , she said . in order to finish what was a labor of love for hayek , she agreed . but she said she had a nervous breakdown while shooting the scene . `` my body would n't stop crying and convulsing , '' wrote hayek . `` it was not because i would be naked with another woman , '' she wrote . `` it was because i would be naked with her for harvey weinstein . '' even still , weinstein initially refused to give the movie a theatrical release . he eventually relented after pressure from director julie taymor and hayek . ",
        "it went on to gross $ 56.3 million worldwide and land six oscar nominations , winning two . in a statement through a spokesperson wednesday , weinstein denied hayek 's depiction of their relationship and said the battles on `` frida '' were `` creative friction . '' `` all of the sexual allegations as portrayed by salma are not accurate and others who witnessed the events have a different account of what transpired , '' said the statement . `` mr. weinstein does not recall pressuring salma to do a gratuitous sex scene with a female costar and he was not there for the filming , '' read the statement . ",
        "`` however , that was part of the story , as frida kahlo was bisexual and the more significant sex scene in the movie was choreographed by ms. hayek with geoffrey rush . '' dozens of women have accused weinstein of sexual harassment , and numerous women have said he raped them . weinstein , who is currently under investigation for sexual assault in four cities , has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex . `` why do so many of us , as female artists , have to go to war to tell our stories when we have so much to offer ? ",
        "why do we have to fight tooth and nail to maintain our dignity ? '' concluded hayek in her op-ed . `` i think it is because we , as women , have been devalued artistically to an indecent state , to the point where the film industry stopped making an effort to find out what female audiences wanted to see and what stories we wanted to tell .
