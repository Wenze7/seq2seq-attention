        "cyclops and wolverine had a mini-x-men reunion late last week , which they shared on social media . hugh jackman and james marsden got together late last week for the first time in quite a while and shared their reunion on instagram . it appears that the two ran into each other unexpectedly , but it is n't clear where exactly . however , marsden was recently spotted in paris to watch a louis vuitton menswear fashion show with his 16-year old son , so it 's quite possible that the two x-men stars reunited in europe or possibly at an airport because they both look pretty tired . ",
        "the two actors both posted pictures of their reunion to their respective instagram accounts . hugh jackman noted the `` official '' height difference , which could also be seen as a dig at president donald trump . james marsden pointed out their tired eyes , which may have been due to jetlag . marsden said that he ran into an `` old friend '' early that morning . the two have n't been seen onscreen together since x-men : days of future past . jackman and marsden have been friends for nearly 20 years now , while promoting x-men : days of future past in 2014 , james marsden spoke about his love of working with hugh jackman , noting that the actor is almost too nice and that he 's still looking to find a flaw . ",
        "marsden also shared that jackman is a jokester on the set , always out to have a good time and get a laugh , which may or may not have included some soft shoe dancing naked after performing a dramatic scene . whatever the case may be , the two actors definitely enjoy each other 's company since they have n't worked together in over 4 years now . hugh jackman recently retired the wolverine role with the release of the critically acclaimed logan in 2017 and has no desire to return , even after the disney and fox deal . ",
        "disney has acquired fox 's marvel properties and the internet has been abuzz with rumors of jackman returning to the role to fight along the avengers , but those are just rumors as jackman has moved on and is awaiting to see who gets to take over the wolverine role . hugh jackman 's can currently be seen in theaters in the greatest showman , in a role that is completely different than that of the gritty superhero that he portrayed for nearly 20 years . james marsden spent much of last year on the small screen on hbo 's popular westworld series , which is set to return with season 2 this spring . ",
        "while we wo n't be seeing hugh jackman and marsden as cyclops on the big screen again , it 's cool to see that they 're real-life buds after some rocky times between their characters in the x-men movies over the years . you can check out what james marsden calls the `` tired faces '' and what hugh jackman noted as their height differences in both of the reunion pictures that are posted below . the first picture of the reunion comes to us courtesy of hugh jackman 's instagram account .
