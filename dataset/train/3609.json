",
        "the level passed 200 micrograms per cubic meter in most districts -- eight times the world health organization 's standard of 25 micrograms per cubic meter for 24 hours . according to the shanghai environmental monitoring center , this round of pollution was mainly caused by pollutants carried into the city by a cold front from the north , which often happens at this time of year . blue alert was the first air pollution alarm issued by the environment authority this year . a blue alert is issued when there is moderate pollution -- an aqi between 151 and 200 and short-time heavy pollution over 200 is forecast in the next 24 hours .
