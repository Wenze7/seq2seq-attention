        "the new york jets are starting bryce petty over christian hackenberg , and he can be a better version of what we 've seen josh mccown do this season . josh mccown has become the latest quarterback of the new york jets to be beset by injury . since 1980 , no jets quarterback has started 16 games for this team . it 's hit the team badly since 1999 . vinny testaverde ruptured his achilles , chad pennington tore his rotator cuff , brett favre tore his biceps tendon , geno smith 's jaw was broken , and the shoulder of mark sanchez was injured as well . ",
        "the worst part is that favre and testaverde were both on teams that , with them , had super bowl aspirations . when mccown broke his left hand against the broncos , it was an all too familiar scene . now it 's next man up . mccown was supposed to abdicate his starting spot as one who was preparing the young guys to enter . now it 's time for the student to take over for the teacher . related story : nfl qb power rankings , week 16 : cam newton on the risebryce petty can excel in this offense , because not only does he have accuracy , he also has a much better arm than mccown . ",
        "not only do they now have a quarterback with a cannon for an arm , but robby anderson has developed into a no . 1 receiver . from petty 's first start last year and into the preseason this year , there seems to be a viable connection there . anderson has also developed into one of the league 's best deep threats . his speed also allows him to run after the catch . having a player with the arm talent of petty will only aid the yards after catch , because petty can get anderson the ball quicker . ",
        "the move may have been necessitated by injury , but it 's the right move . the combination of petty and anderson has huge potential to become a dangerous duo . petty will show how much he 's learned , and there may still be growing pains -- much like in week 15 . that said , he will be the guy going forward . more from nfl spin zone 2018 nfl mock draft : what if no quarterbacks went in round 1 ? 17m ago 2017 nfl picks , score predictions for week 161 h ago new york giants : jon gruden proves he should n't coach with one sentence13h ago jacksonville jaguars : huge victory over houston clinches a playoff spot13h ago new york jets : 4 takeaways from bryce petty in week 1514h ago the new york jets are starting bryce petty over christian hackenberg , and he can be a better version of what we 've seen josh mccown do this season .
