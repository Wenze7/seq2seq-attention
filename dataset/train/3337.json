        "2017 was a turning point for women in tech . with an avalanche of news swirling on the web about sexual harassment allegations and the #metoo movement spreading on social media , women are beginning to speak up . in this context , y combinator software engineer cadran cowansage announced today the official launch of leap , an online community by women for women . in a blog post published this morning , cowansage wrote : . i started building leap because i did n't have a place on the internet where i felt comfortable talking openly . i 've found that some conversations online escalate to shouting matches quickly and many people opt out , especially women . ",
        "i wondered what would happen if i created a community where the core culture was set by women , and the software and product decisions were also made by women . i could n't think of a social network defined that way , but i wanted to be part of one . she certainly has a point . be it facebook , twitter , snap , or linkedin , these social network powerhouses were all created by men . so far , leap has amassed more than 1,500 members in private beta . from founders to designers , marketers , software engineers , and vcs , females in tech are beginning to share technical articles , startup questions , job opportunities , career connections , parenting issues , and discussions about sexual harassment . ",
        "above : leap homepageimage credit : screenshot of leap homepage other recent female-centric initiatives include bumble bizz for professional networking , which launched last october , and office hours , a mentoring program for female founders that was launched by female vcs last november . before joining yc two years ago , cowansage worked as a senior software engineer at mongodb . her inspiration for leap came after she attended yc 's annual female founders conference in march 2014 , where yc alumni , partners , and women in tech gather to chat and exchange thoughts on the industry . ",
        "`` the conference was one of the few times i can recall spending an afternoon with hundreds of smart , talented women working in my industry , '' cowansage wrote in the blog post . `` at that time i had only a few female friends working in tech , and it was clear from the conference that there were many more of us than i realized . '' yc partners kat manalac and adora cheung are among the first users of leap .   "
