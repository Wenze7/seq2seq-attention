        "wellington 's water crisis is deepening despite usage dropping with the rollout of a sprinkler ban , and more restrictions are likely sooner rather than later . on friday , available water only outstripped usage by two million litres , and that was with the region already drawing heavily from emergency lake supplies that would normally remain untapped until late january . on first day of summer , seven per cent of the water in the lakes at te marua , north of upper hutt , had been drawn away . wellington water treatment plants manager jeremy mckibbin said daily usage had fallen from 182 million litres to 173 million litres since restrictions on sprinklers were imposed on wednesday night . ",
        "read more : but the total amount of water available had also fallen from 185 million litres to 175 million litres , leaving only a minimal buffer . target usage sat at 160 million litres per day for the region , and mckibbin urged residents to stick to the restrictions . `` every drop we take out of the lakes is a drop we do n't have at the end of summer when we really need it . it is relatively serious . '' in 23 years working on wellington 's water supply mckibbin said he had n't seen water levels so low in november , or restrictions come into forced this early in the year . ",
        "`` unless we do see some reduction in demand we may have to move to some more serious outdoor use bans sooner rather than later . i 'm hoping we get a good enough response from the public that we do n't have to do that . '' a total ban on outdoor water use , including restrictions on washing cars and buildings , could be a possibility . some areas had been cohering the existing bans more stringently than others , with residents in the lower hutt suburb of eastbourne seeming to be the worst offenders for ignoring sprinkler restrictions -- indicated by the number of residents dobbing in their neighbours and continued high water usage . ",
        "wellington water would be dropping off fliers to offending properties if residents continued to use sprinklers , with the possibility of prosecutions if residents continued . metservice meteorologist lisa murray said november was the second-driest year since records began in 1927 . this dry spell coincided with four of the eight bores at the knight rd aquifer being out of action due to emergency upgrades , which would usually supply around half the region 's water . but there may be some relief on the horizon with a new uv treatment facility at waiwhetu aquifer expected to be online in a couple of weeks , which would increase the amount of water that could be drawn . ",
        "sunshine hours had leapt up , with recordings from kelburn showing hours jumping from 180 hours last year , to 251 in 2017 . although the ridge of high pressure that has been sitting over wellington for the past couple of weeks was expected to weaken this weekend , murray said the the weather continues to be generally sunny and dry . a number of councils around the region have also put voluntary restrictions in place for their own water usage , including limiting the watering of parks , plantings , and the washing of cars and buildings . wellington wellington city council has already cut back on irrigation , but the city still intends to keep watering its sports fields , public lawns and plant collections . ",
        "parks , sports and recreation manager paul andrews said it would explore other ways to save on water `` if the drought conditions continue '' . it would water by hand `` where practical '' , pause field renovations until autumn 2018 , defer its annual building washdowns , set sprinklers for early mornings and evenings , and might stop or empty some of the city 's water features . porirua porirua city council will cut back on watering parks , lawns and gardens . in a statement , the council 's chief operating officer tamsin evans said residents would see some parks and reserves quickly `` browning off '' . ",
        "`` we want to do the right thing and conserve water as much as possible but at the same time we have recently invested in upgrading three of our key sports fields ; porirua park , endeavour park and ng훮ti toa domain , so we need to keep watering to ensure the grass establishes properly . `` loss of condition would jeopardise the playing surfaces for winter and we 'd face significant renovation costs . '' porirua park and endeavour park had in-ground irrigation systems which will operate at night . ng훮ti toa domain will be watered morning and evening by a mobile irrigator . ",
        "watering at the nursery would be done during cooler times of the day to protect young plants being grown for next winter 's planting season . lower hutt hutt city council parks manager bruce hodgins said contractors had been instructed to restrict water usage . a small amount of watering was being done but only in the morning or evening to minimise evaporation and only on a required basis . some areas still required watering , including particular plants in the percy reserve nursery and cricket pitches , hodgins said . wairarapa in carterton , no suspension of irrigating garden beds or washing council cars or buildings had been adopted , with thunderstorms earlier in the week taking pressure off supplies . ",
        "infrastructure and services manager garry baker said some water restrictions were in place due to the low flow in the kaipaitangata stream . `` staff will be monitoring daily usage ; if usage gets to high we will have introduce stage two of water restriction . stage two only allows for the use of hand held hosing on alternate days . '' `` if the situation worsens , we will then activate stage three , which would see a complete hosing ban . '' `` due to the low river flow , we have already started irrigating wastewater to daleton farm . ",
        "this started on 11 november which is at least five weeks earlier than the last three years . this proves what a dry season we are already having . '' k훮piti coast on the k훮piti coast , it is unlikely that water restrictions will need to be introduced this summer . infrastructure services group manager sean mallon said water consumption across the district had reduced since water meters were introduced in 2014 . `` people are now more aware of their water consumption and , as a result , peak water consumption has reduced by more than 26 percent . ",
        "`` mallon said this had helped the council secure more than enough water to manage even the worst drought conditions . `` if we have an extremely dry summer we can call on our bores to recharge the river if river levels get low , but this will not require us to apply water restrictions .
