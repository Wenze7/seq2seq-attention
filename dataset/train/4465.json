        "photo by wesley hitt/getty imagesthe 2018 nfl playoffs are set to begin on saturday . we 've got your nfl picks and score predictions to help you maneuver through the wild card round . it took four long months , but the 2018 nfl playoffs are finally upon us . back in september , 32 teams began their quest to reach the postseason . now , only 12 teams remain in a battle that ends in a single lombardi trophy being award to the last squad standing . with the wild card round set to begin on saturday , i 've put together my nfl picks and score predictions for the four upcoming games . ",
        "whether you 're just trying to figure out who will win or are betting your kid 's college fund hoping to score big , i 've got you covered . i 've put in the time to ensure these picks are solid , although i ca n't make any guarantees . so why trust me ? it 's a reasonable question . during the regular season , i made picks for every single game . when week 17 had come to a close , i had an overall record of 160-95 . now i 'll admit it 's not the greatest effort out there on the interwebs , but i 'd say i 'm proud of the picks i put together throughout the 2017 campaign .

        "related story : predicting where top 2018 free agents will landso without further ado , let 's take a look at my nfl picks and score predictions for the wild card round of the 2018 playoffs . just keep in mind that i assume no responsibility if you choose to bet money based on my picks -- that 's your decision , not mine . photo by elsa/getty imagesafc : kansas city chiefs vs tennessee titanssaturday , january 6 , 4:35 pm eti 'm guessing this one will be a blowout . the tennessee titans have limped their way into the postseason , needing a pitiful effort by the jacksonville jaguars to help them get in . ",
        "meanwhile , the kansas city chiefs are on a tear and do n't appear interested in slowing down this weekend . more from nfl spin zone chicago bears : john fox could n't adjust , now he is out17h ago detroit lions : looking at replacements for jim caldwell18h ago predicting the outcome of the entire 2018 nfl playoffs19h ago jacksonville jaguars : too many sour notes in music city21h ago new york jets : report card vs. patriots in week 1722h ago since matt nagy took over as the chiefs ' playcaller , they 've won four straight games , never scoring less than 26 points along the way . ",
        "alex smith is getting back to early-season form , and kareem hunt is showing us the explosiveness that has made him a nightmare for opposing defenses all season long . i mean , there is a reason he ended 2017 as the rushing yards leader . as for the titans , they 've been miserable in the month of december . they lost three straight before their week 17 win , and even that game was awful considering how many opportunities tennessee had to blow the game wide open . marcus mariota is having a down year , and the running game has n't pulled its weight either . ",
        "the chiefs will face a stiff test at some point this postseason , but it wo n't be against the titans . this will serve as a warmup game for what lies ahead for kansas city during the divisional round . prediction : chiefs win 34-10photo by otto greule jr / getty imagesnfc : los angeles rams vs atlanta falcons saturday , january 6 , 8:15 pm etif you 're looking for a high-octane offensive assault , this is the wild card contest for you . both of these clubs boast top 10 offenses , and the los angeles rams were the top scoring team in the league during the regular season . ",
        "put simply , points will be come in bunches on saturday evening . unfortunately for the falcons , i do n't see them outscoring the rams . while they do sport a talented bunch of playmakers , matt ryan , julio jones and devonta freeman have been wildly inconsistent compared to last season . one game they look like the bunch of stars that just played in a super bowl 11 months ago . the next , not so much . meanwhile , the rams have been deadly in just about every game . apart from a few off days against top defenses , jared goff , todd gurley and the los angeles offense have been nearly unstoppable . ",
        "there 's a reason gurley is considered one of the top mvp candidates of 2017 . in the end , i think the rams get the best of the falcons because of their defense , though . they 've had one of the league 's best pass rushes this season , and have done a great job of creating turnovers . a few key plays from the los angeles defense should seal the deal . prediction : rams win 28-24photo by logan bowles/getty imagesafc : jacksonville jaguars vs buffalo billssunday , january 7 , 1:05 pm etjust when blake bortles appeared to be putting it all together , he tanked the jaguars ' last two games . ",
        "that 's why i 'm a tad skeptical heading into the wild card round -- which bortles will we see , and is the jacksonville defense ready to make up for any shortcomings ? whatever the answer to that question may be , i do n't think we need to worry . why ? because it 's the buffalo bills . and while they 've managed to stay relevant this season , their offense is far too inept to really cause a commotion against a jaguars defense that is one of the best in the nfl . tyrod taylor will do his darndest to move the ball , and may even make a big play or two . ",
        "however , a hobbled lesean mccoy is going to make it very difficult for buffalo to put significant points on the board . that 's not to say they wo n't score , but i do n't see them finding the end zone early or often on sunday . as long as bortles avoids making too many mistakes and the jacksonville ground game can get going , the jaguars should walk away victorious . it wo n't be a close cakewalk by any means , but the no . 3 seed has enough talent to at least survive the first round . ",
        "prediction : jaguars win 23-20photo by kevin c. cox/getty imagesnfc : new orleans saints vs carolina panthers sunday , january 7 , 4:40 pm eton the surface , this seems like an easy choice . the new orleans saints are the higher seed , swept the carolina panthers in their regular season series , and have the consistent offense their nfc south foes could only dream of . yet , for some strange reason , i 'm going with the panthers in this one . every time i 've started doubting carolina this season , they found a way to put me in my place . ",
        "cam newton may not be his 2015 self , but he 's made some plays while relying heavily on jonathan stewart , christian mccaffrey and devin funchess to help carry the load . it 's not the offense that has me leaning towards the panthers , though . instead , it 's their defense . it 's been one of the best in the league this year , excelling specifically at slowing opposing ground games . as it so happens , the saints have relied heavily on running backs mark ingram and alvin kamara this season to put points on the board . ",
        "obviously drew brees and the passing game have played a big part , but carolina also boasts an underrated secondary . this should be a close , low-scoring affair that sees more than its fair share of turnovers . when the clock finally strikes zero , though , the panthers will be ahead on the scoreboard , finding themselves in the divisional round of the playoffs . prediction : panthers win 17-16the 2018 nfl playoffs are set to begin on saturday . we 've got your nfl picks and score predictions to help you maneuver through the wild card round .

        "it took four long months , but the 2018 nfl playoffs are finally upon us . back in september , 32 teams began their quest to reach the postseason . n. . .   "
