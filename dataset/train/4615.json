        "ryan mayer . the college football bowl season kicks off this saturday afternoon with the celebration bowl , featuring grambling and north carolina a&t . after that , the 39 bowl games featuring fbs teams kick off and it 's two-plus straight weeks of postseason college football action . football will be played on every day of the week leading up to the college football playoff semifinal games that will take place on new year 's day . there will be plenty of discussion over the next couple weeks about which bowl match-up is the best , and who has the edge in the semifinal games . ",
        "to help break it down for you , we caught up with former georgia bulldogs qb and current cbs sports college football analyst , aaron murray . > > more : . cbs local sports : bowl season is here , as you look across the slate of games outside of the two semifinal match-ups , which bowl sticks out to you as the most intriguing ? aaron murray : the one that i 'm really looking forward to is the ucf-auburn game . this ucf team has shown that they are a really good football team by going undefeated this year , 12-0 . ",
        "but going against an auburn team that is still one of the best teams in the country . they 're big , they 're fast , they 're physical . this ucf team is going to get a chance to prove why they , in years to come , may be ... one of those teams into a playoff eventually . they 'll have their chance to prove why they belong with the big boys when they play auburn in atlanta in the chick-fil-a peach bowl . cbs local sports : glad you mentioned ucf , because they were part of the coaching carousel this year , with scott frost moving to nebraska and josh heupel taking over in his stead . ",
        "what did you think of the hire ? aaron murray : i love it . everyone ended up in a great place . obviously , scott frost did a tremendous job in his couple of years at ucf , taking a team that had 0 wins in 2015 , getting them to six wins last year and then going undefeated this year . the turnaround there is awesome , and he has left some great players behind . they are stacked with talent on both sides of the football . for a new coach , that 's what you want . ",
        "you want to come to a team that 's undefeated ; that 's not a bad gig to come in to . then you add in the fact that you 're in florida , with the amount of talent that is in that state . you look around florida too , and florida state is a little bit down , florida is a little bit down , miami is getting better and better , but they 're in a good spot right now to recruit some guys , maybe some of the second-tier guys that people may not give a chance . ",
        "you can get them there . there 's just so much talent all throughout the state of florida that they 're going to be in a good spot with that new coaching staff coming in . cbs local sports : is there a player that you 're particularly excited to watch this bowl season ? aaron murray : for me , i 'm interested to see baker mayfield , what he does after winning the heisman . everyone always says there 's a little bit of a heisman curse or jinx or whatever it is . just the amount of media and distractions that he 's having to deal with this week and next week leading up to their game versus georgia . ",
        "i 'm interested to see how he handles it . that 's one of the big things for him , not so much what he does on the football field and playing-wise , but rather some of his antics off the field and during games . there 's going to be a lot of distractions . a lot of people grabbing him , dragging him from one place to the next . he has to make sure he stays focused because he 's going against a really talented georgia defense . interested to see how he handles the whole spotlight . ",
        "he 's been in the spotlight , but now you 've got that heisman on your back a little bit , and that just makes the bullseye a little bit bigger . cbs local sports : let 's get to that game , the bulldogs won the sec championship by dominating auburn on the ground . how do you think that rushing attack will do against a sooners defense that has acquitted itself well in big games this year ? aaron murray : the sooners defense has played well in big games . it 's funny , because you watch some games with oklahoma -- the oklahoma state game in particular -- and it looks like 7-on-7 out there , throwing it back and forth . ",
        "it was comical . but then , you look at the fact that they played tcu well in both games , giving up 20 points and 17 points respectively . west virginia , they gave up 31 , but that 's a high-powered offense for west virginia , so that 's pretty good . and , early in the year , they shut ohio state down . you just do n't know what you 're going to get from their defense . they have n't faced an offense like georgia yet this year . both teams defensively have n't faced the types of offenses they 're going to see in this game before . ",
        "oklahoma really has n't faced a ground-and-pound team like georgia . most of the big 12 teams are going to spread you out and pass the ball . georgia is more traditional , get in the i-formation , run it and then go play-action from there . on the flip side , georgia defensively really has n't seen a spread offense , vertical passing game like oklahoma has . auburn is a little bit similar , but they 're still heavy run-first with kerryon johnson to set up the play-action , and let jarrett stidham throw it from there . ",
        "so both defenses are going to have a challenge because they really have n't seen it much this season . the good thing is they do have a month to prep and get ready for these unique offenses . for georgia , the biggest key for them ... their best defense against oklahoma is going to be their offense . can they stay on the field ? can they run the ball ? can they eat up the clock ? because it 's hard , with baker , the sooners offensive line , and the speed they have at receiver , to really slow that offensive powerhouse down once they 're on the field . ",
        "cbs local sports : in the other semifinal , it 's the rematch . the third time we 'll have seen clemson play alabama in the college football playoff , but this time it 's in a semifinal as opposed to the national championship game . what do you see when you look at this year 's version of both teams ? aaron murray : i tell you what , alabama is a scary football team right now . they should be healthier , i do n't know how completely healthy they will be . and teams nowadays are n't really ever completely healthy this time of year . ",
        "but , they had the week off , they did n't have to play in the conference championship game . they have the shortest distance to travel for a bowl game , only having to head down to new orleans for the sugar bowl . and they 're hungry . they have a little bit of a chip on their shoulder , so they 're going to be a dangerous football team . but clemson , besides the syracuse game , they 've looked really good . kelly bryant has gotten better and better each week as a passer . ",
        "he had a tremendous game throwing the ball against miami , who has a really good defense , a team that has been getting turnovers all year long , especially interceptions . bryant looked great against them . it 's going to be fun . the big difference is going to be how hurts plays for alabama . can he play the type of mistake-free football that he 's played all year with only the one interception ? can he utilize his legs is another big question . for both of these defenses , it 's about how can you contain these quarterbacks and keep them in the pocket and make them beat you with their arms . ",
        "if either one of them gets out of the pocket , and can break down a secondary to where they 're having to say , ` do i stay with my coverage , or do i get off my coverage to go try and stop a running quarterback ? ' that really puts those guys in a predicament . it 's all going to be about containing those guys , and both of these teams have tremendous front fours .   "
