        "davos , switzerlandafter a difficult election , german chancellor angela merkel has a more sober view of migration and its impact . speaking at the annual gathering at the world economic forum in davos , she described the political challenges migration to europe had created . merkel is still in the process of securing a coalition to govern four months after the election , or as merkel described it , `` in a special situation . '' she paid a political price in september 's election for a 2015 policy to open germany 's borders and let in some one million refugees over the next year . ",
        "german voters put a far-right party , the alternative for germany , in parliament for the first time since world war ii . `` polarization is something we see in this country as well , which we have n't seen in decades , '' merkel said . the lingering effects of the euro-zone debt crisis and migration were part of what caused this , she said . some german voters believe that other european countries were overly benefitting from germany 's prosperity since germany partly funded bailouts , merkel said . additionally , a `` great influx '' of migration made some germans feel something was being taken away from them . ",
        "when this is combined with unemployment , there is a `` a very poisonous mix '' that creates social divisions , merkel said . she did n't go as far as to say she regretted that germany welcomed the migrants , despite the toxic politics that followed . hitting on the conference 's theme of a `` shared future , '' merkel said that many people were worried about whether multilateralism would be able to provide the answers for issues including the impact of digital transformation on society . but like several other leaders speaking at the conference this week she argued strongly against protectionism and isolation , in what seems like a collective message aimed at donald trump 's `` america first '' policy . ",
        "populism was a `` poison '' to be rejected , she said . even while extolling the virtues of international cooperation , merkel warned that europe could n't rely on every other country for everything . europe recently signed a pact to create a joint defense force in response to america 's step back from the global stage . `` the fact that europe in its foreign policy has not been all that active in the past -- we quite often relied as with regards to security on the united states of america , and now they are focusing on themselves and their security -- tells us a lesson , '' she said . ",
        "`` we need to take more responsibility . '' while brits in the audience might have been encouraged that they were n't forgotten , they might not have liked that they heard . merkel said that it was `` regrettable ' that the uk voted to leave the eu but that it has encouraged the region to focus on big important issues . the election of french president emmanuel macron had created a `` new impetus '' that will strengthen the bloc , she said . macron will take the same stage at davos later today and britain 's prime minister theresa may is speaking tomorrow . ",
        "in a wide-ranging speech merkel also spoke about the need to germany to stop `` lagging behind '' in technology and digitalization . she pointed to estonia as an example of a country far more advanced , with estonia 's government famously tech-savvy and considering launching a cryptocurrency . merkel said europe needed to create a digital single market and that it was under `` great pressure '' from big american companies that have access to lots of data . `` data is the raw material of the 21st century , '' merkel sad . `` and the question ` who owns that data ? ' ",
        "will decide in the end whether democracy , a participatory social model , and economic prosperity can be combined . ''   "
