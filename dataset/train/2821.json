        "if you want the real inside story of competing at an olympics , just say `` pyc . `` that 's the name of cbc sports ' latest podcast , debuting tuesday , jan. . 23 and available wherever you download your podcasts . pyc podcast -- short for pyeongchang -- features canadian olympic athletes , both past and present , providing their unique and up-close perspective on the world 's biggest sporting event . kelly vanderbeek , host of olympic overnight and a former olympic skier , says the format works well in bringing out the stories . `` perhaps it has to do with a comfort level in talking to a retired athlete , perhaps it 's something else , but all my guests seemed authentically unguarded , '' vanderbeek said . ",
        "`` these are intimate and thoroughly canadian conversations . `` i was surprised to hear one athlete describe standing naked atop st. moritz , and chagrined to learn how doping scandals made another athlete question their olympic pursuits altogether . '' episodes include : - former downhiller steve podborski on the good old days of the crazy canucks . - cross-country gold medallist and wada member beckie scott on the twin challenges of fighting cheating and the cynicism that goes with it . - figure skating great kurt browning takes us on a funny and insightful behind-the-scenes tour of the skaters to watch . ",
        "pyc podcast will release a new episode almost daily during the olympics , which run feb. . 9-25 .   "
