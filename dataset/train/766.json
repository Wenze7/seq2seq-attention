        "allen park , mich. . -- with their playoff hopes teetering , the detroit lions have plenty at stake when they play at cincinnati this weekend . the fact that receiver marvin jones will be facing his old team barely registers . `` i 'm just going to see a couple of friends that i have there , '' jones said wednesday . `` but other than that , it 's no significance . `` jones spent his first four years in the nfl with the bengals before signing with detroit in 2016 . sunday 's game will be his first back in cincinnati , but he does n't see a lot of nostalgia in the matchup , although he does keep in touch with some of the guys he played with . ",
        "`` we 're always on the group text , every week , '' jones said . `` me , mohamed sanu , a. j. , andrew hawkins . `` of that foursome , only green is still with cincinnati , which may explain why this game is n't that personal to jones . the move to detroit has worked out fine for him . he arrived just after the lions had lost calvin johnson to retirement , and in his first season with detroit , jones caught 55 passes for 930 yards , the latter figure a career high . ",
        "with two games to go this season , he has 54 receptions for 970 yards -- and he 's eyeing the 1,000-yard mark . `` it 's always a milestone for a receiver to go over a thousand , '' he said . `` so yeah , i 'm looking forward to it . `` detroit is running out of time to make up ground in the playoff race , but the passing game has been doing its part . in fact , the lions have largely withstood the loss of johnson before last season . golden tate has 82 catches this season , and jones leads the team in yards receiving . ",
        "it 's clear quarterback matthew stafford has confidence in jones as a deep threat . `` marv 's put a lot of work in . i think our system and the system he came from in cincinnati is quite a bit different , and he did a great job of adjusting , putting the work in , '' stafford said . `` and then , on sundays he just goes out there and makes plays . i 'm giving him chances on certain throws , and he 's going up and making me right more often than not . so , it 's nice to have . ",
        "`` detroit needed another productive season from jones , since anquan boldin was gone from last year 's team , and rookie kenny golladay has n't been totally healthy . this week , the lions put receiver tj jones on injured reserve , so he 's no longer available after catching 30 passes this season . still , stafford leads the nfc in yards passing , and he 's thrown for 25 touchdowns with only nine interceptions . all that despite being sacked 43 times -- and with little support from the running game . right now , stafford 's top targets include tate , marvin jones , golladay , running back theo riddick and tight end eric ebron . ",
        "the improvements stafford has noticed in jones suddenly seem even more important . `` i think just precision and his route running has gotten a whole lot better , and with that has come separation at the top of routes and all that kind of stuff , the better you get at running them , '' stafford said . `` some of the routes that we 're asking him to run here are probably different than what he had done in the past , so it took some time , and some effort , and some concentration , and focus on those details and he 's done a nice job with that .
