        "when twitter and facebook executives appeared before the senate intelligence committee last year to answer questions about their social networks ' role in allowing `` malfeasance '' in the 2016 election , the world was watching . during the hearings , the reps were grilled by the senators as to what they knew , when they knew it , and how they were making changes to stop `` meddling '' in the future . as they left , each company was given homework . they were to answer additional questions , and all agreed to do so . now twitter has missed the deadline . ",
        "cnn contacted the company to find out why -- and a twitter spokesperson said it was `` working closely with the committee '' to provide the answers . `` we look forward to finalizing our responses soon . . . '' other sources within the company said they were `` not surprised '' the social network missed the deadline , mainly because it does n't have the information required to answer the questions . according to the source , unlike facebook , which was able to detail how many people were duped and by whom , twitter has not `` internally admitted how bad of a problem it is . ",
        ". . they need to talk about the problems so that everyone 's aware of them and everyone can get on the same page of how to solve them . . . the reality is they do n't know the total number because they do n't have the data needed or systems needed to figure out what that number is . '' so , at this point , it does n't look like `` soon '' will be any time -- soon . what happens now ? what authority does the senate committee have to drop the proverbial hammer on twitter for noncompliance ? ",
        "that 's unclear at this point , and people , though some are willing to speculate , are not making specific predictions . meanwhile , twitter continues to work to come back from a frustrating 2017 , despite the fact that it is president trump 's favored social media channel . in addition to the trouble with the government , the social media network had a disappointing business year . while much of the news media these days includes or involves tweets , especially from the president or celebrities , the network still does n't have the reach , popularity or profitability of facebook . ",
        "twitter did try to branch out , showing live sports in 2016 . while the effort went somewhat well , their pioneering effort has been overshadowed by amazon . com , which did live sports streaming better , both in style and in audience . that does n't mean twitter is n't relevant . it certainly is popular and profitable . but in a world going increasingly online , the company has to keep up to stay competitive . this issue with the government is something twitter does n't need hanging over its head . ronn torossian is one of america 's foremost public relations executives as founder/ceo of 5wpr , a leading independent public relations agency .
