        "iowa city , iowa -- iowa expected to lose cornerback josh jackson to the nfl after his standout junior season . the hawkeyes also were n't surprised to see junior center james daniels go - and he might be just as hard to replace as jackson . iowa will have plenty of key spots to fill , and jackson and daniels ' departures only made that challenge more difficult . still , the hawkeyes head into winter workouts on a high after snapping a five-game postseason skid by beating boston college 27-20 in the pinstripe bowl . `` i think everything about the way we won the bowl game is really representative of what we need to do to have success certainly , and hopefully that win will give us a good jolt of energy , '' coach kirk ferentz said wednesday at his first news conference since that win over the eagles . ",
        "iowa prides itself on a tough , balanced offense spearheaded by a cohesive line . that was n't the case at times in 2017 after the hawkeyes lost senior starting tackles ike boettger and boone myers early in the season . iowa will also lose graduating guard sean welsh , so finding a new center and developing freshman tackles alaric jackson and tristan wirfs - both elevated to starting jobs way ahead of schedule in 2017 - will be crucial this offseason . `` we would have been a different team with ike and boone out there . and i say it with all due respect to the players that played , but especially at that position , when you have guys that have been around a little bit , '' ferentz said . ",
        "`` with that being said , guys we had out there were capable and i 'm really excited , again , just going back to that bowl film . you watch the film . there are so many things technically we can do better . but that 's experience . it 's not just the maturity part , but experience and repetition . `` welsh appears to have a bright future in the nfl - and so does daniels as evidenced by the lavish praise from ferentz , a longtime offensive line coach in the pros . `` i 'll say this about james : just i do n't know if i 've ever coached a more talented center prospect . ",
        "that includes my time in the nfl . he 's got some skills that are just really unusual . and he 's a really intelligent guy , '' ferentz said . `` one interesting thing about him , you get the feedback from the nfl folks . that 's strictly off film . they have n't had a chance to investigate the kind of person he is and his intelligence . `` the loss of quarterback tyler wiegers to eastern michigan as a graduate transfer has left the backup job `` wide open , '' according to ferentz . redshirt freshman peyton mansell and incoming freshman spencer petras are likely the front runners to back up starter nate stanley . ",
        "at running back , ferentz said toren young and ivory kelly-martin are the two candidates most likely to replace seniors akrum wadley and james butler . defensive lineman matt nelson , a two-year starter who suffered an undisclosed injury in the pinstripe bowl , will sit out spring workouts but is expected to be ready by fall camp .
