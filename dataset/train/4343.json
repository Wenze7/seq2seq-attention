        "ready for your group-vacation prep to get a lot less stressful ? instead of having to cover the airbnb costs for your annual bestie getaway upfront , the site 's new feature will save you the struggle . airbnb just announced its new split-pay tool , which allows you and all your bffs to divide the reservation costs from the get-go , à la uber 's split-fare feature . and , it 's super easy to use : the feature allows you to make a reservation and invite your friends . then , if everyone makes the payment deadline of 72 hours , you 're good to go -- otherwise the stay is canceled . ",
        "not only does this tool remove the need for you to empty your entire bank account just to get the ball rolling for an upcoming trip , but it also prevents the whole never-getting-paid-back thing from happening , which is much more common than you even realize . airbnb surveyed 2,000 american wanderlusters and found 43 percent of those traveling in groups lost $ 1,000 or more in repayments -- and 18 percent lost $ 10,000 or more , condé nast traveler reported . sounds like the makings for an awkward flight home , huh ? luckily , you 're now set to travel the world with your besties worry - and resentment-free -- and with a whole lot more money in your pocket . ",
        "so where should the fun begin ? experience the northern lights with these iceland airbnbs . or go on a boho-style vacay in mexico .   "
