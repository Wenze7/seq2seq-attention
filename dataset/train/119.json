        "london - the head of britain 's social mobility commission has quit , accusing prime minister theresa may of being too fixated on brexit to improve the prospects of those from less privileged backgrounds , the sunday times newspaper reported . may has vowed to create an economy which works for all britons but chairman alan milburn , a former minister in tony blair 's labour government , said she was failing to deliver on her promises . `` the worst position in politics is to set out a proposition that you 're going to heal social divisions and then do nothing about it , '' milburn was quoted as saying by the sunday times newspaper . ",
        "`` talking the talk is all very well , but you also need to walk the walk . i see precisely no chance of making progress . they are so concerned with brexit that there is no bandwidth to focus on any of this stuff . '' the entire board , including milburn , has resigned , the sunday times reported . a spokeswoman at the social mobility commission , a public body which monitors progress towards improving social mobility , could not immediately be reached for comment late on saturday . two ministers have quit may 's cabinet in the last month , placing strain on the government as it nears a crucial summit on britain 's exit from the european union . ",
        "an opinion poll published for the mail on sunday newspaper put labour on 45 percent with the ruling conservatives on 37 percent , the biggest lead for opposition leader jeremy corbyn 's party in a survey by pollster survation since late 2013 . `` an 8 point lead would put the labour party into overall majority territory if such vote share totals were reflected at the ballot box , '' survation said .
