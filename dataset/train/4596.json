        "china 's first space station had a good run , but it 's about time for the tiangong-1 to pack it in . china reports the station will fall out of orbit sometime in march , but it does n't know exactly when or where that will happen . there is some concern that pieces of the 9.4-ton station will reach earth 's surface , but you probably do n't need to fret -- the odds of it causing damage are remote . china launched the tiangong-1 module in 2011 as its first manned space station , but it was n't intended as a long-term base of operations like the international space station . ",
        "tiangong-1 was more a proof of concept -- a way for the china national space administration to test its ideas about autonomous orbital docking and modular space station design . chinese astronauts visited tiangong-1 several times , most recently in 2013 . upon leaving , the crew set the station to sleep mode with the intention of leaving it that way for some time . china 's space agency wanted to track tiangong-1 over the course of several years to test the long-term viability of certain components , but the station had already completed its intended mission . thus , it was n't a great tragedy when ground control lost contact with tiangong-1 in 2016 . ",
        "the cause of the communications failure is n't known , but teams around the world have been tracking the station remotely ever since . that 's how we know it 'll crash to earth at some point in march of this year . furthermore , we know it 'll most likely hit the surface between 43 degrees north and 43 degrees south latitudes . part of the us is technically in the potential impact zone , but it 's more likely the debris just ends up in the ocean . crew entering tiangong-1 for the first time . when tiangong-1 enters the atmosphere , most of the 10-meter-long station will break up into tiny pieces , but the engines are probably too dense to break apart . ",
        "those 220 pound components are expected to reach the surface intact . tiangong-1 also carries a supply of hydrazine propellant , which is highly toxic . as long as the engines do n't land right next to your house , there 's nothing to worry about . china will not be left without a space station when tiangong-1 crashes to earth . it launched the tiangong-2 module in 2016 , and it continues to operate normally . chinese astronauts visited the tiangong-2 in 2016 , staying for 30 days . that was a record for chinese-operated space stations and twice as long as astronauts lived on tiangong-1 .
