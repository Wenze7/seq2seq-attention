",
        "adonis cutchlow , of the lax police , told the la times there had been no criminal or illegal activity on board the plane , and it was not clear why it had turned back . ` so many questions ` the plane should have flown 11 hours to tokyo . instead , passengers spent eight hours in the air only to return to the same airport . according to a series of tweets posted by ms teigen to her 9.2 million followers from the plane , the passenger in question boarded the ana flight with a ticket from united airlines .
