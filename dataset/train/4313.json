        "children 's story : there was no room for errors . the stage was set . the play was about to start . the audience was waiting for the most-awaited main event of the school . how could there be any error in this occasion of innocent souls ? it was n't an annual function . it was n't a farewell event . it was n't a fresher 's party . it was children 's day . the title read : children 's story . a 5-year old kid then came to the mic and spoke : accept us who we are . ",
        "please , do n't scare us unnecessarily . support us in what we want to do desperately . motivate us when we fall immaturely . hold us in the trouble times . we are sure it 's temporary . my poem may not rhyme every time . but , i always try . i do homework . i long for the cricket bat for my papa to buy . i become sad and sometimes i cry . let us be us . let a child be a child . dedicated to , all the children whose confidence moves the mountains , every lil ones whose hopes sprinkle like fountains , the aspiring authors , painters , guitarist , engineers & doctors .

        "the unconventional round peg in a square hole . optimism : she giggled as he slipped over a patch of ice on the sidewalk . she did n't know that her laughter will not stay longer . samrat was in pain . jeenu carefully gave him the hand to stand up but when she heard his sigh while getting up , she knew that her leg would have been fractured . all the way to the hospital , the nurse beside them was watching both of them . `` jeenu in her wheelchairs and god forbids ... . . '' ",
        ", the nurse stopped her imagination right there . the basic treatment was already given in the van . they were about to reach the hospital . jeenu 's face lost the shine and samrat 's shine faded away while looking at her . samrat kept screaming without a halt and the nurse could n't get hold of her negative thoughts however she managed . `` boyfriend-girlfriend ? '' the nurse asked . `` yes '' `` since ? '' `` 3 years '' when they arrived at the hospital , the nurse asked jeenu , `` what if he has to face the same situation like yours ? '' ",
        ". jeenu said , `` it does n't matter . i met him 3 years ago when he saw me on the road lying . by the way , it was a patch of ice , nurse , not a 100 km/hour car that thrashed him . '' comedy : it was a dark and stormy night . once upon a time in my younger years when there were only few atm vestibules in the city , i was trapped inside one of them because duh the lights were out and by the time i imagined to die inside that dark hollow place , a sweet sound echoed , `` hello , please help . '' ",
        "with her smartphone 's flash light , she made ujjala . she saw me ; i could n't . unfortunately , all she could see through my drenched body was a lighter . she asked me for it . i said , `` i ... . . i do n't smoke . it was for a friend . actually , i am wearing his pants . you know , i ... . you can light it . '' i gave the lighter to her . she started smoking . that day , i could n't . time passed and i thought i could make my first move towards her because ` in the end , it does n't even matter ' . ",
        "i did n't remember why linkin park came to my mind then . anyways . as soon as i touched her shoulder , there was ujjala light ka and before i could say anything , that same voice said , `` hi , yeah , i am a guy and my voice sounds like a girl . i 'm sorry '' , he said & went with my lighter .
