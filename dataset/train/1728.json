        "the first-ever detection of an asteroid from beyond the solar system revealed a remarkable object . about 400 meters long and only 40 meters wide , ` oumuamua 's axis ratio of 10:1 makes it the most elongated asteroid ever discovered . the highest axis ratio we see for asteroids in the solar system is only about 3:1 . the odd shape is perhaps a clue about when the asteroid was flung from its own star during the formation of that solar system , or perhaps it can tell us something about what happens to space rocks when they fly through interstellar space for millions of years . ",
        "and of course there is another remote possibility . perhaps , just maybe , the object is elongated because it is artificial , the equivalent of a rocket booster or a probe from an advanced extraterrestrial species . fortunately for the believers , yuri milner and breakthrough listen are going to point the largest fully-steerable radio telescope in the world , the 100-meter green bank telescope , at the object , which is currently about twice as far away from earth as the sun . the green bank telescope in west virginia . nrao/aui . avi loeb , a professor of the harvard-smithsonian center for astrophysics who has written multiple papers on the search for extraterrestrial life , first brought the unique properties of the object to yuri milner 's attention , suggesting the object could be artificial . ",
        "`` this is the first interstellar object to be discovered and its axis ratio is so extreme . therefore when i first learned about it i started wondering whether it might be an artificially-made probe which was sent by an alien civilization , '' loeb wrote in notes about the early observation of ` oumuamua provided to popular mechanics . he goes on to point out that the `` keplerian orbit '' of the object , meaning its trajectory can be explained with just the gravitational encounter of the sun , makes it unlikely that the object is a controlled space probe . ",
        "`` most likely , this is just a large rock , but it is worth checking for any radio signal to be sure . `` the gbt observations of ` oumuamua , which is hawaiian for `` scout , '' will be valuable to astronomers even if the object turns out to be nothing more than an asteroid . in the first observations , the interstellar rock did not appear to have a cloud of debris following it known as a coma , which suggests it does not have any water ice . the gbt radio observations should be able to determine more accurately whether or not the object has any ice or surrounding debris . ",
        "`` thus far , observations have focused on natural emission or been restricted to engineering tests to establish our ability to target the object , '' andrew siemion , director of the seti research center at the university of california berkeley , said in an email to popular mechanics . `` the upcoming observations will be more sensitive and more complete , allowing us to search for a wide variety of signals over more than 10 ghz of the radio spectrum . `` based on the changing brightness of the light reflected by ` oumuamua , astronomers have determined that it rotates around its axis about every eight hours . ",
        "the breakthrough listen observations will capture each side of the interstellar object to give us the best idea of what it 's made of , and perhaps a clue as to where it came from , be it mothership or neighbor star .   "
