        "pokemon go quickly became a global phenomenon when it was launched in 2016 . since developer niantic did n't have a local partner in china , it was n't able to launch the game in the world 's largest smartphone market . two years after the game was originally launched , it 's finally making its way to china as niantic has struck a deal with a local partner . the augmented reality game became popular not only because of pokemon but because it made users get up and go outside . players had to find and capture pokemon in the real world and then use the captive monsters to fight other players . ",
        "niantic has teamed up with local firm netease to launch pokemon go in china . foreign firms are bound by law to launch digital ventures in china with a local company . since it did n't have a partner before , niantic could n't launch the game in china even as its popularity reached crazy heights globally . however , niantic has n't confirmed precisely when the title is going to be released in china . niantic recently confirmed plans for a new augmented reality game based on the harry potter franchise . it has the potential to be even bigger than pokemon go given the massive fan following that this franchise has .
