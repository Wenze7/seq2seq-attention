        "after andy played beholder last year he described it as a cross between papers , please and gloomy east berlin police drama the lives of others , which sounds about as bleak as a game could get . you were a landlord employed by the government to spy on your neighbors , forced to grass them up or else risk your job , and your family 's lives . you can expect more moral dilemmas like that from beholder 2 , which developer warm lamp games has announced with a teaser trailer , above . the difference this time around is that you 're embedded within a department of the totalitarian state . ",
        "you begin at the bottom of the ladder and work your way up , no doubt leaving a trail of wrecked careers in your wake . the trailer gives little away other than the fact there 's stacks of paperwork , but the steam page suggests it will be pretty free form . you can play by the book and serve the top brass , or you can make a move for the prime minister 's hot seat yourself . you can even be a whistle blower , if you 're feeling particularly brave , which suggests a wider story with protest groups fighting against the state . ",
        "beholder 2 will be out in the second half of 2018 . the steam page is here . thanks , rps .   "
