        "the arizona coyotes , at the time long overdue for a uniform change , rolled out their current uniforms in time for the 2015-16 national hockey league season . however , the new rendition leaves much to be desired . an unbalanced messat first glance , the addition of black seems to be a welcome one , given the relative blandness of the previous edition . illustration by andrew m. greenstein , the black certainly livens up the jersey , but still does n't solve the fundamental problem that has plagued the ` yotes ' duds since 2007 : a lack of tail striping . ",
        "many teams went along with this unfortunate trait of the reebok edge uniform system , before realising it looked silly -- even practice-y -- to not have anything at the bottom of the jersey . the toronto maple leafs and the st. louis blues are examples of teams that , dissatisfied with the redesign , reverted -- smartly -- back to a jersey with tail striping . arizona would do well to follow suit . on a different note , the modifications made to the sleeves creates a new problem : there are now three colours on the sleeve , which , in the current arrangement , looks overly busy when compared to the single colour of the jersey body . ",
        "in addition , the stripes on the sleeves are not only all different colours , but differently sized as well , with no discernible symmetry . all this busyness combines to make the coyote 's latest effort unbalanced and disorienting . though pippi longstocking might approve , the human eye does not . they even have their captaincy letters on the right-hand side ... who do they think they are , the red wings ? ! as for the rest of the kit , the black pants actually look rather nice when contrasted with the white or brick red of the jersey body . ",
        "however , the socks carry over the unfortunate condition of the jersey sleeves ; just far too much going on . though confusing to look at , perhaps even more importantly , it still manages , somehow , to be as uninspiring as the old model . what if all the stripes were wiggly lines ? what if the players wore the jerseys inside out ? what if they set them on fire before taking the ice ? they would still look unpleasant , but at least it would n't be boring . bad genesthe current iteration of the coyotes jersey manages to be both frustrating and uninspiring at the same time . ",
        "if you 're wondering why you 're not surprised by that , this is swiftly becoming a theme with the coyotes . check out their last couple efforts , starting with those introduced for 2003-04 . illustration by andrew m. greenstein , at first glance , these kits are not half-bad . the slim-thick-slim pattern on the sleeve and tail striping is as traditional as hockey jerseys can get , and the brick red and white contrast nicely with each other . curiously , the shoulder patch only appears on one shoulder . lace-up collars are always appreciated , though i would have liked to see them on the away jersey as well as the home . ",
        "the home jersey could also have used the contrasting collar present on the away version , but now i 'm just being nitpicky . where this uniform really falls down is that ... well , again , it 's boring . be honest : you probably remember them best on goaltender brian boucher , flailing about on the ice while alex ovechkin scored his ridiculous behind-the-back goal . two-tone colour schemes generally work when the secondary colour is plentiful enough to provide a visually satisfying counter to the primary . take the toronto maple leafs , for example . on the home jerseys , there is enough white to ensure that blue does not wash out the visual , and vice versa for their road kits . ",
        "this coyotes entry placed too much emphasis on the primary colour ; the stripes were simply not thick enough to counteract the background colour , and contrasting shoulder yokes were not included . as a result , the team looked like an amorphous blob of rust puttering about on the ice . a more perfect representation of the coyotes franchise i can not find . more of the sameamazingly , the coyotes ' design choices proceeded to get even worse , circa 2007-08 and the reebok edge redesign . illustration by andrew m. greenstein , a contrasting shoulder yoke was added to the away kit , definitely a good decision . ",
        "as was the addition of contrasting striping to the previously solid-brick red pants . however , the ` yotes chose , like so many other nhl teams , to do away with the tail striping at the bottom of the jersey . so , though the uniforms were still boring and washed-out , the redesign turned them into glorified practice jerseys . ugh . their black third jersey , though definitely different , was not much better . the re-introduction of sand to the coyotes colour scheme was a welcome addition , though the curly vertical striping was just downright weird . ",
        "even the logo looks as though it 's trying to run away . kachina ka-chingso where do the coyotes go from here ? if anything , why not bring back the `` kachina '' kit introduced in their inaugural season ? after all , they 've done so before , to great applause . illustration by andrew m. greenstein , yes , the logo is a tad unsettling and yes , that textured striping is a bit unusual . but hey , it 's not overtly offensive and certainly stands out in comparison to the current uniform , which is a symphony of bland . ",
        "take the current logo -- the howling coyote . decent enough , yes . but the san jose sharks crest is an angry shark chomping down on a hockey stick . the old florida panthers emblem depicted a panther pouncing on an opponent . in contrast , arizona 's coyote just seems to be howling aimlessly off into the distance . `` why wo n't you look me in the eye anymore ? ? '' more aggressiveness is warranted . or , in the case of the original , more creepiness . disturbing logo aside , it is symmetrical and balanced , and everything about it screams `` american southwest '' . ",
        "and how about that eerie-looking green third jersey , introduced for 1998-99 ? psychedelic , man . for a team seeking to establish nostalgia and tradition , why not ? i 'd buy one , and i do n't think i 'm alone . make it yoursto put it bluntly , the arizona coyotes have had problems selling the game in their market . yes , they 've got a young , up-and-coming team that should make some significant strides next season ; winning will definitely help with marketing . but another huge part of branding is making your fans proud to wear your colours .

        "straight up , the coyotes can not afford to be boring . it 's time to think outside the box . originally published in april 2017 .   "
