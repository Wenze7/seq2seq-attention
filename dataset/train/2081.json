        "three recent challenges to consummated transactionsin december 2017 , the ftc filed an administrative complaint seeking to unwind the merger between two manufacturers and suppliers of microprocessor prosthetic knees , otto bock healthcare north america , inc. , and fih group holdings , llc . in september 2017 , the parties simultaneously signed a merger agreement and consummated the merger . according to the ftc complaint , the merger eliminated direct and substantial competition between otto bock and its most significant and disruptive competitor , fih . specifically , the ftc alleged that the intense competition between otto bock and fih resulted in substantially lower prices and improved features and functions , all to the benefit of consumers . ",
        "thus , this transaction acted to entrench further otto bock 's position as the dominant supplier of microprocessor prosthetic knees . in light of the ftc action , the parties have agreed to cease the integration of the two businesses as the case awaits trial before an ftc administrative law judge . also in december 2017 , the doj announced a settlement with transdigm group inc. . that required it to divest certain airline passenger restraint businesses that it had acquired from takata corp. . earlier in the year for $ 90 million . despite being over the current $ 80.8 m hart-scott-rodino act transaction value reporting threshold , due to the transaction 's structure , it was not required to be reported . ",
        "nevertheless , the doj investigated the transaction and found that it had eliminated the only competitor to transdigm in the market for commercial airplane restraint systems , including traditional two-point lap belts , three-point shoulder belts , technical restraints , and more advanced inflatable restraint systems such as airbags . according to the doj , competition between the two companies had led to lower prices and more innovation in the industry . as such , the doj required the divestiture of the commercial airline restraint assets to an already approved consortium , or an alternate acquirer to be approved by the united states . ",
        "in september 2017 , the doj challenged parker-hannifin 's consummated acquisition of clarcor inc. . alleging that it had eliminated head-to-head competition between the only two domestic manufacturers of fuel filtration systems and filter elements . these products are important because they remove particulate contaminants and water droplets before such fuel is delivered into commercial or military aircrafts . in an unusual twist , the doj challenged this transaction after it had allowed the initial waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino act to expire in mid-january 2017 . reports suggest that the doj was not aware of certain key evidence that would have affected its initial decision to clear the transaction to proceed . ",
        "in december 2017 , the doj announced a settlement with parker-hannafin that required the divestiture of the fuel filtration assets to a to-be-determined acquirer acceptable to the doj , in its sole discretion . conclusion : these examples provide a reminder that parties to proposed transactions should seek the advice of experienced antitrust counsel at the deal formation stage to assess and address potential antitrust risk , even when the transaction is not reportable under the hart-scott-rodino act . in the event there is any substantive antitrust exposure and the attendant potential for a post-closing investigation by the antitrust authorities , understanding the scope of the risk before proceeding with consummation of the transaction is essential . ",
        "without such an appreciation , parties may be confronted with unanticipated , lengthy and costly investigations and litigation , and ultimately may even be required to unwind a transaction . ------------------- generally , transactions valued above $ 80.8 million must be reported to the federal antitrust authorities and the parties must observe a mandatory waiting period of 30 days before closing . the transaction value is adjusted annually and the waiting period may ultimately be fewer than 30 days if the federal antitrust authorities grant early termination . the waiting period for a cash tender offer is 15 days . ",
        "the antitrust authorities ' recent challenges are reminiscent of the doj 's 2014 lawsuit against bazaarvoice 's acquisition of powerreviews , which it had acquired in 2012 . although the transaction was not reportable under the hart-scott-rodino act , the doj launched an investigation soon after the parties consummated the deal . after a lengthy investigation , the doj filed suit to unwind the transaction and it prevailed after a three week trial . the court required bazaarvoice to unwind the transaction and sell the previously acquired powerreviews assets .
