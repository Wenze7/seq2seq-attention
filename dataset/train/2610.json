        "going home for christmas brings a mixture of emotions , not least because it is the longest period of time you 've spent with relatives in the entire year . returning to your parents can also cause otherwise responsible adults to regress to behaving like the teenage version of themselves . `` an amazing number of people are experiencing this , '' says counsellor and relationship therapist , andrew marshall . `` the whole experience of walking across your parent 's threshold is powerful . '' although it is comforting to know it is n't just us , we spoke to experts to find out why we turn into harry enfield 's kevin for the christmas period . ",
        "why does our behaviour change ? make no mistake , most people falling into this trap have n't recently left home and struggling to find their feet in the world of adulthood . this affects people of all ages , with homes , jobs and responsibilities of their own . but within minutes of being back in your parent 's home , you find yourself lying on the sofa , and abdicating all responsibility . `` the reason this happens so often is because the roles are so incredibly well established , '' says marshall . the role you had throughout your formative years is the one you settle back into comfortably , often without even realising . ",
        "marshall says : `` until we are adults we do n't analyse the roles in a family unit , it is like asking if fish know they are in water , we just do n't notice our roles . '' so if your parents have always been the ones to cook , clean , and tidy up after you , and you were never expected to do this yourself , it can be very hard to get out of that mentality . this is n't helped by the fact your elders will naturally revert to their parental roles , even if you have n't legally been a child for decades . ",
        "but we do n't behave like this in normal life . it can be a little disconcerting to realise you might not have grown up as much as you thought you had , but that is n't always the case . the situation can be compounded by a number of factors , including other people , and being back in a place that has lots of memories attached to it . armele philpotts , relate relationship and family therapist , and a member of the bacp , says : `` often just being back in a place we left years before leaves us unsure of how to be and others unsure in their expectations of us . ",
        "`` in healthy adult relationships we switch fluidly between the roles of adult , parent and child in response to what we and others need in the moment . for example , if our partner has had a bad day at work they may take on the child role in order to whinge , while we take on the role of sympathetic parent , then we switch into our adult roles to tackle the weekly shop together . '' but when you go back to your parents , you end up stuck in the allotted ` child ' role , regardless of whether you might want to help or not . ",
        "and marshall says our siblings and partners can make this worse : `` if you were always the little brother or sister , or the rebel , or the peacemaker , then expect to be treated that way ... the reinforcement going on here is huge . '' is this really a problem ? tempting as it is to ignore this , marshall says this parent-child dynamic is one of the biggest issues his patients face around christmas . in the short-term it causes niggling tension for the duration of your stay - we all know that family member who constantly complains that no one helps them in the kitchen , but anyone who tries to help is just ` in the way ' . ",
        "but taking a step back , it also means that our parents never get to know us properly as a person , rather than just as their children . `` they only know a version of us that is outdated '' , says marshall . `` you just edit yourself in their presence and the bits you know they do n't like about you , and the person you are in real life is very different to the person that walks through that door to your parents . '' equally , they are more than just a parent and you are not getting to meet them as a full person either . ",
        "marshall says : `` this is dangerous because it 's not just a case of falling back for the holidays , it makes us more aware of the roles we probably play with our families the whole year - this is just an exaggerated ` cartoon version ' of that . '' so what can we do to fix it ? once you 've decided that you do n't want the dynamic to be like this anymore , the first thing you need to do is to take a step back and see the roles that everyone is playing . ",
        "the first 24 hours that you are home for christmas , try to be more of an observer than a contributor to the situation . `` just look at the roles that people play and the games they are playing with each other , '' says marshall . `` do n't beat yourself up if you get hooked in , you are so conditioned it 's like throwing a ball and not expecting a dog to chase after it . '' philpotts recommends taking a minute to breathe , offering to take the dog out or just hiding in the bathroom if you need to get some space to do this . ",
        "then once you 've had some time to understand the parts that you do n't like , for example that your elderly mother is like a butler , start asking her how you can help to alleviate that pressure on her . or suggest you tackle the washing up instead . what you are trying to do is move into an ` adult to adult ' relationship . `` if your bids for change are turned down take some deep breaths , congratulate yourself for being more present in your family relationships , and remember that although you 'd like a shift maybe others are n't ready yet , and that 's ok too , '' says philpotts .
