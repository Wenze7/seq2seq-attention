        "tesla is finally making good on the promise of premium solar roof tiles . the automaker-cum energy storage firm last month began manufacturing its integrated roofing solution , as reported by reuters . early-bird customers who reserved the product last year with a $ 1,000 deposit can expect installation `` in the coming months . '' tesla did not immediately respond to geek 's request for comment , and declined to share pre-order numbers with reuters . unlike most solar-powered houses today , which feature slabs of paneling , tesla 's glass tiles were conceived to look indistinguishable from traditional roofing materials . ",
        "company co-founders elon musk and jb straubel became the first solar roof customers in august , and have been generating energy ever since . smooth solar roof `` it ultimately pays for itself by reducing or eliminating a home 's electricity bill , '' the 2017 second-quarter earnings update promised . tesla supported its claim with a cheeky warranty for the lifetime of the house , `` or infinity , whichever comes first . '' according to reuters , tesla 's solar roof costs `` between 10 and 15 percent less '' than a new roof plus traditional solar panels . ",
        "ultimately , pricing depends on residential square footage and what portion of the roof you want covered ; the estimated cost includes materials , installation , and removal of the old covering . add a recommended powerwall battery for $ 5,500 , plus supporting hardware . the firm initially built pilot solar roof products at its nevada facility , but recently expanded production to the gigafactory 2 in buffalo , ny , where it collaborates with long-time battery partner panasonic . in the autumn of 2016 , tesla acquired solarcity , the nation 's largest installer of rooftop solar systems , for $ 2.6 billion . ",
        "do n't expect much solar fanfare for now , though . tesla told reuters that its primary focus is increasing production of the model 3 sedan ; the industry titan hopes to build some 2,500 vehicles per week by the end of the first quarter -- half the number if previously promised . let us know what you like about geek by taking our survey .
