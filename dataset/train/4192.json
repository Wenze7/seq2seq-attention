        "the pittsburgh steelers are so notorious for having key players injured during the final game of a season and heading into the playoffs that they made the very conscious effort of sitting every star on their roster against the browns . despite that effort , it seems like they could n't put a complete stop to the jinx . somehow , offensive coordinator todd haley was injured following a fall after pittsburgh 's grind-it-out win over the browns . it 's not clear exactly how this happened , and details of the injury are vague , but the good news is that nothing looks to be serious . ",
        "effectively locking up the no . 2 seed with a win over the 0-16 brownies to close out the season , pittsburgh will have a nice week off during wild card weekend in preparation for the divisional round . stud receiver antonio brown will also look to rejoin the team after the week 15 injury he suffered at home against the new england patriots . head coach mike tomlin should definitely set a curfew or put his entire team on house arrest ; the steelers need all systems go so that they do n't squander what has been a phenomenal season . ",
        "that rule applies to coaches , too .   "
