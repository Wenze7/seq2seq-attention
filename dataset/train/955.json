        "-- tax debates make for strange bedfellows . during the long , slow recovery from the great recession , americans became accustomed to a familiar economic debate -- keynesians , usually aligned with the democratic party , would call for more government spending in order to stimulate the economy , while republicans would call for cuts in outlays . eventually , a compromise was reached , though dangerous theatrics were involved and nobody was overjoyed with the result . from 2011 to 2013 , the large federal deficits that were a tool used to fight the recession were mostly eliminated : but now , with republicans on the verge of adopting big tax cuts , the lines of debate have shifted . ",
        "some of the people calling for stimulus a few years ago are now worried about the tax plan 's effect on the deficit . economist larry summers , for example , who has long called for fiscal stimulus to fight the slow growth that he calls `` secular stagnation , '' has excoriated the bill 's supporters for downplaying how much the tax cuts would add to the debt . it 's typical for partisans to switch from deficit dove to hawk when the presidency changes hands . republicans , in general , are famous for only worrying about deficits when the president is a democrat . ",
        "but summers ' stance on the bill is n't as self-contradictory as it might initially appear . because the republican bill would cut taxes mostly for the rich and could possibly even raise them for the middle class , it might not be a fiscal stimulus at all . savvy economists realize that because poor and working-class people spend more of the money they get from the government -- while rich people tend to stick it in the bank -- a bill that shifts the tax burden from rich to poor could easily end up being fiscally contractionary . that could make secular stagnation even worse . ",
        "even if a tax cut for the rich provides a slight stimulus , if you think government debt puts a future burden on the citizenry , it 's probably just not worth it . summers ' position actually looks quite a bit like orthodox keynesian policy -- borrow and spend when times are bad , cut government deficits when times are good . and since times are pretty good right now , an orthodox keynesian might say this is the moment for a bit of austerity . but some other people think that government deficits and debt are n't a bad thing at all and that they contribute positively to the economy even in boom times . ",
        "these are adherents of so-called modern monetary theory , a fringe concept that has gained some credence in the financial industry and the pundit class in the wake of the great recession . for example , in a recent new york times op-ed , stephanie kelton , a professor of economics and public policy at stony brook university , and a prominent mmt champion , urged people to think of government debt as a good thing . her reasoning , common in mmt circles , is that government deficits are also private-sector surpluses . that 's simple accounting -- since there are only the government and the private sectors in the world , when the government borrows it 's the private sector that lends . ",
        "when banks or individuals buy government bonds , they become net lenders , meaning that they 're running a financial surplus with respect to the government . according to kelton , who also served as an adviser to presidential candidate bernie sanders , that surplus constitutes a real economic benefit . she made the argument even more explicitly on twitter : the economic logic here does n't seem as watertight as the accounting . there 's no law that says a financial surplus equals a net economic benefit . if i lend my friend $ 100 , i run a surplus and she runs a deficit , but that does n't necessarily mean i 'm richer than before . ",
        "the real magic of mmt comes from the idea that the government does n't have to pay back its debts . most economists assume that the government has to balance its budget in the long run -- that if it borrows today , it has to raise taxes tomorrow . not so , say the mmters -- the government can just keep rolling over its debts forever . if interest costs get too big , the central bank can lend a hand by lowering rates to zero . if people get scared of a default and stop buying government debt , the central bank can just print money to buy government bonds . ",
        "that could conceivably cause hyperinflation , of course , but mmters say not to worry -- the lack of inflation from quantitative easing and zero interest rate policy in japan , the u. s. and elsewhere means that the danger of inflation spinning out of control is remote or nonexistent . so although mmters might -- as kelton does -- oppose the gop tax cut on the grounds that they favor the rich at the expense of everyone else , they have been vigorously attacking both democrats and economists who see debt as a reason to worry about the bill . ",
        "this has , strangely , put them at odds with keynesians like summers . so who 's right ? the mmters seem to be ignoring the details of how deficits lead to fiscal stimulus . accounting relationships alone ca n't prove that deficits raise output -- if the tax cut shifts the burden to the middle class , there 's the possibility it will reduce aggregate demand despite increasing deficits . in addition , the premise that government debt is never dangerous rests on some questionable assumptions -- the low risk of sudden inflation , and the willingness of the central bank to support infinite borrowing . ",
        "therefore , although keynesians like summers may look like they 're reversing their previous stance , their concerns must be taken seriously . mmt is an idea worth considering , but it 's also a dangerous experiment , and a regressive tax cut like the one now being considered is n't the best occasion for pro-deficit crusading . in this case , i 'd listen to summers . this column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or bloomberg lp and its owners . noah smith is a bloomberg view columnist . he was an assistant professor of finance at stony brook university , and he blogs at noahpinion .
