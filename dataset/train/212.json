        "she ca n't quite believe how far she 's come . gemma atkinson has shared her disbelief that strictly come dancing viewers have kept her in the competition long enough to land a place in the semi-final . the emmerdale actress and her dance partner aljaz skorjanec were in joint last place on the leaderboard last saturday along with davood ghadami , who ended up waltzing out of the competition . however , despite not completely winning over the judges with her quickstep , atkinson avoided the dreaded dance-off due to the public 's support . she told strictly spin-off programme it takes two how grateful she is to have the backing of viewers . ",
        "atkinson said : `` it 's horrible because when you 're at the bottom as well , you think obviously the judges did n't like the dance as much as we felt we liked it , so you do get panicked . `` but when your name is called it 's such a relief because it literally is the public who put us in the semi-final . it means so so much . `` i ca n't believe people have enjoyed watching me try and dance , watching choreography , they 've enjoyed it with us and that 's what we wanted to do . '' ",
        "skorjanec said : `` to get to this stage of the competition , for gemma who gets up at 4.30 every morning , sees me and then we rehearse for eight hours , she never complains . `` it 's just incredible how much you 've improved from week one , to be in the semi-final , it 's amazing for anyone . '' atkinson , who has yet to land in the bottom two on the bbc one show , said that despite being so near to the end of the series , she is still wracked with nerves every saturday night . ",
        "speaking of her quickstep , she said : `` i did love it , i loved the song , the concept , i loved the fact that we just went for it , and i had a really good night on saturday . `` i mean , the nerves were still there -- they always are -- but it was fun . '' atkinson will face the semi-final alongside debbie mcgee , alexandra burke , joe mcfadden and mollie king . strictly come dancing airs on bbc one on saturday at 6.45 pm .   "
