        "the snp 's most prominent rising star has disclosed how she rejected an offer from alex salmond to help her choose clothes and give herself a makeover . mhairi black said mr salmond had offered the services of close friend tasmina ahmed-sheikh , who also lost her seat in june 's general election , to take her out shopping and improve her wardrobe . the 23-year-old paisley and renfrewshire south mp said mr salmond told her he had held the same conversation with a young nicola sturgeon but she retorted : `` i am never going to be told how to dress , especially by a man . '' ",
        "in an interview with holyrood magazine , she also disclosed that she has never held an in-depth , one-to-one conversation with ms sturgeon despite being touted as a future snp leader . miss black said her `` awkward '' conversation with mr salmond was one of the few she has had with senior figures in the snp and claimed the party needs a `` kick up the backside '' to give its group of mps more support . alex salmond suggested that mhairi black should go shopping with tasmina ahmed sheikhcredit : getty imagesdisclosing how she sat down with the former first minister following her election in 2015 , the gay mp said : `` i was just sitting chatting away to him and the whole time i 'm thinking , what 's the point of this meant to be -- is this a date , do i need to come out to alex salmond ? ",
        "`` it was fine , really , he was just giving me tips here and there and then he says , ` i 'm sure taz will take you out to go shopping or something at some point and you 'll find your own style ' . `` he then said that the last time he 'd had this conversation it was with a young woman called nicola sturgeon . i thought , ` oh , very good ' and i just left the awkward silence hanging when he asked me if i wanted him to arrange it with taz . '' ",
        "miss black , who is the youngest mp in the commons , said the only time she had held a substantive conversation with ms sturgeon was when the first minister asked her to help with the party 's youth campaign in last year 's scottish election . fiona hyslop , the culture minister , was assigned to offer her mentoring support in the 2015 general election campaign but they only met twice , with miss black adding `` i think i frightened her '' .
