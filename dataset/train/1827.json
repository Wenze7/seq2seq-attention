        "iranian actor navid negahban has hit out at the whitewashing claims levelled against the upcoming aladdin remake . the film sparked a backlash after guy ritchie was announced as the director with billy magnussen cast as prince anders , a new role that was not present in the 1992 disney animated classic . negahban , who will play the sultan , used a metaphor to argue that the criticism is a non-issue . `` it 's not whitewashing , '' he told huffington post . `` the thing is that the garden should be filled with flowers of different kinds . ",
        "if not , the garden is going to be very boring . `` so you 're gon na go and see this beautiful garden with colourful flowers , and i just hope that you enjoy the journey . '' he continued : `` just go enjoy the journey because you will definitely love the film . it does n't matter how old you are , the film has something for you to take away from it . '' backlash : actor billy magnussen magnussen was heavily criticised after he retweeted a link to the news of his casting , with many questioning why an additional `` white '' character was necessary . ",
        "one twitter user posted : `` nope . i do not approve of this . this decision is stupid . '' another tweeted : `` i do n't wan na see them throw a white man in to a strong cultural movie he had no scenes in the first one does n't need a spot in this one . '' producer dan lin promised fans last year that he and ritchie will `` make a movie that 's authentic to that world '' . speaking to variety he said : `` i mean , i 'm not a typical guy . ",
        "listen , i 'm very fortunate working in hollywood ; i am diverse . so when i came in to make the movie , i wanted to make a diverse version of the movie . `` luckily for me , guy ritchie has the same vision and disney has the same vision , so we 're not here to make prince of persia . we want to make a movie that 's authentic to that world . '' mena massoud , who is of egyptian background , will play aladdin while naomi scott will take on princess jasmine .  "
