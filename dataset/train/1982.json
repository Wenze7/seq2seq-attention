        "live manitoba more streams if you want to avoid a mobile photo-radar ticket , do n't go anywhere near grant avenue and thurso street . you may also want to avoid driving during the afternoon rush hour anywhere in winnipeg , particularly on wednesdays . a cbc news analysis of 22,737 mobile photo-radar tickets handed out over a four-month period in 2016 found the city of winnipeg dinged more motorists for speeding on grant at thurso than at any other location in the city , more motorists on wednesdays than on any other day of the week , and more drivers between 4 and 5 p. m. than during any other hour . ",
        "geographically , grant at thurso -- a stretch that runs alongside grant park shopping centre -- is the easiest place to get a ticket . a total of 2,916 motorists were nailed by mobile photo-radar equipment for driving faster than 50 kilometres an hour at this river heights intersection from jan. . 1 to may 1 , 2016 . `` that one fools a lot of people , my family included . i believe my own wife got a ticket there , '' winnipeg police chief danny smyth said thursday . `` it 's a school , but grant is one of those corridors that people tend to travel more like 60 along , so yeah , that one seems to catch a lot of people . '' ",
        "river heights-fort garry coun . john orlikow , whose ward includes the offending intersection , said the city needs to do something to mitigate the number of speeding tickets along this section of grant avenue . `` maybe it 's increasing the speed limit . maybe it 's more signage . maybe it 's more engineering to the street , '' orlikow surmised thursday . in 2003 , the public works department recommended increasing the speed along this stretch from 50 to 60 kilometres an hour . a study found the natural speed for most motorists was between 61 to 68 along the route and found the collision rate to be in line with other regional streets . ",
        "`` furthermore , it is expected that making these changes to the speed limit at these locations will ... provide motorists travelling along these routes with a more consistent driving environment in terms of uniformity in speed limits , '' said the report 's author . however , a motion rejecting the recommendation by then-councillor for river heights-fort garry garth steek was carried , effectively freezing the speed at 50 . see top 15 ticket locations in more detail but the 50-an-hour speed zone at grant and thurso actually is an anomaly , when it comes to places where mobile photo radar nabs the most motorists . ",
        "the mobile photo radar data , obtained by cbc news after an 18-month freedom-of-information dispute , reveals most motorists are caught in 30 km/h zones . seven of the top 10 stretches of road where drivers were caught during the sample period had 30 km/h speed limits , while a total of 61 per cent of the tickets were generated in 30 km/h zones . `` there 's a cynicism behind this program , because we 're limited to these areas , '' smyth said . `` people get upset about that , that it always seems to be those 30 kilometre zones at the schools . '' ",
        "smyth said the police would like to place mobile photo radar on regional streets where conventional photo enforcement operations would endanger officers . `` i certainly would like to have greater flexibility to be able to deploy in some of these high-speed corridors , '' smyth said . it is not safe for police to stand out in streets with vehicles whizzing by at 80 kilometres an hour , he said , adding many good candidates for mobile photo radar -- regional roads such as chief peguis trail , bishop grandin boulevard and the southern extension of kenaston boulevard -- either did n't exist when mobile photo radar arrived in winnipeg or were n't busy enough to warrant the enforcement measure . ",
        "smyth said he 's spoken to infrastructure minister ron schuler about the possibility of expanding the locations where mobile photo radar can operate . the lobby group wise up winnipeg would like the province to tighten the reins on the program , rather than expand it . wise up founder todd dube claims the police have never demonstrated photo radar improves safety on winnipeg 's roads and claims the mobile program was designed to maximize revenue . the large number of tickets handed out in 30 km/h zones is a perfect example , he said . `` it 's unnaturally slow and prudent drivers find themselves exceeding that unnatural speed limit , especially in the city of winnipeg , because unlike other cities , we do n't even have the accompanying yellow flashing lights you find in other school zones , '' dube said thursday in a telephone interview . ",
        "`` in winnipeg , they 're as stealthy as possible , so it comes as no surprise why tickets are through the roof . and that 's never going to change , '' he said . `` it 's simply a stealthy program , and they know very well that 's the case . '' under an agreement between the city and the province , the police are required to submit an annual report on the program 's activities . this includes a controlled study evaluating how photo enforcement modifies speeding behaviour and an analysis of the effect of photo enforcement on safety over time . ",
        "however , none of the annual reports submitted by the police contain this required information . `` it 's the responsibility of all drivers to know what the speed limit is and to obey the law . the best answer if you do n't want to pay for speeding tickets and to slow down , '' he said . dube said politicians always trot out these sorts of lines . `` you know , ` slow down , save the kids , if you do n't want a ticket , just slow down . it 's empty rhetoric , but it 's an easy sell . '' ",
        "how we got the data in may 2016 , cbc news filed a freedom-of-information request for four-months worth of mobile-enforcement data . a month later , the winnipeg police service rejected the request on the basis the records belonged to a third party , mobile-enforcement contractor acs public sector solutions . in july 2016 , cbc news complained to the manitoba ombudsman , arguing the deal between the police and acs clearly indicated the city owns the records and can have access to them at any time . police release photo-radar locations after complaint to ombudsman with the help of the ombudsman , the police in december 2016 released a disc of information without any mobile-enforcement locations .
