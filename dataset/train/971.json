        "honduras 's leftwing opposition tuesday called for a month of protests and possible insurrection to reject president juan orlando hernandez 's claim to have won re-election in a bitterly disputed poll held in november . the declaration comes ahead of hernandez being sworn into a new term on january 27 . the opposition has denounced the november 26 runoff election between hernandez and its candidate , salvador nasralla , as rigged . foreign observers said they noted irregularities in the vote . after the election , opposition protests took place , countered by robust police and military contingents . at least 31 people were killed , according to the government 's national commission on human rights . ",
        "the united states last month said it recognized the victory of hernandez . the 49-year-old conservative has washington 's backing for his policies aimed at stemming undocumented migration of his citizens to america . nasralla , a 64-year-old popular former tv president , initially conceded after the us declared its support for hernandez . but he then came back with the opposition alliance against the dictatorship to demand the election results be annulled . `` we have a strategy that we are going to develop in this month of january , '' nasralla told a news conference in tegucigalpa . ",
        "he said it would involve `` protest actions '' including a march on saturday in the country 's second-biggest city of san pedro sula . the opposition 's chief coordinator , former president manuel zelaya , told the news conference that the outcome of the november election was that `` the president is nasralla . '' `` nobody should obey an usurper government , '' he said .   "
