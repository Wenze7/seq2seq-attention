        "financial literacy is considered as one of the most essential components of everyday life in today 's world . in fact , an individual these days need to respond wisely to financial matters to get the best out of limited resources available to him and hence prevent excessive debt and also avert himself from becoming casualty of unethical business practices and achieve large objectives like homeownership . these days , the concern in regards to financial literacy is not about the accessibility of data . it is more about the efficient distribution of data . in recent times oecd , a membership institution comprising of 30 nations , which includes the u. s. , reported that multiple surveys taken during the time in various communities in united states showed that well educated consumers with high per capita incomes are sometime na√Øve about finance problems and are similar to less educated , lower income consumer groups . ",
        "it 's a fact that around 3 % -- 10 % of the people are without a bank account , and are hence financially isolated in a world where financial transactions are more and more carried online . actually , to be termed competent , a financial literacy curriculum should be capable of serving consumers who represent those sections of society whose requirements are not attended in a language or format that works well for them as it does with the members from the mainstream of society . to do so , one must utilize community based services , which are ideal for reaching isolated and marginalized populations . ",
        "at present , community-based organizations cumulatively assist tens of millions of clients annually that includes families , young people , seniors , gay/lesbian/transgender entities , immigrants and refugees , the unemployed and the outcasts . it 's a proven fact that as reliable individuals in their communities , they understand the issues of local residents more precisely and can assist them in getting solutions for the same more precisely . in philadelphia customarily , a critical problem like an outstanding utility bill or an issue paying for transportation brings the client to a community service provider . during this sort of situations consulting can be provided to address the larger financial issue that most likely exists but is not acknowledged to accelerate financial growth . ",
        "if the counselor is ready with knowledge , training and materials , he or she can make the client well informed on personal finance and development at the very moment when he or she is most susceptible to the information and suggestion .   "
