        "on the same week the trump administration announced there would be tariffs placed on imports of solar panels , the department of energy announced it is holding a competition to help foster american innovation in the solar energy sector . the department revealed the plan on its website , saying the $ 3 million competition is called the american made solar prize . `` the united states possesses the talent , expertise , and vision to surpass the rest of the world in solar technologies and forge a new solar energy landscape around the globe , '' secretary of energy rick perry said . ",
        "`` the american made solar prize will galvanize our country 's entrepreneurs , allow them to utilize technologies and innovations developed through doe 's early-stage research and development , and , ultimately , bring new american-made products to market . '' the trump administration said monday it will slap a 30 percent tariff on imported solar cells and modules above 2.5 gigawatts . a bloomberg analysis concluded that the tariff could increase the cost of a solar farm by as much as 10 percent and the cost of rooftop solar units by roughly 4 percent . the department of energy 's solar initiative is meant to `` reenergize innovation in u. s. solar manufacturing , '' which may end up driving down prices in the long run .
