        "in this final week i was making the final touches to my dissertation and i also completed my final presentation . i wrote up a script for my presentation that i hoped was sufficient to cover many of the topics that i wrote about in my extended project but not cause boredom and show a few interesting things in the presentation that may be actionable . i spoke about the resources i gathered , where i got my other information from . i also spoke about the various terminology involved with studying the risks and opportunities posted by artificial intelligence . ",
        "i feel that my presentation went rather well . it was within the time limits and i managed to answer questions about the presentation afterwards in good time . i did n't read off the slides and i feel that my presentation was conveyed in an interesting way but without any unimportant elements . to finish off my epq i completed the end of my project progression record , the checklist and i printed off my epq for submission . it 's been fun . progress made in week commencing 11th december . this post is part of a series on my extended project qualification .
