        "will the u. s. government shut down for lack of money , and if so , what doors actually close ? how did we get here , and which party might be blamed ? with elected leaders in washington running out of ideas for keeping the federal government funded , and a midnight deadline fast approaching , americans might want to start reacquainting themselves with the details of government shutdowns . 1 . what are the chances the government shuts down ? over the course of months , it 's gone from a far-out possibility to an imminent headache . ",
        "with members of congress still in session , and president donald trump down the avenue in the white house , there 's always the chance for a last-minute deal that at least postpones a shutdown for a few days or weeks . but the countdown clocks running on cable-news channels -- ticking down until midnight washington -- testify to the fact that time is running out . 2 . what needs to happen to avert a shutdown ? a simple majority of house members , and a supermajority of 60 senators , would need to get behind some funding measure -- called a continuing resolution -- that trump would be willing to sign . ",
        "that means republicans can pass a measure on their own in the house -- as they 've done already -- but need democratic support in the senate , where they hold only 51 of 100 seats . democratic senators , who have been cut out of much decision-making in the past year , are holding out for some of their priorities . 3 . what are the sticking points ? there are several , tangled together . when congress considers a must-pass piece of legislation such as this one , both parties try to insert their top priorities in it . ",
        "for senate democrats , that 's permanent protection from deportation for about 700,000 so-called dreamers -- undocumented immigrants who were brought to the u. s. as children and protected under the obama-era deferred action for childhood arrivals program . republicans want to combine that with $ 18 billion for border security , including work on the mexico border wall that trump has long promised , plus some limits on other immigration programs . to lure senate democrats , republican leaders had agreed to extend for six years the children 's health insurance program , whose funds they let lapse last year . ",
        "but trump muddied those waters by tweeting that chip money should n't be in the temporary-funding bill , before the white house backtracked . for defense hawks , the question is whether the bill increases defense spending -- without also increasing spending on social-welfare programs . 4 . what does a shutdown mean ? it means many , though not all , federal government functions are suspended , and many , though not all , federal employees are furloughed . services that the government deems `` essential , '' such as those related to law enforcement and public safety , continue . ",
        "but defining `` essential '' is more art than science , with individual government departments -- and the political appointees who run them -- having a say over who comes to work and who stays home . so many details are still to come , probably on monday , if a shutdown continues until the work week begins . in theory at least , a federal employee who works during a shutdown , but is n't supposed to , could face fines or a prison term under what 's called the antideficiency act . 5 . what government services would cease ? ",
        "the ones that draw headlines are those that produce closures of national park facilities and the smithsonian museums in washington and delays in processing applications for passports and visas , though the trump administration is intent on easing those effects . economic reports from the labor and commerce departments could be delayed , depending on how long a shutdown lasts . tax audits , oversight of financial swap markets and investigations of workplace civil-rights complaints are among activities expected to stop . 6 . which government functions would be unaffected ? military operations , air traffic control , medical care of veterans and federal criminal investigations -- including a certain probe of the president 's inner circle -- are among the essential activities that will go on . ",
        "the u. s. postal service and u. s. federal reserve have their own funding streams so will also be largely unaffected . 7 . who would get blamed for a shutdown ? since they control congress and the white house , republicans might be expected to be most at risk from the appearance that washington is n't working correctly . but republicans already are trying to explain a potential shutdown as being forced by democrats in the senate and their insistence on protecting those who immigrated illegally to the u. s. as children . 8 . would there be harm to the u. s. economy ? ",
        "it depends on how long a shutdown lasts . based on past shutdowns , something lasting a few days to a week is unlikely to have a sizable impact . a shutdown of several weeks could shave a few tenths of a percentage point from gross domestic product growth in a given quarter . bloomberg economists estimate that a government shutdown that lasted two and a half weeks in 2013 subtracted 0.30 percentage point from quarterly gdp . 9 . how many times has this happened ? there have been 12 shutdowns since 1981 , ranging in duration from a single day to 21 days , according to the congressional research service . ",
        "shutdowns over spending disagreements are different than what would happen if the u. s. breached its debt ceiling and defaulted on some of its obligations . that 's never happened -- though its specter , too , will grow if congress does n't reach a deal in the next several weeks . the reference shelfcongress lists all votes on appropriations for the 2018 fiscal year . the committee for a responsible federal budget tracks the budget through its appropriations watch . a 2015 report by the democratic staff of the joint economic committee of congress examines the economic costs of shutdowns .
