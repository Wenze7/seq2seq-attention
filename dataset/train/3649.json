        "it 's time -- time to pick the boston area 's neighborhood of the year ! here 's how the annual curbed cup works : we present two matchups a day during the first round . polls stay open 24 hours for each one . the biggest vote-getter in each matchup advances to the second round . we start with 16 , and we whittle it down to one . got it ? good . go ! seaport district . projects either underway or planned include the three-building , 1.3 million-square-foot echelonseaport , which is due to include 733 apartments and condos , and 315 northern avenue across from the blue hills bank pavilion , which is supposed to include a 304-unit apartment building and a 294-key hotel . ",
        "it 's due to have 3.2 million square feet of residential space , 2.8 million square feet of office space , a 476,800-square-foot hotel , and 1.12 million square feet of retail , restaurant , and entertainment space . it might even have a public library . west end . jiawangkun/shutterstockboston 's west end is so hot right now that some people think it needs two names . the under-construction hub on causeway is driving much of this buzz . this monumental project on and around td garden and north station is set to include 1.5 million square feet of shops , restaurants , offices , and residences , as well as an expansion of the arena and improvements to the transit hub . ",
        "it 's also supposed to get a hotel full of micro-rooms . never mind , either , that the west end is one of the city 's most walkable and bikable neighborhoods . enter your email address . by signing up , you agree to our privacy policy and european users agree to the data transfer policy .
