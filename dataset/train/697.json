        "the texans have agreed on a contract with new general manager brian gaine and an extension for coach bill o'brien . after three days of negotiations , the agreements were finished saturday morning . gaine , buffalo 's vice president of player personnel , was hired to replace rick smith , who was the general manager for the last 12 years . gaine is the team 's third general manager behind charley casserly and smith . he 'll have control of personnel and football operations . he 'll answer to owner bob mcnair and vice chairman cal mcnair . o'brien had one year left on the five-year contract he signed to leave penn state for the texans in 2014 . ",
        "o'brien will continue to have control over his coaching staff and who plays and does n't play on game days . owner bob mcnair and vice chairman cal mcnair wanted to have gaine signed and o'brien extended before they leave for the senior bowl . now that o'brien has his extension , it 'll be easier for him to hire assistant coaches who know he 's not going to have only one year left on his contract . gaine and jimmy raye iii , the team 's vice president of player personnel/assistant general manager , were the only candidates interviewed . ",
        "gaine came to houston on monday and interviewed tuesday before returning to buffalo . in 2014 , smith hired gaine as director of pro personnel and promoted him to director of player personnel during his three seasons with the texans . gaine worked on four drafts and free agent periods for the texans before he left for buffalo in may of last year .
