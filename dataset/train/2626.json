        "pasadena , calif. . -- the latest on abc 's upcoming programming from the tv critics meeting in pasadena , california : 6 p. m.roseanne barr says making her character a donald trump supporter in the revived sitcom `` roseanne '' is true to its roots . barr said she always tried to have the original abc sitcom `` roseanne '' reflect society , and the show 's conner family is a fictional version of the working-class people who put trump in office , said barr , herself a trump supporter . in a q&a with tv critics monday , barr and others involved in the reboot of the 1988-97 comedy said they hope depicting a loving family that disagrees on politics will set an example for a divided america . ",
        "the new `` roseanne , '' debuting march 27 , reunites barr with john goodman , laurie metcalf , sara gilbert and other original cast members . ___ 11:30 a. m.the `` grey 's anatomy '' spinoff has yet to be titled , and `` chicago fire '' shares the blame . abc entertainment president channing dungey said the nbc franchise drama 's name is the reason the `` grey 's '' spinoff about firefighters wo n't be called `` seattle fire . `` it 's challenging to come up with a good show title , dungey told a tv critics ' meeting monday , noting that the seattle-based `` grey 's anatomy '' was n't named until shortly before it debuted . ",
        "the network is sorting through options and hopes to make the pick in the next couple of weeks , she said . the `` grey 's anatomy '' spinoff will debut with a two-hour episode on march 22 as part of abc 's lineup of shows from producer shonda rhimes . one of them , `` scandal '' with kerry washington , is wrapping its seven-season run with the finale airing april 19.10:45 a. m.upcoming oscars host jimmy kimmel says it 's hard to tell how the public will react to the subject of sexual misconduct when he delivers his monologue at the event in two months . ",
        "to that end , the abc late-night host said monday he felt that one of seth meyers ' jokes at the golden globes was written specifically for him -- when meyers said he felt like the first dog being shot into outer space . it was a reference to meyers being a test case for how hollywood would talk publicly about the topic . one event sure to come up is last year 's epic envelope mix-up , where actor warren beatty announced the wrong best picture winner . kimmel said if something like that happened again , everyone at abc should be fired .
