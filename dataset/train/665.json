        "renegade republican roy moore may be plagued by scandal , but scandal alone will not convince the voters of 44th place north to show up for democrat doug jones . in a state where democrats are used to losing , malaise hangs over this quiet african-american neighborhood in suburban birmingham , even three days before alabama 's high-profile senate contest . it is supposed to be a democratic stronghold , yet the jones campaign signs are hard to find . `` a lot of people do n't vote because they think their vote do n't count , '' ebonique jiles , 27 , said after promising a jones volunteer she would support the democrat in tuesday 's election . ",
        "`` i 'll vote regardless of whether he wins or loses . '' with history and math working against them in deep-red alabama , democrats fought saturday to energize a winning coalition of african-americans and moderate republicans -- a delicate balancing act on full display as jones and his network of volunteers canvassed the state . moore , by contrast , held no public events , a familiar strategy as he bets big that the state 's strong republican leanings will carry him to the senate , despite his shortcomings . during an appearance near the staging ground for selma 's landmark `` bloody sunday '' civil rights march , jones declared that alabama has an opportunity to go `` forward and not backward . '' ",
        "`` this campaign has the wind at its back because we are bringing people together from all across this state , '' jones said after a meeting at brown chapel a. m.e. church . `` the other side is trying to divide us more than they bring people together . '' he was later joined by new jersey sen. cory booker , one of only two african-american democrats in the senate , who offered a warning to voters gathered at alabama state university : `` bad people get elected when good people do n't vote . '' saturday evening , moore 's camp organized two get-out-the-vote concerts expected to draw overwhelmingly white voters -- including some open-minded republicans -- in a state that has n't elected a democrat to the senate in more than a quarter century . ",
        "moore got a big boost the night before in nearby pensacola , florida , where president donald trump encouraged voters to `` get out and vote for roy moore . '' trump has also recorded a phone message on moore 's behalf set to be distributed to alabama voters on monday , said white house spokesman raj shah . the white house support comes even as the 70-year-old moore faces multiple accusations of sexual misconduct , including allegations that he molested two teenage girls and pursued romantic relationships with several others while in his 30s . he has largely denied the allegations . ",
        "the explosive charges , which many washington republicans describe as credible , are giving democrats a rare opportunity to pick up a senate seat in the deep south , where republicans significantly outnumber democrats . even if jones wins on tuesday , many democrats expect the gop to re-claim the seat when the term expires at the end of 2020 . beneath jones ' biracial and bipartisan balancing act is a complex numbers game that has vexed alabama democrats for decades . the party 's core of black voters and white liberals -- plus a smidgen of old-guard , more conservative `` southern democrats '' who 've held on amid the region 's partisan shift -- is worth no more than 40 percent in statewide elections . ",
        "that 's been true in high-turnout elections , with former president barack obama twice landing between 38 and 39 percent , and the most recent governor 's race in 2014 , when the democratic nominee pulled just 36 percent . african-americans make up about 25 percent of eligible voters , though democratic pollster zac mccrary said jones needs black voters to comprise 27 percent or more of those who show up at the polls on tuesday . jones then needs to win one in three white voters in the state , which would require capturing about 15 percent of republicans , mccrary said . ",
        "such dynamics are difficult to overcome , said democratic strategist keenan pontoni , who managed the campaign of georgia congressional hopeful jon ossoff earlier this year . ossoff aimed for an upset in the 6th congressional district of georgia , but ultimately came up short in atlanta 's republican-leaning northern suburbs . `` the only way you win in these kinds of districts and states is a coalition that is obviously very hard to put together , '' pontoni said . `` you 're going after voters who think and vote very differently . '' much like jones , ossoff used an extensive , data-driven ground game to maximize democratic support , while using television advertising to strike a moderate , non-partisan tone . ",
        "ossoff did n't have a controversial opponent like moore , but he ran against washington dysfunction as a way to reach moderates . on the ground in alabama on saturday , jones dispatched hundreds of volunteers across the state to knock on doors to identify likely supporters in neighborhoods that featured high concentrations of african-americans and republicans who supported moore 's gop primary opponent , current sen. luther strange . jones volunteer dana ellis , a 64-year-old nurse , navigated icy sidewalks in birmingham 's kingston neighborhood , which is overwhelmingly african-american , to ensure likely jones supporters vote on tuesday . ",
        "unlike many states , alabama does n't offer early voting . `` roy moore will not win if people turn out to vote , '' ellis said . many voters on the list provided by the campaign did n't answer their doors saturday morning . those who did suggested they would support jones , even if they did n't know him well . oweda clark , who lives just around the corner from 44th place north , admits it 's hard being a democrat in alabama . but she told ellis that she plans to vote for jones anyway . ",
        "`` i do n't like roy moore . i do n't like what he stands for , '' she said .   "
