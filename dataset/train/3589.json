        "after what was undoubtedly a very frustrating fight , a utah teen completed an unprompted fear factor challenge to spite his parents : walking six miles across a frozen lake . if he were to go head-to-head on the tv show with the oklahoma teen who jumped into a zoo 's zebra exhibit earlier this year , the utahn would definitely bring home the $ 50,000 grand prize . according to ksl , the 13-year-old boy 's parents called the police at 4:20 p. m. friday to report that their son had started his journey across utah lake at the saratoga springs marina area . ",
        "while the specifics of the family fight have not yet been disclosed , the argument must have really shaken the teen . the average temperature in the area that day was 32 degrees fahrenheit , according to weather underground , which means utah lake was just barely frozen . after police arrived at the lindon marina around 5:00 p. m. , where the teen was set to complete his six-mile-long trek , utah county sheriff 's office sgt. spencer cannon said the only thing the officers could do was watch as the boy approached the shore . while the 13-year-old later told police that he could hear the ice cracking with every step he took , his foot did n't break through the ice until his penultimate step . ",
        "according to good4utah , there have been two incidents in the past week where utahns fell through the ice . though the teenager made it off the lake uninjured , cannon told the boy he needs to find a better way to cool off . `` i would n't say walking six miles across ice is a normal teenage response , but a response that is n't given much thought is not an uncommon way for teenagers to react to a situation that they 're not happy with , '' cannon told ksl . maybe next time he 's mad at mom and dad , he can go wreak havoc in a local mall or have an illegal sleepover in ikea .
