        "buffy the jedi master . in the decades since star wars changed the world in 1977 , a wealth of material about the saga 's developmental stages has come out , with some bits of old concept art and words like `` starkiller , '' the original last name for luke , even getting repurposed in later chapters and the extended universe . the making of star wars : the empire strikes back , by j. w. rinzler , is a fantastic resource filled with a ton of surprising facts , such as the original name for jedi master yoda . ",
        "it was buffy . yes , buffy . in early outlines drafted by george lucas , bunden debannen aka buffy was three to four thousand years old . luke , the chosen one , would be `` the human buffy . '' later , lucas envisioned him as a frog type creature , with the full name minch yoda . the emperor was n't always played by a man . before the great ian mcdiarmid was retroactively inserted into later editions of the empire strikes back , to tighten up continuity with return of the jedi and the star wars prequels , actor clive revill voiced the mysterious and decrepit leader of the galactic empire . ",
        "but it was a woman named elaine baker underneath the makeup . she was then the wife of academy award winning makeup artist rick baker , who in addition to his work on star wars , worked on an american werewolf in london , coming to america , the men in black series , and michael jackson 's thriller . baker not only made the suit for the 1976 king kong movie , he 's the guy inside of it ! speaking of primates , elaine baker 's eyes in empire were the eyes of a chimpanzee . darth vader was n't always a skywalker .

        "in the first draft by the late leigh brackett , aka the queen of space opera , anakin skywalker , ben kenobi , and minch yoda swear luke into the jedi order , in a little ceremony that involves an oath and the crossing of their lightsabers . anakin also tells luke about his sister , who was also training to become a jedi , just like luke . leia was n't always a skywalker either . that sister in the early drafts was not princess leia organa of alderaan . in the second draft of the empire strikes back , vader tells luke , `` you 're in love with leia . ",
        "you do n't want to lose her to han solo ... but you will , if you lack the courage to use the strength that 's in you . a strength as great as mine , luke . '' this second draft and its accompanying dialog , which of course reads much differently with the addition of the now familiar familial twists , was written by george lucas himself . george lucas always had a harrison ford back-up plan . before anyone knew whether or not the first star wars would be the kind of success that could warrant a big budget sequel , lucas commissioned a novelist to write a story for a sequel that could be made for less money , reusing sets , and without harrison ford , who was n't signed on for follow-ups . ",
        "splinter of the mind 's eye featured a luke and leia romance , as the shipwrecked duo searched a swamp planet for something called a `` kaiburr crystal . '' both luke and leia would 've had lightsaber duels with darth vader . in a similar fashion , the whole `` frozen in carbonite '' plot device was cooked up as a way to write han solo out of the next movie should wily scoundrel harrison ford have chosen not to return for a third star wars movie . next page .
