        "former democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton saw her favorability rating fall to a record low of 36 % , according to a gallup poll . clinton is now tied with president donald trump 's low job performance rating . clinton 's favorability reached a record high in 1999 , but slid considerably after her resignation as secretary of state in 2013 . in a new gallup poll released on tuesday , the favorability rating of former 2016 democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton hit its lowest point since gallup began tracking it over 25 years ago . the former secretary of state is now tied with her former opponent , president donald trump , whose job performance rating also sat at 36 % on tuesday , according to another recurring gallop survey . ",
        "while clinton started out with a favorability rating of 38 % in 1992 , her star quickly rose during her tenure as first lady to former president bill clinton , and her rating reached an all-time high in 1999 at 67 % . after a slight dip during her time as a us senator from new york in the 2000s and during her first candidacy for the presidency in 2008 , she again enjoyed high ratings during her tenure as secretary of state for former president barack obama . her favorability began to slide again following her departure from the office in 2013 , and continued to dip as the 2016 campaign got underway . ",
        "during the 2016 race , then-candidate trump fielded a variety of insults at clinton , including the now-infamous nickname `` crooked hillary , '' along with a host of other personal attacks .   "
