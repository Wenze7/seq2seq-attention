        "the world 's first pokémon rap battle was gifted unto us today in a promo video for the new pokémon ultra sun and moon . while it 's difficult to parse exactly what devastating burns are being exchanged , because they 're rapping in japanese / pokémon language , it 's clear that mc mimikyu suffered a humiliating loss against crowd-favorite mc pikachu . it 's another trauma to add to mimikyu 's tragic backstory of dressing up as pikachu , because it , too , wants to be a beloved icon . the video features the heavily auto-original pikachu voice actress ikue ōtani , with mimikyu voiced by actual japanese rapper dotama , accompanied with beats by dj libro . ",
        "pokémon japan was kind enough to transcribe the rap battle in full under the video , and it 's mostly this : . ＜ ミミッキュ ＞ グガガガグガ グガッ ギゴゴゴギゴ ギゴッ グガガガグガ グガッ グガッ ギギ ギギ ギギ ギギ ギギ ギギ ギギ グガガガ グガガガ . < mimikyu > gagagagagguuga guggogogogogogo giggagguagiguggu guggaggaggi gigi gigi gigi gigi gigi gigaga gaga gaga gaga gaga . ＜ ピカチュウ ＞ ピカッチュウ ピィカ ピカピカチュウ ピピカァ ピカッチュウ ピカァ ピカァ ピィピカチュウ ピピカチュウ ピカピカピカチュウ . < pikachu > pikachu pika pika pika pika pikachu pika pika pie pikachu pikachu shiny pikachu . i knew when pikachu spit those fire verses like `` pika pika '' and `` pikapikapika , '' it was all over for mimikyu . ",
        "it is truly inspiring how quickly pikachu learned to freestyle after only learning to speak just a few weeks ago . being able to talk has opened up so many doors for pikachu career-wise , from starring as a detective in his own live-action movie to his latest gig as an alexa voice assistant . it 's a really embarrassing defeat for mimikyu , and hopefully , it 'll take this l as a wake-up call to do better for its next battle , which i 'm praying happens soon .
