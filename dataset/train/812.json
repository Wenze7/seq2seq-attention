        "the us army just converted a war training video game to better suit future trainees with school shootings . a tactical fps video game was made to train troops in the us army . that game was converted by the army to instead assist teachers and faculty to fight back against attacks in public schools . violence that was once said to be caused by video games is now being fought with video games . this particular video game is part of a $ 5.6 million program called enhanced dynamic geo-social environment , or edge . this system is located online at cesi edge training dot com , and the school shooting version is coming this year .

        "`` with teachers , they did not self-select into a role where they expect to have bullets flying near them . unfortunately , it 's becoming a reality , '' said tamara griffith , chief engineer for the project , speaking with ap . `` we want to teach teachers how to respond as first responders . '' one video about this project was published by gizmodo , containing interviews with the army research laboratory 's griffith , and others . `` i hope that people will sort of see this simulation as a really cool and engaging way to think about school safety , '' said amanda klinger , director of operations for nonprofit educators school safety network .

        "this video game was first promoted by the us army to several news outlets right around the turn of the new year . meanwhile there was no significant news this week or last week or any week recently about any sort of new gun regulation in the united states . a related set of events that happened happened recently took place at the white house . on the anniversary of the massacre at sandy hook , the trump administration hosted a christmas party . one of the invited attendees was national rifle association leader wayne lapierre . some misinformation about this situation was spread not long after , but the fact remains that a party on the night of the 5th anniversary of the sandy hook shootings did take place , and the nra was represented .
