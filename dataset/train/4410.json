        "personally , this semester has been one of the most difficult yet intriguing periods of school i have ever been through , due to the fact that i started college and it was a completely different atmosphere for me . although it was tricky to get used to , i do n't think i 've learned so much about myself , and my life in general . college is one of those things in one 's life where you learn so much about anything and everything and you never realize how much you can learn about yourself as a person along the way . ",
        "i really have been faced with some difficult obstacles like breaking up in a relationship , a death in my family , and even just the amount of work i have to do . although i was at my lowest when these things happened , and i unfortunately got depressed , i learned how to cope with difficulties like these . i learned and gained a lot of confidence after that break up but i also got a lot of sadness from the death of my grandfather . however , my dedication to school seemed to push it away which made me more motivated to do better in school . ",
        "not quite sure how but it motivated me enough to make the decision to try for medical school ! it turns out that whenever bad things happen , i become more motivated than ever which i had never realized until college . furthermore , this motivation of course does n't come to me without stress . in fact , whenever i get stressed out , i look at my badge that my grandmother gave to me when i was little that says `` dr. breanna sakmar , m. d. '' and then i realize that all this stress and constant work is for a reason . ",
        "i want to go to medical school ! with that being said , my approach to academics has change in ways i never imagined . i actually want to do homework now and it ` s seriously still very strange to me . specifically , i never wanted to read anything having to do with biology in high school , and now after this semester , it ` s one of my favorite things to read ! i 've also found that sitting down and actually listening to the lecture rather than scribbling down everything word for word , is a lot more beneficial in the long run and high school was n't that into just `` sitting there and listening '' so this is new but in a good way . ",
        "i have a better outlook on myself as a learner and my life as well and i ca n`t wait to see what the future has in store for me !   "
