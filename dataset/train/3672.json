        "in a victory for internet service providers like at&t , comcast and verizon , the federal communications commission voted thursday to repeal net neutrality rules . fcc commissioner ajit pai , who was appointed by president donald trump , forged ahead with the vote , despite widespread opposition and a request from 18 state attorneys general to delay it over concerns that the public comment process was corrupted by fraudulent messages . the repeal proposal passed 3-2 on party lines . the hearing was temporarily delayed -- and the room evacuated -- by a bomb threat before pai could cast the fifth and final vote . ",
        "commissioners were permitted to continue after police and dogs searched the empty chamber . the repeal rolls back so-called `` title ii '' regulations that classified the internet as a public utility , and which , among other things , required internet service providers , or isps , to treat all of the data traveling on their networks equally . without the protections of title ii , those isps can now legally begin treating data from some websites differently than others . so comcast , for instance , could charge customers who use netflix extra for using so much bandwidth ; at&t could , in theory , decide to block access to some websites entirely ; or verizon , which owns huffpost 's parent company oath , could hypothetically decide wireless customers wo n't be charged data when they 're viewing huffpost content . ",
        "in a conference call with reporters wednesday ahead of the vote , telecom industry executives sought to calm the storm of public opinion . michael powell , the head of the national cable & telecommunications association and a former fcc chairman , argued that just because it 's now legal for isps to discriminate against internet traffic and create fast lanes does n't mean they will . `` we ca n't live by a principle that just because there is n't a rule banning something , it does n't mean necessarily that something is going to happen , '' he said . ",
        "`` there are a lot of things in our society we do n't expressly prohibit , but it does n't mean that they 're going to happen , '' he added . `` there 's no law that says i ca n't paint my house hot pink , but i assure you i have no intention of doing it . `` he called arguments to the contrary -- that isps are only repealing net neutrality rules so they can engage in the sort of behavior that would otherwise have been prohibited -- `` a very lazy and unfounded way of looking at the problem . ",
        "`` while isps have previously pledged not to prioritize web traffic in this manner , under the new rules , customers ca n't do much but take them at their word . and their word is no ironclad guarantee . last week , comcast quietly altered a net neutrality pledge that had been on its website since 2014 , removing a promise that it would n't `` prioritize internet traffic or create paid fast lanes '' and replacing it with a much more cautious pledge to `` not block , throttle , or discriminate against lawful content . '' if comcast decides on a whim to change its pledge again next week , it absolutely can . ",
        "in addition to repealing net neutrality , the new fcc rules also strip state and local governments of the power to enact their own laws regulating broadband service . that provision alarmed a group of nearly five dozen mayors from across the political spectrum , who signed a public letter last week slamming the fcc 's actions as a `` stark , inexplicable , and unwarranted attack on the constitutional principles that lie at the heart of our system of government . `` a collective of internet activist groups that have united under the banner of `` team internet '' responded to the repeal by calling on congress to review and overturn the fcc 's action . ",
        "`` the telecom industry spent millions lobbying and spreading misinformation to pit internet users against each other and turn net neutrality into a partisan issue , '' the group said in an emailed statement to huffpost . `` they have failed . '' `` net neutrality has more public support now than it ever has before . internet users are educated , outraged , and strategic , and they know that congress has the power to overturn the fcc vote , '' the statement continued . `` lawmakers can not hide from their constituents on this issue . the internet has given ordinary people more power than ever before . ",
        "we 're going to fight tooth and nail to make sure no one takes that power away . `` this article originally appeared on huffpost .   "
