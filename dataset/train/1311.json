        "as the federal open market committee joins together for chairwoman janet yellen 's final meeting as the head of u. s. monetary policy , expectations are near 100 % that the end result tomorrow will be for a quarter-point hike to the fed funds rate to 1.5 % . this is still historically low , but will mark the fifth raise since the fed cut rates to the bone in the wake of the great recession nearly a decade ago . there is not much room to trade on this news that has n't even happened yet ; more interesting for speculators will be how many times the fed raises next year .

        "but depending what happens with corporate tax reform , and considering we will have an fomc headed by incoming chairman jay powell , the blueprint for next year 's interest rate policy is far from etched in stone . ahead of today 's opening bell , we see fresh producer price index numbers for november : +0.4 % on the headline is perhaps a tad hotter than expected , whereas the `` core '' read is a more in-line +0.3 % . this illustrates a steady creep of very modest inflation into the economy , following october 's +0.4 % on both headline and core . ",
        "year over year , we see this figure hit +3.1 % -- the first time ppi has reached a 3-handle in recent memory . this is also good news for fed participants , who have been making consistent efforts to bring overall inflation to the desired 2 % . as we saw in last friday 's non-farm payroll report , wage growth has taken some baby steps in this direction of late as well , which is another key metric to understanding the health of the domestic economy . what market participants really want to see now is the november consumer price index , which will be released before the opening bell tomorrow . ",
        "not only is this the other side of the coin , but the cpi is arguably the more demonstrative for the economy : if the ppi represents the supply side of the equation , cpi is the demand . and as any business 101 student knows , if there is no demand there need be no supply . want the latest recommendations from zacks investment research ? today , you can download 7 best stocks for the next 30 days . click to get this free reportto read this article on zacks . com click here . zacks investment research .
