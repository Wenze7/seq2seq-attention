        "a coin flip could decide your next elected official . some democrats are wringing their hands over the logjam of their candidates -- 25 so far -- challenging orange county 's four republican congress members . one worry is draining democratic money in the primary that will be crucial in the general election against republicans . another is the possibility that too many democratic candidates could lead to vote-splitting among democrats , allowing two republicans to advance out of the top-two primary to the general election . but a reader presented another intriguing -- if unlikely -- scenario last week : what if the gop incumbent finishes first and two democrats tie for second ? ",
        "the state 's open primary system calls for the top two vote-getters to advance to the general election , regardless of party ... unless there 's a tie for second . then the top three vote-getters appear on the november ballot . in orange county 's gop congressional races , that could be good news for republicans : gop incumbents are expected to easily finish first in the primary , with democrats likely to be battling for the second spot . if there are two democrats and one republican on the november ballot , democrats ' voting splitting will likely give the republican a big advantage . ",
        "but wait , there 's more . things get particularly interesting if there 's a tie in the general election . if that tie occurs in the race for governor or lieutenant governor , the state legislature will vote to determine the winner . for all other races , the appropriate election official will `` determine the tie by lot . '' orange county register of voters neal kelley once put names on poker chips and did a drawing , although it was n't for an election winner . last year , he received two ballot arguments opposing a school bond for orange unified school district -- and had to decide whether to use one from conservative activist deborah pauly or controversial former school board member steve rocco . ",
        "kelley drew the chip with rocco 's name on , pauly sued and the courts stood with kelley . ties happenas for an election tie , kelley has n't seen one since he began working in the county elections office in 2004 . and secretary of state press secretary sam mahood could not recall one happening in a california state race . ties are rare , but they do happen . a nov. . 29 judicial election in mississippi was decided by a single vote -- but the loser has petitioned to have one of his opponent 's mail ballots disqualified . ",
        "in the case of a tie , a coin toss will decide the winner . a heyburn , idaho , city council race ended in a draw last month and was decided by a coin toss -- although the loser is now suing for a recount . those elections were relatively small affairs -- the vote in mississippi was 867-866 and the vote in idaho was 112-112 . the odds of a tie decrease with the number of ballots cast , but there have been some close calls even in larger orange county races . best known in recent history was now-state sen. janet nguyen 's 2007 special election for county supervisor . ",
        "after the ballots were counted , she trailed trung nguyen by seven votes . a recount put janet nguyen ahead by seven votes . a court challenge by trung nguyen narrowed the margin to three votes , but the seven-vote victory -- 10,919 vs. 10,912 -- remained as the official tally since the court challenge did n't reverse the outcome . even closer was a 2008 yorba linda council race , where jim winder outpaced ed rokochy by a single vote , 11,950-11,951 . more odditieswhile we 're on the subject of election oddities , there 's a situation where a tie could help a democratic house candidate . ",
        "let 's take rep. dana rohrabacher 's 48th congressional district , where the challengers are eight democrats , two republicans , a libertarian and an independent . assuming the incumbent captures the top spot , the field could lend itself to a democrat and a republican battling for the second spot . if that happened and they tied , that would put two republicans and a democrat on the november ballot . that not only means the democrat would gain an advantage , but that a democrat could win even if more votes were cast for republicans . the buzz is the register 's weekly political news column .
