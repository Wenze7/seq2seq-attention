        "for as long as i can remember i 've enjoyed reading and writing , but lately it seems that aside from my work writing , the usual outflow of topics and thoughts related to my own writing has run dry . the good news is that i 'm not necessarily upset of bothered by the lack of writing output , but rather i 'm using the lack of topics and writing flow to read more and to think more about what i put out there . seth godin writes often about having a daily writing discipline andthat knowing that he has to put something out there requires him to consistently stay on the lookout for things to think about , write about and share with the world . ",
        "and he also knows that telling the world that he 's going to do that , and therefore increasing the world 's expectations , keeps him on his writing habit . and it 's time for a little bit of that around here . the indoor time of the winter , the wide variety of interesting topics and ideas out there , the mental sharpness that comes from know that i have to write , and knowing that i 've made a public commitment to write is a good thing for me . let 's see what happens .
