        "jan 15 -- england all-rounder ben stokes has been charged with affray following an altercation outside a bristol nightclub in september . the 26-year-old will appear alongside two other defendants in front of magistrates in bristol at a later date after the crown prosecution service decided to pursue a conviction following a review of the evidence . stokes was already forced to miss england 's ashes tour of australia this winter following the incident , while he was also omitted from the ongoing one-day series against the same opposition . the durham player could also miss the upcoming tour of new zealand in march because of the ongoing proceedings , but he has vowed to clear his name and welcomed the opportunity to disclose his version of events in open court . ",
        "`` i want to thank all those who have continued to support me in relation to the bristol incident , not least my family , friends , fans and team-mates , '' stokes said in a statement . `` i gave a full and detailed account of my actions to the police on day one - the same day as the incident - and have cooperated at each step of the police inquiry . `` i am keen to have an opportunity to clear my name but , on advice , the appropriate time to do this is when the case comes to trial . ",
        "`` it is not yet known whether stokes ' trial will be held at magistrates or crown court , but if it takes place at the latter then the maximum punishment he could face is three years in prison .   "
