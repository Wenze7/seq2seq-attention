        "once again , bungie has apologized for messing up another event in the destiny universe . after being called out for throttling tokens and not releasing new weapons during the faction rally event , bungie came out with an apology . instead of simply saying that they were working on a fix , the team clarified its position on the situation and apologized to the fans , owning up to the mistake . more ` destiny 2 ' problems . earlier in the week , news came out that destiny 2 players were not being given the correct number of tokens during the faction rally event . ",
        "also missing during the faction rally were the weapons that players were supposed to be able to purchase during the limited time event . as soon as it happened , a community manager reached out , saying that the team was looking into the issue . bungie cleared up the issue in a new blog post this week . throttling was happening in regards to the faction tokens . the reasoning for the throttling was because players were earning too many tokens too quickly and too easily . `` players were earning hundreds of faction tokens per hour without firing a single shot . '' ",
        "instead of fixing the problem by making the gameplay more challenging , bungie just made players have a cooldown . director of destiny 2 addressed fans on twitter who were upset with the change . `` the timer was meant to fix an exploit but it is way too penalizing right now . it 's being adjusted in the next patch but we likely need to adjust it further . '' the other issue bungie had to contend with regarding faction rally was the lack of new weapons . instead of letting players know that the weapons would be released throughout the year , the developer said nothing until players were upset by the lack of weapons . ",
        "`` it was not made clear beforehand that the new season 2 weapons would be added throughout the events of the season rather than all at once in the beginning . this was on us , '' said bungie in the blog post addressing the lack of communication . if all this seems familiar , it is because this is what has been happening throughout the short life cycle of destiny 2 . players find something wrong , players become unhappy , bungie says it will fix it , and the cycle begins again . the only good thing about the post is the update by the sandbox team . ",
        "it says that it is already working on the improvements previously outlined in another post that apologized to destiny 2 players .   "
