        "berlin -- chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives and the center-left social democrats took a big step friday toward forming a new german government , sealing a preliminary agreement in which they vowed to strengthen the european union and keep a lid on the number of migrants entering the country . the 28-page deal reached in a marathon negotiating session that lasted more than 24 hours at the end of nearly a week of talks was enough for leaders of merkel 's two-party union bloc and the social democrats to recommend moving on to formal coalition negotiations . but social democrat leader martin schulz will have to work hard to persuade a party congress jan. . ",
        "21 to endorse that move . the agreement set out compromise positions on a wide range of issues , including taxes , education and health care . `` i think we have achieved outstanding results , '' schulz told reporters . he said it was a good indicator of support that his 13-member negotiating team had decided unanimously to recommend going ahead with talks . still , even if the negotiations then succeed , schulz faces another challenge : a ballot of his party 's entire membership on a coalition agreement . after the week of negotiations and the overnight session , a visibly tired merkel told reporters that she , too , was now `` optimistic that things will move forward '' to forming a new coalition of the same parties that have run germany for the past four years . ",
        "`` we are working seriously ... on creating the conditions to be able to live well in germany in 10 or 15 years , '' she said . `` we dealt with questions of investment for the future , '' she added , pointing to education , digitalization , energy and construction as major issues . if things go well , a new government could be formed by easter , said horst seehofer , the leader of the christian social union -- the bavaria-only sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union . `` if we succeed , these could be four very , very good years -- i am already speaking of these years because i believe we will succeed , '' seehofer said . ",
        "had the talks failed , merkel 's only options would have been to form a minority government or hold new elections . despite the challenges ahead , the news buoyed markets and sent the euro to a three-year high of $ 1.2138 . following a dismal result in germany 's sept. . 24 election , the social democrats initially vowed not to enter another government with merkel 's conservatives , but they reconsidered their position after the long-time chancellor 's attempts to form a coalition with two smaller parties collapsed . there still remains much resistance to it within the party 's membership , however . ",
        "friday 's agreement opened with an acknowledgement that the september election showed `` many people were dissatisfied . '' the three coalition parties ' support dropped by a cumulative total of nearly 14 percentage points in the election . it said the parties are committed to `` strengthening social cohesion in our country and overcoming the divisions that have arisen . '' it contains a long section on europe -- an issue particularly dear to schulz , a former european parliament president . the parties pledged that germany will play an active role in the debate on the eu 's future and strengthening european integration . ",
        "they pledged to fight tax dumping and evasion in europe , pushing for `` fair taxation of big companies '' including internet giants google , apple , facebook and amazon , and called for unspecified minimum rates for corporate tax . merkel currently leads a caretaker government , limiting her ability to take major policy initiatives as french president emmanuel macron pushes an ambitious european reform agenda . `` we have , in what feels like a long time since the election , seen that the world will not wait for us , '' merkel said . `` we are convinced that we need a new awakening for europe . '' ",
        "`` so i have no worries about us finding common solutions with france , '' she added . on migration , an issue that is key for seehofer 's csu , the agreement states that the number of new asylum-seekers should n't exceed a range of 180,000-220,000 annually . and there will be a 1,000 per month limit on the number of close relatives allowed to join migrants in germany who are granted a status short of full asylum .
