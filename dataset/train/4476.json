        "see your favorite final fantasy characters in vr glory ! the post universal studios japan will be getting a final fantasy vr ride appeared first on playstation lifestyle . universal studios japan is creating a special final fantasy vr ride ! named the final fantasy xr ride , it uses vr headsets and the existing space fantasy the ride roller coaster to make a fun final fantasy themed ride . the ride will be available from january 19 to june 24 . here 's a short video for the universal studios final fantasy ride , courtesy of engadget : the ride seems pretty cool , but if you 're not going to be in osaka during that time frame , you unfortunately wo n't be able to experience it . ",
        "but , there are other final fantasy vr adventures you can try out , right from home ! check out our review of monster of the deep : final fantasy xv : while virtual reality is still in its infancy , it 's managed to excel in two key areas : allowing players to experience the absurd and allowing players to mimic real actions . monster of the deep : final fantasy xv combines these two key experiences perfectly , as the mundane act of fishing is paired with fantastical monsters in a highly entertaining fantasy world . in those aspects , this strange ffxv spin-off is a perfect fit in the current vr landscape . ",
        "as far as fishing goes , monster of the deep mirrors its real-life counterpart rather faithfully . due to that , i wo n't go deep into how it plays mechanically much here . however , i will say that i found casting to be more difficult than expected , as i often found myself casting short when i was going for a far target , and vice-versa . at first , i thought there was just a learning curve , but i never really got much better at it . eventually , i settled on doing large motions to go short , and short flicks to go long , despite the motions not making much sense . ",
        "it 's a slight annoyance , but players can always reel in long casts , so it 's not much of an issue . will you be trying out the final fantasy xr ride ? the post universal studios japan will be getting a final fantasy vr ride appeared first on playstation lifestyle .   "
