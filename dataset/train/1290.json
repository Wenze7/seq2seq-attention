",
        "the company calls it an `` encrypted digital ledger of rights ownership for photographers . '' photographers can add new as well as archive images to the system . because of the blockchain structure , the data is stored on a large network of computers that both helps create a public ledger , adds a layer of protection and prevents data loss . while the blockchain keeps the record of photographs , crawler bots will search the web for those photos , kodak said . licensed images will be linked to an ip address , so bots wo n't incorrectly flag purchased images . ",
        "if that crawler detects an image that was n't properly licensed , kodak says the platform assists photographers in getting those sites to license the image . `` for many in the tech industry , ` blockchain ' and ` cryptocurrency ' are hot buzzwords , but for photographers who 've long struggled to assert control over their work and how it 's used , these buzzwords are the keys to solving what felt like an unsolvable problem , '' kodak ceo jeff clarke said in a statement . `` kodak has always sought to democratize photography and make licensing fair to artists . ",
        "these technologies give the photography community an innovative and easy way to do just that . `` along with serving as a platform for photographers to help find and recover stolen images , kodakone will also function as a licensing platform where photographers can sell their work . kodak said the platform pays in kodakcoin immediately after the sale and is ideal for both professional and amateur photographers . for kodakcoin , the initial offering launches on january 31 in the u. s. , u. k. , canada and other select countries , issued under sec guidelines with regulation 506 as an exempt offering . ",
