        "in gee chun plays a smooth game of golf -- what 's between that game and victory is a chink in her mental game . in gee chun , like lydia ko , has a world-class game in her bag . and like ko , in gee chun went winless in 2017 . that 's not to say that the world-ranked number six had a bad season or is suffering from a collapsing game . chun recorded ten top-10 finishes last year out of 23 lpga event starts . you can do the math . chun finished inside the top ten in 43 % of her starts , an impressive stat any player would be delighted to possess . ",
        "with $ 1.25 millions in winnings she ranked 11th on the tour 's 2017 official money list . so what 's holding in gee chun back from a win ? it 's certainly not her swing . take a look at some of the shots she delivered at the keb lpga hana bank championship , where she shot an impressive 16-under and finished third , behind jin young ko and sung hyun park . chun 's technical gamei took a closer look at chun 's playing stats , thinking i could identify the weakness in her game that 's keeping her out of the winner 's circle . ",
        "while chun is a bit short off the tee she 's a more accurate shot-maker than most . the payoff comes in her ability to get from tee to green quickly and efficiently . for the 2017 season she ranked fourth on the tour in gir and that gave her a huge advantage over the competition . chun 's putting is good but not great . she averaged just over 29 putts per round for the 2017 season , which got her inside the top 50 on the tour . as i 've watched in gee chun play i 've thought she 's the master of the two-putt , and she ranked 13th in total number of birdies in 2017 . ",
        "her short game keeps her inside the top 10 finishers . what 's missing -- a killer instinctso what does in gee chun need to do to move from those consistent high finishes into the winner 's circle ? what chun seems to lack is that killer instinct that drives cristie kerr and sung hyun park to their victories . i do n't for a minute think in gee chun lacks self-confidence . to the contrary , she seems utterly confident in her game and her presence on the game 's big stage . she enjoys playing well and she 's comfortable with the missed shots every golfer endures . ",
        "chun is remarkably even-tempered and good-humored , and those very positive personality traits do n't easily leave room for the will to defeat one 's opponent . from annika s√∂renstam to shanshan feng , the women who 've reached the pinnacle of the world rankings have , like in gee chun , been superb golfers . unlike chun , they have all played to win by defeating their opponents . will in gee chun discover that winning ingredient in her game this season ? what do you think ? more from foregals golf : is it an option for my daughter in high school ?
