        "interview with edith copley , director of choral studies at northern arizona university , about the university 's annual holiday dinner event . `` one of the things i really work hard on is to get a connection so that , when the choir 's singing , they make a connection with the audience with what they 're doing . '' `` i think being in choral music , it builds community . it builds a real sense within a section in the choir and then the choir itself . they have to work together . they have to listen . ",
        "they have to be responsive to the conductor but so much of it is working together and i think that that 's what makes it extremely special . it is a real sense of community in a choral rehearsal and in performance . '' `` every place that i 've been teaching we 've always done big holiday concerts and then when i came to nau we had this thing called the holiday dinners , which is a really major event , so probably the biggest kind of christmas choral event that i 've been involved with in my life . ",
        "'' `` it 's the one event during the year that we all working together . we 're all performing separately but we all join together and sing together , surround the audience , light candles . it just is a real heartwarming event , i think for the students as well as for the people in the audience . '' without question , the most special moment in the holiday dinner is at the very end because we sing still , still , still and this is the one piece that for all forty-three years the choral union has sung together . ",
        "it makes it a very special piece . the other thing is we invite all our alumni to come up and join our circle , to take a candle and sing with us . i think that 's a great moment . '' hannah kimball conducting the university singers at northern arizona university .   "
