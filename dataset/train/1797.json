        "mole valley district council has agreed to let elected councillors make the final decision instead of a planning officerthe contested sale of a public footpath to private owners in dorking will now be decided by councillors instead of a council officer . it is feared by some that if the small piece of land , which provides public access between meadowbank park and the town centre , is sold it could lead to homes being flooded and hundreds of people having a longer walk into town . residents opposed the sale of a piece of land between fairfield drive and london road to such a degree that mole valley district council agreed to hold a public meeting on the issue on january 3 . ",
        "as a result of the meeting , held of the councils pippbrook offices , mvdc has decided to extend the consultation on the sale of the land in front of pippbrook mill to january 12 to take stock of the community 's opinions . hazel watson , surrey county councillor for dorking hills , who has previously voiced concern over the potential sale of the land believes it is only right such an important issue is decided in this way . she said : `` everyone is particularly happy the decision will be made in an open and transparent way with residents ' opinions considered . ",
        "`` the council chambers and public gallery were packed out with residents ready to speak out about their concern of a public right of way being sold to private developers . `` the council has said that the earliest date a final decision will be made by the council 's executive committee will be march 27 . grant meltonone of the main objections to the potential sale of the land centres around the fact that it includes a sluice gate which is used to protect nearby properties from flooding from pipp brook . the sluice gate is currently the responsibility of mvdc to open and close and it is feared that , if the land is sold , the new owner will hold the fate of nearby properties in their hands . ",
        "at the public meeting planning officers from the council presented their reasoning for why the land had been put up for sale . it was said that Â£ 30,000 would be raised from the sale and that more money would also be saved for the taxpayer in the future as responsibility for maintaining the land would now lie with the new owenr . grant meltonhowever it is this fact that cllr watson believes is worrying residents the most . she said : `` considering there 's a sluice gate on the land in question , residents believe it would be dangerous to leave this in the hands of a private developer .
