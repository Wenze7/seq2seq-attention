        "a u. s. judge on tuesday refused to order a mistrial in the case of mehmet hakan atilla , an executive at turkey 's majority state-owned halkbank who is charged with helping iran evade u. s. sanctions . u.s. district judge richard berman in manhattan federal court rejected arguments by atilla 's lawyers that the trial was tainted when prosecutors asked atilla , during a dec. . 19 cross-examination , whether he remembered that a report by a turkish expert had concluded he violated sanctions . ` grossly mischaracterized ` atilla 's lawyers objected before atilla could answer , saying the question involved hearsay and `` grossly mischaracterized '' the turkish expert 's conclusion . ",
        "berman told the jury to disregard it . atilla 's lawyers moved for a mistrial on dec. . 20 . berman said on tuesday that his instruction to the jury was enough to prevent any unfairness to atilla , adding that a mistrial was an `` extreme '' outcome that should be avoided whenever possible . berman had already denied another motion by atilla for a mistrial earlier in the case . a lawyer for atilla could not immediately be reached for comment . jurors are expected to come to court on wednesday for their fourth day of deliberations in the case , which has strained diplomatic relations between the united states and turkey . ",
        "at the center of the three-week trial was testimony from turkish-iranian gold trader reza zarrab , who pleaded guilty to charges of violating sanctions and testified for u. s. prosecutors . turkey president implicatedzarrab testified that atilla helped design fraudulent gold and food transactions that allowed iran to spend its oil and gas revenues abroad , including through u. s. financial institutions , defying u. s. sanctions . zarrab also implicated turkish officials in the scheme , including president tayyip erdogan . attempts to reach erdogan 's spokesman for comment on the allegations at the trial have been unsuccessful . ",
        "erdogan has publicly dismissed the case as a politically motivated attack on his government . charges deniedatilla has denied all of the charges against him . halkbank has denied taking part in any illegal transactions . the first request for a mistrial came after jurors heard testimony from huseyin korkmaz , a former turkish police officer who said he led an investigation that included atilla and fled turkey in fear of retaliation . atilla 's lawyers said the testimony unfairly associated their client with political violence . u.s. prosecutors charged nine people in the criminal case , though only zarrab , 34 , and atilla , 47 , were arrested by u. s. authorities .
