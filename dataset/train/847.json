        "washington -- the collapse started in the final seconds of the first half when the knicks watched washington 's john wall chase down an offensive rebound and hit a tiebreaking buzzer beater . the bad vibe kept rolling to start the second half as the knicks and jeff hornacek looked absolutely disinterested and with their minds possibly on miami 's south beach for friday 's showdown against the heat . after trailing by one point at halftime , the knicks got blown out in the second half , with hornacek conservative with his timeouts , as the wizards posted a 121-103 rout wednesday at capital one arena . ",
        "in losing a back-to-back to san antonio and washington , the knicks have lost six of seven and are two games under . 500 for the first time since they started 1-3 . they also fell to 3-13 on the road . slumping kristaps porzingis had a strong first half before disappearing , scoring 14 of his 16 points before intermission . he did n't score his first point of the second half until midway through the fourth after missing his first five shots . he finished the night 5-of-13 from the field . the wizards ransacked the knicks in the first six minutes of the second half , reeling off a 20-5 run . ",
        "strangely , hornacek preserved his timeouts as the knicks were getting battered . it was n't until bradley beal brought down the house with a dipsy-doodle move on porzingis at the 3-point line . beasley drained a stepback over the off-balance latvian to jack the lead to 16 points at 84-68 that hornacek wanted to talk it over after his team that had committed six turnovers to start the second half . after racking up 63 points in the first half , the knicks saw their offense die and were outscored in the third quarter 26-14 . washington 's marcin gortat reached his season high with 3:30 left in the third quarter , getting to 20 points on 9-of-10 shooting . ",
        "the first half came to a lousy ending for the knicks when , with less than a second to play , porzingis and michael beasley watched john wall chase down an offensive rebound and hit the buzzer-beater to break the 62-62 tie . . beasley finished with a team-high 20 points , lighting up the second half . beal added 27 and wall 25 . porzingis had a good rhythm in the first half , drawing fouls and hitting a couple of catch-and-shoots . he sank 14 by halftime , making 5-of-6 free throws and going 4-of-7 from the field . ",
        "rookie point guard frank ntilikina , over his sickness that bothered him tuesday , quarterbacked the knicks to a nine-point second-quarter lead before the wizards rallied on a 12-4 run . ntilikina made 3-of-5 shots in the half , scoring seven points in 8:31 .   "
