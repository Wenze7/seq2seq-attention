        "memphis , tn -- december 30 : wide receiver john diarsegeorgia football has signed 20 players for the 2018 class . we 're going to take a quick look at every one of them and it 's time to look at cornerback divaad wilson . * highlights * 247sportsas the 2017 georgia football team moves on after their final game of the season , we 're going to do the same . rather than looking back at the national championship game , we 're going to keep looking forward . that 's why we 're going to continue our series about the new 2018 signees . ",
        "with signing day behind us and with uga having 20 players in the books , whereas before , these guys were recruits , who could still change their minds , now they have signed with georgia and we can count on them coming to athens . divaad wilson is the third defensive back that signed with the 2018 class . he is also the only one who enrolled early and is currently in athens . wilson was a player who really trended with georgia late and joined the class on the early signing day . he 's another player who could end up making an impact in the future on the georgia bulldogs . ",
        "so let 's take a look at how exactly wilson ended up in athens and what kind of player we can expect playing between the hedges . next : how did he end up at uga ? athens , ga -- october 04 : defensive back dominick sandershow did he end up at uga ? wilson is a player that georgia fans can be very happy they signed . that 's not just because of his talent , however , it 's also because they stole him from their rivals , the florida gators . wilson committed to the gators back in february of 2017 . ",
        "he was a relatively under the radar recruit back then who did n't have huge offers . but he jumped up the charts when the camp circuit started and ended up as a 4-star prospect . it looked like the gators had gone in early and won on a really good prospect . but when jim mcelwain was fired , this got a bit dicey for florida . randy shannon , the defensive coordinator was not retained by new head coach dan mullen . that was a big issue for wilson who had a great connection with the previous coaching staff . ",
        "after talking to mullen and hearing about his decision , he decided to look elsewhere . georgia quickly became the front-runner for wilson who played at the same school as then uga commit rachard wildgoose . that connection helped give georgia the inside take and throughout december , they were the team to beat . wilson committed and signed on december 20th . he enrolled in january . next : what type of player is he ? athens , ga -- november 18 : aaron davis what type of player is he ? ironically , wildgoose who helped bring wilson to athens decommitted from georgia this week . ",
        "it seems that his space has been taken by a higher ranked player and wilson coming in probably did n't help . wilson is a better player than his teammate and is a pure corner rather than a safety . uga is much more needy on the outside than it is the inside right now . wilson is a very talented cornerback who has a real nose for the ball and a big play . he 's not as physical as chris smith or the same physical specimen as nadab joseph , but he 's a turnover machine who makes plays when the ball is in the air . ",
        "when you watch the highlights , you see a cornerback who gets a lot of interceptions . chris smith did n't do the same in his senior season in part because people did n't throw it his way . but wilson made the most of those throws and he showed that he has a knack for finding the football . wilson is also a legit punt returner who could end up stepping into that role eventually . georgia has a lot of explosive athletes for that role though so instead , i could see him being a really great gunner one day on special teams . ",
        "he 's a very capable tackler which is why i expect him to contribute there next season . ultimately , wilson reminds me quite a bit of tyrique mcgee . he has a habit of getting around the ball and making a play when he needs to . but wilson is quicker than mcgee and could end up being a better player . next : what can we expect in athens ? south bend , in -- september 09 : richard lecounte iiiwhat can we expect in athens ? i 'm not entirely sure where wilson will fit in the secondary right now . ",
        "georgia recruited pretty heavily there in 2017 and has done the same this year . he 's heading into a very talented position group although it is one that has lots of available spots right now . deandre baker is going to hold down one cornerback spot next season . but who takes the other one on the outside right now is anybody 's guess . mcgee is the favorite , but i believe he is ideally a slot cornerback . his experience and playmaking make him the perfect fit there in my opinion . wilson is already on campus which is big for him . ",
        "it gives him the chance to start competing for a position on day 1 . he will go up against the likes of eric stokes , mcgee , william poole and ameer speed this spring for a spot in the rotation . then he will have to contend with smith , joseph and possibly a top rated corner when the summer arrives . that 's a lot of options with plenty of talent . wilson is going to have to beat out some really good players to win a spot . it might not happen in 2018 , but i think he 'll find a way onto the field eventually . ",
        "i do also think he 's going to be someone who makes an impact on special teams . that 's another important area where i see him contributing from day one . next : 5 potential replacements for roquanin any normal class , i 'd be so excited about wilson . he 'd be someone i talked about as a potential starter in his sophomore year . but the way kirby smart is recruiting right now is insane . wilson might end up being the 4th best db in his own class . that is downright scary because this guy can really play .
