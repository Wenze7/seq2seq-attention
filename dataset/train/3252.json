        "there are delays on trains in and out of london waterloo this morning , the fourth day of disruption so far this week . today 's transport issues are caused by a track circuit failure at vauxhall . although all lines have now reopened , trains running through this station may be still be cancelled , delayed by up to 10 minutes or revised . disruption is expected until 09:00 . `` yesterday morning , we received reports of a track circuit failure at vauxhall station . a track circuit is the method that signallers use in order to detect the presence of trains on the track , and in this instance the track circuit was intermittently changing between showing the section as occupied and free , '' national rail said . ",
        "`` whilst network rail engineers worked to investigate the issues and take corrective action , one of the lines heading away from london was blocked . the line was opened again yesterday afternoon , however it was determined that further work was required to enable the fault to be fully rectified , and the engineers have been working hard overnight to return the track to normal working order , and all lines have now reopened . trains may still be subject to delays and short notice alterations as services return to normal .
