        "file - in this aug. . 13 , 2017 , file photo , logan paul introduces a performance by kyle & lil yachty and rita ora at the teen choice awards at the galen center in los angeles . youtube says it has removed blogger logan paul 's channels from google preferred and will not feature him in the new season of `` foursome . '' paul 's new video blogs also are on hold after he shared a video on youtube that appeared to show a body hanging in a japanese forest that is said to be a suicide spot . ",
        "pasadena , calif. . -- youtube has suspended a star who posted video images of what appeared to be a suicide victim but said saturday that does n't mean it wo n't work with him in the future . the video service announced this week that it had pulled logan paul 's channel from its ad-supported google preferred platform and put two other projects on hold . youtube chief business officer robert kyncl said saturday there 's no timetable for when paul 's future will be addressed again . kyncl did n't shut youtube 's door on paul . `` everything is evolving so fast , '' kyncl said . ",
        "`` the best thing we can do is put all projects on hold indefinitely , and there 's no date or plan for him in the future . `` paul apologized for posting video of him in a forest near mount fuji in japan near what seemed to be a body hanging from a tree . the location is known in japan as a frequent site for suicides . youtube said the images violated its policies . paul pulled the images from his channel on his own . youtube was criticized for moving slowly in response , taking nearly two weeks to take action . ",
        "youtube said on twitter this week that critics were right to be frustrated by its initial lack of response . kyncl said paul recognizes that he has made serious missteps and has expressed remorse for them . `` the most important thing to focus on is that actions speak louder than words and logan has the opportunity to prove that , '' he said . removing paul 's work from the google preferred platform cuts off a significant route to advertising revenue through youtube . youtube also said it would not feature paul in the fourth season of its series `` foursome '' and would put other work on hold . ",
        "paul is one of the platform 's biggest stars , with forbes magazine estimating he earned $ 12.5 million last year . youtube said it would soon announce steps to protect advertisers from having their products connected to controversial material .   "
