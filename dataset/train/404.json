        "el t√©cnico de real madrid zinedine zidane gesticula durante un partido de la liga contra el celta de vigo el domingo , 7 de enero del 2018 . madrid -- as far as zinedine zidane is concerned , things are not as bad as they look for real madrid . zidane downplayed madrid 's recent setbacks , blaming critics for exaggerating the team 's struggles and wanting to create turmoil at the club . `` i 'm tired of hearing that madrid is struggling , '' zidane said on friday . `` it 's easy to say that everything is wrong , but it 's not all bad here . ",
        "it 's pretty to talk negatively about real madrid , it sells more . `` madrid has been under increased pressure since it lost to barcelona 3-0 at home in its last game of 2017 . it started the year by defeating second-division club numancia 3-0 in the copa del rey , but then was held by celta vigo to 2-2 in the spanish league and could n't manage more than another 2-2 against numancia in the return leg of the copa at santiago bernabeu stadium . `` we ca n't listen to what is being said , '' zidane said . ",
        "`` everything that is said about real madrid is negative , but in reality things are not like that . i do n't see it like that . the situation is what it is , and we have to try to make the most out of it . we are still alive in all competitions and we have to keep moving forward . we are not doing as bad as people say . `` madrid is in the knockout stages of the copa del rey and the champions league , but it already trails barcelona by 16 points with a game in hand near the halfway point of the spanish league . ",
        "it has never been able to overcome this big of a gap and win la liga . madrid will face leganes in the quarterfinals of the copa del rey next week , and next month it will take on paris saint-germain in the last 16 of the champions league , a competition it has won the last two seasons . its next league game is on saturday against sixth-place villarreal . `` we have to show on the field that we are improving , '' zidane said . `` we will do that by winning matches . that 's what 's important , and recently it has been difficult to win matches . ",
        "`` zidane , who this week confirmed he has renewed his contract with madrid until 2020 , said he was not worried about the team being jeered by fans at the bernabeu , but made a plea for their support . `` what i ask is that they support the team , like they have always done , '' zidane said . `` i 'd tell them not to listen too much to what is being said . in difficult moments we need the fans to be on our side .
