        "buddhism & the modern society : we 're focusing on the wrong place . human has their advance technology and knowledge but still , they have not find what they 're looking for -- happiness . buddhism is an ancient wisdom of living -- teaching human to live happily and peacefully -- but in the modern society , it seem to be just something spiritual more than the practical knowledge that could be used to benefit our life . however , wisdom that buddha had discovered is far more than just a spiritual guideline . it 's simple truth of nature which could be seen in everything and benefit human life in any extent . ",
        "this chapter of buddhism and the modern society focuses on applying the knowledge of buddhism into socio-dynamic perspective , to help us understand and develop our society in the simplest way . wrong definition of problemwe have democracy , also we have communism . there are countries running with welfare state principal and others that run with capitalism or socialism . we 've been developing so many social systems to create an ideal society -- the place where there 's no fighting and suffering , but all that system could do is failing us repeatedly by the problems it create . ",
        "poverty , inequality and war have never been diminished from our society . one reason we 've never found that place is because there 's nothing such an ideal system exists for us at the first place . we 're looking for something unrealistic -- the world without poverty and inequality , so we 're trying to reach an impossible goal . we expect too much from the world and believe that everything has to be fair and justified . we 're searching for the perfection in this imperfect world . 2 . wrong direction of solvingsociety appears when people come and live together as a group . ",
        "we set the rules and agreement to prevent conflict and use it as guideline to run the whole society but we 've never interested in the origin of that conflict . creating a social system is an act of avoiding problem rather than to tackle it . we choose to focus on how to escape from the problem than finding the way to solve it . it could be said that a system like democracy could prevent most of the conflict by reaching the consensus from majority but it does n't mean that those majority wo n't later change their mind and their belief . ",
        "in the universe that everything has to change unavoidably , there 's nothing such the best thing . there 's only the right thing at the right time . that 's why creating system ca n't prevent us from fighting or hurting each other . human is changing all the time but the system is not . it 's obvious for everyone that the world is changing every second but most of us still do n't understand this fact , and still try to find the way to prevent it from happening . we try to find just a solid system which could suit all kind of situation in the world and give us an expected result . ",
        "we try to make the world predictable . we 're running the whole world in wrong direction . 3 . misconception of truthone thing that necessary for human happiness is freedom . since we 've been learning to live together as a society -- there 're so many attempts to create the system which could remain the freedom for each individual under the laws or some agreement . this is an act of creating conflict itself . how we could remain our freedom if we have to live our life under conditions that sometime we do n't want -- could this be called freedom ? ",
        "it could n't be refused that everything has their own extent and limitation , also the freedom . it means we are free and not free at the same time . we 're free to live our life as long as our life wo n't hurt other people 's life . this is an only condition of living together that really have to be considered -- try not to hurt each other . system like democracy delude us from seeing this simple condition by creating the concept of human right , freedom of speech and liberalism -- making us to believe in rules and system rather than to perceive the world through our feeling of love and compassion . ",
        "we begin to judge other people with a rational-fixed mindset , adopted from these principals -- so we forget that every human being is imperfect and not always rational . 4 . misunderstanding of loveuniversal concept like human right tell us to respect other people but there 's no universal instruction for us to do given along . interpretation of these abstract concepts could be vary as we all have our own different attitude and experience . this means we could believe in different thing even though it 's the same concept -- and to prevent our own belief , we tend to focus on our own right according to our own belief rather than others right and their belief . ",
        "focusing too much on our own right decreases our ability to listen with empathy . therefore , it decrease our ability to love . we do n't respect each other because we understand them but because it 's their right to be respected . trying to respect other people without understanding of their belief cause us to create our own criteria of who would deserve our respect and who would n't . it 's a tool to prevent us from being guilt for being unable to respect everyone like we think we should be . how we could love and respect someone if we do n't understand them -- even further , if they hurt us . ",
        "this is the point where all kind of social discrimination originate , to determine who deserve our respect and who do n't . we do n't live our life according to our human feeling anymore , but we 're living with the ambiguous concept of morality instead . unfortunately for us that today society keeps feeding us so many negative feeling -- the society that full of problems like food deprivation , social inequality and war , so it 's hard for us to remain our faith in humanity among these negativities . these negative stimuli , without our awareness of it , would dominate our perception on the whole society -- and would eventually become our reality , so we would end up as a hateful person who hate his own society . ",
        "this maybe a reason why depression patient rate is increasing in some country . 5 . focusing on the wrong placesociety is a large group of people living together so if there are so many people whose heart full of hatred living in it -- it would become a hateful society where everyone is hurting each other to serve their own right . in contrast , if there are more happy people in the society , that society would become the place where everyone respects and tries to love each other . this means that to save the society is to save our own self from becoming that hateful person who negatively criticize everything -- and to become a happy person who is ready to love and share . ",
        "our modern education system is also an important factor of the problem . it 's taking us away from the fact that we could easily change our society by taking care of our own happiness . it teach us that if we want to do something good for the society we have to take a big action like doing a voluntary job or helping poorer people -- and if we do want to make a big change on it -- we have to do it through the system . this is not all wrong but it 's not all right . ",
        "doing something good for other people requires more energy than doing something good for our own self , so if we do n't really want to do it -- it would eventually hurt ourselves and others instead of helping them . also making change on the society are n't necessary to be done through the system . it also could be done through love and compassion . focusing to make change through the system make us forget that we could also make the change through people around us by loving and trying to understand them . if we make just one person in our life become a happier person , it also means that we 're helping our society to become a happier society . ",
        "conclusionpoverty , social inequality and discrimination are problems originated from from the conflict of human differences , but differences is the nature of human being . trying to get rid of these problems mean we 're trying to fight with our nature as a human . it might be possible but it 's hard to do and it requires so many conditions or complicated system . it 's almost not possible for us , ordinary people , to affect the system and make change through it . therefore , it could be said that it 's an ineffective way . ",
        "to find an easier solution is to move our focus from external factor like system and culture , into internal factor like happiness and peace . the ideal society is the place we expect to find happiness and escape from all sufferings , but how we could reach that goal if we still do n't happy to live in the society . people keep blaming the society for not good enough for them to live happily . their happiness is bound to so many external factors rather than inside -- they move their learning process from inside stimuli to outside stimuli -- so instead of making themselves happy from inside , they try to change things what make them unhappy . ",
        "system and concept is necessary for learning but it also make us to believe in false concept , like there are ` good ' or ` bad ' people , and to judge each other only by our moralistic belief without listening . but the truth is that there are just ` imperfect ' people as we all are . we promise to respect each other but all we do is blaming each other on their mistakes . to respect people mean to aware that they are human just like you . they could hurt each other and do stupid thing but they still want to be happy just like you . ",
        "to respect other is to truly respect your self that you also are n't a perfect human and no one is .   "
