        "hong kong police 's chief telecommunications engineer , once tipped to serve as the innovation and technology bureau 's deputy minister , was on friday accused of concealing his married status to mislead the government into granting him more than hk$ 1.9 million in housing loans and allowances . wong chun-kau , 58 , made his first court appearance on friday , more than 20 years after the alleged offence took place in his filing of a statement on housing and housing related benefits received by an officer/his spouse on september 8 , 1997 . at the time wong was eligible for the government 's home financing scheme as a telecommunications engineer with the hong kong police force . ",
        "the scheme granted him more than hk$ 1.9 million in a down payment loan and home financing allowances . but prosecutors told the eastern court that his statement was `` false , erroneous or defective '' because it claimed that wong was single when he was in fact married with a wife and receiving housing benefits . the case brought by the independent commission against corruption arose from a complaint referred by the treasury . wong was charged with one count of using a false document with intent to deceive his principal , an offence is punishable by three years ' imprisonment and a hk$ 100,000 fine . ",
        "his case will return on february 12 for plea . in the meantime , wong was released on hk$ 10,000 bail by principal magistrate bina chainrai , with the condition that he reside at his reported address and refrain from contacting any prosecution witnesses . wong was once tipped to serve as the bureau 's deputy minister before its launch in 2015 . the post of undersecretary was later taken up by dr david chung wai-keung . the home financing scheme was introduced by the colonial government on october 1 , 1990 to promote home ownership among civil servants . ",
        "under the scheme , beneficiaries receive monthly home financing allowances for a maximum period of 120 months to repay mortgages for residential property in hong kong . officers appointed on permanent and pensionable terms are also eligible for a down payment loan to help them acquire residential properties . such loans are repayable with interest over 10 years .
