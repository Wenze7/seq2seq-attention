        "marvel is getting into the podcast game . in addition to the marvel cinematic universe on the big screen and a number of tv shows across multiple networks and streaming services , the comic giant is going to debut an audio drama in 2018 . as reported by mashable , marvel will release a 10-episode scripted podcast that revolves around x-men character wolverine . the project , wolverine : the long night , will premiere on stitcher premium in spring 2018 . it will then be released across all other podcast platforms in the fall . the original story follows two agents as they track a serial killer in alaska , whom they suspect is wolverine . ",
        "the mutant will be voiced by the hobbit star richard armitage in the podcast . he 's joined by scott adsit , bob balaban , brian stokes , and chris gethard , who will appear in a cameo . speaking to mashable , writer ben percy described the 10-episode series as a blend of previous podcasts like serial and s-town , along with the `` narrative tricks '' used in true detective . `` if you look at the success of serial and s-town , it has everything to do i think with their investigative formats , the way the listeners become complicit in the narrative , '' he says . ",
        "`` they 're co-authors , they 're literary detectives , because they 're piecing together the clues alongside the reporters , and i wanted to take a similar approach to that . `` should wolverine : the long night prove successful , there 's no telling what other stories -- both original and adapted from other works -- marvel would be interested in telling through audio dramas . percy is already throwing around the phrase marvel podcast universe , so chances are if the long night works out , fans will be getting even more of their favorite character in podcast-form .
