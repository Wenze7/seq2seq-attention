        "chelsea were on top throughout the first half at stamford bridge , with forster making multiple saves and a pedro effort deflecting onto the post . the impressive alonso broke the deadlock just before half-time , though , bending a delightful free-kick into the bottom-left corner from 25 yards out for his fourth goal of the season . charlie austin had two fine chances to level the scores but could not find a way past chelsea goalkeeper thibaut courtois , whose saves secured a fourth successive premier league victory over southampton for the blues . video courtesy of @marcosalonso03 's left foot !
