        "japanese e-commerce platform rakuten has announced its plan to shake up the mobile business in its home country . reuters is reporting that the company is applying for a license to offer 4g service , making it japan 's fourth national wireless carrier . rakuten intends to offer service in 2019 , and has a target of gaining 15 million customers , putting it well behind third-placed softbank , which currently serves 39 million . rakuten already has a toe in the mobile world , thanks to its imaginatively-named mvno , rakuten mobile . according to our colleagues in japan , the budget carrier offers low cost voice and data services . ",
        "but that , at least , means that rakuten wo n't be launching into the market from a standing start , and since it already has beefy e-commerce and media platforms , has plenty of reasons to lock customers in . the move appears to have been prompted , at least in part , because of regulatory concerns that japan 's big three : softbank , ntt docomo and au/kddi have too much power . rakuten believes that extra competition will lower prices , but even if it does shake up the industry , there 's no discounts on offer . ",
        "the company believes that it 'll need to raise $ 5.3 billion in order to pay for the necessary spectrum and infrastructure .   "
