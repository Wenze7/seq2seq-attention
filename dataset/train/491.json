        "lhasa -- about 4.95 million tourists visited the city of nyingchi in southwest china 's tibet autonomous region in the first 11 months of 2017 , up 18.94 percent year on year , authorities said tuesday . tourism revenue during the past 11 months increased by 15.6 percent year on year to 4.33 billion yuan . both the number of tourists and the revenue hit new records , according to the city 's tourism development commission . compared to other tibetan regions , which are known for their snow-covered mountains and high plateaus , nyingchi is a valley facing the indian ocean to the southeast , where the warm indian current moves upstream to meet the cold air from the north , allowing the co-existence of tropical , sub-tropical , temperate and frigid zones . ",
        "with an average altitude of 3,100 meters above the sea level , much lower than the region 's average height of more than 4,000 meters , and more green vegetation , nyingchi has long been a stop for visitors looking to acclimatize to the high-altitude plateau environment . famous landmarks include the 7,780-meter-high namcha barwa peak , the 15th highest in the world , named as the most beautiful peak in china by the chinese national geography magazine , and the 490-km-long precipitous yarlung tsangpo grand canyon . according to the city plan , nyingchi aims to receive over 10 million tourists in 2020 , with an annual tourism revenue of over 10 billion yuan . ",
        "the city currently has 27 tourist attractions and 307 hotels which can accommodate 7.8 million tourists annually . it plans to build another 40 rural tourism villages in the region .   "
