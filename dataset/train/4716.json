",
        "in a statement today , nama said : `` during the course of 2017 , nama redeemed the final € 2.6 billion of its government-guaranteed senior debt . € 30.2 billion of senior debt was originally issued by nama in 2010 and 2011 to acquire bank loans and , when issued , it was intended that this debt would be redeemed by 2020 . `` the final redemption was made over three years ahead of schedule . this means that nama 's primary objective has been achieved with the elimination of a € 30.2 billion contingent liability of the irish state . ",
        "`` it adds : `` nama continues to manage a diverse portfolio of loans valued at € 3.7 billion and expects to generate a profit for 2017 . subject to favourable market conditions prevailing and the effective management of its remaining portfolio of assets , nama expects to deliver a surplus of the order of € 3 billion by the time it completes its work . `` image : namadownload our app for exclusive content , podcasts and listen back .
