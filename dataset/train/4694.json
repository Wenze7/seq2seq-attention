        "catalonia goes to the polls on thursday to elect a new regional government . the vote was called by the spanish government after it took control of the region and ousted the pro-independence administration of carles puigdemont , following october 's unilateral declaration of independence . why is the election significant ? not for the first time , pro-independence parties in catalonia are treating the vote as a de facto referendum on regional independence . if the separatist movement draws significant support at the polls , its grassroots will be reinvigorated and tensions with madrid are bound to flare once again . ",
        "a big turnout in favour of the parties of puigdemont and his deposed vice-president , oriol junqueras , would prove another massive headache for madrid and would hasten another showdown and the possible extension of direct rule if independence leaders refused to abandon their unilateral drive for sovereignty . conversely , victory for the unionist bloc would be disastrous for puigdemont , junqueras and their supporters , suggesting that their high-stakes , aggressive push for independence has backfired badly . the spanish government would find its tough approach vindicated and would be in a far stronger position when it came to any independence negotiations . ",
        "what kind of government is likely to emerge ? polls suggest it will be a tight race for first place between the leftist , pro-independence erc and the centre-right , unionist ciutadans party . but with neither party predicted to win anywhere near a majority of seats , a hung parliament and rounds of coalition negotiations seem all but inevitable . another alliance between puigdemont 's juntsxcat , the erc and the anti-capitalist cup is possible , but such a coalition would be problematic . there are tensions between juntsxcat and the erc , and the cup 's insistence on unilateral independence would be frowned on by the madrid government , which could again use the constitution to apply direct rule . ",
        "scenario two is a three-way leftist coalition of catalunya en comú-podem , the erc , and the catalan branch of the socialist party , the psc . however , any deal would involve the erc having to renounce its unilateral approach to independence and the psc abandoning its support for direct rule from madrid . ciutadans could try to build a pro-unionist government with the psc and the conservative people 's party of catalonia , but the centre-right party and the socialists have been trading insults and the latter would suffer nationally for teaming up with the people 's party , which governs spain . ",
        "whatever happens , comú-podem looks set to play kingmaker in the looming rounds of horsetrading . it could prop up an erc-led coalition supported by juntsxcat -- one excluding the cup -- but it might require both parties to soften their line on unilateral independence . what happens if no government can be formed ? although results are expected late on thursday night , they will not be officially declared until 5 january . the catalan parliament must then meet within 20 working days to elect a speaker . an investiture debate to vote on a new regional president needs to take place within 10 working days of the speaker 's election . ",
        "an absolute majority is required ; if no one attains it , a second vote will be held two days later that requires only a simple majority . if there is still no winner two months after the first presidential vote , parliament will be dissolved and new elections held 54 days after the date of the first investiture vote . it is also worth noting that article 155 of the spanish constitution -- which permits madrid to maintain direct rule over catalonia -- will stay in place until there is a new catalan government . but , whatever thursday 's results , the catalan independence crisis looks set to roll on and a solution remains as elusive as ever . ",
        "who tends to vote for whom ? before the independence debate took centre stage , catalan politics were simple enough : rural areas voted for the conservative nationalist convergència i uniò party and the cities voted for the socialists . with the rise of independence , the broad town/country split remains : rural catalonia is more secessionist than barcelona or tarragona . it still votes for convergència , who have taken up the independence cause , with the erc also polling well in the rural north and west . in barcelona there are far fewer independence flags on balconies in working-class areas than in middle-class districts , with hardly any in the wealthiest parts of the city . ",
        "the city 's inhabitants are , however , underrepresented in the regional assembly : to win a seat in the thinly populated province of lleida you need about 20,000 votes ; a seat in barcelona will cost you 46,000 . the secessionists ' goal is to win more than 50 % of the popular vote , something they have yet to achieve . a big turnout in the more densely populated urban areas could thwart this ambition . a key factor on election day will be the beltway -- the ring of towns that grew up on barcelona 's periphery to accommodate the wave of immigration in the 1960s and 1970s . ",
        "until recently , the beltway voted solidly socialist in national elections but tended not to vote at all in the autonomous catalan elections . catalan share of vote which parties are running in the election ? junts per catalunya together for catalonia the revamp of catalonia for yes , the deposed coalition government of erc and puigdemont 's convergència i unió , which changed its name to distance itself from corruption scandals . the new group insists that puigdemont is the only legitimate president and that the illegal 1 october referendum is the basis for an independent republic , but backs away from committing to a timescale for independence . ",
        "esquerra repúblicana catalana catalan republican left erc is going it alone rather than in coalition with puigdemont . its leader , oriol junqueras , is in prison , having been detained as part of an investigation into rebellion , sedition and misuse of public funds stemming from october 's referendum and the catalan parliament 's subsequent vote to declare independence . this could give him a moral advantage over puigdemont , who skipped the country . partit dels socialistes de catalunya catalan socialist party the psc upset many party members by backing madrid over direct rule but in miquel iceta has a leader with strong appeal to anti-independence voters . ",
        "open to coalition but not with secessionists . partit popular de catalunya catalan people 's party catalan wing of spain 's ruling , conservative people 's party . vows to dismantle pro-independence institutions established over recent years and reform catalan public tv and radio . receives only about 8 % of vote but could play vital role in any anti-independence coalition . ciutadans citizens party centre-right , anti-independence party on course for about 25 % of vote under leader inés arrimadas . vows to heal the wounds of divided catalan society . wo n't form government with secessionists but could end up leading left-right coalition of pp , socialists and the leftwing catalonia in common . ",
        "catalunya en comú catalonia in common the catalan version of the anti-austerity podemos party . struggling to shake off accusations of being soft on independence and establish clear identity as left alternative under the likeable but professorial xavier domènech . may well end up as kingmaker . candidatura d'unitat popular popular unity candidacy the anti-capitalist cup , whose 10 seats gave together for yes a majority , regards the election as illegitimate because it was called by the spanish government but is standing nonetheless . refuses to countenance any road other than a unilateral declaration of independence . current polls suggest its vote is falling .
