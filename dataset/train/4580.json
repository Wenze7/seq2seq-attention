",
        "`` i really appreciate that , it 's mind-blowing really , amazing neighbours . `` then this morning a lady i do n't even know turned up and gave me $ 100 toward the treatment of my dog . it made me cry . and i do n't cry . `` that to me says paraparaumu , beautiful people , phenomenal . '' neighbour charlie maltby was outside having a cigarette when he heard the vehicle approaching at high speed . then he heard it lose control and crash . the car had spun around and hit pugh 's house backwards after taking out a stop sign and a fence , maltby said . ",
        "`` the driver tried to drive the car out of the house but i think the concrete at the base of the fence actually stopped the car moving . the tyres were squealing on the deck . `` the guy then jumped out of the car and ran down the street . i yelled after him and he yelled something back and carried on running . `` another car pulled up just after that and someone got out , looked at the car and then jumped back in and drove off after the guy , i think . '' it is the second time in just over a year that the house has been hit by a vehicle . ",
        "in august 2016 a car lost control , crashed into pugh 's parked 4wd and badly damaged the car port . he and his partner were home at the time . `` it 's the fourth time this has happened in about the last eight years . the second time my house has been hit . something needs to be done about it . the police said that to me as well . `` a bollard to stop cars crashing through the fence would make it a lot safer . '' a 29-year-old kāpiti man was charged with dangerous driving , driving while forbidden , and failing to remain at a crash , police said . ",
        "the car was removed on sunday morning and a friend of pugh 's , builder gary owen , is putting in temporary support for the roof because the car `` took out the lintel '' . `` in high wind with the lintel gone the roof will flex and could be quite dangerous , '' owen said . `` i 'm putting something in to stop it falling until brendon can get it properly fixed . '' no people in the house were injured .   "
