        "sacramento , calif. . -- a former conductor of the university of california , davis , symphony orchestra gave up his professor titles amid allegations he sexually assaulted a former student who now works at the university . d. kern holoman , who retired in 2013 , relinquished the titles of professor emeritus and distinguished professor monday after danny gray discussed the allegations with administrators and said he planned to write about them on his blog . the university also revealed that holoman was suspended for a month in 1997 over a different allegation of `` unprofessional conduct '' and told he could be fired if he violated the campus sexual harassment policy again . ",
        "gray alleged holoman sexually assaulted him when he was a freshman in 1987 , later raped him and made other romantic and sexual gestures over a period of years . he said his allegations were `` badly mishandled '' when he told the university about them as a student but that administrators are now supportive . holoman apologized but said he remembers their relationship differently . `` our memories of that time differ markedly , but the remorse is very real . i continue to treasure memories of our long friendship and its focus on the beauties of art , literature and history , '' he said in a statement sent to gray by his attorney , steven sabbadini . ",
        "the university of california system has a history of limited transparency and lax discipline in handling sexual misconduct claims . the president 's office told the associated press in march that a quarter of the more than 100 employees found to have violated sexual misconduct policies in a three-year window were faculty members . the governing board paid a uc santa cruz student $ 1.15 million after she accused the university of failing to address her rape claims against professor hector perla in 2015 . a letter in his file showed his conduct constituted sexual assault and he should be dismissed , but he resigned before disciplinary action was taken .

        "uc berkeley came under intense criticism after a former law school dean , sujit choudhry , received only a temporary pay cut and counseling orders after a 2015 investigation found he repeatedly kissed and touched a subordinate . in the uc davis case , gray said he told the university about holoman 's behavior twice while he was in school and was told by an administrator that holoman would not be made a dean in the future . gray again brought up his concerns after holoman became dean of the college of letters and science in march 1995 . holoman stepped down from the role in april 1996 . ",
        "he referenced the allegations again this year , when the school was considering bringing holoman back for a teaching position . it was not granted . gray , now director of academic employment and labor relations at the university , said the national me too movement of sharing stories about sexual misconduct inspired him to come forward . `` these courageous people who have started this have opened up a space where victims can see possibly , maybe , what happened to me is not something that i need to be so ashamed of , '' gray told ap . ",
        "holoman 's attorney said they were not commenting further . losing the titles means holoman can no longer teach or pursue research related to the university of california system . chancellor gary may sent a letter monday to the uc davis community outlining the university 's anti-harassment policies and resources for victims . `` i have no doubt our own uc davis community includes survivors and their abusers , '' may wrote . holoman possessed a celebrity status on campus , said gray , who played violin in the symphony . the two began having lunch together on campus , progressing into an invite for lunch at holoman 's home , where gray said the professor sexually assaulted him in a hot tub . ",
        "their friendship continued at various points , and holoman later raped him , gray said . `` i regret that i lacked the moral clarity and courage to end all engagement with holoman permanently once his predatory nature had revealed itself , '' holoman wrote on his blog . `` my failings aside , however , holoman was still the predator , and i was still the victim .
