        "controversial right-wing commentator milo yiannopoulos has weighed in on the net neutrality debate . yiannopoulos claims that george soros-funded organizations are telling lies to bring about government control of the internet . `` the soros-funded organizations that are pushing net neutrality and advocating for more government control of the internet have told you two big lies , '' yiannopoulos told an audience in a video posted on his facebook page . the first ` lie , ' according to yiannopoulos , is the idea that the internet should be regulated by the government rather than the free market . `` it is much better in my view to have customers and private companies negotiate their own relationship and the market decide what it can bear . '' ",
        "it was revealed in october that soros has donated $ 18 billion to his open society foundations over the past few years . the organisation has a budget of $ 940.7 million for 2017 ; $ 14 million of this is designated for information and digital rights . yiannopoulos dismissed the argument that net neutrality is about ensuring equality on the internet . `` that has never been the case . every service provider already shapes traffic , all of the stuff that net neutrality is designed to eradicate it never will , '' he said , suggesting that internet service providers will always send some data faster than others . ",
        "`` net neutrality is a cosmetic announcement on the one hand but really what it represents is a license for the fcc to wade in and interfere in the relationship between private people and their providers . '' the former breitbart journalist and self-proclaimed `` free speech champion '' contended that net neutrality is tantamount to government control and bad for the consumer . `` i want the government completely out of that relationship , just leave us to deal with the service providers and if they screw up we 'll sign up with someone else . '' the federal communications commission voted to repeal the obama-era net neutrality rules earlier this week amid protests and heavy criticism . ",
        "opponents of the decision say only internet service providers will benefit from the rollback . tech giants , including amazon , facebook and netflix , are among the most vocal critics of the decision to repeal the rules . the fcc said the rules would take effect once the white house office of management and budget approved the new transparency rules , which could take several months . meanwhile a number of us state attorney generals have already expressed their intention to file a lawsuit aimed at blocking the change . top democrat chuck schumer said friday that he intends to force a vote on a bill that would preserve existing rules . ",
        "a reversal of the fcc vote would need the approval of the house , the senate and president donald trump .   "
