        "spoiler : no . the ethereum world has been purring over the cutest use of the blockchain yet : cryptokitties ! the community has spent the past week buying , selling , and breeding a nearly infinite variety of cartoon cats . fur is flying over the heavy strain the application has put on the ethereum network and the increased fees that have come with it . rare cats have sold for incredible amounts -- the very first cryptokitty , genesis , sold for 250 ether . the frenzy has left a key question unanswered : who really owns your cryptokitties ? ",
        "what is a cryptokitty ? each cryptokitty is made up of two key pieces : text-based `` dna '' stored in an ethereum transaction , and graphic elements created by axiom zen , the company behind cryptokitties . each cryptokitty transaction is associated with an ethereum wallet , identified by a public key . the transaction contains the cryptokitty 's dna , which determines its `` cattributes '' . the cattributes define the graphic elements displayed for any given cryptokitty . cryptokitty dna looks something like this , or some other random-looking mix of characters : 000042d28314c7305c97b94300c0c31c44638c92c0b228ca6104217a52e4b56bowning cryptokittiesto buy a cryptokitty , you go to the cryptokitties website and browse the marketplace while logged in with your ethereum wallet . ",
        "when you find the cryptokitty of your dreams , you pay in ether and the blockchain entry containing the cryptokitty 's dna is transferred to you . when you view your cryptokitty on the website , the dna data from the blockchain is combined with the graphic elements to generate your pet . are cryptokitties like baseball cards ? axiom zen , the company behind cryptokitties , says in its faq that kitties are a `` cryptocollectable '' akin to baseball cards or fine art : cryptokitties are not a cryptocurrency . they 're more like a cryptocollectible . the real-world analogy for a cryptocurrency is dollars or pounds ; a cryptocollectible 's real world analogy is closer to assets like baseball cards or fine art . ",
        "as dictated by the smart contract , any cryptokitty you own belongs to you . like any product or property you can own , the market price is determined by demand , scarcity , and your asking price . so the faq says the cryptokitty belongs to you , but what does that really give you ? when you own a baseball card , fine art , or a book , you own the physical object . for the most part , that gives you the right to do what you want with the object . you can sell it or trade it , but maybe not dress it up for christmas . ",
        "owning the physical object does not give you ownership of the underlying copyright in the work . think of it like this : buying a harry potter book does not give you the right to make a bunch of copies . cryptokitties follows in the footsteps of the work we did with ascribe , which allowed artists to register their work on the bitcoin blockchain , create unique digital editions of that work , and transfer those works . in fact , a group at an ascribe hackathon created a collectable trading card game that was just a bit ahead of its time . ",
        "with ascribe , we recognized this distinction and worked hard to make sure that owning a digital object was as much like owning a physical object as possible . we did this by making sure the default terms of service created the same rights to digital property you 'd have with physical property . cryptokitties has gone a different route . recall that cryptokitties are made up of two pieces : the dna written to the blockchain , and the graphics assembled to represent each cryptokitty . axiom zen owns the graphics , and makes it clear you have no rights to those in their terms of use : a .

        "you acknowledge and agree that we own all legal right , title and interest in and to all elements of the app , and all intellectual property rights therein . the visual interfaces , graphics , design , systems , methods , information , computer code , software , services , `` look and feel '' , organization , compilation of the content , code , data , and all other elements of the app are owned by axiom zen , and are protected by copyright , trade dress , patent , and trademark laws , international conventions , other relevant intellectual property and proprietary rights , and applicable laws .

        "all axiom materials are the copyrighted property of axiom zen or its licensors , and all trademarks , service marks , and trade names contained in the axiom materials are proprietary to axiom zen or its licensors . except as expressly set forth herein , your use of the app does not grant you ownership of or any other rights with respect to any content , code , data , or other materials that you may access on or through the app . we reserve all rights in and to the axiom materials not expressly granted to you in the terms . ",
        "for the sake of clarity , you understand and agree : that your `` purchase '' of a cryptokitty , whether via the app or otherwise , does not give you any rights or licenses in or to the axiom materials other than those expressly contained in these terms ; and that you do not have the right to reproduce , distribute , or otherwise commercialize the axiom materials in any way without our prior written consent in each case , which consent we may withhold in our sole and absolute discretion . that 's a long block of legalese , so here 's a human readable summary in bullet points : axiom zen owns all the artwork for every cryptokitty . ",
        "owning a cryptokitty gives you no right to the artwork . you ca n't use the artwork in any way without their written permission . they do n't have to give you permission if they do n't want to . so far , that sounds a bit like a baseball card , but the digital nature of cryptokitties makes all the difference . are cryptokitties not at all like baseball cards ? what happens if the kitty site goes down or if axiom zen goes bankrupt ? the art disappears , and you have no right to it . your pretty kitty is now just an ugly string on the ethereum blockchain . ",
        "another scenario : what happens if axiom zen decides to re-do all the art in a style you hate ? sorry -- you have no rights to that old art . that 's the big difference with baseball cards . your barry bonds card is safe where you left it , in a shoebox in your parents ' house . the picture is n't going to fade away if topps goes out of business , and topps ca n't come into your parents ' house to replace it with my drawing of barry bonds . so what do i own ? ",
        "there is a bit of a contradiction here -- the faq says you own your cryptokitty , but what you really `` own '' is the string . as long as you control the keys associated with a set of kitty dna , you can hodl or transfer that dna . you can do what you want with those 256 characters . but that does n't feel a lot like owning a kitty , and a pseudo-random string probably is n't super-cute enough to get you paid . but i want to own my kitty ! axiom zen 's lawyers were doing them a favor when they drafted their terms of use . ",
        "they were dreaming of cryptokitty t-shirts , cryptokitty vinyl toys , and a multi-picture cryptokitty cinematic universe with a full lineup of cryptokitty brand activations . that 's how copyright law works in the old world -- you keep as much as possible in case it 's valuable someday . but in blockchain world , if axiom zen wants us to truly own our kitties , a bit of creative legal drafting could make it happen . contracts could change the default to make cryptokitties just like baseball cards . one easy fix would be to change the terms to grant you a limited license to use the specific arrangement of graphic elements defined by your kitty 's dna . ",
        "someday , the law will catch up and recognize the reality of digital property , whether that 's in-game collectibles or blockchain-based property that links to off-chain data . for now , if we want to truly own digital objects , we need a more careful combination of law and tech to make it happen . disclaimer : i think cryptokitties are fun . there is absolutely nothing to suggest that axiom zen has bad intentions or wants to mess with your kitties . from what i 've seen they 're good people and community-minded ... but they unquestionably are in control , and your ownership of your cryptokitties is not what you might expect . ",
        "thanks to : donald mcintyre , who first asked this question on twitter and gave some useful feedback on my draft . tim daubensch√ºtz , who pointed me to donald 's tweet and helped shape a lot of my thinking on digital property while working on ascribe and coala ip . the cryptokitties marketplace . prices are listed in ether . the genesis kitty . a sample of cryptokitties with the calicool trait . barry bonds is not a cryptokitty . my rebel leader clara is for sale . she 's one of the top scientists in the solar system !
