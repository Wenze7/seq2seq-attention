        "the united states sanctioned two north korean officials on tuesday over the development of ballistic missiles , as russia and america 's top diplomats held talks on pyongyang 's nuclear program . tensions have escalated after the isolated but nuclear-armed regime staged a series of atomic and intercontinental ballistic missile tests , most recently on november 28 . us president donald trump and north korean leader kim jong-un have also traded personal insults . `` treasury is targeting leaders of north korea 's ballistic missile programs , as part of our maximum pressure campaign to isolate the dprk and achieve a fully denuclearized korean peninsula , '' treasury secretary steven mnuchin said in a statement , referring to north korea by the abbreviation of its formal name . ",
        "the two officials were listed last friday in a new united nations security council resolution sanctioning north korea , it said . `` kim jong-sik reportedly is a key figure in north korea 's ballistic missile development , including efforts to switch from liquid to solid fuel , and ri pyong-chol is reported to be a key official involved in north korea 's intercontinental ballistic missile development , '' the treasury statement said . solid-fuel missiles can be fired on shorter notice , as they do not have to be filled with liquid fuel prior to launch . `` as a result of today 's actions , any property or interests in property of those designated by ofac within us jurisdiction are blocked , and transactions by us persons involving the designated person are generally prohibited , '' treasury said , referring to its office of foreign assets control . ",
        "the sanctions announcement came as russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and us secretary of state rex tillerson held talks by phone in which they discussed north korea 's nuclear program . new un sanctions `` the sides were united in the opinion that nuclear missile projects in north korea violate the demands of the un security council , '' the russian foreign ministry said after the call . lavrov `` once again highlighted that it is unacceptable to exacerbate tensions around the korean peninsula with washington 's aggressive rhetoric toward pyongyang and increasing military preparations in the region , '' it said . ",
        "trump habitually refers to kim as `` little rocket man '' and has threatened to utterly destroy his regime with `` fire and fury . '' north korea has branded trump a mentally disturbed `` dotard . '' `` it was underlined that it is necessary to move from the language of sanctions to the negotiating process as soon as possible , '' the statement said , adding that it was tillerson who initiated the call . on friday , the un security council unanimously passed new , us-drafted sanctions that will restrict oil supplies vital for north korea 's missile and nuclear programs . ",
        "the third raft of sanctions imposed on the north this year , sparked by last month 's icbm test , also received the backing of china -- the north 's sole major ally and economic lifeline . the sanctions also order the repatriation of north korean workers sent abroad to earn much-needed revenue for kim 's regime . north korea slammed the fresh un sanctions as an `` act of war . '' `` we fully reject the latest un sanctions ... as a violent breach of our republic 's sovereignty and an act of war that destroys the peace and stability of the korean peninsula and a wider region , '' pyongyang 's foreign ministry said in a statement carried by the state-run kcna news agency . ",
        "the latest launch of the hwasong-15 icbm , theoretically capable of hitting all major us cities , further heightened global alarm over the rapid advance in north korea 's weapons technology , which has made significant progress since kim took power in 2011 . date created : 2017-12-27 .   "
