        "goannas have overtaken foxes as the number one predator of the endangered loggerhead turtle at its second largest queensland nesting beach . a university of queensland study has found that since feral red foxes were controlled in the 1980s , there has been an increase in the number goanna raids on loggerhead turtle nests at wreck rock beach , south of agnes waters . uq school of biological sciences researchers phd student juan lei and dr david booth observed - with the assistance of turtle care queensland inc volunteers and camera traps - that the predators disturb up to 400 nests at the beach in one year . ",
        "`` we discovered that only large male yellow-spotted goannas dug open sea turtle nests , but once the nest was opened other lizards , such as lace monitors and smaller yellow-spotted goannas , raided them , '' dr booth said . `` we had expected most nests would be discovered within one or two days of being constructed because of the visual and scent cues left behind by the female turtle . `` but what we found was the likelihood of a turtle nest being opened by a goanna was n't related to the nest age or even the presence of ghost crabs , which disturb nests by burrowing and potentially releasing those smells that attract a goanna 's attention . ",
        "`` so we still do n't know the mechanism by which goannas discover and attack sea turtle nests that are several weeks into the incubation period . '' dr booth said studying the relationships between predators and prey , and the interactions between different predators that hunt the same prey , were important in ecological research . `` one predator species may provide the cue signalling the location of prey to the other predator species , particularly when food sources become sparse , '' he said . the study , supported by a nest to oceans turtle protection program grant , is published in austral ecology .
