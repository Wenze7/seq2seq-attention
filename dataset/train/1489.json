        "the atlanta falcons did two things last thursday night of note . in beating the new orleans saints at home , they moved back into playoff position . it did n't look good there , for a while . going into the 4th quarter down a touchdown , the atlanta falcons did something that has eluded them and haunted them for months now : they won the 4th quarter . in defeating the nfc south leading new orleans saints , atlanta pulled to within one game of the division lead , and also moved into a wild card spot . ",
        "the phrase `` must win game '' was n't mathematically true of last thursday 's match-up , that we know of , but it sure felt that way going into it . reality is that atlanta never makes the payoffs when they get swept by the saints . that ca n't happen , if they win their home tilt . they just did that . more from atl all day atlanta falcons : can run the table after sloppy win1 d ago atlanta falcons : how should fans react to quinn 's crowd noise admonition ? 4d ago atlanta falcons : short week and a massive game against new orleans4d ago atlanta falcons facing another must win game5d ago atlanta braves quietly setting up for revamped roster5d ago `` bad '' matt ryan showed up , and proceeded to throw three - count them 3 - ints and it looked like the team was done .

        "the defense , however , played like they have started to gel , and looked much more similar to last year 's version than they have all year . needless to say , if ryan continues to play like that , atlanta probably wo n't beat lowly and struggling tampa bay this weekend . his continued problems with throwing into coverage , and wrs dropping passes , that seem forced , but are technically there , will end this team 's season , eventually . but not that night . with a 20-17 victory , atlanta still could win the entire nfc south division . ",
        "in fact , if the falcons make the playoffs , it will be the first time in franchise history of making the playoffs in subsequent years . it would also buck history of super bowl losers returning to playoff action the following year . after tampa , atlanta gets the saints at their joint and carolina at home in the season finale . win all three , they can probably write a ticket for the playoffs , whether they win the division , or not . go 2 and 1 in those games , and they leave it to fate , and about 4 other teams . ",
        "they 'll need ryan to play better to win 3 . they 'll probably need him to play better to win 2 . the atlanta falcons did two things last thursday night of note . in beating the new orleans saints at home , they moved back into playoff position . it did n't look good there , for a while . going into the 4th quarter down a touchdown , the atlanta falcons did something that has eluded them an ...
