        "manchester - jose mourinho will allow any unhappy fringe player to leave manchester united in the january transfer window , which will spark speculation over the futures of the likes of henrikh mkhitaryan . mourinho adopted the same policy in the last winter transfer window when he agreed to requests from morgan schneiderlin and memphis depay to leave the club to pursue regular first-team football elsewhere . now mkhitaryan and teammates including former england full-back luke shaw and matteo darmian , who have been out of the first-team squad for long periods this season , would be allowed to leave should they wish -- and should satisfactory offers be made . ",
        "`` i think for the right price , '' said mourinho , when asked if he would listen to offers in such circumstances . `` that 's my approach as a manager , in cases where the club advises me . i think every player has a price . `` if a player is not happy , if a player brings with him the request with the number that we consider a good number for us -- like it happened for us last season with memphis and morgan -- i would never say no . `` the case of mkhitaryan has been curious after the armenian midfielder put in a strong second half to last season and appeared a key player in mourinho 's side . ",
        "but his form has progressively dipped this season and he has not started for mourinho since united 's defeat at chelsea at the start of november , finding it increasingly difficult to land a place even on the bench . - ` i did n't celebrate either ' - mkhitaryan , who arrived at united 18 months ago in a Â£ 26 million deal from borussia dortmund after a stellar bundesliga career , has seen his name linked with potential moves as a possible makeweight in any deals mourinho might wish to pull off next month . shaw has also struggled to convince mourinho of his long-term worth , although the 22-year-old has recently forced his way back into contention and started the midweek league win over bournemouth . ",
        "meanwhile , mourinho has responded to questions about why romelu lukaku appeared not to celebrate his winning goal in that victory over bournemouth . the belgian striker hardly responded after heading united into the lead , with what proved to be the only goal of the game . but in a week in which the behaviour of manchester city players was in the spotlight after they celebrated wildly at old trafford after their derby victory , mourinho insisted his response was simply an effort to remain on an even keel . `` i did n't celebrate either , '' said mourinho . ",
        "`` i do n't celebrate goals in a very enthusiastic way . if you score a goal in the last minute that gives you the victory then yes you lose your balance and you do n't control your emotion . `` after that goal there is a long time to go and anything can happen in football . i 'm not acting to the cameras or the fans .
