        "goal zero has taken to ces 2018 to announce the latest version of its yeti power station-branded portable generators and a sherpa-branded portable power bank family of devices . specifically , the company has made some significant improvements to its previous iteration of those devices in terms of both functionality and overall aesthetics . for those who may not already know , goal zero 's yeti power station lineup is marketed , as the name might imply , are intended for use in situations where power may be needed but not otherwise available . that makes them ideal for construction sites or for use as an automatic backup generator for power outages alongside the company 's home integration kit . ",
        "meanwhile , goal zero 's sherpa devices are aimed more directly for use with tablets and laptops . with regard to the new updates , there are two new yeti power stations -- the yeti 1400 and the yeti 3000 . if the model names used here continue to follow the company 's previous naming conventions , the yeti 1400 should store just over 1400 watt-hours of power , while the yeti 3000 stores just over 3000 watt-hours of power . the overall design of the power stations does n't appear to have changed much and goal zero has n't given any indication otherwise . ",
        "both are lithium-based power sources -- touted as cleaner alternatives to gas-burning generators -- and both retain the wide variety standard wall socket , usb , and other outputs found in their predecessors . the heavier yeti 3000 also features a metal frame with an extended handle and wheels for more comfortable portability . however , the updated versions will also feature built-in wi-fi at launch and bluetooth support will be added later with an update . those features are being added to provide users with a better way to connect a smartphone to the power supply via the goal zero app . ",
        "that connection will allow users to monitor and manage the generators , up to and including providing controls and monitors for the current power flow of each output . that 's also a feature that absent from most other similarly marketed devices -- even some of the most recent ones . as to the sherpa power banks , meanwhile , the next iteration appears to have gotten a serious slim-down over previous devices in the line-up , which should be great for those who want a power bank that goes well with their devices . to begin with , goal zero says that both feature built-in cables , which vary depending on the model chosen , which should make charging up devices and other electricity-hungry technology more convenient . ",
        "the sherpa 15 power bank features either a micro usb and lighting cable or a usb type-c and micro usb cable . the sherpa 40 , on the other hand , features one of each type of cable . that 's not the only place they differ , however . the sherpa 15 is intended for use with mobile and smaller devices with a rating of 3,800 mah , while the larger sherpa 40 is rated at 12,000 mah and is meant to charge larger devices . for pricing and availability , the new products will each launch in march of this year and will be purchasable through the company 's official store website -- accessible via the source link below . ",
        "the next-generation yeti 1400 and yeti 3000 will cost approximately $ 1,799.95 and $ 2,999.95 , respectively . meanwhile , the sherpa 15 will be available for just $ 49.95 and the sherpa 40 will cost $ 79.95 . the post goal zero unveils updated yeti & sherpa lineup -- ces 2018 appeared first on androidheadlines . com | .
