        "my husband and i have what we call brave little toaster syndrome . it 's our theory that the '80s disney movie that assigned feelings and personalities to inanimate objects officially scarred us for life . to this day , our 30-year-old selves will see a stuffed animal on the side of the highway and not only mourn the fact that it lost its human , but that we ca n't cross four lanes of moving traffic to rescue it . when we had our daughter claire , we had no idea how to choose a lovey that was a safe and comfortable choice for her , but we knew it was inevitable she would cling to something given her lineage . ",
        "still , we were n't sure : what was the best choice for her ? `` parents should consider items that are not just cute , but also comfy and comforting , '' dr. tiffany mckinnon-russell , founder of thoughts of a homeschool mom , tells romper in an email interview . `` a stuffed animal may seem cute to an adult , but could be frightening to a child . whenever possible , test out the item before you buy it to see how they respond . `` not sure exactly what constitutes as a lovey ? turns out , anything you want . ",
        "according to the baby sleep site , a lovey can be anything that 's safe for a child to have at bedtime , including a small stuffed animal , throw pillow , blanket , pacifier , board book , and even a hair extension . melanie potock , pediatric feeding expert and co-author of raising a healthy , happy eater , tells romper safety measures to keep in mind include making sure that `` stuffed animals , blankies or other lovies have no buttons , pom-poms or other small choking hazards that can come loose or be put in the mouth . ",
        "`` mckinnon-russell agrees , adding that the size of the item should be considered if your child will be sleeping with the item at night or during naps . `` you want to ensure that the child 's breathing will not be obstructed in any way during sleep , and no injuries will be sustained as a result of having difficulty carrying , holding , or lifting the item , '' she says . also important ? `` buy 3 of whatever you choose , '' potock says . `` one for the child to use , another for when that one gets dirty , and a third to keep when one gets lost . '' ",
        "take it from me : this point is important to keep in mind . i had no idea that when claire finally landed on the lovey of her choice , jellycat would screw me over and stop making it . where were you when i needed you , melanie ? i have scoured toy stores and ebay auctions to no avail , and have now simply resorted to praying kitty does n't lose his head because the threadbare material holding it atop his shoulders finally gives out . do n't be surprised , potock says , if you eventually need to reduce the size of a lovey so that your little one can have a piece of a favorite blanket or stuffed animal in their pocket when they eventually go to preschool or kindergarten . ",
        "`` for children who need extra comfort , a piece of the lovey can be sewn into one pocket of a few pairs of pants , '' she says . `` then , when he reaches in his pocket , he 'll feel the soft piece of fabric and know that everything is ok . `` of course , if you 're kid is like mine , then the lovey will be making outings and appearances long before the school years hit . kitty is a regular at the dinner table and even has a spot in our gym locker -- complete with provisions like a sippy cup and snacks -- when claire heads to swim class . ",
        "allison klein , owner of new york-based rose & rex , says choosing the right materials is also crucial when introducing your little one to a lovey . `` look for organic , natural materials instead of synthetic fabrics that may irritate baby 's skin , '' she tells romper in an email interview . i can tell you firsthand that choosing the right materials is also important because you are bound to be washing that lovey at least 88 times per month . klein recommends adorable loveys , like organic hazel village annicke mouse and wise old owl lovey , as options that will not only provide comfort , but `` a rich sensory experience . ",
        "`` you want baby to be able to touch , grasp and interact with his/her lovey so that they develop early motor skills , which is why choosing the right size can make a difference , '' klein says . `` what starts as a comfort object today will grow with your toddler into a friend for imaginative play adventures and much more . '' which is something that this brave little toaster mama will cherish no matter how many years go by . check out romper 's new video series , romper 's doula diaries : watch full episodes of romper 's doula diaries on facebook watch .
