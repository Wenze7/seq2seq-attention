        "thanks to new growth engines in exports and robust momentum in imports , china 's foreign trade hit more than $ 4 trillion last year , ending a two-year dip . the country 's overall trade volume jumped by 14.2 percent year-on-year to 27.79 trillion yuan in 2017 , ending two consecutive years of decline , the general administration of customs announced on friday . gac spokesman huang songping attributed the double-digit growth in trade volume to the global market 's recovery , domestic economic expansion , rising commodity prices , emerging markets related to the belt and road initiative and a low comparison basis . ",
        "outbound shipments from china rose by 10.8 percent year-on-year to reach 15.33 trillion yuan in 2017 , while imports surged by 18.7 percent to 12.46 trillion yuan . stimulated by domestic demand for manufacturing , food consumption and commodity investment , china imported 1.08 billion metric tons of iron ore from global markets in 2017 , up by 5 percent year-on-year , as well as 420 million tons of crude oil , an increase of 10.1 percent , and 95.54 million tons of soybeans , up by 13.9 percent . zhang yongjun , a researcher at the china center for international economic exchanges , said rising demand in overseas markets and trade in services and high-tech products will build a solid foundation to support china 's foreign trade in 2018 . ",
        "li guanghui , vice-president of the chinese academy of international trade and economic cooperation in beijing , said : `` china is no longer betting on low-end exports to drive up its economy . cultivating new growth points in technology upgrades , domestic consumption and investments in global destinations Ôºç these have all become practical elements for the country to boost foreign trade . '' however , potential trade growth faces pressure for the first quarter of this year , as surveys show falling confidence and fewer new orders in december , according to the gac . it will be difficult to keep double-digit trade growth this year , given the many global uncertainties and a high comparison base , said huang , the gac spokesman . ",
        "export and import growth slowed in december after surging the previous month , as the government extended a crackdown on corporate financial risks and factory pollution . huang also noted that global protectionism is still on the rise , with more trade remedy investigations into chinese products on the horizon . china 's trade surplus continued to narrow last year , shrinking by 14.2 percent to 2.87 trillion yuan , compared with a 9.1 percent reduction in 2016 , when the trade surplus was 3.35 trillion yuan . the european union , the united states and the association of southeast asian nations are china 's top three trading partners , according to the gac . ",
        "`` there are also threatening elements coming from the financial markets as certain developed economies tighten their monetary policies , '' said xue rongjiu , deputy director of the beijing-based china society for wto studies . `` though cutting overcapacity in certain sectors and optimizing companies ' resources in key industries are still important , the country must accelerate negotiations on trade facilitation agreements with more trade partners such as canada and israel , '' said xue . china 's foreign trade volume previously fell by 0.9 percent year-on-year to 24.33 trillion yuan in 2016 , and the figure was 24.59 trillion yuan in 2015 , a drop of 7 percent from 2014 .
