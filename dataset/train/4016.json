        "brrrrr . this morning was frigid cold out . bob walked in while i was typing my morning essay and slurping my coffee and said ` i want to get out today . all my work is caught up and i 'm kinda bored with staying in ' . `` bowling ! ?? ! '' , i screamed . umm -- we have n't bowled for maybe 5 or 7 years . where did that come from ? lolthere 's a small bowling alley inside the community center 5 minutes from our house . he said ` what 's with you and bowling ! ",
        "? '' , because i had mentioned about a month ago that for some reason i dreamt that we were bowling . wow -- you can tell how exciting my dreams are sometimes . so , he agreed bowling might be fun since its too damn cold to do much else . we both got dressed quickly . i wore my furry black russian hat because god forbid i try to do anything with my hair that i have n't cut for many weeks ! wayyyyy too much effort to spend any time on hair styling . i love hiding my ratty hair under a hat , putting on earrings ... and voilaaa -- im ready ! ",
        "bob threw on his black sweat pants that he got at kmart that he rarely wears -- only when its super duper cold like today . i made a cup of to-go coffee which i seem to always do , like osmosis , whenever i go out . usually i go out to write on locations , to the bookstore , library or wherever , and i always want my own special coffee with the splash of stevia and sugar free flavored syrups . i like the decadence of it so i made my to go cup and we both jumped in the car heading to the bowling alley . ",
        "it was an alley with about 6 lanes . small place but it had a nice cheerful bright vibe . happy music was playing in the background while we chose our balls and laced up our newfangled bowling shoes . i do n't recall bowling shoes having velcro straps but it was a nice comfy handy thing . i pulled the velcro and tightened the shoes . `` im readyyyy ! ! '' the electronic system was nifty too . no need for math skills to add the scores up . perfect for me ! we signed up for a great deal : all we can bowl in an hour for $ 10 bucks each . ",
        "! woohoo ! so $ 20 for two . not too shabby . at first i forgot how it all worked . oh yeah , you walk up to the line and throw the ball . okayyy . i ended up throwing maybe five strikes today , in between some really horrible throws that were coming out of left field . bob said : `` you are a wild inconsistent bowler ' . `` oh well . you are a consistent bowler but i still beat you one game ! '' we end up playing three games . bob won two . ",
        "in between turns i gulped some coffee and looked around at the one other lane where a grandma looked to be teaching her grand kids how to play . overall it was a mellow time . laid back . a good distraction . bob laughed at me when after i rolled my ball id shake my butt and do these flailing arm and butt movements trying to convince the ball to mooooooove over just a bittttttt ! ! you know it sort of works sometimes to move your bodyyyyy while the ball is rolling down the lane ! i laughed at bob on the way home when he said ` wow im sooo sore ! ",
        "! my legs and hamstrings really hurt ! that was really a workout . '' `` wow . we 're old farts . '' he said `` yeah we have jgo disease . just getting old ? ? '' loloverall a nice day out bowling . we might go bowling more often . it still beats sitting on the recliners like two lumps watching netflix . not a bad way to spend a few hours and a $ 20 bill .
