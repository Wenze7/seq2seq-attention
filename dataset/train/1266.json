        "credit : cc0 public domaina team of researchers affiliated with several institutions in the u. s. has found some key differences in brain chemicals between humans and other primates . in their paper published in proceedings of the national academy of sciences , the group suggests these differences could explain the social edge humans have over other primates . scientists have studied the anatomy of humans and other primates for many years as part of an effort to understand why we humans came to be so dominant . many assume that it is not just brain size , because prior research has shown that our early ancestors began engaging in advanced activities before our brains grew larger . ",
        "this , the researchers note , suggests that our ancestors developed different brain chemistry . brain chemicals play a role in such behaviors as socializing , which logically could lead to better language and other skills . to test this theory , the researchers studied brain chemistry in six species : humans , macaques , baboons , capuchins , chimpanzees and gorillas . samples for the non-humans were gathered from animals that had died naturally in zoos . the team studied nerve cells from the striatum , which serves as a relay for chemicals in the brain , looking for neurotransmitters , most specifically serotonin , dopamine and neuropeptide y -- they have all been tied to social and cooperative behavior . ",
        "doing so revealed brain levels of each when the animal was alive . the researchers found that humans and great apes had higher levels of neuropeptide y and serotonin in their basal ganglia than the other primates . they also found that humans had more dopamine in the striatum than the apes but less acetylcholine than chimps or gorillas . it is these differences , the group claims , that sets us apart from other primates . they suggest such differences would have made our ancestors more social , leading to a host of evolutionary changes . interestingly , a separate study was done recently by a team at kent state -- they were looking to explain the demographic success of humans and as part of that research found that female survivorship was a key component . ",
        "they suggested differences in female brain chemistry led to females mating more often with males who were more outgoing but who were not too aggressive . such males , they further suggest , would have been better providers because by that point in history , hunting was done in groups . abstractit has always been difficult to account for the evolution of certain human characters such as language , empathy , and altruism via individual reproductive success . however , the striatum , a subcortical region originally thought to be exclusively motor , is now known to contribute to social behaviors and `` personality styles '' that may link such complexities with natural selection . ",
        "we here report that the human striatum exhibits a unique neurochemical profile that differs dramatically from those of other primates . the human signature of elevated striatal dopamine , serotonin , and neuropeptide y , coupled with lowered acetylcholine , systematically favors externally driven behavior and greatly amplifies sensitivity to social cues that promote social conformity , empathy , and altruism . we propose that selection induced an initial form of this profile in early hominids , which increased their affiliative behavior , and that this shift either preceded or accompanied the adoption of bipedality and elimination of the sectorial canine . ",
        "we further hypothesize that these changes were critical for increased individual fitness and promoted the adoption of social monogamy , which progressively increased cooperation as well as a dependence on tradition-based cultural transmission . these eventually facilitated the acquisition of language by elevating the reproductive advantage afforded those most sensitive to social cues . 2 . richard s. meindl et al. . early hominids may have been weed species , proceedings of the national academy of sciences . doi : 10.1073 / pnas . 1719669115panid , gorillid , and hominid social structures appear to have diverged as dramatically as did their locomotor patterns as they emerged from a late miocene last common ancestor . ",
        "despite their elimination of the sectorial canine complex and adoption of bipedality with its attendant removal of their ready access to the arboreal canopy , australopithecus was able to easily invade novel habitats after florescence from its likely ancestral genus , ardipithecus sp. . other hominoids , unable to sustain sufficient population growth , began an inexorable decline , culminating in their restriction to modern refugia . success similar to that of earliest hominids also characterizes several species of macaques , often termed `` weed species . '' we here review their most salient demographic features and find that a key element is irregularly elevated female survival . ",
        "it is reasonable to conclude that a similar feature characterized early hominids , most likely made possible by the adoption of social monogamy . reduced female mortality is a more probable key to early hominid success than a reduction in birth space , which would have been physiologically more difficult .
