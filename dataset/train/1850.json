        "canada 's nafta negotiators are on a fact-finding mission this week in washington , seeking places where compromises might be found in the new year when the talks enter a critical , potentially do-or-die phase . officials from the three nafta countries began gathering monday at a downtown hotel for a week of meetings between formal rounds . canadian officials say they expect less-controversial chapters to get closer to completion . they do n't foresee formal offers , counter-offers , and text-tabling happening on some of the hardest issues . instead , one official said , the canadian team intends to try learning more about what the u. s. hopes to achieve as an end goal , on auto parts for instance , to see whether there might be constructive pathways for achieving it that all countries can live with . ",
        "`` we 're prepared to have conversations to better understand their priorities , '' the canadian official told the canadian press , speaking on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the talks . `` perhaps there are other solutions ... . we are always prepared to think creatively . '' trump says trudeau left out lumber , energy while talking trade numbers canada proposes ` groundbreaking ' nafta chapter on indigenous rights nafta 's potential end would hurt , but bmo says it 's a ` manageable risk ' several of the toughest issues have seen early impasses : they include auto parts , agriculture , and dispute-resolution mechanisms . ",
        "canada and mexico have described some u. s. proposals as non-starters , and have frustrated some u. s. officials by refusing to make counter-offers so far . one trade-watcher warns the clock is ticking . dan ujczo says several situations will soon push the nafta situation to a head , with president donald trump facing a decision , likely by march , on whether to take steps to withdraw the u. s. from continental trade agreement . those include the approaching mexican election and u. s. midterm primaries ; the conclusion of the easier , non-controversial nafta chapters ; a u. s. debate over whether to extend its so-called fast-track law ; and the end of the currently scheduled round of talks , all of which are happening around the same time . ",
        "` doing nothing is not an option ' the dickinson wright lawyer says trump will be tempted to make a big move around that time , before the u. s. midterm election season -- so he can say he kept his promise to either rip up or renegotiate nafta . that means , with the next formal round of talks scheduled for next month in montreal , canada and mexico will be under pressure to start counter-proposing soon , ujczo said . `` i think this is a clean-up-the-text round . clean up the text , and really tee up the issues for 2018 . ",
        "my biggest fear is we 're going to run out of clock in 2018 , '' he said in an interview . `` if it becomes clear after montreal that people are n't negotiating , that there 's not a negotiation happening on autos and agriculture , they 're going to say , ` what are you gon na do now , mr. president ? ' and then the reality is , even if he does n't want to act , he has to do some things by march ... `` if i was canada and mexico i would n't give him an excuse to issue a notice to withdraw ... you 've got to counter-propose on some of these issues . ",
        "and come up with creative solutions . doing nothing is not an option here . '' a trade deficit less than 3 per cent trump himself has cited the trade issue as a major reason he got elected . the president said so in a speech to a partisan rally last friday , where he revealed that he and prime minister justin trudeau have debated in private about whether the u. s. has a trade deficit with canada . trump insists it does . the most recent statistics from his own u. s. trade representative say it does n't . ",
        "the fact that this controversial yardstick for economic success is even the subject of a debate , especially given that the balance is so tiny compared to the u. s. trade deficit with other countries , especially china , does n't bode well , according to the former u. s. ambassador to canada . bruce heyman tweeted over the weekend : `` when our trade negotiations devolve into a public he said/he said situation or a disagreement over a deficit or surplus that amounts to less than three per cent of total trade we are at an ominous point . '' ",
        "auto proposal canada 's chief negotiator described the state of play in recent testimony to parliament . steve verheul said canada is capable of making constructive suggestions , but he called the auto proposal completely unworkable , and said his side is trying to figure out what the u. s. really wants from this negotiation . he said the other countries can offer solutions , if the u. s. wants solutions that benefit the region . `` we will not accept u. s. proposals that would fundamentally weaken the benefits of nafta for canada , and undermine the competitiveness of the north american market in regard to the rest of the world , '' verheul said . ",
        "`` that is one of the issues we 're struggling with : what does the u. s. need for a win ? because i think we can certainly bring a lot of creativity to the table in developing outcomes that could be characterized as a u. s. win , or as a north american win . ''   "
