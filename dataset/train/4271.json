        "a swiss effort to mandate kindness to lobster before they 're cooked could reach across the atlantic ocean to the east coast lobster industry , but a new brunswick company is n't worried yet . earlier this week , the swiss government banned boiling lobster live without stunning them first . it also stopped allowing the transport of live lobster packed in ice , instead insisting they be carried in something that reproduces their natural environment . the new regulations are part of switzerland 's program to make the treatment of animals more humane . `` my first reaction was to laugh about it a little bit , '' said nat richard , director of corporate affairs at westmorland fisheries in cap pelé , n. b. `` you almost wonder if it 's true or not . ",
        "`` according to richard , canada has very strict handling procedures . although the swiss said they do n't want lobster to feel pain before they 're cooked , richard is n't convinced the new regulations are any more humane than a quick dunk in boiling water , the traditional step in preparing the crustaceans as a meal . - ` it 's very troubling ' : n. b. lobster fishermen discouraged by lower wages , union says `` it is not a crueller method than , for example , decapitating the animal with a knife ... or electrocuting the animal in an electrified water bath . ",
        "`` but richard said it 's important to take the swiss changes seriously . `` i 'm not concerned it 'll become a major issue , but we need to be alert to it . '' he said switzerland is not a major market for his company , compared with france , germany , the united kingdom or spain . `` but still it 's something that we follow closely as an industry . '' even some people in switzerland were caught off guard by the changes . arnaud hyséni , who owns the geneva restaurant entre homard et côte , specializing in beef and lobster , thought the regulations were a joke . ",
        "`` for the first while we laughed , because we could n't believe it . '' he said he has called the swiss health authorities for clarification . he wants to know if he is expected to buy special equipment to either electrocute the lobster or knock them unconscious , which the government said provides a quicker death than boiling . hyséni also wonders how to import lobster without ice . he has n't received any answers . `` what will be the real problem with this is the transport . `` hyséni may have gotten a laugh out of the new rules , but the potential effect on prices is n't funny to him . ",
        "he sells whole lobster for 35 swiss francs , or about $ 45 can . with the new regulations , he 's worried he 'll have to charge more . `` we 're going to continue selling lobster because this is our concept ... it 's what people come for . `` richard is n't worried the swiss rules will spread across europe , complicating the industry 's ability to export lobster , or affecting other industries . `` i do n't think the french , for example , would forfeit their foie gras industry , '' he said . ",
        "the u. s is the largest importer of canadian lobster , and china is next . china bought $ 27.5 million worth of lobster in 2011 , but that grew to about $ 162.8 million in 2016 . richard said the atlantic lobster industry is a healthy one , and he 's not worried about swiss laws dampening the demand .
