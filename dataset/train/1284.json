        "the resident kopites in the transfer tavern are beginning to draw up a list of potential targets to replace coutinho this month . the coutinho saga has finally been concluded once and for all , as the brazilian completed his Â£ 146 million move to barcelona on monday . jurgen klopp will have been bitterly disappointed to lose one of his best players during the mid-season window whilst his side 's place in the top-four of the premier league hangs in the balance . however , it is vital that the club move on quickly and attempt to fill the void left by coutinho with the signing of a quality replacement this month . ",
        "according to the daily star , monaco 's french winger thomas lemar is prime a target for the reds , although they face stiff competition from arsenal for his signature . lemar caught the attention of europe 's heavyweights due to his sensational form for the french side during their champions league run last season . however , lemar has predominantly played as a left-winger for monaco since his move to the club from sm caen in 2015 , which suggests he is not a like for like replacement for coutinho . with that being said , liverpool would be wise to make a bid for ac milan 's attacking playmaker suso , who left merseyside for milan three years ago this month . ",
        "the little spaniard was predicted for greatness as a youngster at liverpool , but he was never really given an opportunity to prove his worth at the club . since leaving for milan , suso has become a star player for the rossoneri , as his record of 7 goals and 9 assists from 27 matches in all-competitions this season suggests . although suso is constantly improving , his development would be catalysed by playing alongside players of a higher standard than the current crop at ac milan , so klopp should bring him back to anfield and hand him the chance to fill the void left by coutinho .
