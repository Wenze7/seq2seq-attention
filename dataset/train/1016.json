        "the mission : entertain the baby . the solution : anything that works . the last episode was about bad habits babies develop . well this week 's episode was about entertaining them . and much like the habits they form , it 's all about doing whatever it takes . another way of putting that , is just giving in to their greater interest in your phone or keys then the slew of toys strewn about the house . it 's why i ultimately switched to a nokia 3310 . my previous phone being destroyed by drool and drops . ",
        "it really does n't matter that her grandmother keeps bringing over new toys , the very toys my wife played with , because my daughter just does n't care . i 've said it before , but here it is again . i want to be a good father . that means keeping my kid engaged , and trying different things . i answer her questions , and there are a lot . mainly it 's , `` da ? '' a shortened version of `` d√§r ? '' but she 's actively interested in the world around her and i do n't want to discourage that . ",
        "i only wish i did n't have to follow her around so much . that wo n't be a problem much longer as she starts daycare tomorrow . professional educators and an opportunity for me to focus on my interests mean i should approach her questions her probing of the world with renewed interests and enthusiasm . she 's keen on everything around her and i want to encourage and take part in that , but to do so i need to have the energy and interest . in the meantime , i 've returned to superhot . not that switching games has made me any less verbose . ",
        "as usual you can find this episode on twitch , youtube , stitcher , iheartradio and itunes . originally published at www . gregorypellechi . com .   "
