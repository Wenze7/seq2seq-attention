        "president donald trump repeated his contention that there was n't any collusion with russia , but he declined to say whether he would agree to a possible interview request from special counsel robert mueller , who is investigating russia meddling in last year 's election . `` there has been no collusion between the trump campaign and russians or trump and russians , '' trump said during a press conference wednesday at the white house . `` it has been determined there was no collusion . `` asked again about a possible mueller interview , trump said , `` i 'll speak with attorneys . '' ",
        "trump 's legal team is preparing for a potential interview with mueller and is in preliminary discussions with his office on the parameters , according to a person familiar with the matter . no administration officials have been questioned by mueller in about a month , the person said . mueller has been methodically collecting tens of thousands of documents from the white house and trump campaign and has interviewed some of the president 's closest aides as part of his investigation into russian meddling in the 2016 election . white house lawyer ty cobb has said he expects mueller 's investigation to be wrapped up early this year , though other people close to the probe say months of work remain . ",
        "an interview would bring its own set of risks for trump , particularly given his penchant for speaking off-the-cuff . mueller and his investigators could use any statements they consider misleading or false against him . mueller indicted former trump campaign chairman paul manafort and another campaign aide , rick gates , in october . former national security adviser michael flynn and a lower-level foreign policy adviser to the campaign have pleaded guilty to lying to mueller 's investigators and agreed to cooperate with the ongoing probe .
