        "the lunch and talks at the elysee palace are expected to take in syria and eu-turkey relations , but macron is also expected to voice concern over erdogan 's post-coup purges . the visit to france will be erdogan 's first since the botched july 2015 putsch and one of only a handful to europe since the attempted army takeover . in an interview with france 's lci television on thursday , he said he had got off to a `` very good start '' with france 's new leader . but in an interview with le point magazine in august , macron listed `` having to talk to erdogan every 10 days '' as one of the drawbacks of the job . ",
        "the invitation to the turkish strongman , who has presided over the arrest of tens of thousands of officials , academics , journalists and activists , has drawn criticism on the french left . the socialist mayor of paris , anne hidalgo , said she was `` concerned '' about the state of `` human rights and local democracy in turkey '' . the french presidency has however insisted on the need to `` maintain dialogue '' with ankara without `` covering up differences of views . '' macron and erdogan already met at a nato summit in brussels and at the un general assembly in new york in september , and held telephone talks leading to the release of two french journalists held in turkey . ",
        "macron has said he will also bring up the plight of jailed turkish reporters during friday 's talks . amnesty international , whose turkey head taner kilic has been jailed , said macron should `` strongly remind that human rights defenders are not terrorists . '' high on the agenda will also be turkey 's relations with the eu , which ankara has sought to join for the last 50 years in an epic membership saga that appeared to hit the buffers amid bitter rows in 2017 . ` essential partner ' the purges carried out by turkey in the wake of the coup bid have dealt the biggest blow yet to its ambition of joining the european union . ",
        "german chancellor angela merkel has been particularly condemnatory of the crackdown . but macron has stressed the need to avoid a breakdown in communications with a country he calls an `` essential partner '' on conflicts , including syria , where france is seeking to play a greater role . speaking to lci , erdogan who is trying to mediate in syria alongside russia and iran reiterated his position that president bashar al-assad should stand down . france has taken a similar line but has appeared to be less unbending on that condition of late . hosting erdogan forces macron , who has attempted to boost france 's standing on the european and world stages , to again walk a diplomatic tightrope . ",
        "he has already met russian president vladimir putin at the former royal palace of versailles near paris and took us president donald trump for dinner at the eiffel tower .   "
