        "blake bortles has continuously had to weather the harshness of national media , but has never lost the support of those who matter most . the jacksonville jaguars are playing against the new england patriots in the afc championship game on sunday . despite leading his team to the precipice of the promised land , it 's no secret that quarterback blake bortles has faced a sea of brutal criticism this season , even through the team 's current playoff run . bortles has been nothing but genuine and sincere in any and all press conferences in his time in jacksonville , but has still faced the brunt force of many unkind media voices within the league . ",
        "now bortles has certainly played with inconsistency at times with the jaguars , and has had sub-par performances no doubt , but there seem to be personal vendettas from national media members , and even fellow nfl players , waiting with bated breath to attack the fourth-year quarterback at the sight of even the slightest sign of struggle . but despite the heat bortles has constantly faced , and a telling sign of why the jaguars are still playing , is the unwavering support from the other 52 guys in the locker room this season . teammates have been in bortles ' corner all year long , and have vocally taken exception to any negative remarks about their quarterback . ",
        "bortles has been unfairly picked apart numerous times , and his comrades are not having it . that was clear even as recent as this week . after the win over the pittsburgh steelers , in which bortles was a key component , malik jackson sounded off on tennessee titans ' defensive end jurrell casey . right before the playoffs started , casey notably stated that bortles would `` choke '' in the postseason . jackson has n't taken kindly to that , and would like to know what casey thinks now , `` while you sit at home and watch us next week '' . ",
        "that is just one example of a season full of jaguars teammates coming to the aid of their offensive leader . bortles has never let outside talk be a hindrance to how he plays , and has always taken unflattering remarks in stride . but having the collective backing of the other guys within the locker room shows the close-knit bond between this team , and has been a driving force behind jacksonville 's ongoing success . through it all , blake bortles is one of just four quarterbacks left playing in the 2017 season . media can write whatever they choose , but a fact is a fact . ",
        "bortles ' supporting cast knew he could get the team this far , and have candidly expressed they have no doubt he can take them even further . and that 's the only chatter that matters . more from black and teal jacksonville jaguars must defeat the best to be the best1 h ago the jacksonville jaguars fit blueprint for beating new england patriots2h ago calais campbell awarded defensive player of the year by pro football writers of america1 d ago jacksonville jaguars get a retroactive ` a ' for their 2017 offseason from espn1 d ago jacksonville jaguars are nine-point underdogs to new england patriots in afc championship2d ago blake bortles has continuously had to weather the harshness of national media , but has never lost the support of those who matter most .
