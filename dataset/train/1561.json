        "diversified conglomerate , united technologies corporation utx is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on jan 24 . the company is likely to report higher revenues in the impending quarter owing to a favorable macroeconomic environment . whether this can translate to bottom line growth of the company remains to be seen . top-line growthrevenues of the company are largely affected by spending in the u. s. military and commercial aviation industries . an increase in demand for the company 's products in these industries is likely to favorably impact its financial performance in the quarter .

        "the zacks consensus estimate for revenues of fourth quarter of 2017 for united technologies is $ 15,400 million , significantly higher than reported revenues of $ 14,659 million in the prior-year quarter . revenues across otis , pratt & whitney and aerospace systems segments are expected to increase year over year to $ 3,112 million , $ 4,157 million and $ 3,858 million , respectively from $ 3,063 million , $ 3,992 million and $ 3,598 million . in september 2017 , united technologies announced its plans to acquire rockwell collins , an iowa-based avionics firm . post the acquisition , united technologies is expected to emerge as one of the world 's largest aircraft equipment manufacturers . ",
        "the acquisition , slated to be completed by the third quarter of 2018 , will provide a huge competitive advantage to the company and increase its bargaining power . the resultant operating synergies and lower operating costs will help it create complementary products that will help it serve evolving global customer needs . the merger is expected to be a huge boost to the company 's revenues and adjusted earnings per share after the first full year of combined operations with synergies to the tune of more than $ 500 million . although the transaction will not have any direct impact on the earnings in the quarter , it is likely to attract similar lucrative deals for the company that in turn could augment overall revenues in the quarter . ",
        "other key factorsthe strong aftermarket business that sells spare parts and offers related services to keep the primary products running is also likely to record a healthy growth momentum with uptick in the economy . furthermore , continued focus on four key priorities to fuel its growth momentum , namely flawless execution , innovation for growth , structural cost reduction and disciplined capital allocation is likely to translate to improved performance in the quarter . our proven model does not conclusively show that united technologies is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components .
