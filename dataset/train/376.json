        "i had an interview yesterday , and i am a little bit surprised by how i felt about it afterwards . i have been thinking about the experience a lot . i think this was because of the way he behaved was so representative of all the candidates that shared similar backgrounds and or where they are at in their respective careers : 30 + years of managerial experience , the top dogs in their companies , etc ... this man was about 50 years old . he has had a really successful career . he was made general manager before he was 30 , and continued to work for various multi-national companies at very senior positions . ",
        "he listened poorly . i felt everytime we asked a question , or opened up a topic , before we would finish the question , he would already come up with his own view of what the question was . it was almost like he has made up his mind way too soon every single time . it was almost like he concluded `` yea i know where you are going '' before we even started . his answers were convoluted , long winded , and hard to follow . he was explaining so much , as if he had to share all his perspectives ... or to cover all grounds , just in case . ",
        "he gave us this feeling , `` i have seen it all , so i am only looking for something truly meaningful . '' he would never tell us what he truly thinks and feels . `` it 's good luck , or bad luck . '' `` china was a promise and a disappointment . '' `` some says it 's a blessing , some says its a curse . '' i felt he did this because he wanted to appear considered and balanced . they all have these ridicolously watered down views of almost everything . i felt he had an almost desperate need to contain and include all perspectives ... maybe this is how he truly thinks and feels . ",
        "i also felt he was afraid to have , and or share his own point of views . yet he also categorised and judged . he was very opinionated . `` indians are better programmers . '' `` those young managers . '' `` i am here to change them . '' `` big corporations are always greedy . '' he also was the victim often . `` i could not do what i truly want to do , because busiensses are afterall businesses . i am not saying this was wrong , but i want to find a place where i could do what i want to do . '' ",
        "as a result , he appeared bitter , negative , preachy , stuck , scared and utterly boring . he is stubborn , he ca n't / does n't know how to debate and discuss . he is bored . he is afraid . he is lost . perhaps , this is what mid life crisis looks and feels like . i will work as hard as i could to not become that , and i have 10 years .
