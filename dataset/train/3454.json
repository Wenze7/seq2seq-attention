        "the moto e series is one of motorola 's more popular devices for the budget-inclined . the moto e4 , launched around june last year , carried this same focus on affordability while giving users pretty competent hardware . if motorola will adhere to its yearly upgrade cycle , we can expect the upcoming moto e5 around the middle of the year , and this new leaked image shows - among other things - a rear-placed fingerprint sensor . the moto e4 from last year was one of the cheaper devices you could get with a fingerprint sensor . this budget-friendly phone had a 5-inch hd screen powered by a mediatek quad-core processor , 2 gb ram and 16 gb internal storage . ",
        "it also had a physical home button up front which doubled as the fingerprint sensor as well . see the leaked image below . if this leaked image is at all true , then the moto e5 is set to come with a rear-placed fingerprint sensor - and it will be the first moto e to go with that design choice . it does n't appear to have an 18:9 display , but we 're hoping for at least a full hd screen and on-screen navigation buttons . we also hope that motorola will go with the snapdragon 400 series for the moto e rather than stay with its usual mediatek chipset . ",
        "the moto e4 is now available in stores for less than usd$ 100 , so we expect the moto e5 to be around usd$ 120 to usd$ 150 at launch . if we look at the clock widget on the leaked image , it has april 3 as the date . could this be the date of launch as well ?   "
