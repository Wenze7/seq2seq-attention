        "wolves have joined fellow championship club leeds in a race to sign aleksandar prijovic , according to reports from super express poland , the 27-year-old currently plays his football for greek side paok , where he 's managed to score 10 goals in 20 games for the club in all competitions for the greek side . indeed , goal cyprus had reported of leeds ' interest in the striker with a rather low release clause of £ 8.8 million in his current contract . but with the club not necessarily willing to pay that much for the player , wolves could look to cash in . ",
        "prijovic is full of confidence after scoring his first goal at international level for serbia , that sent his home country to the world cup . with previous experience in england from his time at derby county , he 'll be rather familiar with the english game . although , wolves are definite favorites to secure the striker from here on in , with the bigger wage budget to provide for the serbian , along with the fact that leeds have n't gone above the £ 4 million mark for a player in more than a decade . the verdictwolves should look to pass on this one . ",
        "after failing to produce in english football with loan-spells during his time at derby county last time out , it could yet turn out to be a flop in what would be an £ 8.8 million deal . in preparation for the likelihood of premier league football , it does n't look like prijovic will match up to this level with better options out there . a risky buy if they choose to do so , but could turn out to be magnificent . wolves fans ... . let us know your thoughts ! !! !
