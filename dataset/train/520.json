",
        "championing diversity is one of my passions , i do n't discriminate against anyone . i have chosen to delete them as they do not represent the message of harmony that i stand for . '' in the tweets ms khan said `` israel is an illegal state '' and `` israel = pharaoh . both are child murderers '' , according to the daily mail . a spokesperson for l'oreal paris told newsbeat : `` we have recently been made aware of a series of tweets posted in 2014 by amena khan , who was featured in a uk advertising campaign .
