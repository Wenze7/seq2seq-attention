        "every two years , elite american athletes come together to march through an olympic stadium wearing matching ensembles . while the actual garments change -- blazers and chinos to suffragette skirts and berets -- the common thread , quite literally , is red , white , and blue and a healthy dose of patriotism . ahead of the pyeongchang 2018 winter games in south korea , team usa revealed its ralph lauren opening ceremony looks . the get-ups are much as expected : a navy blue parka with red and white stripes , an intarsia-knit wool sweater of the same colors , and a navy wool ski hat . ",
        "but there are , of course , some distinguishing features that have sparked chatter : rhinestone-cowboy gloves , brown suede mountaineering boots with red laces , and slim cut jeans . to keep athletes warm while walking , the jackets also include wearable heat technology . when asked by yahoo lifestyle about the inspiration for this year 's looks , a spokesperson for ralph lauren said the brand is working to reimagine iconic american design references in an attempt to celebrate the american spirit . the 2018 opening ceremony looks have n't yet drawn the kind of ire that the sochi 2014 opening ceremony outfits did . ",
        "deadspin called the ralph lauren-designed patchwork knit cardigans with white sweatpants , `` knit patriotic barf . '' it 's the sixth time ralph lauren has outfitted team usa . as for those american design references , it 's not the first year that team usa olympic ensemble has pulled from western iconography . in 1984 , levi strauss designed tan-colored shearling jackets , tan gloves , and beige cowboy hats , a look just missing a pocket holster and stirrups to make it fit for an extra on butch cassidy and the sundance kid . still , this year 's fringed gloves are almost more lloyd christmas circa dumb and dumber than the treasure of the sierra madre . ",
        "while one writer for smithsonian magazine said , `` team usa has always had an eccentric taste in its uniforms , '' this year 's look is relatively subdued . per usual , the prices are less so : the ralph lauren team usa slim jeans cost $ 295 , the wool sweater $ 495 . the fringed gloves are n't yet for sale on the ralph lauren site , but you 'll be able to corral that piece of american history soon enough . follow us on instagram , facebook , and twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed , every day .
