        "in a study spanning two decades , a team of researchers led by colorado state university found declining numbers of soil fauna , nematodes and other animal species in the mcmurdo dry valleys , one of the world 's driest and coldest deserts . this discovery is attributed to climate change , which has triggered melting and thawing of ice in this desert since an uncharacteristically warm weather event in 2001 . there are no plants , birds or mammals in the mcmurdo dry valleys , located in the largest region of the antarctic continent . but microbes and microscopic soil invertebrates live in the harsh ecosystem , where the mean average temperature is below -15 degrees celsius , or 5 degrees fahrenheit . ",
        "the findings offer insight and an alarm bell on how ecosystems respond to climate change and to unusual climate events , scientists said . `` until 2001 , the region was not experiencing a warming trend , '' said walter andriuzzi , lead author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher in the department of biology and school of global environmental sustainability . `` on the contrary , it was getting colder , '' he continued . `` but in 2001 , the cooling trend stopped abruptly with an extremely warm weather event . since then , the average temperatures are either stable or are increasing slightly . ",
        "but most importantly , there have been more frequent intense weather events . `` the research team sampled soil invertebrates and measured soil properties , including water content , in three hydrological basins and at three different elevations in the region . in taylor valley , the field study was launched in 1993 ; in miers and garwood valleys , scientists started their work in 2011 . andriuzzi said what the team found in this long-term study can not be observed by looking at average or monthly temperatures . `` it 's a few hours , or days of unusually warm weather , '' he said . ",
        "`` there are even peaks of high solar radiation that trigger ice thawing without high temperatures . that 's how climate change is happening there , and it 's already starting to impact the biological community there . `` higher temperatures mean more melting and thawing of ice from glaciers and permafrost , which has led to the decline of the most common species , the nematode scottnema lindsayae . other species are becoming more abundant and are spreading uphill . as a result , at higher elevations , the microbes and animals in the soil are becoming more diverse , with unknown consequences for the ecosystem . ",
        "`` this is happening worldwide , and not just in antarctica , '' said andriuzzi , who is a researcher in the lab of university distinguished professor diana wall . in the rocky mountains , for instance , scientists have observed insects moving uphill on a year to year basis , due to warming temperatures . andriuzzi , who led field work in the mcmurdo dry valleys , called antarctic nematodes `` remarkable creatures . '' `` it 's amazing that they survive in these conditions , '' he said . the growing season only lasts a few weeks , but in the field , this microscopic animal may live 10 years . ",
        "given what the team found , andriuzzi said it will take time for the nematode community to recover from these disturbances . `` with climate change , some species are winners , some are losers , '' he said . `` in the dry valleys it 's all about how they respond to warming and , most importantly , water . `` andriuzzi said shifts in communities are often very hard to predict because there are so many species . `` it 's easier in places like the dry valleys to isolate the effects of climate change , or to isolate how one species responds to climate change in one way , '' he said . ",
        "`` it 's a natural laboratory , where some of the mechanisms that operate elsewhere can be unveiled . ''   "
