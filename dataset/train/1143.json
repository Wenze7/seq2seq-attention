        "out of context a sentence may not have the impact it had in context . still the sentence by elizabeth wurtzel took my breath away and makes me smile even out of context . there are -lrb- this is a common refrain , a clich√© -rrb- sentences you wish you 'd thought of , or written , and though i think i 'm too reticent to actually say or think this ... the reality is that , of course , it 's true . daily thoughts is my op-ed site . i do not/will not invite anyone to join me because i do n't know you ! ",
        "you are entitled to my opinion , of course you are , however that does not mean 1 -rsb- you have to read or hear it2 -rsb- you have to or need to agree3 -rsb- you care at all . i am not important in any popular sense of the word . long ago when people in the city i live replaced `` good morning '' with `` how are you ? '' i replaced reply of `` good morning '' with `` it does n't matter '' ... because it did n't . how i am is absolutely of no concern to anyone i do n't know intimately and even then maybe not . ",
        "how i am is transitory , at that moment i am annoyed , not permanent , momentarily . it is a question rendered meaningless by it 's casuality . my opinions are too . her sentence is one i 'd like to have written with the same impact , that her 's in context had on me . if you agree , what you are agreeing with is ... i have n't succeeded . just my opinion , though .
