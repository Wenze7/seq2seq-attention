        "throughout my time learning from the ever-amazing professor david harris , i have learned a great deal about the three topics mentioned above . society , for one , is what really gets me . as a sociology major i spend 99.99 % of my life thinking about why society works the way it does and how that results in different outcomes . as an avid technology user i spend 99.99 % of my life either using technology or unavoidably being distracted by it . finally , as somewhat of a self proclaimed activist , i spend 99.99 % of my time thinking about how to fix some of the major injustices in our world . ",
        "so basically , this course that focused on social media and social movements encompassed my life . now , lets bring it back to one of the most interesting units we discussed in class : politics , technology , and racists . yeah , thats right . in my late october article , `` politics , tech , the left , the right , and everybody in between , '' i focused on a documentary feature by vice that followed people attending the charlottesville rally and protest in `` charlottesville : race and terror . '' `` charlottesville : race and terror , '' by vice is a documentary style film that follows the events that unfolded at a white-supremacist rally and counter protests in charlottesville , va. . ",
        "what i found most compelling about this unit was how before i was presented with this video and course material in class i had already seen most of the film via a facebook friend sharing it . although it was painful to watch , i sat through the full twenty-two-minute film , which included witnessing a horrific crime and listening to a white-supremacist share his ideas of beliefs . when i originally saw this film i could n't help but compare the internet virality of it to that of the bernie sanders campaign that was mentioned by issenberg in `` the meticulously engineered grassroots network behind the bernie sanders revolution . '' ",
        "what drew me to this was how this course 's primary focus was on how social movements are affected by social media - and both of these cases were prime examples . by incorporating the medium of film and easily sharable media websites in the vice documentary , and instant messaging , texting , and virtual communities in the sanders campaign , it really reflects how strong of a role that social media really plays into how quickly information is spread and how quickly movements are created . also , i think its important to mention how we also discussed empathy and social media , like in the global lives project . ",
        "the global lives project features video clips of various people from around the world in a goal to expose others to differences in cultures and people , is a program that could most definitely be useful in helping to bridge the gap of understanding empathy . so , do what you want with that information . another way that this course has exposed to me how social media has influenced activism is reflected in tania bruguera 's work , featured at the yerba buena center for arts in september , 2017 . when i first saw bruguera 's work and heard her story i was moved , but it was n't until i was really able to see her art installations in person that i truly understood what she was doing . ",
        "bruguera is a cuban artist who used her art as a medium to express her passion for immigration rights , freedom of expression , and reflected on both political and social issues . one of the installations that i was able to see in person was a a video and the other was a polling system where people could say whether or not they believed in a world without boarders . both of these works of bruguera were made possible by technology , and both were made known by social media . i was able to find information on both of her featured works before seeing them in person at the ybca on various websites and social media accounts , which goes to show how easy it is for information to make its way into anybodies hands via the internet . ",
        "honestly , if i could recommend this course to everybody - i would . i cant stress enough how important it is to be able to think about technology , social issues , and social movements from an empathetic and sociological perspective , because it really is cutting edge stuff . ever since the creation and boom of the internet , social media and social movements have and will continue to be ever-changing and unpredictable , so having the ability to study it has been a truly unique and valuable experience . all i can say is , if you want to make a movement : utilize technology .
