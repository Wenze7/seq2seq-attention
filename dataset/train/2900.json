        "a wide range of animal-free festive foods means christmas dinner is a treat for everyonerebecca nicholsonto non-vegans , the idea of a plant-based christmas dinner may smack of scrooge crouched over a miserly candle , sucking on a single slice of tofu . there are few holidays more dedicated to tearing up the five-a-day-guidelines than this one , so if you take away not only the meat but the cream , then what 's left ? actually , this year there 's a lot left , as supermarkets are increasingly wise to the idea that plenty of vegans want to stuff their faces , too . ",
        "with estimates that between 2 and 12 % of british people now follow a vegetarian diet , it 's unsurprising that a vegetarian christmas is well catered for by shops , but the rise of the `` flexitarian '' means that even non-vegans may buy and try vegan now , if it 's an option . it takes a bit of supermarket-hopping and a familiarity with an online checkout to do it , but with a little effort , there 's now a gluttonous array of choice . the majority of a traditional roast is vegan anywaychristmas dinner is a roast with bits added on , and the majority of a roast is vegan anyway . ",
        "there are a few tweaks that may need to be made -- use oil to roast the potatoes instead of fat ; swap butter for olive oil in the mash , and leave honey off the parsnips and carrots . when it comes to the star of the show , the amount of effort you 're willing to put in will dictate your centrepiece . the ever-reliable linda mccartney range 's new `` roast beef '' joint comes with a boozy-tasting red wine glaze and a remarkably beef-like flavour , which is great for vegans who like the taste of meat but not the methods , though it may be too meaty for some . ",
        "mmmm : ` mheat ' vegan roast from sgaia . fry 's soy and quinoa country roast is a solid herby veggie roast , while tofurky 's turkey and stuffing is a respectable substitute for the real thing . at the more artisan end of the faux butchers -- there 's an emerging meat-substitute industry that reminds me of the craft brewery explosion -- then irish company moodley manor offers top-end luxury in its mammoth meat-free roast , with a sausage and breadcrumb stuffing inside that tastes like the real deal , while scotland 's sgaia meats is serving up a new and limited version of their signature `` mheat '' vegan roast wrapped in maple-glazed rashers and filled with orange , hazelnut and pancetta stuffing . ",
        "if you 're a no-meat-substitutes kind of vegan , the hardy nut roast is a perennial stand-in and most major supermarkets have a vegetable-based centrepiece , if you do n't fancy making your own . ocado has a stuffed butternut squash made by irish company dee 's , while tesco is pushing the boat out with cauliflower wellington . but the real joy of christmas is in the trimmings , otherwise it would just be an ordinary sunday . you can make bread sauce with a non-dairy milk , though most are likely to be too sweet -- unsweetened almond milk is a good bet . ",
        "for pig-free pigs in blankets , pick a fakon and a brand of vegan mini sausage , and make up your own . ocado stocks dee 's vegan sausage stuffing ; while on the sauce front , most cranberry sauces will be vegan , and for the fancier meat-avoider in your life , there 's also tideford organic vegan gravy with red miso . it 's surprisingly easy to avoid a fruit platter at dessert time , too . asda 's own-brand mince pies are vegan , as are waitrose essential mince pies , and today dairy-free ice creams are available in most supermarkets . ",
        "or , if you 're the kind of person who pours cold bailey 's on a steaming mince pie , then there 's even a vegan version of that -- slosh on the gluggable baileys almande , available in whole foods , while sipping m&s 's gold crème brûlée liqueur . white magic : dairy-free baileys . for the determined and brave , if not foolhardy , it 's even possible to cook up a vegan cheese platter . violife and vbites offer a variety of `` cheeses '' , though for this particular customer they 're a substitute too far . ",
        "if you 're really determined , i 'd go for a simple homemade cashew cheese using online recipes , which makes a good soft cheese for crackers . you can whip up an easy mushroom pâté at home , or ocado does a vbites duck pâté if you 're more effort-free . so whether you 're the sole vegan at a meat feast or serving up a meat-free dinner for non-subscribers , step away from the stuffed red pepper : at last , food producers , from independent businesses to big supermarket chains , have made it possible for everyone to pig out this christmas .
