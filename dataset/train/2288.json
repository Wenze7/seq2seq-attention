        "i used to want to be a doctor . i wanted to help people and make them better . now a video game can assist doctors with that very thing . without going through 12 plus years of schooling , crying , and all nighters . there currently are vr programs that are able to help people with a variety of diseases or ailments and it blows my mind . there are now opportunities that have been opened up because of virtual reality . for one instance , surgeons can use a vr camera to record a surgery and people around the world can watch with a headset . ",
        "this gives students a chance to watch a surgery and learn how to do operations . there are only so many spots available for a student to shadow an actual surgery . but with a video recording , hundreds of people can watch the surgery and learn the techniques . another way that virtual reality is helping the medical community is providing therapy for stroke patients to help speed up their recovery and motor movements . this is able to happen because there is a program called mindmotionpro that allows patients to pretend or practice lifting their arms and move their digits . ",
        "they do not actually carry out the movement , instead the program helps them to enhance the attention and engagement . it is suppose to make the repetitive recovery movements more fun and to help the nervous system recover faster because the patient is not just laying in bed doing nothing . vr can help relax patients with chronic illnesses . for some patients the four walls that they are enclosed in just add to the pain and stress . vr googles can help patients leave the room by taking them on adventures through the ocean or safari or where ever they want . ",
        "being able to relax this way can help patients with their stress . i personally know that stress affects my body and how it functions , particularly my blood sugars . not that i go to the hospital all the time for long periods of times , but the longest i was there was five days and i was bored out of my mind . i was too weak to walk around for a while so i just laid in my bed waiting for breakfast , lunch , and dinner . just one use of vr goggles like this would have improved my mood immensely . ",
        "giving younger doctors an exerience of an elderly man to create more emphathy and undrstanding is available through vr . the program for this is called `` we are alfred '' and it allows people to hypothetically be an elderly man wiht video and audio impairments . the goal for this is to close the disconnection between the younger doctors and older patients . this is believed to be able to happen when the physicians can see things through the patients ' eyes . all of these programs and opportunities that vr has opened are crazy advanced and 3 years ago they were not available . ",
        "they are making life easier and more fun and i am here for it .   "
