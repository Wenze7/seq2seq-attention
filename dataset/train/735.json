        "sanaa , yemen -- foreign humanitarian workers with the united nations and other international organizations have left yemen 's red sea port city of hodeida because of intensified fighting there , yemeni officials said on friday . their departure came as yemen 's shite rebels , known as houthis , stepped up fighting with forces loyal to the internationally recognized government of president abed rabbo mansour hadi along the red sea coast of hodeida and western yemen . local employees with the u. n. and other organizations are now doing the humanitarian work in rebel-held hodeida , a lifeline for most of yemen 's population , said the officials . ",
        "hadi 's forces , backed by a saudi-led coalition , have made military advances over the past week , capturing several rebel-held areas , including the coastal district of al-khoukha , about 135 kilometers from hodeida . the houthis , however , claimed their forces were able to regain control of some areas captured by hadi , allegedly killing more than 120 of their enemies over the past three days . fighting has escalated between the houthis and hadi 's forces after the killing of yemen 's ex-president , ali abdullah saleh , earlier this month at the hands of his onetime allies , the shiite rebels . ",
        "saleh 's slaying followed his announcement that he was willing to turn a new page with the saudi-led coalition , a move the rebels saw as betrayal . on friday , tribal officials said hadi 's forces seized several rebel-held areas in the southern province of shabwa , including the district of bayhan which has been under houthi control since 2015 . the fighting killed at least 54 on both sides , the tribal officials added . in the southwestern province of taiz , suspected saudi-led coalition airstrikes killed at least eight civilians and wounded 15 others , officials also said . ",
        "all the officials and tribal elders spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to reporters . the coalition has been fighting to defeat the iran-backed rebels since march 2015 and to reinstate hadi 's government . since the beginning of the conflict , it imposed an air and sea blockade on the impoverished country , allowing only occasional humanitarian access . the blockade has been criticized by international groups , which say it is deepening the humanitarian suffering of yemenis . the civil war has caused profound misery among yemen 's 28 million people . ",
        "more than 10,000 civilians have been killed in fighting and airstrikes ; food-supply and medical infrastructure has collapsed , causing a humanitarian emergency of hunger and cholera .   "
