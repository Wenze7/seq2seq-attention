        "designing a service canvas book or the unexpected creation of a new toolteam : andrea desiato , cristina paleari and alberto sarullo , design group italia `` ok , let 's add this new section in the service canvas poster . '' `` uhm , i 'm afraid there 's no more space . '' `` so , we need to go a little deeper on this topic . '' `` i can add a line or two , but then we wo n't have any space left . '' `` not even a bit ? '' `` nope ... '' -- how can we communicate the complexity of this project then ? ",
        "during the early design phase of our latest project for an insurance company we were struggling with the growing complexity of the services we were designing . we were , indeed , designing a network of five health-related micro services , each independent , each independent , yet connected and part of one bigger whole . the aim of these services was to become part of a mobile application , a web portal and possibly other touchpoints . as the project took shape many issues came up . we started to ask ourselves how to address them . -- when we started the project , we did n't know that we would eventually come up with a new tool , a tool we could use to design many other services , too . ",
        "but enough with the flashbacks -- let us start from the beginning . 1 . service canvas book as we see itso we are speaking about a weird thing we call ` service canvas book ' or , among friends , ' scb ' , but what is it exactly ? the sbc is a combination of different things . like a recipe to a cake , scb has many ingredients : - 1/3 strategic design , as we were helping the company to give shape to their ideas , clear up their mind and structure a strategy for their new services . ",
        "- 1/3 of user experience design , because we translated the services into a mobile application , and designed all the user flows as well . and , last but not least , - 1/3 of data journeys , as we designed all the data flows , to structure the information architecture . 2 . why did we need a tool ? to refer back to the beginning , we did n't design the scb just because of lack of space on the original service canvas poster , of course , but this was certainly a starting point . in the early stage of the process we used a basic tool that we called service canvas , a single-sided-poster split into different areas , one for each part of the service . ",
        "this service canvas worked well as a synthesis for all the different parts of the service , but provided just an overview of them , with no possibilities to go deeper in analysis . that 's why , when the design process was becoming more and more complex , we realized that we needed to think about a tool specifically designed for our purposes . one tool to rule them all : we knew that keeping every section in a single space was a key requirement for our new tool , as it would bring value both to ourselves and the people that we wanted to share the tool with . ",
        "speaking of our needs : a single document would allow us to control each and every section . having one section next to each other would also help us work on the different part of the service simultaneously , making it much easier to go through sections and navigate them back and forth . operationally speaking , as we had to use the tool five times , we wanted a single document to quickly update according to changes , feedback received and so on . to assure the document was always updated to the latest version , we were controlling versioning while keeping track of every release as well . ",
        "most importantly , we realized that having one , simple-to-understand and exhaustive tool would make it easier to share the project . one tool to bring them all : we did n't have to share the project just with the client , though . our goal was to communicate the services to a number of other stakeholders as well . as you know , our client was an insurance company and we were working for them to develop a series of services . what you do n't know is that we were speaking with different departments within the corporation , whilst also speaking with start-ups and other companies to select them as partners , while working together with another design studio and a consultancy agency . ",
        "the situation was a bit crowded , in other words . so , our biggest challenge was to share our research , analysis and project with all of these stakeholders , using language and visual contents that they all could understand . 3 . how the sbc is made ? and finally , let 's come to how the service canvas book is made . the whole book revolves around a service model section which contains the map of the analysed service . in addition to this , the book is made of ten sections in which we analyse the following aspects : project brief , stakeholders , team , partners , tasks , touchpoint , opportunities/constraints/risky points and data journey . ",
        "the stakeholder section was intended to map the complex and crowded nature of the project . since the people involved were many , both from the project and the service side , we wanted to clarify tasks and responsibilities distributed among the different companies . we also categorised and listed the client 's internal stakeholders and final users . in the partner-section , we map the companies to collaborate with . we tell about the service through a service map which explains how the whole system should work . we made two versions of it , as we expect two different releases of the app . ",
        "the touchpoint-section contains flows and wireframes that we designed . these translate the service into an app . we worked on the ux of the app , while another studio took care of the ui . we designed this section to communicate every detail of the app with them . lastly , data journey-section was built to guide the it team to understand data sources , storage and messages between entities . in conclusion , as we were finishing up the project and talking to co-workers about the project and the tool that we were using , we realized that there was interest around the topic . ",
        "so we decided to tell the story . -- the service canvas book may need some updates and fixes but it is a tool that we will for sure use again , maybe adapting the format to meet the needs of other projects . we are thinking about an upgrade to digital as well . we have worked hard on this challenge and we are proud of the scb . the next step is to share it internally with the whole studio , and use it as a communication tool to speak about our service design skills . sbc recipeservice canvas poster was n't enoughus , in the war room , working hard , looking for space . ",
        "but having fun .   "
