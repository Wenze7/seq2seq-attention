        "melbourne - australia 's nick kyrgios won an electric four-setter with his idol jo-wilfried tsonga to advance to the round of 16 at the australian open on friday . kyrgios , seeded 17 , needed three tiebreakers to win a crunch match with the former finalist 7-6 , 4-6 , 7-6 , 7-6 in 3 hr 17 min in a spectacular night match on rod laver arena . it pitches the mercurial australian into a round of 16 showdown with bulgaria 's world no. 3 grigor dimitrov on sunday . kyrgios , urged on by his home crowd , traded breathtaking shots with tsonga , who lost to novak djokovic in the 2008 australian final when kyrgios was a doting 12-year-old fan . ",
        "`` it was amazing . i 've never won a match on this court before but playing jo i was obviously very nervous , '' kyrgios said on court . `` he was a guy i looked up to as a kid , still do , he 's a great guy . i 'm just so happy to get through . `` at 5-2 down in the fourth set breaker , i was getting ready for a fifth set mentally . i somehow just hung in and got a couple looks . `` i knew my best chance was probably to get in a couple tiebreakers . ",
        "`` he served extremely well throughout the whole match . i did n't really get a look at many second serves at all . `` tsonga praised kyrgios , saying he had the game to do some damage . `` he has got it . yeah , we will see how it goes for him . but anyway , he 's already a good player , '' tsonga said . `` i think he still needs time to improve . with his game already , he can do some damage . the most important in tennis i think is to believe in it . ",
        "`` the match had some drama just after the third set when an incensed tsonga yelled at the chair umpire in french about a vociferous member of the crowd . tsonga was heard to say `` bring him here , he needs to come down here '' . he said it three times before the umpire warned the french star , telling him : `` you have to stop , you have to stop . nothing good can come from it . you have to stop . `` tsonga was then issued with a code violation for unsportsmanlike conduct . ",
        "tsonga explained later : `` the guy was telling me , ` you are under pressure now , you are under pressure now , ' when i was bouncing my ball . that 's it . i lost it and i went a little bit crazy . `` kyrgios won his first home atp tour title at the lead-up brisbane international -- beating dimitrov along the way -- and is looking to go further than a quarter-final appearance in melbourne three years ago .
