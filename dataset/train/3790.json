        "`` we imagine a group of generals of the byzantine army camped outside an enemy city , each division commanded by its own general . these generals can communicate with one another only by messenger . after observing the enemy , they must decide upon a common plan of action . however , some of the generals may be traitors , trying to prevent the loyal generals from reaching agreement . the generals must have an algorithm that : a. all loyal generals agree on the same plan of action . b . a small number of traitors can not cause the loyal generals to adopt a bad plan . '' ",
        "the byzantine generals problem , originally published in 1982 , is a longstanding problem in computer science . at its most basic , it asks how to create a system of trust between unrelated parties over an untrusted network . blockchain in general , and cryptocurrencies in particular , are solutions to this exact problem . the practical consequences of solving this problem are hard to overemphasise . it gives us a way of transferring unique pieces of digital property to each other in a system which gains its legitimacy by enabling everyone to see that the transfer has taken place . ",
        "the digital property that can be transferred include smart contracts , digital ownership , bonded identity services and , of course , digital money . all these can be transferred through a distributed network that no longer relies on a centralised bank or broker , without compromising the legitimacy of ownership or the validity of the transaction . cryptocurrency : the security landscape2017 was the year that cryptocurrencies became a new asset class ; shifting from easily disregarded to hard to ignore . a strong diversification in the spectrum of investors has fuelled the market . the increasing number of crypto products and services that have emerged also signal a market that is starting to mature . ",
        "while cryptocurrencies are in their infancy , they have been understandably volatile . however the fundamental characteristics that underpin it : the technology , the decentralised network , and the cryptographic code present an underlying value which would be unwise to overlook . one of the more important long - term challenges crypto assets of all kinds must face is security . as the market has developed , so has the number of hacks and the amount of fraud ; cyber attacks occasionally bring down exchanges and wallets . cyber attacks have included anything from attacking an entire digital exchange , to individual software wallets . ",
        "in this environment , security is not a feature , it 's the cornerstone of its future success . one key point of attack is the `` end point '' , where the private keys of individual investors could be stolen . every cryptocurrency holder has a private key that authenticates their identity and allows them to exchange units . without the key , the holder ca n't spend or convert their currency . while this is a critical security feature that reduces theft and unauthorised use , losing a private key is the digital equivalent of losing real cash and hackers are increasingly seeking to steal private keys stored online . ",
        "we believe that offline , or `` cold '' , storage for private keys is emerging as the most secure solution . introducing ledgerledger , a paris-based company that was founded by a team of crypto and smart card experts , solves this exact problem . ledger 's products provide their customers with crypto assets with unprecedented security , by securing user 's private keys . the company have developed two main hardware products : the ledger nano s and the ledger blue , both of which enable users to store their keys offline . they will also launch a new product : the ledger vault , enabling hedge funds , banks and family offices to manage their crypto assets , due to high demand . ",
        "all these products are underpinned by a unique technology : an operating system specifically designed to run on any secure hardware and to support any crypto asset . by building a cold storage solution , the company offers users the safest solution , enabling crypto owners to keep full ownership of their digital assets , without the need for third party intervention . the hardware wallets isolate the private keys from computers or smartphones , which are easily hackable . building a global syndicate for a truly global companywe are excited to announce today that draper esprit is leading a $ 75 million series b round in ledger . ",
        "pascal , eric , nicolas and the wider team have shown truly exceptional growth over the last year to meet unprecedented demand , having sold over 1 million hardware wallets from across 165 countries . the team , now over 80 employees across france and the us , have managed to recruit some of the best engineering talent from organisations such as gemalto and french smart card experts , such as oberthur technologies . simon cook , ceo of draper esprit , will join their board to support the ledger team as they scale rapidly . since the 1990s , france has been a global leader in smartcard technology . ",
        "ledger continues this long history of french technical excellence and join a host of european deeptech companies we have long been investing in , including movidius , cambridge silicon radio , icera , displaylink , ncipher , and more recently , graphcore . cryptoassets are , by definition , a global asset class . it is for this reason that we are delighted that we are leading an international group of top tier investors . our very own draper network have participated , bringing in funds , network and skills from china to the us . tim draper , one of the largest owners of bitcoin and an early investor in skype , baidu and tesla , lead the deal from their side . ",
        "we are also glad that top funds firstmark capital , cathay capital and korelya capital have joined the round . we look forward to partnering with ledger as they accelerate on their mission to secure all crypto assets globally . eleonore butler , lead investor on the dealsimon cook , board member of ledgerledger products include the ledger nano s and the ledger blue , hardware storage solutions for cryptoassets . from left to right : pascal gauthier and eric larcheveque . to read more about the deal , check out what tim draper has to say via the draper network 's recent post .
