        "research shows that machine learning can improve the way we place refugees in the united states . while the beltway argues over whether president donald trump called haiti a `` shithole '' or a `` shithouse '' -- or whether the outburst is question is simply more fake news -- the global refugee crisis continues more or less unabated . in 2017 , the number of forcibly displaced persons around the world soared past 65 million , a figure that includes both refugees -- those living outside their home countries -- and the internally displaced . every day , according to the united nations high commissioner for refugees , more than 28,000 people are forced to flee their homes . ",
        "a recently published study in science offers a 21st-century solution to an age-old question : where best to settle refugees upon their arrival in a new country . jens hainmueller and his colleagues at stanford university 's immigration policy lab used machine learning and reams of historical data to design an algorithm that optimizes a refugee 's chance of finding employment in her new home . `` refugees are among the world 's most vulnerable populations , '' the authors write . `` after experiencing war , violence , and years of living in overcrowded refugee camps , refugees arrive in a new country with few resources and must acclimate to an unfamiliar local language , economy , and culture . ",
        "refugees frequently remain economically marginalized , with low levels of employment in the years following their arrival . `` the syrian migrant crisis you 've never heard of : as millions of syrians are forced to flee their home country , the descendants of earlier migrants enjoy a life of cultural and economic assimilation . hainmueller and his colleagues built an algorithm that studied historical settlement data -- including characteristics such as country of origin , language skills , sex , and age -- and `` learned '' where particular newcomers fared best . the researchers trained their model on data from 33,000 working-age refugees from 2011 to 2016 . ",
        "they then tested it on 900 refugees who arrived at the end of 2016 . the results were impressive . `` the median refugee 's predicted probability of employment in the united states more than doubled , increasing from approximately 25 % to 50 % , '' the authors write . `` our optimized assignment increased the probability of finding employment across the entire distribution of refugees , including those who were least likely and most likely to find work . `` on average , 34 percent of refugees in the test group found work within 90 days of settling in the u. s. using an algorithm to guide the settlement process , the researchers predict , that figure would climb to 48 percent -- a 41 percent improvement . ",
        "a job is n't a silver bullet , but it 's a start . in addition to economic stability , it provides community and self-sufficiency , even purpose . but not every city or town offers a refugee the same odds of finding work . `` a particular place could be an onramp or an obstacle , '' hainmueller tells pacific standard . denver , for instance , might have a thriving afghan community , making it easier for refugee from kabul to find work there , while los angeles has no such network . or a town in alabama might have a meatpacking plant that readily employs young people , but which rarely hires older workers . ",
        "`` many of these factors matter , '' hainmueller says . `` the key is , they matter differently in different locations . `` on an anecdotal level , this seems obvious . in switzerland , for example , african refugees from francophone countries are 40 percent more likely to find work when they 're settled in the french-speaking part of the country rather than the german-speaking part . but trying to catalog these synergies in an exhaustive way is a complex process of trial and error , hideously inefficient for a human to tackle . `` think about it as a matching problem , '' hainmueller says . ",
        "`` if you have three families and three locations , you can do it with a paper and pencil . in the real world , there 's thousands of refugee families and hundreds of locations . it 's basically impossible for a case work or placement officer , using an excel sheet , to come up with the optimal matching . `` at present , refugee settlement in this country is a basically random process . if a refugee does n't have pre-existing ties -- family , friends , or an official sponsor -- they are assigned to one of nine voluntary resettlement agencies in a weekly lottery . ",
        "from there , they 're typically sent to whichever local office has the most capacity at the moment . according to the authors , `` placement officers make assignment decisions prior to refugees ' arrival and without interviewing the refugees . `` hainmueller envisions a future where , rather than replacing them altogether , computers simply help their human counterparts make better decisions . for instance , an algorithm could suggest the three most optimal settlement locations for a refugee family , based on its particular characteristics , but a case worker , drawing on her experience and professional judgment , would make the final call . ",
        "because machine-learning algorithms are flexible , they improve with time . `` say afghans no longer do well in denver because their networks stop being effective or the labor market is saturated , '' hainmueller says . `` once the data comes in , the algorithm will figure out , ` oh , afghans are no longer doing well there . ' but they might start to do well in another place . there 's immediate feedback built into the system that 's absent from the process right now . '' `` the world is facing the most significant refugee crisis in the post-war period , '' hainmueller says . ",
        "`` the u. s. has been a leader in refugee resettlement , but that leadership had waned somewhat recently . refugee policies , like immigration policies generally , are dominated by ideology rather than sounds evidence . we have n't seen a lot of innovations in this space . cash assistance , language instruction , training programs : these turn out to be very expensive and difficult to scale . '' `` the nice thing is , from a policy perspective , this does n't really cost you anything more , '' he continues . `` it 's just a smarter way of doing the allocation . ",
        "rather than doing it in a haphazard , quasi-random fashion , as we 're doing it right now , we might as well do it in a more data-driven way , where we send people to the places they 're more likely to succeed . ''   "
