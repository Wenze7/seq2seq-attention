        "demi lovato might not always feel as confident as her hit song suggests , but that is n't stopping her from living her best life on a beach somewhere . while the east coast of the u. s. get pounded by heavy snow , the `` tell me you love me '' singer escaped to the warmth for some sand and sun . on thursday , lovato posted a photo of herself frolicking on a beach in a one-piece black-and-white-striped bathing suit . `` so , i 'm insecure about my legs in this picture but i 'm posting it because i look so happy and this year i 've decided i 'm letting go of my perfectionism and embracing freedom from self criticism , '' she captioned the photo . ",
        "`` learning to love my body the way it is is challenging but life changing . giving up my eating disorder has been the most challenging journey of my life but i work every day towards solid recovery even if i mess up sometimes , '' she continued . `` today i 'm feeling strong . you all can do it too . it is possible . thank you god for this new chapter in my life . `` lovato has long been open about her struggles with an eating disorder -- something she shares with both her mother and grandmother -- and sought treatment in 2010 to deal with `` emotional and physical issues . ",
        "`` she 's been on the path to self-acceptance since then , dropping body-positive anthems and encouraging her legions of fans to discard toxic beauty standards . in october , she shared side-by-side photos of herself with her followers on instagram . one photo is from what looks like her disney channel days , when the star says she experienced bullying . the photo had the caption , `` recovery is possible . `` in her powerful youtube documentary `` simply complicated , '' released last year , lovato opened up about relapsing in the wake of her breakup with actor wilmer valderrama . ",
        "the couple announced their split in june 2016 . `` when i do have moments when i slip up , i feel very ashamed , '' the pop star said . `` i do n't want to give it the power that it controls my every thought , but it 's something that i 'm constantly thinking about , '' she continued . `` body image , what i wish i could be eating , what i wish i could be eating next , what i wish i did n't eat , you know , it 's just constant .
