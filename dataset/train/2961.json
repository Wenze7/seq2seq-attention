        "the toronto blue jays have not made any big splashes this offseason to improve the 2018 contingent however management has picked their spots making moves for players who for the most part are controllable with upside all the while adding roster flexibility in what has suddenly shaped up to a sneaky good offseason . the jays have added curtis granderson , aledmys diaz , yangervis solarte and most recently randal grichuk while hardly subtracting from their major league roster . the foursome combined to hit 73 home runs last season with their respective teams . granted the blue jays still have some work to do on the pitching side of things but general manager ross atkins has money to spare to solidify the rotation and possibly add a proven back end of the bullpen type arm before it is all said and done . ",
        "yangervis solarte hit 18 round trippers including 8 of those at home while playing at petco park last season . the versatile solarte is a safe bet to increase those power numbers this season north of the border at the rogers centre . grichuk has colossal power and should benefit from an everyday assignment in right field . according to a recent interview , grichik conceded he has been diligent all offseason on improving his plate discipline and managing the strike zone better . grichuk has a legitimate chance at hitting 35 round trippers at the homer dome . defensively the new additions provide manager john gibbons with a plethora of combinations to run out on the field every day especially if troy tulowitzki and or devon travis once again succumb to injury . ",
        "the manager can also afford to rest his star players from time to time with the versatility at his disposal . it is difficult to award atkins and company a final grade on the offseason with moves still to be made however thus far the blue jays are a much better team going into the spring than they were last season . after a slow offseason , the jays managed to become much improved right under our noses . next : an exclusive interview with tony fernandezthey may not have added lorenzo cain or j. d. martinez but do n't sleep on the blue jays in 2018 .
