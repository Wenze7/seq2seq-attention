        "building on a budget ! the post lead designer for i expect you to die explains building levels on a budget appeared first on playstation lifestyle . not all video games are made with multi-million dollar budgets , and when it comes to smaller games , sometimes designing a game or level on a budget is a must . as part of gamasutra 's `` deep dives '' series , they recently had shawn patton -- the principle designer for schell games -- sit down and discuss what it took to create a level for the vr puzzle game i expect you to die . ",
        "as patton states , when the game was first being tested , many players commented on making the game `` worth '' the cost , meaning that patton and his team had to find ways to possibly design levels in a cost-effective way . to do this , he said , he began by having a brainstorming meeting to discuss possible level concepts before moving on to letting the core team meet and discuss what could be realistic . what came from these moments , he said , was learning that something as simple as sitting in a train car can be fun , and not every environment has to be rich or gigantic to be engaging to the player . ",
        "the entire discussion is well worth the read if you 're interested in level design or game design on any scale , so make sure to head over to gamasutra to check it out . for more on i expect you to die , make sure to check out our review on the game : i expect you to die is an essential vr game that gets across why virtual reality is so fundamentally different from traditional games . it immerses you in schell 's take on spy culture , and provides some frantic heart pounding moments as you try not to die . ",
        "the adventure is over all too quickly , but the format of the missions being launched from a central office is the perfect platform to bring in additional missions as updates or dlc , which i would wholly support if they matched up to the impeccable quality of the existing puzzles . the credits do conclude by saying `` i expect you to die will continue ... '' so after all of these deadly super spy experiences , it looks like schell games still expects you to die , and hopefully we do n't have to wait too long . ",
        "i expect you to die is n't just stirring up the field of virtual reality . like a bond martini , it 's thoroughly shaken . i expect you to die is available now . the post lead designer for i expect you to die explains building levels on a budget appeared first on playstation lifestyle .
