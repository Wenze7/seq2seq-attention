        "with the inaugural season of overwatch league getting underway , blizzard has released a new update for overwatch on pc , ps4 , and xbox one . among a variety of other things , it adds a huge number of skins to the game -- 312 , to be precise . each of the game 's 26 characters receives 12 new skins , each themed around one of the dozen teams participating in overwatch league 's first season . unlike typical skins , you wo n't be grinding loot boxes in order to get your hands on these . instead , they 're sold with a newly introduced currency , league tokens . ",
        "skins are sold individually for 100 tokens . you 'll receive 100 for free just by logging in before february 13 , but past that point , you 'll need to pay up . doing so is n't cheap : 100 tokens cost $ 5 , although higher-priced bundles will bring down the dollar-to-token ratio . still , amassing a complete set will run you in the neighborhood of $ 1,200 . in the event that seems unreasonable to you , we 've amassed a collection of screenshots showcasing all of the new skins . you can see all of these in the gallery above . ",
        "overwatch league season 1 's first matches begin on january 10 . the competition will go on for six months , with champions being named later this year . for much more on what to expect , check out our rundown on how to watch overwatch league , a roundup of all the overwatch league teams and rosters , and a recap of everything you need to know .
