        "bridgewater threw an interception on his first pass . bridgewater has been sidelined since aug. . 30 , 2016 when he suffered a dislocated knee and torn ligaments during a non-contact drill in practice . after rehabbing for nearly 15 months , the quarterback was moved off the pup list and to the 53-man roster in october . he has been active since week 10 and spent the last six games as keenum 's backup . the last time the vikings made an in-game switch at quarterback happened out of necessity in week 5 when sam bradford twisted his knee and had to be replaced by keenum with 25 seconds left in the first half .
