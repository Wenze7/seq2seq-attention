        "live halifax more streams david burkereporter david burke is a reporter in halifax who covers everything from politics to science . his reports have been featured on the national , world report and as it happens , as well as the information morning shows in halifax and cape breton . some would-be tenants are being turned away by landlords because of their criminal history , according to a halifax lawyer who says such actions amount to discrimination . tammy wohler said she 's dealt with a couple of these cases , where landlords required a criminal record check before they would hand over keys over to a tenant . ",
        "`` it 's essentially an invisible punishment , '' said wohler , who works for nova scotia legal aid . the organization provides legal services to people with low incomes . lease-breaking doctors ' notes costing landlords thousands people with a criminal record have paid their debt to society and deserve to move on with their lives , she said . it 's in everyone 's best interest that people find stable housing because without it , there 's a higher chance that they will reoffend as they struggle to get by , she added . in the cases wohler 's seen , those rejected by landlords were not career criminals , had never been incarcerated and had `` convictions that were relatively light on the scale . ",
        "`` the existence of a criminal record tells you nothing about what an individual is as a tenant . whether or not they 're going to be paying their rent on time or whether or not they 'll be a tenant of good behaviour . past misdeeds do n't necessarily tell you what that person 's future is going to be , '' she said . in one case , wohler 's client wanted to move into a mobile home park , but was turned down because of his criminal record . the case went before the residential tenancies board . ",
        "the board sided with wohler 's client and he was allowed to move in . wohler said there is nothing in the province 's residential tenancies act that addresses criminal record checks as a reason to not rent to someone . but it is spelled out in the landlord 's guide on the access nova scotia website . the government website states that landlords can conduct `` background checks on prospective tenants . '' jeremy jackson says criminal record checks do fall under the umbrella of a background check . he 's president of the investment property owners association of nova scotia and vice president of marketing and program management at killam apartment reit . ",
        "`` landlords are allowed to ask for it , but i can tell you my experience here at killam , both on the apartment side and also on the manufactured home community side , it is not our practice to do the criminal records check . '' kijiji rental turned into ` complete nightmare ' for tenants jackson said most landlords only perform a credit check , then call a prospective tenant 's references to gauge what kind of person they are . he does n't believe many landlords are asking for criminal record checks . part of the problem is no one knows exactly how many landlords are asking for the checks , wohler said . ",
        "people may simply accept a landlord 's rejection and seek out other places to live . or they may not apply to be a tenant at all if they know they have to undergo a criminal record check , she said . this , combined with the fact there is no obvious route to appeal a rejected tenancy application , means the problem is not being addressed , said wohler . she 's encouraging anyone who has been turned away because of a criminal record check , or because they did n't want to disclose their criminal record , to contact her at nslegalaid . ",
        "ca or call 902-420-3450 . `` a criminal record check is simply too invasive in terms of someone 's privacy and too discriminatory . if we allow landlords to say no to someone because they have a past conviction , then the question becomes what does that person do ? ''   "
