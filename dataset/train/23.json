",
        "`` he was trying to go in and get his family out , '' said capt. dean hensley . `` he did everything he could , he just was n't able to get to them . the fire was just too intense . `` by the time huffman fire department made it over the icy roads to the home , smoke and flames had already engulfed the small trailer . `` the fire department did everything they could do but there was just too much fire when they got here , '' hensley said . the mother and children were in their bedrooms when the blaze began , officials said . ",
        "`` we understand from talking to the dad that obviously she was trying to get them and get out -- they were both trying to get the kids out , '' hensley said . `` obviously when you 're in smoke and fire you get disoriented . you get overcome by the smoke and sometimes people just collapse where they are . `` when fire crews made it inside , they found the 33-year-old woman dead in the back of the home , along with her 9-year-old son and 11-year-old daughter , according to authorities . `` she probably perished trying to save her kids , '' hensley said .

        "the father was transported to the hospital with first - , second - , and third-degree burns . officials initially reported that a third child died in the flames , but later clarified that he was not home at the time . authorities are still probing the cause of the fire , though hensley noted there were space heaters inside . while investigators worked to uncover where and when the blaze started , friends and community members came forward with condolences . `` she had a hard life , but she 's always been an awesome mom , '' said denise armstrong , whose mother lives across the street from the tienda family .
