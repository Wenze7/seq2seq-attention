        "troy -- the two men accused of slaying four people inside a lansingburgh apartment last month both have violent criminal records . justin c. mann and james w. white are each charged with one count of first-degree murder and four counts of second-degree murder in connection to the slayings of brandi mells , 22 , shanta myers , 36 , and two of myers ' three children -- jeremiah , 11 , and shanise , 5 . white was arrested in 1999 in new york city on a second-degree murder charge , according to the bronx county district attorney 's office . ",
        "prosecutors said white and two others forcibly entered a west bronx apartment on aug. . 5 , 1999 , where white grabbed 19-year-old tyshawn jackson by the neck and told the others to stab him . one man did , several times , and jackson died at a hospital , the district attorney 's office said . white pleaded guilty to manslaughter in 2001 and served nearly nine years in prison before being paroled . on monday , the city mission 's executive director , michael saccocio , said white had been banned from the schenectady shelter for violent outbursts and repeatedly starting fights . ",
        "mann was arrested in 2013 after pointing a gun at another man in queens and stealing his cellphone . he was charged with robbery , criminal possession of a weapon and criminal possession of a stolen property . mann pleaded guilty to robbery and was paroled from state prison in june . it was not immediately clear how long either had lived in schenectady . no one answered the door at either of their addresses on tuesday morning . a motive for the troy killings has not yet publicly surfaced . investigators have said they believe the victims were targeted but declined to elaborate . ",
        "police sources said the victims were discovered bound with their throats slit . the first-degree murder charge stems from the accusation that mann and white intentionally killed more than one victim , an act that carries a harsher punishment under state law . the top murder charge does not reflect premeditation or specify which , if any , of the four victims was the target , a law enforcement source close to the investigation said tuesday . if convicted of first-degree murder , white and mann face life in prison without the possibility of parole . court paperwork indicates the killings took place at about 9 p. m. friday , dec. . ",
        "21 . the bodies were found on tuesday , dec. . 26 . mann , 24 and white , 38 , were arrested without incident late friday night at mann 's apartment on hamilton street in schenectady and arraigned saturday morning . both men have court appointed attorneys and are being held without bail . they are scheduled to appear in court thursday for a preliminary hearing . police from troy and schenectady as well as other agencies began focusing on white and mann , in part , after reviewing footage from security cameras in troy , police sources said .
