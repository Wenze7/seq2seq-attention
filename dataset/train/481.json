        "credit : university of queenslandmimicking sleep processes in the awake brain of elderly people could prevent age-related decline in brain function . the university of queensland 's school of health and rehabilitation sciences researcher dr. martin sale is investigating if the brain can be made more resistant to age-related decline by artificially boosting sleep-like brain activity . `` sleep plays a key role in promoting neuroplasticity -- the ability of the brain to re-wire itself -- but as sleep quality reduces as we age , our brain function is affected , '' dr. sale said . `` sleep is important in helping to consolidate the changes to brain function that occur whilst you are awake . ",
        "`` for example , if you have a good night 's sleep after studying , you 're much better at remembering the material you learnt for an upcoming exam . `` a portion of sleep , the deep part of sleep known as slow wave sleep , assists with strengthening the brain changes required for learning and memory that occur throughout the day . `` we would like to artificially cause the relevant brain regions to oscillate at this slow frequency , to mimic slow wave sleep , but when the brain is awake . `` the researchers can achieve this by passing a small alternating electric current between two parts of a person 's brain using a safe and often completely unnoticeable procedure . ",
        "`` in essence we are tricking the brain into thinking it 's asleep to harness the beneficial aspects of sleep even though it 's still awake . `` approximately 50 per cent of adults complain of difficulty sleeping and approximately 20 per cent of adults aged over 65 have some form of cognitive impairment . the researchers are looking for healthy right-handed elderly participants aged over 65 years to participate in the study . provided by university of queenslandthis story is republished courtesy and copyrighted by medical xpress , a popular site that covers news about medical research . read the original article .
