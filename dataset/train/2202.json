        "santa fe , n. m. -- creators of a popular immersive art entertainment project in santa fe , new mexico , announced thursday a push into a major metropolitan market with plans for an interactive exhibit and music venue on a wedge of highway-side property in an industrial neighborhood of downtown denver . the for-profit arts company meow wolf said it will launch a new business venture to build a kaleidoscopic walk - and crawl-through exhibit for all ages , under a 20-year lease in partnership with denver-based commercial real estate developer revesco , which operates a nearby urban amusement park . ",
        "a new five-story building , spanning an area larger than a football field , is scheduled for completion by early 2020 , offering the offbeat public attraction near stadiums for denver 's major league sports teams , the children 's museum of denver and the city 's downtown aquarium . the denver venture will provide a major financial and creative test for meow wolf and its growing staff of about 200 artists , technicians and project developers . ceo vince kadlubek describes them as the `` corporate version of an art collective . `` he estimated overall investment will reach $ 30 million or more and compared it to the budget of a major motion picture . ",
        "meow wolf plans to seek additional investors later this year , with an offering that could involve equity in the company or debt obligations or both . the company last year raised nearly $ 1 million by selling off-exchange shares to employees and small-scale internet investors to fuel its expansion and equip a manufacturing and video production facility in santa fe . in santa fe , the company has coined a new brand of family entertainment that combines eye-popping psychedelic design work -- that lends itself to shared images on social media -- with narrative storytelling . artistic details of the denver exhibit remained largely a mystery .
