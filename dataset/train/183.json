        "brazil superstar neymar has tipped belgium to spring a surprise at the world cup in russia next year . the red devils , managed by former everton boss roberto martinez , won nine of their 10 games in qualifying and boast some of the world 's most in-form attackers , such as kevin de bruyne , eden hazard and dries mertens . neymar , who will lead brazil 's line as they bid to win football 's showpiece prize for the first time since 2002 , has cited belgium as dark horses , as well as highlighting the superb recent form of premier league top-scorer mohamed salah , which could be the catalyst for egypt to cause an upset . ",
        "`` i think the best-known teams are the favourites , as always , '' he said . `` among them are brazil , germany , france , spain and argentina - these teams will be the highlights in any championship . `` and for the surprise , i think belgium has an excellent team and can be a surprise in this world cup . salah is a great player who can make a difference in the world cup . '' que deus nos aben√ßoe e nos protejagood bless and protect us pic . twitter . com/kppj5pq7a0 -- neymar jr november 29 , 2017 neymar was an instrumental figure in his country 's ill-fated attempt to win the world cup on home soil in 2014 as they suffered a crushing 7-1 defeat to germany in the semi-finals . ",
        "however , the psg star believes he is a more experienced player now and is better positioned to spearhead an attempt to win a sixth world cup for his country . he added : `` the difference is hard to explain , but i think i 'm more experienced , more wise , more ` cascudo ' , as we say in brazil . `` this is because i had many experiences , i participated in a world cup where we lost and i think i 'll be more prepared for the next one , because i know what is like to be in a world cup , i can be better prepared . ",
        "`` so the neymar in 2018 is better than the neymar in 2014 . ''   "
