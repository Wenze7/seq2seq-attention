        "a strange new food trend , raw water , has gripped consumers , or at least the ones rich enough to afford to throw away their money on unproven and sometimes ridiculous statements by people who profess to know what they are talking about . what is raw water ? according to adherents of the $ 6.00 a glass product , it is nothing more than unfiltered and untreated water . that raw water might contain bacteria , parasites , or chemical contaminants goes over the heads of people willing to pay a ridiculous amount of money just to go off the tap water grid . ",
        "the new york times reports `` raw water '' is now somehow a thing on the west coast and `` other pockets around the country . '' in san francisco , california , one company , live water , offers `` unfiltered , unsterilized spring water '' for $ 36.99 for a 2.5-gallon container , with refills going for $ 14.99 a pop . the live water website claims : '' shocking but true - all other filtered and even bottled spring waters are sterilized with uv light , ozone gas , and a sub-micron filter . this is similar to how most juice and dairy products are pasteurized for shelf stability . ",
        "unfortunately , this sterilization destroys beneficial sources of minerals and probiotics . `` they go on to talk about the miraculous healing powers of their spring water , including a list of probiotics proven to be exclusive to their water only , claiming they are imperative for optimal physical and mental health . san francisco 's rainbow grocery shift manager kevin freeman told the times . `` bottled water 's controversial . we 've curtailed our water selection . but this is totally outside that whole realm . '' freeman said , `` it has a vaguely mild sweetness , a nice smooth mouthfeel , nothing that overwhelms the flavor profile . ",
        "`` in san diego , liquid eden offers options including `` fluoride-free , chlorine-free and a ` mineral electrolyte alkaline ' drinking water that goes for $ 2.50 a gallon . '' then there is a startup called zero mass water that offers a $ 4,500 home system called source which pulls unfiltered water from the air . zero mass water was founded in 2014 in scottsdale , arizona . the company develops equipment that uses solar energy to produce potable water . why the nyt put this company in with sellers of `` raw water '' is questionable because producing water from the air using photovoltaic technologies is a growing business that is deserving of the publicity . ",
        "zero mass water offers a renewable supply of water with a panel system that uses sunlight to power panels that pull water vapor from the air . the system adds minerals to optimize health and taste . their two-panel array is capable of producing 8 to 20 bottles of water a day or they have a reservoir system that makes water that flows into a 30-liter container where it is mineralized for optimal taste , storing up to 120 standard bottles per 2-panel array . what started the raw water movement ? gizmodo writes the movement was motivated by vague claims that raw water contains probiotics supposedly beneficial to a person 's health . ",
        "probiotics are microorganisms that are believed to provide health benefits when consumed . the term probiotic is currently used to name ingested microorganisms associated with benefits for humans and animals . however , any claims , such as reducing gastrointestinal discomfort , improving immune health , relieving constipation , or avoiding the common cold , are not backed by scientific evidence and are prevented as deceptive advertisements in the united states by the federal trade commission . they can also cause bacteria-host interactions and unwanted side effects in rare cases . then there is the growing number of people who believe our tap water is contaminated with lead , fluoride , or birth control chemicals . ",
        "based on the times ' interview of live water chief mukhande singh who is quoted as saying : `` tap water ? you 're drinking toilet water with birth control drugs in them . chloramine , and on top of that they 're putting in fluoride . call me a conspiracy theorist , but it 's a mind-control drug that has no benefit to our dental health . '' the bottom line is actually simple . there is absolutely no guarantee that untreated water is free of pathogens like bacteria , viruses , parasites , or carcinogenic compounds . in august , digital journal reported on the water crisis in southern asia where over 750 million people in pakistan , india , nepal , and bangladesh are at risk from arsenic poisoning because 60 percent of their groundwater is contaminated with salt and deadly levels of arsenic . ",
        "an eroded trust of public resourcesthis begs the question of where people in the u. s. think our raw water is coming from ? but it also brings up another issue . is the public becoming distrustful of our municipal services ? we all know what happened in flynt , michigan . by december 2015 , residents had been drinking water from the flynt river for 18 months and many of the children in flynt had elevated lead levels . and because of global warming , there has been an increase in toxic algae growth , including the contamination of many municipal water reservoirs around the country . ",
        "outbreaks of the blue-green algae , a type of bacteria called cyanobacteria , produces a cyanotoxin called microcystin . this toxin has resulted in a number of `` do-not-drink '' warnings around the country . as gizmodo says , and i could n't put it any better : `` hey , though , if the nation 's rich want to hoard all the money that might otherwise be used for things like infrastructure and health care and spend it all on magic giardia water , there 's very little any of us can do to stop them .
