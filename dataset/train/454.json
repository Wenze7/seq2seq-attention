        "restaurant workers , a hotel event booker and a watchdog group who say president donald trump has business conflicts that violate the constitution can not sue him , a new york judge ruled thursday . u.s. district judge george daniels said it was too soon for the lawsuit to be considered by the courts , particularly because congress had not considered the issue . the lawsuit earlier this year alleged that trump 's `` vast , complicated , and secret '' business interests were creating conflicts of interest . it claimed the business ties violated the constitution 's ban against taking foreign gifts and money without congress ' permission , including for hotel stays or office leases . ",
        "trump had called the lawsuit `` totally without merit '' while aides to the republican president dismissed it as politically motivated . justice department lawyers had argued that the plaintiffs did not suffer in any way and had no standing to sue , and that it is unconstitutional to sue the president in his official capacity . citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington originally brought the lawsuit . it was later joined by restaurant opportunities centers united inc. . and two individuals in the hotel industry . ` we will not walk away ' `` while today 's ruling is a setback , we will not walk away from this serious and ongoing constitutional violation , '' said noah bookbinder , executive director of citizens for responsibility and ethics . ",
        "`` the constitution is explicit on these issues , and the president is clearly in violation . our legal team is weighing its options and will soon lay out our decisions on how to proceed . `` the lawsuit cited the little-known domestic and foreign emoluments clauses of the u. s. constitution . trump has made appearances at his resorts , golf clubs and a hotel in washington frequently since he was sworn in as president in january . other lawsuits have made similar claims , including a lawsuit in washington by the attorneys general of maryland and the district of columbia . ",
        "in his ruling , daniels said the intended purpose of the foreign emoluments clause was to prevent official corruption and foreign influence . he said the purpose of the domestic emoluments clause was to ensure presidential independence . daniels noted that with congressional consent , the constitution allows federal officials to accept foreign gifts and emoluments regardless of their effect on competition . `` there is simply no basis to conclude that the hospitality plaintiffs ' alleged competitive injury falls within the zone of interests that the emoluments clauses sought to protect , '' the judge wrote .
