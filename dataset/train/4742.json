        "the action role-playing game nightmarchers is adding a tropical twist to the end of the world . developer wyrmbyte crafted a postapocalyptic version of the hawaiian island oahu , incorporating local mythology in protagonist kai 's quest to reclaim the land from evil gods . the game is raising funds on fig , with an estimated pc launch coming this summer . wyrmbyte portrays oahu after an event called the `` great thunder '' wracks the island . in the aftermath , people are struggling to survive as otherworldly spirits and raiders maraud the island . an old god named kamapua'a leads the forces of evil , and the only one who can stop him is kai , a descendant of shamans who can wield mystical powers . ",
        "`` i have had a passion for postapocalyptic settings since seeing mad max and playing the original wasteland and we thought what about doing a postapocalyptic game in paradise instead of a brown , dead world , '' said wyrmbyte 's president scott brown in an email to gamesbeat . `` with hawaii being one of our favorite places in the world , it seemed like a great fit . then as we began learning more and more about the past of the island it just became a really strong story that we finally decided we should create . '' ",
        "despite the calamitous great thunder , nightmarchers 's world features lush tropical flora . wyrmbyte did research to try to closely replicate oahu 's geography . it studied coastal erosion scans from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration as well as maps of the island . it also built internal tools to analyze data that it got from the coastal scans . `` while we thought we might make the entire island playable , it 's just too big so we have instead focused in on parts that are unique and interesting to explore , '' said brown . `` starting from this data and using all the tools we have now built allows us to really quickly build large maps in . '' ",
        "as for the inhabitants of the doomed oahu , wyrmbyte mixes real lore along with fictional elements . kai will encounter folks who have different ideas about how to survive , as well as spirits and scientists who are trying to harness the power of the supernatural . his arsenal is a mix of magical `` demigod '' abilities -- for instance , players can unlock the power to summon a small volcano -- and high-tech weaponry , like a `` wave condenser '' gun that looks like it shoots energy blasts . and the developer based many of the creatures on hawaiian mythology , including the titular nightmarchers , which are ghostly warriors who protect the land . ",
        "`` we went into this with being respectful to the mythology from the start , '' said brown . `` we had this amazing conversation with a kahuna from oahu for hours listening to him talk about the past , issues we should avoid , and more . it was a really fun way to start building a lore that fit into something as amazing as hawaiian culture . the surprising thing is that nobody else has done this .
