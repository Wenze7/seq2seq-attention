        "with numbers and costs bulging for the annual year 10 wakatipu high school camp at the branches station , changes are possible in the future . however , principal steve hall said there would not be anything significant for 2018 , despite him and camp organiser ken mcintyre hearing rumours that the 12 day camp might be cut to six days . `` we think this is pretty funny because we 've heard this too but it 's news to us - surprising given we are the organisers , '' he said . but with 165 students taking part in the camp this year at a cost of almost $ 100,000 , there would be a review in the future . ",
        "`` wakatipu basin numbers are going to continue to grow so at some stage we will look at the model , '' he said . hall , a branches veteran having run the camp as a teacher at the school in the 1990s , attended this year 's camp , the 51st , for the first four days and returned for the final night . `` our big story was trying to be proactive about the sun and the heat , '' he said . the three day trek into lochnagar was tough in the heat but the river crossings were benign compared to some previous camps . ",
        "changes this year included a shift in the management structure . previously one person organised the whole camp . now there were several roles with different portfolios including overall co-ordinator , logistics , food , health and safety and operations . running the camp was a huge undertaking for the school , he said . `` lots of schools have this time to plan and prepare for next year - and this time is especially important for us with the move to the new school ... but for us the benefits are really significant . `` the students learn a lot about themselves . ",
        "they learn a lot about and get to know people they do n't necessarily mix with . one of the values of the camp is inclusiveness and that really goes into our senior school . they go in in a much more mature and grown-up way . `` they gain a great sense of responsibility and learn about things like resilience and determination . '' the remoteness , lack of cell phone coverage and the fact they lived under canvas for two weeks were all important as was the length of the camp . `` you ca n't hold your breath for 12 days . ",
        "you 've got to surrender and commit to the process as much as you can . ''   "
