        "people with early stage parkinson 's may be able to delay a worsening of the disease through a regimen of intense exercise , new research found . `` if you have parkinson 's disease and you want to delay the progression of your symptoms , you should exercise three times a week with your heart rate between 80 to 85 percent maximum . it is that simple , '' said study co-lead author daniel corcos . he 's professor of physical therapy and human movement sciences at northwestern university 's feinberg school of medicine in chicago . however , a more `` moderate '' exercise level -- under the heart rate threshold outlined in the study -- was not effective in slowing the disease , the researchers said . ",
        "as corcos ' team explained , medications for parkinson 's cause harmful side effects and their effectiveness declines over time , so new treatments are needed . `` the earlier in the disease you intervene , the more likely it is you can prevent the progression of the disease , '' corcos said in a university news release . the exact magnitude of the effect remains unknown , however . `` we delayed worsening of symptoms for six months ; whether we can prevent progression any longer than six months will require further study , '' corcos said . but the findings do challenge the long-held belief that intense exercise is too physically stressful for people with parkinson 's disease , he added . ",
        "the new study included 128 patients , ages 40 to 80 , who had early stage parkinson 's and were not yet taking medications for the disease . some of the patients did high-intensity workouts three times a week for six months , others did moderate-intensity workouts , and a control group did no exercise . the results showed that intense exercise was safe and delayed worsening of parkinson 's symptoms such as loss of muscle control , trembling , stiffness , slowness and impaired balance . `` several lines of evidence point to a beneficial effect of exercise in parkinson 's disease , '' dr. codrin lungu , program director of the u. s. national institute of neurological disorders and stroke , said in the news release . ",
        "`` nevertheless , it 's not clear which kind of exercise is most effective . trial tries to rigorously address this issue . the results are interesting and warrant further exploration of the optimal exercise regimes for parkinson 's , '' lungu said . two other experts agreed that physical activity could be what the doctor ordered for parkinson 's patients . `` as a neurologist who cares for many patients with parkinson 's , this study offers the potential for additional non-pharmacological strategies in aiding our patients , '' said dr. yasir el-sherif of staten island university hospital in new york city . ",
        "he said he `` looks forward '' to further studies that might tell doctors just how long the benefits last . dr. souhel najjar directs neurology at northwell health in new hyde park , n. y . he agreed that longer-term studies are needed , but the new findings help confirm that when dealing with parkinson 's , intense exercise `` can be very effective in halting its short-term progression . '' parkinson 's affects about 1 million people in the united states . incidence increases with age , and men are 1.5 times more likely than women to have the disorder , according to the parkinson 's foundation . ",
        "the study was published dec. . 11 in the journal jama neurology .   "
