        "daisy wood-davis , star of hollyoaks and freshfields ambassador , said : ` i have very little experience in long haul cycle rides but i jumped at the chance to help freshfields raise money for their wonderful rescue centre . i 've got to know the staff and the animals over the last six months and the work they do is just tremendous . `` this is a real rescue centre , who truly care and fall in love with all of their animals no matter how they got there or what they are . the fact that freshfields looks after injured or sick wildlife , not just our furry home friends , really is the cherry on top for me . ",
        "three men fined over one thousand pounds for littering `` they need every donation they can get to reach their full potential and spread more kind fundraisingmanager , john rullo said `` the cycle challenge is symbolic of the link that connects our centres . the distance of 120 miles may be great , but with teamwork nothing is insurmountable . `` it 's a ` virtual ' challenge , so we will be undertaken in the comfortable surroundings of liverpool one , avoiding the mud and the rain on the open road . thanks to the kindness of the gym group , we 'll be riding the high-quality exercise bikes which we hope will make the miles all the easier .
