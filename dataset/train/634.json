        "new york -- patrick ewing returned to madison square garden and got the better of chris mullin and st. john 's one more time in a throwback to their big east days of the 1980s . jessie govan hit a 3-pointer from the top of the arc to put the hoyas ahead in the final minute and they held on to beat the red storm 69-66 on tuesday night at msg . ewing and mullin squared off as coaches of their alma maters for the first time , sparking memories of their glory days when georgetown went 3-1 vs. the red storm in 1984-85 and the teams were ranked in the top three for all four meetings . ",
        "ewing , a former knicks great , was back at the garden for the first time as the hoyas coach . ewing was cheered from the moment he walked out of the tunnel and gave a fist-bump and hug to an arena security guard . he walked toward the st. john 's bench and pulled in mullin for a hearty embrace . they posed for pictures and pointed and shouted toward some familiar faces in the stands . ewing heard all cheers from the thousands at msg , maybe even from the knicks diehards who plunked down $ 160 bucks for a no . ",
        "33 jersey at the team store on the concourse . ewing 's retired no . 33 hangs in the rafters 13 spots away from new york 's 1998-99 eastern conference champions banner . ewing 's image is plastered inside and out at the garden where he forged a hall of fame career . the most popular photo in the joint saw his arms outstretched and his back toward the camera from the may 22 , 1994 game 7 win over the chicago bulls in the conference semis . his game-worn jersey and sneakers are encased in glass on the concourse and top tickets on stubhub ran about $ 180 a pop just before tip . ",
        "mullin , the flat-topped golden state warriors great , kept his share of fans even as the red storm continue to slog through another depressing season . one fan held a sign that read , `` coach m , wooden it be nice to top patrick , again . go storm ! ! '' mullin was the 1985 john wooden award winner given to the most outstanding player in college basketball . ewing mostly kept his hands in his pockets as he paced the sideline ; mullin gestured , waved hand signals and pulled a piece of paper out his pocket for an occasional glance at the playbook . ",
        "but ewing was quick to bellow , `` rebound ! go ! '' the kind of commands that had to even please former st. john 's coach lou carnesecca in the stands . ewing wore a dark winter cap and mullin had his head covered by a hoodie as they shook hands in a photo that had more than 1,600 likes by tipoff on georgetown 's twitter account . mullin told wfan radio on tuesday he expected a weird vibe , but `` after the weirdness subsides , it gets down to the players and competitions , and both teams are trying to get on track . ",
        "that 's what the focus will be . `` ewing and mullin would have been one-and-done players in this era but instead their identities are forever linked with their college heyday . mullin led the red storm to the 1985 final four , a no . 1 ranking and finished his career as the program 's career leading scorer . ewing personified the `` hoya paranoia '' under coach john thompson and took the program to the 1984 national championship . ewing and the hoyas beat mullin and st. john 's in one of the 1985 final games -- where georgetown would then get upset by villanova in the title game . ",
        "this one was far from a big east classic and served as a stark reminder of how just far these programs are from the days when mullin and ewing , teammates on two olympic teams , dominated the game instead of watching one in suits . the big east teams shot a combined 4 for 23 in the first half from 3-point range and crowd enthusiasm waned after both coaches were introduced . big picturegeorgetown : govan had 18 points and 13 rebounds for the hoyas . marcus derrickson scored 17 points . st. john 's : shamorie ponds scored 17 points for st. john 's and justin simon had 16 .

        "up nextgeorgetown : the hoyas play saturday at no . 13 seton hall and then jan. . 17 at home against no . 1 villanova . st. john 's : the red storm are back at msg saturday to play no . 1 villanova and jan. . 17 at no . 10 xavier .   "
