        "wesley chapel , fla. . -- maddie rooney , nicole hensley and alex rigsby all are olympic rookies . even though robb stauber has coached americans in the winter games before , pyeongchang will mark his debut as head coach on the biggest stage for women 's hockey . they all have something else in common . they are all goaltenders , used to the pressure of being a team 's last line of defense . stauber , who played 62 games in the nhl with los angeles and buffalo , believes simply being a goalie prepares a player for pressure and high expectations . ",
        "`` all of them have been in big games before , '' said stauber , who coached goalies for the u. s. women in 2014 at sochi . `` when you 're successful in that environment , it 's never about the big game . it 's about staying in the moment , and they all know how to stay in the moment . regardless of the olympics , that 's something they have to do . goalies that are able to find that peace of mind in the most critical time play well . it 's very simple . ",
        "they will play well . `` that 's a lot of confidence in untested goalies as the americans try to end their 20-year gold medal drought . `` we 've got a great coaching staff and great personnel to make sure everyone 's going to be on the right page when push comes to shove and it 's time to perform , '' said forward hilary knight , a two-time olympic silver medalist . `` i 'm extremely excited for our goaltenders . they 're great young women who have great potential , and you 've already seen them own the world stage . ",
        "`` all three want to be in net starting feb. . 11 when the united states opens olympic play against finland . `` obviously , there 's three of us fighting for one spot , '' hensley said . `` at the same time , all three of us are very supportive of each other because nobody knows what a goalie goes through except for another goaltender , so it 's really important that the three of us support each other . but at the same time , we 're pushing each other to get better because at the end of the day if we 're doing that , that 's what 's going to be best for our team come february . ",
        "`` the americans will be taking all three goalies to pyeongchang . the final roster will be announced jan. . 1 , but the crucial decision will be who plays on feb. . 15 in the preliminary round against four-time olympic champion canada . the semifinals are feb. . 19 , with both the u. s. and canada favored to reach the final . stauber has made it clear he does n't want to make that decision too early . `` got to let these things play out and when you see what you think is a clear picture , which takes time clearly , then you build your strategy off that clear picture , '' stauber said . ",
        "the americans have lost four straight games to the rival canadians as part of their pre-olympic exhibition tour . rooney went 3-2 against canada this fall , dropping the last two games . she was in net for a 5-2 victory oct. . 22 , then notched two more wins over canada during the four nations cup in november with the united states outscoring canada 9-3 combined . rooney also was in net for an 8-2 win over finland to kick off that tournament . rooney made 24 saves in a 2-1 overtime loss to canada on dec. . 3 and she also made 24 saves in a 2-1 overtime loss to canada on dec. . ",
        "15 . `` we 're all rookies on this olympic team , '' said rooney , a 20-year-old goalie from andover , minnesota , who is taking the season off for minnesota-duluth . `` every chance you get , you want to prove you 're the best and you want to get the start on each night . `` the 26-year-old rigsby has been on the u. s. roster for four world championships , playing in the last three tournaments . the goalie from delafield , wisconsin , was in net for a 2-0 loss to canada on dec. . ",
        "5 and she made 33 saves dec. . 13 in a 3-1 loss to canada . rigsby and hensley both played in a 5-1 loss to canada in boston on oct. . 25 . hensley has the biggest win yet . the 23-year-old from lakewood , colorado , made 28 saves last spring to help the americans beat canada 3-2 in overtime for their fourth straight world championship . hensley went 3-0-0-0 with two shutouts in that tournament . `` we 're used to being the no . 1 , and i think that craving for that position is what pushes each of us to want that same spot here , '' hensley said . ",
        "`` at the same time , we have to be supportive of each other because at the end of the day whoever 's in net , that 's what 's best for the team and that 's what we want is to win . '' ___ more ap olympic coverage : teresa m. walker at www . twitter . com/teresamwalker .   "
