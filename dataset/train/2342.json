        "defensive tackle geno atkins was the best player on paul guenther 's cincinnati bengals defense . guenther must find his own atkins with the oakland raiders . paul guenther was able to establish himself as a sound defensive mind on the cincinnati bengals as their defensive coordinator . while the bengals failed to reach the afc playoffs the last two years , guenther did have one of the best defensive tackles in football leading his defense in the undersized defensive tackle geno atkins . atkins is a six-time pro bowler and a two-time all-pro in his eight nfl seasons out of the university of georgia . ",
        "though a good sec player in his own right for mark richt , atkins was only a fourth-round pick by the bengals in the 2010 nfl draft . one could argue that guenther and former bengals defensive coordinator mike zimmer maximized atkins ' talent and has him on track to be in canton one day . of course , guenther leaves behind his best defensive player in atkins in cincinnati after he joined jon gruden 's 2018 oakland raiders staff as defensive coordinator . recreating his own silver and black version wo n't be easy , but is paramount for the raiders ' defensive turnaround . ",
        "does anybody on the oakland roster fit that mold ? would the raiders have to draft their own version of atkins ? the good news is atkins was a former fourth-round pick , so the raiders do n't have to overspend or overdraft for a guy if he 's not currently on the 53-man roster . keep in mind that atkins is only 6-foot-1 , 286 pounds . that 's not overly imposing for a tradition defensive tackle . then again , atkins uses leverage , speed and power to generate pressure in the middle of the defense . so who on the raiders roster best fits that description ? ",
        "must raiders 2018 nfl draft : 5 edge players to targetto-be free agent justin ellis is too large at 6-foot-2 , 334 pounds to have atkins ' quickness . perhaps the two best fits for that role from the 2017 raiders would be to-be free agent denico autry and former third-round pick eddie vanderdoes . autry showed in 2017 that he can generate pressure up the middle with 5.0 quarterback sacks . at 6-foot-5 , 273 pounds , autry has the frame to be like atkins in terms of speed . however , he is four inches taller than atkins , which could create leverage problems . ",
        "look for the raiders to prioritize bringing him back as a free agent , as there is so much untapped potential still inside of autry . vanderdoes did not have a great rookie year . though he played a bunch , he struggled at generating pressure , did not record a sack and got hurt at the end of the year . that being said , he is relentless in his pursuit of the passer . he was this way during his days in the pac-12 starring for the ucla bruins . at 6-foot-3 , 305 pounds , vanderdoes has a workable frame to be oakland 's version of atkins potentially . ",
        "since this is more of a developmental role than anything else , either oakland needs to find this guy on their roster or target him in the 2018 nfl draft . two players come to mind that could come up big on the raiders defensive line . that would be maurice hurst of the michigan wolverines and andrew brown of the virginia cavaliers . more from just blog baby derek carr added to 2018 pro bowl roster , replaces tom brady2h ago oakland raiders : 5 offensive players to watch at 2018 senior bowl3h ago oakland raiders news : kevin sumlin was in the mix to be raiders oc4h ago rich bisaccia can maximize oakland raiders special teams23h ago tom cable , raiders offensive line must make adjustments in 20181 d ago hurst is a lock to go in the first-round . ",
        "at 6-foot-2 , 280 pounds , hurst is the ideal frame of an atkins prototype . in four years with the wolverines , he had 32.0 tackles for a loss of yardage and 13.5 quarterback sacks . while many in raider nation are clamoring for guys like roquan smith , minkah fitzpatrick and saquon barkley at no . 10 , why would oakland consider a guy like hurst with that selection ? brown is not coming off the board anywhere close to as early as hurst . however , he was a blue-chip prospect coming out of high school , strangely signing with acc bottom-feeder virginia . ",
        "brown and safety quin blanding were key in helping the hoos turn their program around under head coach bronco mendenhall in 2017 . next : raiders : 5 offensive players to watch at senior bowlin four years at charlottesville , brown had 26.5 tackles for a loss of yardage and 10.5 quarterback sacks . brown is 6-foot-4 , 285 pounds , but could work in that atkins defensive tackle role in guenther 's defense . while hurst would be an ideal fit , brown could be in play as a third or fourth-round selection . defensive tackle geno atkins was the best player on paul guenther 's cincinnati bengals defense .
