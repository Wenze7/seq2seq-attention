        "washington -- short-lived white house communications director anthony scaramucci said americans would be `` surprised '' by president trump 's true view on climate change science , despite tweeting dismissive comments about global warming . `` i think you guys should ask him directly if he 's a climate change denier or not , '' scaramucci told cnn 's `` state of the union '' sunday . `` i think you will find you will be surprised by that answer . '' trump , who has previously called global warming a hoax , infuriated scientists by conflating cold weather with climate change in a tweet thursday on the chilly new year 's temps . ",
        "`` perhaps we could use a little bit of good old global warming that our country , but not other countries was going to pay trillions of dollars to protect against , '' trump quipped . `` bundle up ! '' scaramucci said the president 's tweet was directed at defending his policy move to pull out of the paris climate deal . asked whether trump agrees with scientists that climate change is a real , manmade problem , scaramucci demurred . `` i 'm not going to answer that for him . but , more specifically , i think what he 's really saying in that tweet is that that deal , the paris accord , there was something wrong in that deal as it related to the united states , '' scaramucci said , noting he talked to the president `` last monday . '' ",
        "trump announced june 1 he 'd cancel an obama administration deal to curb carbon emissions , believing the paris accord imposed an undue financial and economic burden on the united states . `` my prediction is , is that some time at the end of 2018 , people will look back at him and say , wow , he had a lot of common sense by getting out of that climate accord , '' scaramucci said . the new york financier quipped that his explosive 11-day tenure at the white house left a mark on america . `` they are calling my period in the white house a mooch . ",
        "it was 11 days . ... i became a verb . '' aside from learning to avoid a profanity-laced tirade to reporters , the mooch said he realized in the white house his so-called friends would n't protect him because they were `` intoxicated by power . '' `` i was actually hired , in my opinion , to help fire and uncover leakers and to remove people that were bad actors from the white house , '' scaramucci said . `` unfortunately , we learn in washington , the minute you are hired as a hatchet person , the knives get very , very long , and you get taken out as well . ",
        "scaramucci said he left a mark by making on-camera press briefings the norm because it 's important for the media to check people in power . `` i think we have to be very , very cautious with people that we give power to , because they can run amok and they can get overzealous with it , '' he said .
