        "washington -- in a major policy shift that could affect millions of low-income people , the trump administration said thursday it is offering a path for states that want to seek work requirements on medicaid recipients . seema verma , head of the centers for medicare and medicaid services , said work and community involvement can make a positive difference in people 's lives and in their health . still , the plan probably will face strong political opposition and even legal challenges over concerns people would lose coverage . medicaid is a federal-state collaboration covering more than 70 million people , or about 1 in 5 americans , and that makes it the largest government health insurance program . ",
        "it was expanded under president barack obama , with an option that has allowed states to cover millions more low-income adults ; many have jobs that do n't provide health insurance . people are not legally required to hold a job to be on medicaid , but states traditionally can seek federal waivers to test new ideas for the program . the administration 's latest action spells out safeguards that states should consider to obtain federal approval for waivers imposing work requirements on `` able-bodied '' adults . technically , those waivers would be `` demonstration projects . '' in practical terms , they would represent new requirements for beneficiaries in those states . ",
        "the administration said 10 states -- mostly conservative ones -- have applied for waivers involving work requirements or community involvement . they are : arizona , arkansas , indiana , kansas , kentucky , maine , new hampshire , north carolina , utah and wisconsin . advocates for low-income people say they expect kentucky 's waiver to be approved shortly . `` medicaid needs to be more flexible so that states can best address the needs of this population , '' verma said in a statement . `` our fundamental goal is to make a positive and lasting difference in the health and wellness of our beneficiaries . '' ",
        "for close to a year , the administration has signaled an interest in helping states that want to institute work requirements . advocates for low-income people said work has never been a requirement for medicaid , a program originally intended as a health program for the poor and disabled . it now covers a broad cross-section of people , from many newborns to elderly nursing home residents , and increasingly working adults . `` it is a very major change in medicaid that for the first time would allow people to be cut off for not meeting a work requirement , regardless of the hardship they may suffer , '' said judy solomon of the center on budget and policy priorities , which advocates for the poor . ",
        "the obama administration would have never approved such waivers , she added . a study from the nonpartisan kaiser family foundation found that a surprising number of working-age adults on medicaid are already employed . nearly 60 percent work either full time or part time , mainly for employers that do n't offer health insurance . most who are not working report reasons such as illness , caring for a family member or going to school . some medicaid recipients say the coverage has enabled them to get healthy enough to return to work . the debate about work requirements does n't break neatly along liberal-conservative lines . ",
        "kaiser polling last year found that 70 percent of the public support allowing states to impose work requirements on medicaid recipients , even as most people in the u. s. were against deep medicaid cuts sought by congressional republicans and the trump administration . thursday 's administration guidance to states spells out safeguards that states should consider in seeking work requirements . these include : -- exempting pregnant women , disabled people and the elderly . -- taking into account hardships for people in areas with high employment , or for people caring for children or elderly relatives . -- allowing people under treatment for substance abuse problems to have their care counted as `` community engagement '' for purposes of meeting a requirement . ",
        "the administration said states must fully comply with federal disability and civil rights laws , to accommodate disabled people and prevent those who are medically frail from being denied coverage . states should try to align their medicaid work requirements with similar conditions applying in other programs , such as food stamps . `` people who participate in activities that increase their education and training are more likely to find sustainable employment , have higher earnings , a better quality of life , and , studies have shown , improved health outcomes , '' verma said . solomon , the advocate for low-income people , said the federal government 's waiver authority does n't provide carte blanche to ignore the basic purposes of the program , and promoting work has not been on that list up to now . ",
        "`` there 's never been a work requirement in medicaid , it 's only been in recent years that states have raised the possibility of having one , '' she said . `` medicaid is a health program that is supposed to serve people who do n't otherwise have coverage .
