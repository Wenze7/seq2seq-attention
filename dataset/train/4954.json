        "at dwarika 's resort , a holistic wellness retreat in nepal 's eastern kathmandu valley , i sat in a wooden library across from famed astrologer santosh vashistha , a distinguished 42-year-old in a plaid sport coat with remnants of festive red tika adorning his forehead . his piercing eyes are almost as captivating as the view of the distant himalayas through the wide picture window behind him . suddenly his phone rang , but after a glance , he hit mute . nepal 's finance minister gyanendra bahadur karki was calling for advice . with nepal on the precipice of becoming a major hydroelectric energy powerhouse , this has n't been an unusual occurrence ; vashistha predicted that any conversation with karki would be a long one and decided to focus on my own financial destiny instead . ",
        "though he hails from a little-known town in southeastern nepal called jhapa , vashistha has gained international recognition for his ability to read the stars . in 2017 , he was named the best astrologer in asia by the asian astrologer congress and the world astrology federation . his readings focus more on substantive geopolitical predictions and personal fortunes than hokey horoscope drivel , and his regular clients include nepal 's prime minister sher bahadur deuba , bollywood actress manisha koirala , and american celebrities whose names he would n't reveal . all of them treat his readings as gospel , so seldom is he wrong . ",
        "dwarika 's resort dhulikhel , a holistic lifestyle retreat in nepal 's eastern kathmandu valley . photographer : viran de silva / is among the latest in a long string of high-profile prognosticators to work in the financial world : though the practice has ancient roots , it truly took off during the scientific revolution and has guided certain fiscal luminaries ever since . w. d. gann , a financial astrologer born in texas in 1875 , became a legendary trader ; even j. p. morgan and charles schwab consulted astrologers , notably evangeline adams , throughout the early 20th century . ",
        "`` millionaires do n't need astrology -- billionaires do , '' morgan supposedly quipped . at dwarika 's resort , sessions with vashistha are sold to guests for $ 125 an hour , and are billed as another cultural experience to collect -- like a chakra meditation or ayurvedic consultation . but even for those who are inclined to take his predictions with a grain of salt , it 's a transformative adventure . where finance and fortune-telling collidea waterfall in the annapurna conservation area of nepal , less than an hour 's drive from dwarika 's resort dhulikhel . ",
        "photographer : anton jankovoy/moment rfvashistha 's technique is simple . working through a translator named anup , i gave him my place of birth and the date and time before he put the information into a nepali app called skyvision to see what was happening in the skies at that moment . then he mapped the planetary configurations on paper , forming a grid-like schema that represented various areas of my destiny : health , wealth , love , and longevity . being a renowned astrologer is a bit like being a chess grandmaster : lesser practitioners know how the pieces move , but virtuosos see the interconnectedness of each piece in solving the larger puzzle . ",
        "that 's to say that most astrologers can read natal charts and tick off a laundry list of future possibilities based on a set of rote rules related to planetary positioning , but vashistha incorporates peerless astrology knowledge gained in formal academic training and experience with thousands of clients : he got his master 's in astrology at banaras hindu university in varanasi , india , and a ph. d. in raja yoga , a part of hindu astrology focused on planetary situations that indicate wealth and power . he sees the whole board , as it were . it 's difficult to quantify vashistha 's -- or any astrologer 's -- success rate since they do n't necessarily get client feedback on how predictions pan out . ",
        "but that has n't prevented skilled financial advisors and money managers from seeing the practice as a way to apply big-picture logic to unpredictable markets . especially in a secular bull market that some argue is overbought , investors are eager to integrate any data that may help them protect their money by foretelling a correction , even if the information has celestial origins . `` the stock market moves in a seasonal cycle that is derived from a calendar that is computed from the orbits of the earth and the sun , '' said bill sarubbi , who uses astrology in his market forecasts as president of predictive analytics-focused cycles research investments , llc . ",
        "`` by adding other relevant cycles such as that of the planet mars , one will increase their odds of success in market predictions . '' when to try it starry skies over sagarmatha national park in eastern nepal . photographer : weerakarn satitniramai/moment rfthere are examples of it working . `` astrology is one of the finest market-timing tools available in pinpointing dates of tradable market highs or lows , '' said raymond merriman , author of the series ultimate book on stock market timing : geocosmic correlations to investment cycles , and president of merriman market analyst inc. . ",
        "it works best for traders looking to enter and exit positions within three days to six months , not long-term investors , he said -- that 's because planetary relationships , known as aspects , are more accurate in the short term . in may 2008 , when crude oil had broken through $ 100 a barrel , merriman astrologically predicted -- on the record -- that it would top out at $ 144 before plummeting within two years . then he said it would decline , somewhere between 77 percent and 93 percent . -rrb- . goldman sachs group inc. , by contrast , thought crude could hit $ 200 a barrel , and traditional energy economists at deutsche bank ag were stupefied by the confusing market dynamics . ",
        "sure enough , crude hit $ 147.27 on july 11 , 2008 and slid to $ 32.48 five months later . grace k. morris , a professional astrologer and president of astro economics inc. , similarly boasted that during the great recession , she accurately predicted that the market would bottom out on march 9 , 2009 . traditional economists such as nouriel `` dr. doom '' roubini , meanwhile , struggled to pinpoint a specific date when the market would turn ; goldman 's abby joseph cohen insisted it would soon rally , long after 2008 had become a flaming dumpster fire . ",
        "doubters and haters are only hurting themselves , morris said : `` my clients are pragmatic -- if it works , they use it . '' but financial astrology is hardly foolproof . in one prominent prediction flop , london-based financial astrologer christeen skinner surmised that hillary clinton would definitely win the 2016 u. s. election , but would be too bogged down by influenza to attend her own inauguration . vashistha 's reading an outdoor living room at dwarika 's resort dhulikhel , where you can experience a reading by vashistha . photographer : viran de silva / across the table from vashistha , i had no real idea of what to expect . ",
        "being far from home , in nepal , allowed me a certain openness to cosmic determination -- something i 'd normally greet with suspicion . i exhaled , and vashistha started to deliver my financial destiny . as he sat in a chair across from me , the experience felt a bit like visiting with my shrink : yet , instead of unpacking my past with care , he gently entered into dialogue about my future . he consulted with his tablet and the chart he drew , but mostly he looked directly at me to make his statements . ",
        "in his first proclamation , he determined that my wife and i will have a lasting marriage and will have twins in the next three years . better start contributing to some 529 plans , i thought to myself . then the guru put my worries to rest : i 'm destined for at least a modest amount of wealth in the near future , he said , referring to my impressive , `` five star '' measure of planetary energy and power . the number correlates to good fortune , said vashistha ; by contrast , prime minister deuba has only four stars , but donald trump has six , a bounty mohandas gandhi also had . ",
        "santosh vashistha at work . photographer : ross kenneth urkennot every prediction was positive . he said i 'll die at 87 -- when i 'm expected to drop dead suddenly while on a walk . in other words , i 'd better notch up my ira contributions to remain solvent in my longevity , and nix the long-term care insurance . i also have to be a little extra-careful to avoid some kind of danger , perhaps an accident or a health complication , when i am 51 years old . in terms of big financial decisions -- such as when to submit a book i 'm trying to sell and when to make investments -- he said i should take action only on two particular days of the week . ",
        "heavenly bodies in astrology are assigned an affinity for certain days , and according to my birth chart , i have a strong moon arrangement and a powerful jupiter connection . vashistha offered one caveat to his predictions . the courses of the heavens are ever-changing , he said , and i 'm in control of my life 's outcomes through my own volition . i ca n't sit back and wait for riches to come my way , even if the universe conspires to assure my success . was this a cop-out in case he was wrong ? maybe . ",
        "but vashistha had more important things to do than debate that point with me . he had already put off finance minister karki long enough .   "
