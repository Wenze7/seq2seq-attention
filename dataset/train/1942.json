        "actress debra messing is still puzzled about the benefits of painting on a horse after she was let loose on a stallion with a kindergarten art set during a recent wellness retreat . the will and grace star recently spent time at the miraval resort and spa in arizona and admits it was a great trip - but she still ca n't understand why she had to paint a horse . `` i decided , ` well i 've been working hard and around a lot of people and lots of noise ... i 'm just going to go by myself for a couple days ' , '' she said during an appearance on live ! ",
        "with kelly and ryan on thursday . `` it was incredible , you have to go on a trip by yourself . '' `` besides going on hikes and spa stuff , they also have these amazing wellness , meditation things , '' she continued . `` one of them is an equine therapy , where you paint on a horse . they get the non-toxic paint from kindergarten and you paint ... '' messing explains the exercise is designed to teach people how to be in tune with themselves and others . `` i was like , ` well , why are we doing this , because i 've never heard of it , ' and they said , ` horses are really special , they are so sensitive and they respond and let you know immediately if they are uncomfortable and it 's really about being tune with people and energies around you ' , '' she explained . ",
        "`` being mindful like , ` is he happy , is he ok ? ' then you just start painting like you 're a kindergartner ... and then they come and analyze you . `` they 're like , ` ok , we 're talking about living in the moment so you have to erase it all . you have to wash your horse because nothing is permanent ... ' '' the 49-year-old also faced her fear of heights during the retreat . `` i also climbed a 30-foot pole and i 'm afraid of heights , '' she said . "
