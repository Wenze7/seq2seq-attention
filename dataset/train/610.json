        "men 's romantic vows may be short-lived , but a pet 's love is forever . this is one of many zen takeaways in chen kaige 's `` legend of the demon cat , '' a visually and mentally seductive piece of historic revisionism set in the tang dynasty , during which a japanese monk and chinese poet team up to investigate the death of imperial concubine yang guifei . a massive international co-production between china , japan and hong kong , this stunning blockbuster shows that a superior original source , vaunting artistic ambition and a $ 170 million budget can turn a potboiler supernatural whodunit into something of ravishing beauty . ",
        "with chen 's auteur imprint barely noticeable and ang lee 's favored scriptwriter huang huiling providing a narrative throughline with a strong literary foundation , this looks less like a vanity project than some of the director 's more uneven endeavors . co-produced by filmmaking and publishing giant kadokawa , with a big name japanese cast , this screen adaptation of bestselling author baku yumemakura 's novel could create buzz similar to john woo 's `` red cliff . '' it may be the first time in years that a japanese is the hero and central figure of a mainland film . ",
        "film review : ` blame ' in the four-volume novel `` shamon kukai tou no kuni ni te oni to utagesu , '' rumored to be the most expensive book option ever paid for a chinese production , the prolific sci-fi and historical fantasy author playfully reinvents two canonized historical figures : kukai and bai juyi . the former , aka kobo-daishi , founded the shingonshu school of buddhism in the heian period ; the latter was one of the greatest chinese poets ever . kukai , a japanese monk who came to the tang capital chang ' an to study an esoteric tantra , is summoned to the court of emperor xuanzong , who is possessed . ",
        "the self-proclaimed exorcist discovers tufts of feline hair in xuanzong 's chamber . palace official bai letian , aka juyi , mentions the rumor of a talking , fish-eye-eating cat in the household of yunqiao , captain of the royal guards . they follow some leads to a bordello , a location that allows chen to indulge in an opulent display of beautiful women , especially one performing a rapturous uighur dance , before the demon cat appears with a sinister flourish . the director evokes the tang dynasty 's sexually open environment via a `` nichang yuyi '' dance , performed with feverish sensuality by yunqiao 's wife chunqin under demonic possession . ",
        "both the levels of eroticism and gore are refreshingly rare by tame mainland standards . in creating the image of a cat with a murderous grudge , yumenaka may be influenced by the 1968 gothic horror `` kuroneko '' by kaneto shindo , which is itself a claw-back to edgar allen poe 's `` the black cat . '' amid an ever-present ghoulish vibe , the enigmatic plot keeps audiences wondering if the cat really has supernatural powers , or whether it 's a decoy for some human conspiracy . recurring encounters with a melon vendor with magic tricks up his sleeve paves the way for more dazzling , and more dangerous illusionist gambits . ",
        "the film also revolves around bai 's creative process as an aspiring poet and how he reconciles truth with artistic license . his magnum opus , `` chang hen ge '' , on the life of yang guifei , points the way to resolving the film 's puzzles . more clues from a deceased japanese courtier abe no nakamaro finally transport audiences to 30 years ago -- specifically , to yang 's birthday bash , called banquet of ultimate bliss , a national event symbolizing xuanzong 's love and the glory of the empire . the spectacular entry of yang , withheld till well over halfway , pushes the sensory splendor of the film to such a satiating height , it 's as if a giant balloon is ready to burst at any moment . ",
        "yang 's traditional image as a helen of troy-like figure is rewritten to make her a champion of equality , artistic freedom and love . the foreboding that her life and the great civilization she embodies has peaked and is poised for decline echoes the historic perspective of such epic films as alejandro amen√°bar 's `` agora . '' the narrative goes through a lot more twists before reaching its denouement , which requires a considerable suspension of disbelief . by then , the story 's veered wildly from the source , the recurring illusionist motif connects with another theme -- that of cheating and betrayal , culminating in the protagonists ' realization that the pursuit of love , dynastic greatness or immortality is futile , whereas enlightenment means accepting that life is an illusion . ",
        "lead actors sometani and huang are both charming enough even if their emotional struggles are superficially depicted . sometani , whose bright eyes are accentuated by his bald head , imparts a sage , unworldly presence . half-french , half-taiwanese pinna is an unconventional choice to play the legendary beauty , whom the film describes as `` having turkic blood . '' visual effects completed in japan are precise with static images , but cgi of the cat often looks fake , and it 's glaringly obvious that several live cats have been cast to play a single one as their sizes and features vary . ",
        "in imax , cao yu 's cinematography achieves a monumental dimension , though the editing is slightly jittery and blurry , especially in scenes of shape-shifting . in contrast to the meticulous authenticity and period-enhancing glow in the decor and lighting of hou hsiao-hsien 's tang dynasty-set `` the assassin , '' production design by tu nan and lu wei luxuriate in elements of fantasy . not only does the reported $ 200 million sound stage deliver in terms of architectural grandeur , but attention to detail is apparent in every prop , from the intricate patterns on a storage chest to giant carp lanterns that echo the film 's cat-and-fish motif . ",
        "costumes are divine , despite their lack of cleavage , an inaccuracy complying to prim film bureau standards .   "
