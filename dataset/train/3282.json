        "las vegas -- it 's gotten pretty easy to upgrade most gaming pcs with new components over time , but when it comes to the external case , you 're pretty much stuck with what you bought . ibuypower 's project case builder could change all of that . project case builder essentially makes the desktop modular , allowing gamers to swap out panels , storage bays , feet and other parts in order to keep their case design fresh and personalized for years . at ces 2018 , i saw an exploded-skeleton prototype designed to show off just how many different pieces can pop in and out of the chassis . ",
        "i also got a look at what a final case builder configuration could look like , complete with a sleek silver front panel , a clear side panel , a whole bunch of internal rgb lighting and all of the other flourishes you 'd expect from an ibuypower desktop . ibuypower is still working out what types of case upgrades will be available , but the company did point out that its innovative snowblind lcd panel will be an option . according to ibuypower , the types of panels and upgrades that will be available will largely be influenced by what customers , pro gamers and influencers ask for . ",
        "project case builder seems like it has a lot of potential . it 's easy to imagine a world where , say , you order a new front panel for your pc that features your favorite esports team , or upgrade to a see-through side panel that lets you finally show your fancy new graphics card off . if the company has its way , accessorizing your pc 's look and feel will become as simple as tossing on a new t-shirt . there 's currently no set starting price or release date for case builder , but ibuypower is hoping to make it available sometime in q2 2018 .
