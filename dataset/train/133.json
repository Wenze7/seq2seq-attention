        "boris johnson is reportedly set to demand £ 100 million extra a week for the nhs after brexit . the foreign secretary made clear last week he thinks the health service should be `` at the very top of the list '' when the uk `` takes back control '' of money which is currently being sent to brussels . britain is expected to keep paying into the eu budget until the end of a post-brexit transition period in around 2021 , and mr johnson has insisted the government will save hundreds of millions of pounds afterwards . he is set to use tuesday 's cabinet meeting , when health secretary jeremy hunt will update ministers on the nhs winter crisis , to demand around £ 5 billion a year extra for the health service , it is understood . ",
        "mr johnson was rebuked last week after he said the leave campaign underestimated when it claimed brexit would allow an extra £ 350 million to be spent on the nhs weekly . leading health expert professor sir michael marmot said the brexit campaign 's highly controversial claim has already been confirmed `` a lie '' . britain could secure ` a bespoke trade deal ' after brexit , macron says chancellor philip hammond used his autumn budget to commit £ 2.8 billion extra to the nhs in england . but the foreign secretary 's move comes as tories complain about a lack of boldness from theresa may 's government amid the electoral threat of jeremy corbyn 's radical labour .

        "sir nicholas soames is the latest tory backbencher to voice unease about the style of the prime minister 's administration , after former minister nick boles warned of `` timidity and lack of ambition '' . using one of the extended hashtags which have become his social media trademark , sir nicholas asked : `` where 's the bold and brave ? so far , it 's dull , dull , dull . '' `` it really wo n't be enough to get people to vote against the corbini , '' warned sir nicholas . `` they must have really sound reasons to vote conservative . ",
        "we really need to get on with this . #wherestheboldandbravesofaritsdulldulldull . `` sir nicholas 's comments came just days after mr boles warned the pm it was `` time to raise your game '' and claimed her government `` constantly disappoints '' . asked about the concerns expressed by mr boles and sir nicholas , mrs may 's official spokesman said on monday : `` if you look at action taken by the government in recent months , you can see it is getting on with the job of building a stronger economy and a fairer society that works for everyone . ",
        "`` he cited cuts in stamp duty for first-time buyers , the launch of a 25-year environment plan and an industrial strategy , plans for an energy price cap , the recently published race disparity audit and the injection of money into health , social care and schools . `` of course , we know there is more to do and the prime minister is committed to getting on and delivering .
