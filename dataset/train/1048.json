        "washington - us regulators are gearing up for a vote on a plan which -- depending on your viewpoint -- would `` restore internet freedom '' or , alternatively , result in `` the death of the internet '' as we know it . the federal communications commission will consider a rollback of its 2015 order aimed at enforcing `` net neutrality , '' or the notion of treating all data and content providers equally . fcc chairman ajit pai last month unveiled the plan , the latest twist in a dispute over more than a decade , with both sides claiming to promote a `` free and open '' internet . ",
        "the plan , widely expected to be approved on a 3-2 party-line vote thursday , would reverse the rules adopted two years earlier which ban broadband providers from blocking or throttling rivals , or using `` fast '' and `` slow '' lanes for different services . pai , named chairman by president donald trump , said the 2015 rules `` depress investment and innovation . '' critics of the existing rules say they rely on 1930s-era rules for telephone companies , which could in theory lead to price regulation and other burdens . but net neutrality backers argue that the rollback will enable internet service providers to shut out rivals that compete with their services or those of partners . ",
        "they point out that some isps in the past have tried to force users to their own search engines , or block online calling services such as skype or vonage , or require a premium for apple 's facetime video calling . the pai proposal `` will lead to a dramatic transformation of how the internet works , '' said sarah morris , who heads the new america foundation 's open policy institute . `` internet service providers as gatekeepers have a lot of incentives to engage in shenanigans . the threats to our ability to navigate the internet and go to every corner of it are at risk '' if the pai plan is adopted , she told a conference on tuesday . ",
        "- pillow in the face ? - new york times columnist farhad manjoo wrote that `` the freewheeling internet has been dying a slow death '' and that the fcc actions `` would be the final pillow in its face . `` senior executive vice president bob quinn of at&t , one of the large broadband firms which has lobbied and sued to block earlier fcc regulatory efforts , said apocalyptic predictions are wrong . `` at&t intends to operate its network the same way at&t operates its network today : in an open and transparent manner , '' quinn said in a blog post last month . ",
        "michael powell , head of the trade group for major broadband firms ncta - the internet & television association , said member companies have agreed to respect principles to `` satisfy their customers ' desire to visit any lawful website or run any lawful application . `` but some are not mollified by these assurances , arguing that broadband is largely controlled by a handful of firms -- including at&t , verizon and comcast -- with little competition or consumer choice in many markets . `` why would they spend millions of dollars lobbying if they are going to treat everybody equally and not extract monopoly rents ? '' ",
        "asked ed black , president of the computer & communications industry association , which represents major tech firms . `` if they are allowed to build superfast lanes , they would cease to invest in the other lanes . it means everybody else is going to be left on the equivalent of dirt roads . `` the question of `` paid prioritization , '' whether broadband firms can charge more for improved access , has been among the most hotly debated . critics say broadband firms would be able to extort higher fees and limit access for new startups if the proposal is adopted . ",
        "but university of california economist michael katz argues this is a basic business principal at work . `` the logic of net neutrality would also argue for banning e-commerce sites from purchasing faster delivery from fedex or ups , or from offering free shipping , '' katz said in a research paper . the net neutrality battle has been the subject of a series of court challenges over the past decade , and more litigation is likely unless congress establishes clear guidelines . - google , netflix , russian bots - large tech firms like google , facebook and netflix oppose the fcc draft rules , arguing that isps could effectively cut off or limit user access to some services . ",
        "but with political and public sentiment shifting against silicon valley in recent months , pai has turned the tables by blaming the large tech platforms for limiting consumer choice . `` these providers routinely block or discriminate against content they do n't like , '' pai told a recent conference . pai said his plan would `` restore a light-touch '' regulatory approach , while arguing that `` some have tried to whip americans into a frenzy by making outlandish claims . `` still , the fcc actions have sparked protests around the country , and some 21 million comments in its online system . ",
        "but the comment system was tainted by what appeared to be `` bots , '' possibly from russia , repeating similar messages . `` the fcc is on course to eliminate net neutrality guided by a record corrupted by hundreds of thousands of filings with stolen identities close to half a million comments from russian e-mail addresses , '' said fcc commissioner jessica rosenworcel , who opposes the pai plain . `` no vote should take place until a responsible investigation is complete . `` an fcc spokesman said the vote `` will proceed as scheduled on december 14 .
