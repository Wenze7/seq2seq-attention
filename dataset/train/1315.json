        "april 9 , 2017i 'm in tokyo , japan on a tourist visa run from south korea . by a stroke of good luck , entrepreneur and darn great person danny choo has a presentation at a local mall . in the back of my mind , i thought he was supposed to be in houston , texas for a convention . he explained why he was n't there . shaun , i took your advice and decided to not go , he told me . seven months prior , i gave danny a heads up about that convention . ",
        "the people in charge were known for shady business practices and i had to warn danny . even earlier that year , i was given a strong rumor that a famous dance group from south korea were denied entry to the usa due to an `` error '' made by the same convention organizers . apparently , they 're now banned from the usa for 10 years . i take blame for that because i had a chance to warn the group about the convention organizers recent shady dealings . i did n't want the same thing to happen to danny . ",
        "had he not taken the time to talk to me that day , his fans in the united states probably would not have been able to see him again for a number of years . thankfully , danny has enough business and street smarts to know when something is n't right . danny is here showing off his newest smart doll . this particular doll is a commission from a major anime company named sunrise . they asked danny to design a doll from one of their franchises called code geass and this event was the debut . looking at this , you can see shades of his dad in terms of his design and there was a lot of hard work put into this ! ",
        "but we 're not here to talk about dolls . we 're here to talk about rejection ! sometime in august of this year , i came up with an idea . since i was working with my business partner jason , i came up with the idea to see if we could collaborate with danny by making culture japan-themed socks ! great idea , right ? jason and i spent about an hour coming up with a proposal to see about working together . everything on paper looked fantastic and we were excited to present it to him . ",
        "i e-mailed danny the proposal . a few hours went by and i got this message on twitter : not really interested sorry . i was crushed . i was hoping this would be the thing that could finally get me out of my slump . i was rejected many times prior to that and he flat out said no . i tried to make a compromise with him but he really did n't want to . in my mind , i felt disrespected . how could he not be interested ? did n't i help him save his company from working with horrible people ? ",
        "! how dare he ! a month went by and i finally cooled down . i made it back to texas and was recovering mentally and physically . after another mental break down , my mom gave me a box of joyce meyer audio cds . joyce is a mega pastor with a lot of great wisdom and mom gave me one of her series called `` the root of rejection '' . the first cd was called `` rejection protection '' and the key thing i learned was in order to be set free , we have to let god withdraw our props . ",
        "this was profound because my computer died a month prior . my computer and my addiction to wanting to constantly work distracted me from strengthening my mind and my relationship with god . my intent to work with danny was to get me out of a financial and professional slump . i could n't get a job as a teacher and i could n't get a job in video/media production . if i wanted to move ahead in my life , i would have to get over being rejected and learn the basics of interacting with people out of love and not obligation . ",
        "my m. o. was to use manipulation for personal gain . i figured since i helped danny out , i expected him to return the favor . it did n't happen the way i expected it to and my immaturity plus the root of my rejection kept me from what i hoping to be my manifestation . danny was in no obligation to help out . what i did was beneficial but i was trying to get something in return for doing so and that was very selfish of me . i deserved not a darn thing for doing something out of the goodness of my heart . ",
        "life does not work that way . as the days went by , i completed that series and later thanked danny for rejecting me . i was n't ready to work with him . i also was n't ready to accept being rejected . had my mom not given me those audio cds , i would still be mad at danny today . all in all , this particular rejection saved me from making the same mistakes as i get older . i feel much better knowing i can improve and be stronger . danny is a man of character and i honestly believe some of what makes him who he is rubbed off on me . ",
        "thank you danny and be blessed ! thank you all for reading ! peace and love ! shaunlelouch lamperouge small doll danny choo with one of his smart dolls .   "
