        "hello reader , at this time i want to convey and explain about what is arcblock ? ? and what is the secret behind the success of arcblock during this ? ? let us refer to below . = info about arcblock = arcblock -- the world 's first blockchain ecosystem for distributed applications is building the foundation for blockchain 3.0 . arcblock is a platform and system for building and running decentralized blockchain applications . stage goes through important segments that are expected to utilize blockchain to strengthen complex business rules . it connects the existing framework with the blockchain system , empowers you to computerize business forms by utilizing information and personalities related to the existing framework . ",
        "the arcblock project was created to create the world 's first clockchain ecosystem . development and development of targeted distributed applications . platforms and ecosystems to build and implement decentralized blockchain applications . this platform in addition provides the basic components needed to use blockchain to strengthen complex business rules . it connects existing systems with blockchain networks , enabling you to automate business processes using data and identities associated with existing systems . arcblock 's main goal is to remove a barrier that has slowed the adoption of blockchain among the general public . we are also excited to develop a unique approach that will significantly drive the development of blockchain . ",
        "arcblock solves this problem through its revolutionary new design . unlike its predecessor , arcblock is a platform service , not a standalone software package or a set of apis . arcblock is a comprehensive solution that combines blockchain technology with cloud computing . arcblock is an incentive-based market for services , components , and even reusable applications . `` miners '' on arcblock platforms not only bring computing resources , more than that helps build platforms together by providing reusable components , new services , and even ready to deploy applications . people who donate resources or services will be rewarded with tokens to form a growing , positive and self-sustaining platform that continues to grow by itself . ",
        "arcblock platform service is not our own creation . it was developed by the entire arcblock community -- we just started a new blockchain revolution . = all arcblock = building and running a decentralized blockchain application with arcblock has a very important situation regarding the currently available systems available . = objective arcblock = arcblock 's fundamental goal is to repel blockages that have moderated blockchain acceptance among the entire population . we also want to build an approach that will at all encourage increased blockchain . = arcblock benefits = driving growth , archblock fully embraces the token economy .
