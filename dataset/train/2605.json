        "pep guardiola has suggested english football needs to act to protect players after a thrilling goalless draw at crystal palace was marred by some heavy challenges , most notably a tackle from jason puncheon on kevin de bruyne that resulted in the premier league 's outstanding player this season being taken off on a stretcher . de bruyne may have been fortunate to escape serious injury , with suggestions he might miss only the home game against watford on tuesday night , but the manchester city manager emphasised his issue is not with english football 's physicality but its policing of contact . ",
        "`` i admire the physicality of the league , but they know exactly what they have to do , '' guardiola said . `` people focus on diving and this kind of thing , and that 's ok . `` but the contact is more allowed here than other countries , and that 's ok too , but there are limits . we were lucky against tottenham and against newcastle and today we saw what happened . `` they do n't have to change the way they play here -- that 's why it is so nice , they play in different ways in different countries . ",
        "but there is a line and when you go beyond that it can be dangerous . the referee has to follow the rules but also protect the players . `` the football is quicker and the action is great , the players do n't want to hurt each other but there are moments , and then players can be out for a long time . '' guardiola confirmed gabriel jesus is out for at least a month with a knee injury he sustained early in the first half , and which reduced the brazilian to tears , but said that did not mean city would make a move for alexis sánchez in january having come close to signing the arsenal forward during the summer . ",
        "`` no , he is a player from arsenal and i think he is going to stay there , '' said the catalan . `` now it 's just about recovering from injuries and in two days we have another game . we will discuss what is the best in internal meeting but my feeling now is sánchez will remain an arsenal player . '' guardiola also batted away suggestions city could go unbeaten for the rest of the season having seen their winning run come to an end . `` we had an 18-match run , that is not normal , it 's unreal . ",
        "i swear to you , that is not going to happen . i 'm not thinking about being invincible . i told arsène , that brand is for him . '' roy hodgson was quietly satisfied with palace 's performance and refused to dwell on luka milivojevic 's missed penalty in the closing stages . `` it 's frustrating but it was a good save . it 's better to concentrate on our performance and how well we played , '' the manager said . `` i have to give the players an enormous pat on the back for how they played . ",
        "to be brutally honest with five minutes to go i was thinking make sure we do n't lose the game . '' hodgson also had words of praise for wilfried zaha 's performance on both wings , which featured a fine and engrossing duel with kyle walker in the first half before zaha switched to the right for a while : `` kyle is very fast so there was an element of them neutralising each other . we thought it was an idea to switch him over but it was n't exactly a masterstroke . it was the kind of tactical decision my wife would make . ",
        "`` wilf was very good . he puts in one excellent performance after another and the question for me with a bit of cynicism given how long i 've been involved in the game is how long he can keep it going ? it amazes me . i hope he can keep going . '' hodgson refused to reveal what he had said to guardiola when they sat in the same dugout for a short period while de bruyne and puncheon received treatment following their collision . the palace player was also taken off on a stretcher and was somewhat fortunate to be shown only a yellow card by the referee , jonathan moss . ",
        "`` we have mutual respect for each other . we talked about the game and what we thought about the season , '' said hodgson about his conversation with guardiola . `` we do n't often get that chance to talk after the game because we 're busy speaking to you lot .
