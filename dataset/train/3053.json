        "jan 13 -- northampton gained a surprise 2-1 win at league one play-off contenders bradford , condemning the bantams to their seventh home league defeat of the season . bradford had the ball in the net after 37 minutes when keeper richard o'donnell failed to hold paul taylor 's fiercely-driven free-kick from outside the box . defender matt kilgallon turned the loose ball into the net , but was ruled offside . northampton took advantage of this let-off six minutes later when john-joe o'toole broke free to score with a close-range header from matt grimes ' corner to give the visitors a 1-0 half-time lead . ",
        "northampton , who remain in the relegation zone on goal difference , went further ahead in the 62nd minute when chris long benefited from hesitancy in the home defence to score with a shot just inside the near post . the home side pulled a goal back in stoppage time , a superb 25-yard shot from taylor following a quickly-taken free-kick , but it was not enough to prevent the cobblers from picking up a deserved win .
