        "meet ring capital , a brand new vc firm based in paris . the firm just raised a new $ 170 million fund and might still be raising another $ 10 million or so for this fund . many new vc firms tend to focus on seed rounds at first . ring capital thinks there 's a series a and series b gap in france . that 's why ring capital plans to invest around € 5 to € 10 million in each company -- sometimes a bit more , sometimes a bit less . ring capital has already invested in one company and plans to invest in around 15 companies using this fund . ",
        "of course , there might be more funds down the road . `` we 've been investing in tech startups for 15 years , '' nicolas celier told me . `` when growth picks up , that 's when you need to sell the company because you 're already thinking about the next fund . `` ring capital wants to reverse this trend and invest a bit later . the fund even says that it is willing to buy back some shares to partially cash out founders , early employees and early investors . celier says that many private equity firms are looking at tech startups because it 's a big opportunity right now . ",
        "but that does n't necessarily mean that private equity firms have the technical knowledge to bet on winners . from day one , ring capital has put together a team of investors who do n't share the same background and can provide additional value . geoffroy bragadir was both an investor and an entrepreneur . nicolas celier is a venture capitalist at heart . alban de la breteche has a technical background and worked on research and development projects at criteo . marie-capucine lemétais was head of marketing western europe for the danish fintech saxo bank . nicolas bailly worked with bragadir as an analyst . ",
        "thomas marsal worked on data operations for stuart . hagera sendabad was operations manager at mention . `` beyond the technical background of the team , when you 're in the tech industry , you can see that most companies that gain long-term value have technological assets , '' bragadir told me . `` we think we have an ability to understand complex tech challenges . we can leverage that and foster those technological assets . `` limited partners include bpifrance through the `` programme d'investissements d'avenir '' , ag2r la mondiale , bred , danone and tikehau capital . ",
        "around 75 business angels , such as morgane sézalory , hugues le bret , thierry petit , also invested in ring capital and are willing to help portfolio companies with introductions and advice . many of those mentors were ctos or engineers . the firm tried to invite as many technical people as possible , even if they could only invest a limited amount of money in the fund . so it 's clear that ring capital is going to be looking at tech startups with a strong tech product .
