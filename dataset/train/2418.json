        "when you watch videos on your smartphone , you do n't expect it to have the same quality as when you 're watching on a full-scale smart tv . the closest that you will probably get to that experience is something that the razer phone is trying to give to you , as they announced that they are now bringing netflix to you in both hdr and dolby digital plus 5.1 , the first smartphone to bring premium audio and video formats from the video streaming service to your hands . the razer phone , created by a lifestyle brand for gamers , comes with an hdr10-enabled display as well as front-facing dual dolby-optimized speakers , and if you prefer to use headphones with it , it also supports thx connectivity . ",
        "so why not take advantage of all that and bring netflix to your mobile device in a way that other smartphones ca n't give to you ? this is n't just a boon for netflix but also for the smartphone brand , which normally targets gamers but can also now entice entertainment addicts . it is actually also the first smartphone to support dolby digital plus 5.1 since it normally comes to high-end entertainment systems . you get five full-bandwidth channels and one low-frequency effects channel -lrb- the `` point one '' in the 5.1 , a standard that is also used in the surround sound of digital broadcast and music . ",
        "and you will have all that on your razer phone when you watch netflix shows and movies . those who already have their razer phones will receive an over-the-air update later this month to give them firmware improvements and such , as well as the app itself if you did n't have it yet . however , you will have to be subscribed to the premium plan to be able to enjoy hdr titles . also , not all of the shows and movies on netflix are on hdr just yet .
