        "prince edward island external links latest ice conditions the icebreaking season is off to an earlier start than last year in the gulf region , including the waters around prince edward island . the frigid temperatures in recent weeks have accelerated the growth of ice around most of p. e.i. , with the exception of the eastern part of kings county . `` looking at last year , there was very little ice in the gulf at all , only a little bit of ice in the bays and harbours , '' said trevor hodgson , icebreaking superintendent for coast guard atlantic region , based in st. john 's . ",
        "`` this year we 've actually seen it grow in a more normal trend so it 's filled up the northumberland strait and other bays like miramichi and bay of chaleur are starting to fill up with ice as well . '' hodgson said ice that is just starting to form is more fragile and easier to break . `` if you look at the ice charts , it looks like there 's lots of ice there but a lot of it 's a little softer than it otherwise would appear , '' he said . arctic icebreakers en route there are two icebreakers assisting marine traffic in the gulf , with at least two more expected to soon join them to help keep shipping lanes open . ",
        "hodgson said arctic icebreakers are being put into service in the region over the next couple of weeks . `` the thickness of the ice plays on the time it takes to do the escorts , '' hodgson said . `` as the season picks up , as ice gets thicker and traffic picks up , we 'll have to prioritize more which ships we 're doing and time it properly to make sure we can serve the most people at the best times . '' the ice situation could also change , he said , with the weather system currently powering its way toward the atlantic region . ",
        "`` with the storm coming across the gulf of st. lawrence , we 're expecting the waves to break up a lot of that ice , '' hodgson said . `` so we 're going to be looking at a much different picture probably by the end of the weekend . '' aerial images the coast guard posts weekly updates on the ice conditions , every wednesday , with information gathered through an aerial reconnaissance team , the ships and satellite imagery . `` we also have a coast guard helicopter based in charlottetown and saint john that can fly over as required , '' hodgson said . ",
        "despite the extreme conditions that the crews will be working in , hodgson says they 're ready for whatever the winter of 2018 may bring . `` this is what we 're waiting the rest of the year for , so it 's good to see it 's starting to progress .
