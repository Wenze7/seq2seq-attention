        "the left-wing minister was ambushed in her office by trade unionistsangry trade unionists in greece stormed the labour ministry and confronted the minister over plans to tighten the rules on strikes . about 500 protesters from communist-affiliated pame burst into the ministry after breaking open metal shutters with crowbars , reuters news agency reported . they shouted `` shame on you ! '' and `` take it back ! '' at the left-wing minister , effie achtsioglou . curbs on strikes are among conditions set for greece to exit its bailout . the left-wing government of prime minister alexis tsipras has submitted a huge bill to parliament aimed at satisfying eurozone creditors , who have demanded tough austerity in exchange for continuing loans to greece . ",
        "among the proposed reforms is a rule requiring unions to get a yes vote from at least half of their members before triggering a strike . currently the approval of one-third of members is required . in the tense confrontation on tuesday , the trade unionists called on the labour minister to withdraw the legislation . but ms achtsioglou replied : `` i will not take it back . `` the protesters chanted `` we wo n't yield to plutocracy ! `` the tsipras government wants to avoid another bailout programme after the current one - the third - expires on 20 august . ",
        "austerity imposed by the eu and international monetary fund creditors has caused enormous hardship for millions of greeks , after spending on social security , education and healthcare was cut sharply . burdened with colossal state debts , greece has been on an economic lifeline since 2010 . it has received more than â‚¬ 250bn in bailout payments .
