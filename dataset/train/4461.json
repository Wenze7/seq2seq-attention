        "mayor sandra goudie has enlisted her 92-year-old mother to guard her prized pumpkin plants in the mayoral pumpkin growing challenge . the thames-coromandel mayor has taken up hamilton mayor andrew king 's challenge to waikato mayors to enter the celebrity section of the great pumpkin carnival at hamilton gardens in april , 2018 . she has planted two pumpkin plants , one giant and one miniature , in her mother mary grant 's garden in tararu village , thames . `` i thought it was a good idea , a nice quirky little bit of a challenge , something different , so i thought why not ? '' ",
        "read more : `` and then i was thinking , well , if we 're away , who 's going to water them ? so i planted them down at my mother 's . i 'm just buying her a mega water pistol today , '' she said . however , mum will be doing more than watering the plants occasionally . `` we 've dubbed her our security guard - we 're quite sure we 're going to see john tregidga sneaking around in his black commando gear , '' she said . `` all neighbours are on alert . '' ",
        "goudie was encouraging the community to get involved in the challenge . she had erected signs with arrows pointing to her prized pumpkin plants , so everyone could keep a close eye on things . `` this is a community effort . so this is myself and the security guards and the security guards ' offspring , '' she said . `` we 're giving it our best shot . '' the plants were looking very healthy , despite the dry weather , she said . `` there 's no work to be done , the only thing is a bit of watering , and i might just have to get hold of some sheep sh*t . ",
        "and i saw somewhere on the road they were selling some pony poo . '' goudie said she planned to `` top it all off '' with a pumpkin crown and some pumpkin branding accessories . `` you can see that we 're definitely going to be having some fun . '' the carnival currently holds the australasian record with tim harris ' of morrinsville 789.5 kg pumpkin , which gives the mayors something to aim for . after the weigh-in , all the celebrity growers will take up a funky challenge like painting or carving a pumpkin . the carnival is a fun , family event and the only one in new zealand registered with the pumpkin commonwealth in the us , so any record held is officially recognised . ",
        "pumpkin racers will feature again this year and there is a four-metre track ready for anyone who wishes to mount their pumpkin on wheels and race to be first across the finish line .   "
