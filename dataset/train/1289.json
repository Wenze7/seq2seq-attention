        "vladimir putin has declared mission accomplished for russian forces in the fight against islamic state in syria , as he made a surprise visit to the russian airbase in the country . `` friends , the motherland is waiting for you , '' putin told the russian air force detachment based at the khmeimim airbase during his visit on monday morning . `` you are coming back home with victory . '' earlier this month , the head of the russian army said syria had been entirely liberated from isis forces . putin said a significant part of russian forces would be withdrawn from syria , though scepticism was warranted given that two previous announcements have been met with little noticeable scaling down . ",
        "this time , however , could be different . talk of the total defeat of isis may be premature , but there is no doubt that russian air power , combined with syrian forces and iran-backed shia militias on the ground , has decisively shifted the balance of power in the long syrian civil war . president bashar al-assad was on the brink of defeat when russia entered the conflict in 2015 . with sustained airstrikes on both moderate rebel groups and extremists , moscow has helped assad win back control of much of the country . the russian and syrian air forces were accused of brutal bombing tactics , including deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure , which the russian military has always denied . ",
        "assad 's departure from office , long demanded by western powers , is no longer on the immediate agenda . russia hopes to convene a peace conference that would cement its status as a new power broker in the middle east , bypassing the us . `` syria has been saved as a sovereign , independent state , refugees are coming home and conditions have been created for a political settlement under the united nations ' auspices , '' putin said on monday . assad , who met putin at the airbase , thanked the russian president for his country 's effective contribution to the fighting and said the syrian people would never forget russia 's help , according to syrian television . ",
        "the timing of the visit may also be linked to events in russia . with a presidential election coming up in march , putin is keen to portray the syria mission as a success and reassure russians that its forces will not get bogged down in the conflict . casualties have been hushed up by russian news outlets , as has the presence of private military contractors closely linked to the russian state , often operating much closer to the front lines than russia 's official advisory role would suggest . putin said russia would retain a contingent of forces at the khmeimim airbase , located alongside a civilian airport in the coastal city of latakia . ",
        "`` as you can see , we 're here for a long time , '' the russian army 's spokesman , maj gen igor konashenkov , said during a trip for journalists to the base in september . the facility features barracks , a modern canteen and even a makeshift russian orthodox church . putin later flew from syria to egypt , where he met president abdel fatah al-sisi in cairo . the two leaders discussed the political situation in the middle east and bilateral nuclear cooperation . russia 's state nuclear company said it would build a plant at dabaa that will cost up to $ 21bn and take a decade to complete . ",
        "there was no immediate announcement , however , about the resumption of direct flights between the two countries , which were suspended after isis claimed responsibility for downing a passenger jet carrying russian tourists after takeoff from sharm el-sheikh two years ago . the suspension of flights has been disastrous for egypt 's tourism industry . this article originally appeared on the guardian .
