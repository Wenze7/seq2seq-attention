        "live edmonton more streams a report released friday reveals more problems with edmonton 's metro line lrt , showing at least six major malfunctions since 2015 . six times crossing gates or lights on the lrt line failed to activate at the proper time , causing `` a potentially hazardous situation to exist , '' the report says . `` there is significant anecdotal evidence that abnormal behaviour of the crossing warning systems is a regular occurrence , which has warranted putting temporary procedures and controls in place to mitigate associated risks , '' the report said . `` this summary only captures those events which have been reported . '' ",
        "in addition to the six signalling failures , there were two times when northbound and southbound trains ended up on the same track . 45 ` fail-safe events ' after those two incidents , council asked administration for a breakdown of safety-related incidents since the line went into operation in september 2015 . the summary includes 45 `` fail-safe events '' on the metro line , where the system that limits the risks in the event of a systems failure kicks in . fail-safe events include communication and train-routing failures . the city 's capital line , which runs between clareview and century park , has also been affected . ",
        "`` there are no immediate solutions to restoring pre-metro line service on the capital line without significant impact to metro line service , '' the report said . city council will discuss the reports at a meeting next week , including whether or not to part ways with thales , the company that installed the signalling system . staff kept council in the dark , nickel says coun . mike nickel called the incidents alarming . in the cases where the gates and lights did not activate , `` that means the train was going to go through a live intersection , '' he said friday . ",
        "statistically speaking , the sheer number of incidents suggests that it is only a matter of time before an accident happens that puts members of the public at risk , he said . he also questions why city staff did not bring this information to city council earlier . `` why did n't they keep us apprised of the more operational side of this , given the sensitivity ? and now the scope and scale is coming forward , not because of administration 's volition , but because politicians have started asking questions . `` that is disconcerting .
