        "atlanta 's construction frenzy is continuing along the eastside trail 's newest segment in significant ways , as work progresses on an $ 80-million apartment development called `` edge . '' the north american properties project , destined to straddle the beltline , is slated to bring 350 apartments to the long-fallow site between edgewood and dekalb avenues . construction began this past summer ; the first floor of the eastern building has already been framed out , with excavations ongoing on the western side of the future trail corridor . plans call for `` experimental '' retail spaces and loft offices -- nearly 30,000 square feet of space in all -- to front both sides of the beltline . ",
        "and even more noteworthy , 30 percent of the residential units will be earmarked for affordable workforce housing . it remains to be seen just what `` affordable '' will mean in this instance . if construction proceeds according to plan , the development is expected to open in the spring of 2019 . afterwards , the eastside trail will be extended to link up with krog street tunnel and portions of the trail already opened south of the rail yards .
