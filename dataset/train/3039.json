        "new york -- after the class picture of the latest hall of fame inductees was taken , peyton manning made his way over to steve spurrier for another handshake and some chit-chat before heading off in opposite directions to do media interviews . the former tennessee quarterback and former florida coach had a one-sided rivalry that helped define an era of southeastern conference football . manning set records in knoxville , tennessee , and won just about every award short of the heisman trophy , but his teams never beat spurrier 's mighty gators . famous for his zingers , spurrier said on the rare occasion he runs into manning these days , there is no trash talk . ",
        "there 's just mutual admiration and the chance to talk ball with one of the best quarterbacks the coach has ever seen . the secret to beating manning was really no secret at all , spurrier said . `` we just got ready to play the best we could , '' spurrier said . `` offense . defense . just seemed to work out . they did n't have their best game a lot and it seemed like we always played well . `` spurrier and manning were inducted into the college football hall of fame on tuesday night at the national football foundation 's awards banquet in manhattan . ",
        "the rest of the players in hall of fame class included marshall faulk of san diego state ; 2004 heisman trophy winner matt leinart of southern california ; bob crable of notre dame ; kirk gibson , the national league mvp in 1988 and former michigan state receiver ; bob mckay of texas ; dat nguyen of texas a&m ; mike ruth of boston college ; brian urlacher of new mexico ; and adrian peterson of georgia southern . `` he 's the real adrian peterson , '' urlacher said of his old chicago bears teammate . peterson 's college career ended in 2001 , a few years before that other adrian peterson became a star at oklahoma and went on to a brilliant career in the nfl . ",
        "this peterson still holds the division i career rushing record with 6,559 yards . peterson said he always remembered what his first football coach told him when he was growing up in alachua , florida . `` you should never let one person bring you down . from the age of 6 , that kind of stuck with me , '' he said . the other coaches inducted into the hall of fame were larry kehres , who led division iii mount union to 11 national titles and a . 930 winning percentage in 27 seasons , and danny ford , who coached clemson to its first national championship at the age of 33 . ",
        "spurrier became the fourth person to be inducted into the hall as both a player and a coach . spurrier started his head coaching career at duke from 1987-89 and credited his time there with allowing him to understand what it took to have a winning team . `` the offense had to play close to perfect just about every game . we could n't play stupid and have touchdowns called back to have any chance to win . we had outstanding offensive guys . defense was a little light , but they played their hearts out . so whatever kind of coach i became , i think i learned it at duke university , '' spurrier said . ",
        "he went on to coach at florida , where he also won the heisman in 1966 , and went 122-27-1 with the gators , including a national title in 1996 . after a brief stint with the washington redskins , he returned to college with south carolina and became its winningest coach , too . manning played four years at tennessee , passing up a chance to leave early and be a high draft pick . he finished with 11,201 yards passing and 89 touchdown passes and was second in the heisman trophy voting in 1997 . he follows in father archie manning 's footsteps to the hall of fame . ",
        "they are first father-son duo to be inducted into the college football hall . archie manning was a star at mississippi before going on to a long and successful nfl career , mostly with the new orleans saints . peyton manning said he was 13 when his father was inducted and recalled being allowed to skip school with his brothers , eli and cooper , to attend the ceremony . `` first time wearing a tuxedo ; first time being in new york . so that was a big deal , '' peyton manning said . `` but i can remember what a big deal it was to my dad , that honor . ",
        "a lot of ole miss people were here . `` manning said he allowed his kids to skip school to be at the ceremony , too . `` so it 's kind of surreal thinking i 'm going to experience that same moment tonight , '' manning said .   "
