        "sanaa - yemeni strongman ali abdullah saleh said saturday he was open to talks with the saudi-led coalition fighting iran-backed rebels , as his alliance with the huthi insurgents appeared to be crumbling . `` i call on our brothers in neighbouring countries ... to stop their aggression and lift the blockade ... and we will turn the page , '' the former president said in a televised speech . `` we vow to our brothers and neighbours that , after a ceasefire is in place and the blockade is lifted ... we will hold dialogue directly through the legitimate authority represented by our parliament . ",
        "`` the saudi-led coalition , which has fought saleh and the iran-backed huthi rebels since 2015 , this month imposed a total blockade on the impoverished country after a rebel missile was shot down near riyadh . the capital has been shaken by escalating violence this week between supporters of saleh and the huthis , with dozens of fighters killed and injured and residents now fearing a new front in an already devastating war .
