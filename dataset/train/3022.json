        "article by aubrie k. kielsteptoe & johnson pllcemployment essentialson november 28 , 2017 , the supreme court heard oral argument in digital realty trust inc. . v. paul somers , a case that will determine whether employees who report fraud-related conduct internally will be protected by the dodd-frank act 's anti-retaliation provisions or whether the employee must report directly to the government to earn that protection . the dodd-frank act , passed in 2010 , expanded whistleblower protections and incentives that were initially created under the 2002 sarbanes-oxley act . the protections under sarbanes-oxley , which will not be disturbed by the court , requires the employee to arbitrate before the u. s. department of labor before bringing an action in court and provides a statute of limitations of only 180 days from the date the employee becomes aware of the adverse employment action . ",
        "dodd frank , in some circumstances , provides up to 10 years to bring suit directly in federal court where whistleblowers can sue for double back pay . internal whistleblowers will still be protected from retaliatory employment action regardless of the outcome of this case , but they may only be left with the more limited protections offered under sarbanes-oxley . currently at issue is the definition of whistleblower in dodd-frank , which covers employees who provide `` information relating to a violation of the securities laws to the commission . '' despite the definition , the sec interpreted dodd-frank to protect employees who only report internally . ",
        "in recent years , a split among the federal circuit courts has developed regarding whether to adopt the sec 's interpretation of this provision . in 2013 , the fifth circuit unanimously held that the plain language of the statute provides that the term whistleblower only includes individuals who lodge a complaint directly with the sec -- internal reporting does not afford employees protection under dodd-frank . because the court found that the language of the statute was clear , it gave no weight to the sec 's interpretation of the law . the second circuit , and most recently the ninth circuit , however , held that failing to cover internal reporting was inconsistent with the purpose of the law and adopted the sec 's interpretation that internal whistleblowers are protected from retaliatory employment action . ",
        "in the case currently before the supreme court , the employer urged the court to adopt the fifth circuit 's interpretation that internal reporting does not qualify for the protection of dodd-frank . during oral argument , the justices expressed a great deal of skepticism toward the employee 's position and seemed inclined to agree with the employer on applying the narrower definition of whistleblower found in the statute . numerous commentators suggest that , if the court finds for the employer , the result may be to push employees to report to the sec in order to gain the greater protections of dodd-frank . ",
        "while a ruling in the employer 's favor may limit the employer 's exposure of claims of retaliatory discharge , a policy that has the effect of discouraging internal reporting and pushing employees to report the company to the sec could prove counter-productive . given the protection still offered by sarbanes-oxley , and the fact that the average employee may not be knowledgeable about the law before making reports , it seems unlikely that will be true in the average case . a decision for the employer would not permit termination and retaliation against internal whistle-blowers . instead , those individuals would have a shorter period of time to file suit and would be required to arbitrate before the department of labor before bringing suit . ",
        "in the meantime , employers should try to ensure that they develop policies that encourage internal whistleblowing so that more savvy employees will not be compelled to report potential violations to the sec . employers should continue to investigate legitimate concerns and ensure that employees are not retaliated against for their concerns .
