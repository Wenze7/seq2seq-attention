        "bala win away at barry , bangor suffer late heartbreak against the champions and there are wins for abersytwyth and newtowncefn druids 0 llandudno 0manager huw griffiths is relishing the challenge ahead after his druids side sealed their place in the welsh premier 's top-six for the first time in their history . a goalless draw at the rock against llandudno , the only other side that could overtake them , ensured the ancients will play the second half of the campaign in the championship conference along with the league 's big guns . the seasiders had their chances , but hopes of making the top six themselves faded once they had captain tom dix dismissed for a second yellow card five minutes into the second half . ",
        "`` i 'm made up for everyone at the club , players , supporters , officials and the whole community , '' said griffiths . daily post wales `` everyone had us favourites to go down at the start of the season , so to finish sixth is a fantastic achievement . `` the challenge is now to compete with the top sides in the league . we picked up eight points from the 10 games against them in the first half , so we know how tough it is going to be . we have 10 learning games , and they will make us a better side . '' ",
        "llandudno boss iwan williams could not fault the effort from his charges saying : `` we gave it everything , that 's all you can ask for . `` the players are devastated , but i was proud of their effort and endeavour , and there 's still plenty left to play for this season . '' although the druids had the greater share of possession , llandudno would reflect on missed opportunities midway through the first period with marc evans unable to connect properly with one effort , and forcing a good save from keeper michael jones moments later . ",
        "daily post walesdanny hughes then rattled the bar when well placed after terrific work down the left by toby jones . mike williams also headed wide , but the druids also went close in the first half when lewis buckley smashed his shot against the inside of the post . with the game in the balance , a key moment arrived five minutes into the second period when dix picked up a second yellow card for a foul on alec mudimu . llandudno battled valiantly after that , but there was no way through a strong druids defence despite their efforts . ",
        "barry town united 0 bala town 1bala stepped up their challenge for another summer in europe after clinching a fine 1-0 victory away to barry to move joint third . mike hayes ' strike midway through the second half proved enough to separate the sides , taking the lakesiders level on points with bangor city , and just two adrift of second placed connah 's quay nomads . it was the perfect end to the first half of the season for manager colin caton who marked another milestone by chalking up his 600th game in charge of the lakesiders . ",
        "`` we played really well and asked barry a lot of questions , '' he said . `` they had a free header which i was disappointed about , but apart from that , we bossed the game . `` results went for us elsewhere , but we have to concentrate on ourselves . `` we 've now got a break , which has come at a good time as we 've had a lot of injuries , and went to barry without five players . '' before the game , caton was presented with a bottle of champagne from the home side to mark his 600 games in charge . ",
        "and the bala boss had good reason to celebrate after seeing his players return with the points in their first ever league meeting at jenner park . nathan burke had an early chance cleared off the line , while les davies drove a shot narrowly wide and stuart jones blazed over from six yards . the lakesiders continued to call the tune , giving the home defence plenty to think about with their swift raids . substitute jordan evans was soon in the thick of the action , and provided the game 's decisive moment on 66 minutes with a terrific run from the edge of his own box . ",
        "the midfielder eluded two defenders before slipping the ball to hayes whose shot found the net from a tight angle . the visitors went close to a second when hayes ' curling strike rattled the bar , but they were almost pegged back five minutes from time when kayne mclaggon put his free header inches wide . the new saints 2 bangor city 1city were unable to complete a memorable double over the champions , but kevin nicholson 's men would have been worthy of a point at park hall . ex - wrexham defender blaine hudson grabbed an 87th minute winner for the hosts , who head the table by 12 points at the end of phase one . ",
        "the citizens started with the same confidence they showed in beating tns 5-2 at nantporth back in august , with george harry and luke wall causing problems for the home side with their pace and enterprise . however , greg draper missed a great chance for the full-timers on 15 minutes . draper also forced a fabulous save out of bangor stopper matthew hall after half an hour . hudson had the ball in the back of the net midway through the second half , but the referee disallowed the effort for a foul . nonetheless , aeron edwards scored for the hosts with 10 minutes to go . ",
        "bangor responded immediately as gary taylor-fletcher had a shot cleared off the line before wall charged in to prod the ball in to make it 1-1 . this set up a tense finish , but it was hudson who bagged the decider , ensuring city had to be content with a third-place finish at the split . aberystwyth town 4 connah 's quay nomads 2despite ending phase one with a bad defeat nomads manager andy morrison is delighted to be lying second in the welsh premier league after 22 matches . morrison pulled no punches over the below-par performance his team put in at park avenue on saturday , but also stressed how well the players have done during the first five months of the campaign as a whole . ",
        "quay trailed 3-1 at half time to a joe phillips double and ashley young single , mike wilde replying . nomads dominated the second half , but conceded a fourth on the counter as phillips completed a hat-trick . an andy owens reply for the deesiders proved a mere consolation . morrison said : `` give them a bit of credit , but it was more about us . `` the way we started the game , the intensity was really poor . they won seven or eight individual battles in that first 20 minutes and that gave them the foothold to go on and win the game . ",
        "`` the goals we conceded were absolutely appalling . `` we changed things around in the second half and we were really brave ; we really had a go at them . `` if things fall for us in the second half we score 10 . we 've absolutely peppered their goal , we caused them no end of problems , and we get done on the sucker punch . '' the nomads boss was less than happy about having two goals ruled out and a pair of seemingly blatant penalties turned down . he added : `` we feel we had two penalties disallowed . ",
        "i 'm not going to go and make excuses , these are facts . we 've had two goals disallowed which looked perfectly good goals . `` but i 'm not trying to cover for the performance , the performance was n't good enough . '' reflecting on the first phase of the season overall , morrison said : `` we 're now on 22 games , we 're in second position . `` it was a bitter way to end the first phase , but on reflection , with the spending power of teams now in the league , for us to still have our noses in front is a fantastic achievement . '' ",
        "newtown 3 prestatyn town 0aberystwyth town 's win over connah 's quay meant prestatyn end phase one seven points adrift in the relegation zone . neil gibson 's side suffered an eighth straight league defeat at they went down 3-0 at newtown on saturday . jamie reed made it 1-0 after 25 minutes as he converted a cross at the back post to give the robins a lead they deserved . luke boundford and callum roberts went close to adding further home goals in the first half . the home side were totally dominant in the second half , but initially missed a series of chances . ",
        "that all changed with 20 minutes to go , however , as alex fletcher made it 2-0 and then joe kenton came off the bench to add a third .   "
