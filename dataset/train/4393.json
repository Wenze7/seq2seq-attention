        "five times a day for the past three months , an app called wecroak has been telling me i 'm going to die . it does not mince words . it surprises me at unpredictable intervals , always with the same blunt message : `` do n't forget , you 're going to die . `` sending these notices is wecroak 's sole function . they arrive `` at random times and at any moment just like death , '' according to the app 's website , and are accompanied by a quote meant to encourage `` contemplation , conscious breathing or meditation . '' ",
        "though the quotes are not intended to induce nausea and despair , this is sometimes their effect . i 'm eating lunch with my husband one afternoon when wecroak presents a line from the zen poet gary snyder : `` the other side of the ` sacred ' is the sight of your beloved in the underworld , dripping with maggots . `` i welcomed these grisly reminders into my life in the hope that wecroak , along with half a dozen other mindfulness apps , could help transform my iphone from a stressful distraction into a source of clarity and peace . ",
        "according to a study by a research firm called dscout , americans check their phone an average of 76 times a day for a cumulative two and a half hours -- and while many would like to cut back , simple willpower is n't always enough . amid growing concerns over our phone fixation , silicon valley has , in typical fashion , proposed technology as the solution ; there are now more than 1,000 mindfulness apps designed to help us disconnect . `` you can become a master of this powerful device rather than a slave to it , '' says michael acton smith , a co-founder of calm , an app that offers guided meditation and soothing soundtracks and has surpassed 14 million downloads . ",
        "headspace , a rival app that provides meditation sessions led by a former buddhist monk , has been downloaded more than 18 million times . there are apps to improve your breathing ; apps that track the time you spend on other apps ; and apps to teach you to be mindful while running , eating , giving birth , browsing the web , or , per the buddhify app , `` waiting around . '' i decided to test whether technology could be both malady and cure . wecroak 's message is always the same : `` do n't forget , you 're going to die . ",
        "`` on a beautiful morning this past summer , i woke up to an email -- subject line : `` death makes you happy '' -- that i initially mistook for silicon valley satire . it was a pitch for wecroak , which was inspired by a `` famous bhutanese folk saying '' averring that `` to be a truly happy person , one must contemplate death five times daily . '' `` because we are either unable or unwilling to live a rural life in the picturesque himalayas where time for contemplation may happen more easily , '' the email explained , the app 's creators had developed the next best thing : a 99-cent app that would `` foster happiness '' and `` cultivate mindfulness '' by pestering users with reminders about death . ",
        "i installed it mostly to see whether it was a joke . in fact , wecroak is the very real passion project of ian thomas , a 27-year-old freelance app developer , and hansa bergwall , a 35-year-old publicist , who met through airbnb . last spring , thomas , who is based in california , rented a room in bergwall 's brooklyn apartment while taking an artificial-intelligence class , and one evening , bergwall brought up the bhutanese maxim . he 'd come across it the previous year while researching himalayan ashrams , and had attempted to put it into practice . ",
        "`` i would get to the end of the day and realize i 'd forgotten the entire day to think about death , '' bergwall told me . `` and it occurred to me , this is so easy : i could just get my phone to remind me . '' thomas was intrigued by the idea and began building a prototype that very night . six weeks later , on july 26 , wecroak debuted on apple 's app store . the app has since been downloaded 84 times . one impediment to its success : next to other mindfulness apps , wecroak is a serious downer . ",
        "whereas calm greets me with uplifting prompts to `` take a deep breath , '' wecroak interrupts to warn that `` the grave has no sunny corners . '' still , i do not immediately delete wecroak , and by the fourth week , i begin to enjoy its company . trembling with nerves before giving a talk to a group of strangers , i get a ping : `` do n't forget , you 're going to die . '' what 's a little public speaking next to the terrifying finality of my inevitable demise ? soon after , i 'm at a friend 's wedding , sulking about an impending deadline , when wecroak again reminds me , `` do n't forget , you 're going to die . '' ",
        "i loosen up , finish my champagne , and opt to enjoy myself . with each day the app sounds less like a hobbesian warning -- `` life is short '' -- and more like an oprah-esque affirmation : `` life 's too short ! `` the simplicity of wecroak also begins to charm me . this is not an app on which i can linger . it has no feed , no option to browse previous quotes , no way to procrastinate . bergwall and thomas contemplated adding other features , such as links to learn more about the quotes ' authors or a sliding scale to decrease the frequency of notifications . ",
        "but they ultimately nixed everything beyond the basic template in an effort , thomas told me , to `` disengage people as quickly as possible . `` despite buzzing me five times a day , wecroak comes to feel less obtrusive than the other mindfulness apps on my phone . these apps are meant to be an antidote to facebook , snapchat , instagram -- the sorts of digital media that , according to my calm meditation coach , are creating `` an epidemic of overwhelm . '' the irony is that although mindfulness apps promise to help us disengage from our devices , they also have incentives to keep us tethered -- and they use many of the same techniques as the facebooks of the world . ",
        "`` our community generates more meditation minutes than any other app , '' boasts insight timer , sounding distinctly un-zen . that app automatically displays an activity feed that exploits our innate desire to socialize and distracts us from actually meditating . calm , meanwhile , emails me every few days to say , for example , `` christi from calm '' is `` here to support you on your mindfulness journey '' -- a tactic , called an `` external trigger , '' meant to nudge users back to the app . headspace conditions users by rewarding consistent meditators with adorable animations , such as a pink brain doing push-ups , that reinforce desirable behavior . ",
        "all of these apps incorporate a `` streak '' feature that , by tracking consecutive days of meditation , taps into users ' competitive drive . wecroak , in its inability to do anything besides a single , highly specific task , offers a model for designing software that respects our attention rather than inducing glassy-eyed scrolling . so many online services try to hook us through what tristan harris , a former google ethicist , has called a `` bottomless bowl '' of content -- auto-play videos and clickbait and continuously repopulating feeds . `` what if we designed devices for quick in-and-out uses , not endless interactions ? '' ",
        "asks harris 's nonprofit advocacy organization , time well spent , on its website . the result might resemble wecroak . a time well spent survey of 200,000 iphone users found that people spend an average of 20 minutes a day on insight timer , and 10 minutes a day on calm . according to thomas , people spend an average of 36 seconds a day on wecroak . over time , wecroak changes the way i relate to my phone . as i scroll through instagram or refresh twitter , wecroak interrupts with the sobering reminder that it is not just my attention these other apps are consuming , but chunks of my life . ",
        "this was bergwall 's ambition : having struggled with a candy crush addiction , he hoped wecroak would restore his power over his device . `` i 've gotten angry at my phone and all the apps on it one too many times , '' he told me . `` i wanted to do something about it , take matters into my own hands , and create something that would reclaim it as a space that would n't just knock me off track , but also put me back on . `` i 've come to embrace wecroak as the anti-app . ",
        "social-media platforms seduce by providing a distraction from the tedium of everyday life -- the awkward silences , boring waits in line , and unpleasant thoughts , chief among them the fact that we , and everyone we love , will kick the bucket . wecroak makes escapism feel futile : we 're all going to die . the phone buzzes for thee .
