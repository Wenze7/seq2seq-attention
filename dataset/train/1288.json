        "columbia , mo -- michael porter jr. . was with the missouri basketball team , tuesday and told reporters that it 's still too early to tell if he 'll return . porter is doing some treadmill running and light shooting , and he is scheduled to see his surgeon in dallas on thursday . we learned that porter 's current back injury is similar to one he had during an aau practice two years ago . he had been playing through the back pain , but it got to the point where he could no longer do that . ",
        "`` well first of all , rehab is going great , i 'm getting stronger everyday , '' porter says . `` but right this is too early to tell . this is the type of injury where i 'll feel good before i 'm allowed to play because a lot of healing starts to occur . `` so is progressing pretty quick , i go out and see my doctor in dallas , thursday . and he is supposedly going to clear me for more stuff . he just wants to get his hands on me , see how i 'm doing . ",
        "it 's really up to him . '' porter played two minutes in missouri 's season opener against iowa state on nov. . 10 . but that is the only action porter has had during his brief collegiate career . and it could be all that porter plays in college , should he decide to enter the nba draft -- which he was expected to do prior to the injury .
