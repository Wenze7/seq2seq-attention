        "after the ` willy wonka ' star died last year following a battle with alzheimer 's disease , his wife shared her experience taking care of him . after actor gene wilder passed away last year following a battle with alzheimer 's disease , his widow karen penned an exclusive essay for abc news , in which she detailed her experience with caring for the late actor and paid tribute to the caretakers who have endured the trails and tribulations of the disease . `` i never pictured myself marrying a movie star . i also never saw myself spending years of my life taking care of one , '' wilder wrote in the essay . ",
        "`` but i 've done both . love was the reason for the first . alzheimer 's disease , the second . '' after being happily married for twenty years , wilder described the moment she began to learn something was wrong with her husband , after he lashed out at their grandson . `` the first signs of trouble were small . always the kindest , most tender man , suddenly i saw gene lashing out at our grandson , '' wilder wrote . `` his perception of objects and their distance from him became so faulty that on a bike ride together , he thought we were going to crash into some trees many feet away from us . ",
        "once , at a party with friends , when the subject of young frankenstein came up , he could n't think of the name of the movie and had to act it out instead . '' soon after learning he was diagnosed with alzheimer 's , wilder recalled her husband maintaining `` astonishing grace '' nonetheless . `` i watched his disintegration each moment of each day for six years . one day , i saw him struggle with the ties on his drawstring pants . that night , i took the drawstrings out . then his wrist was bleeding from the failed effort of trying to take off his watch . ",
        "i put his watch away , '' wilder wrote . as each day passed , wilder described the struggles her husband had to endure , until his final day . `` gene died fifteen months ago . i was in the bed next to him when he took his last breaths . by that point , it had been days since he 'd spoken . but on that last night , he looked me straight in the eye and said , three times over , `` i trust you . `` after watching her husband struggle with the consequences of his disease , wilder emphasized that the disease also destroyed her . ",
        "`` there 's another particularly cruel aspect to the disease of alzheimer 's , because in addition to destroying -- piece by piece -- the one who 's stricken with it , it ravages the life of the person caring for its victims . in our case , i was that person , '' wilder wrote . feeling as if she has a `` responsibility , '' the widow praised the gates foundation 's hefty donation of over $ 100 million to alzheimer 's research . following the donation , wilder announced that her husband 's renowned character of willy wonka would be used in the `` pure imagination project , '' which is a `` new video campaign to bring greater awareness about alzheimer 's and encourage each of us to do our part . '' ",
        "while hopeful for research , wilder took a moment to acknowledge the struggles caregivers , as herself , have and continue to endure as their loved ones battle alzheimer 's . `` it is a strange , sad irony that so often , in the territory of a disease that robs an individual of memory , caregivers are often the forgotten . without them , those with alzheimer 's could not get through the day , or die -- as my husband did -- with dignity , surrounded by love .
