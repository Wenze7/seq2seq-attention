        "carlo allegri / reutersmontgomery , ala. . -- `` god is always in control . `` a visibly shaken , rambling roy moore told a venue full of his supporters that he 'd `` wait on god '' for direction , minutes after he and his holier-than-thou senate campaign collapsed in a devastating loss to a democrat in alabama . but if god did take the wheel tuesday night , she was already on interstate 65 , hightailing it to birmingham to kick it with election winner doug jones . jones ' victory party would undoubtedly be more gracious than moore 's sullen affair , with its tiny white-bread sandwich slivers and where a saxophone cover of carlos santana 's `` smooth '' served as the night 's only respite . ",
        "no sooner had the election map turned blue than the republicans at this party began to point fingers . `` there 's blood in the water for mitch mcconnell , it leads back to him . this room is gon na be walking out with a vengeance . we know who 's responsible , '' said chanel rion , the 27-year-old fiancee of missouri senate candidate courtland sykes . sykes himself was even more fire-and-brimstone , worried that establishment republicans -- not democrats -- were winning the war against `` maga candidates , '' a shorthand for president donald trump 's `` make america great again '' campaign slogan . ",
        "`` this is impossible . this is 100-percent an effort by the washington establishment to keep roy moore out of it , '' sykes told huffpost . `` if they can put a democrat in office in alabama , in 2017 , to replace jeff sessions , even after donald trump won by a landslide in 2016 , that means they can replace anyone they want . we do n't have an honest republic if this can happen . does that make sense ? `` others pointed to alabama 's senior senator , republican richard shelby , who on sunday admitted he did n't vote for moore and said the `` republican party can do better . '' ",
        "one moore supporter was overheard saying he 'd like to find an establishment republican like shelby to `` punch in the face '' for involvement in moore 's downfall . then there was trump , who leaned on moore after backing his gop opponent during the primary . trump is now 0-for-2 in his alabama endorsements . `` what did n't help is republicans jumping ship during roy moore 's greatest time of need , '' said ben smith , 25 , a conservative university of alabama student . `` that destroyed any party unity we had left ... i 'm kind of just numb right now . ",
        "`` of course , no fingers were pointed in the direction of moore himself , despite allegations that he sexually assaulted a child and harassed others . nobody pointed at moore , who ran for office after being defrocked as a judge -- twice -- for disrespecting federal law in favor of his god-and-country platform . not one supporter we spoke to cast blame on the ex-judge from gallant , who used to sign bibles at his courthouse . moore gave a short , stuttering speech before he left on tuesday -- an uncomfortable bookend to an awkward 24 hours . ",
        "the night before , his wife kayla bragged that the couple were n't anti-semitic because `` one of our attorneys is a jew . '' then , one of moore 's old war buddies said the pals accidentally stumbled into a brothel together that was full of `` very young '' women . on tuesday morning in gallant , moore and his horse sassy were effectively chased out of his own polling center by a throng of reporters desperate for quotes about a possible ethics violation should he win . nobody at his party had expected a loss like this . ",
        "there were rumblings of discontent well before the ex-judge faced allegations of sexual assault . republicans at his own events had previously said they disliked him ; conservative christians said they did n't trust him . after women began coming forward to describe how moore pursued them as teens when he was in his 30s , lawyers and cops said they did n't have the evidence at the time to throw the book at him . in any case , moore is gone for a while , along with the horse he rode in on . it leaves democrats with a rare opportunity for a one-two punch . ",
        "needless to say , doug jones supporters/workers are partying right now . they to start flipping districts with the momentum #alsen pic . twitter . com/qyb7rwq4ke -- andy campbell december 13 , 2017a few blocks from moore 's gathering , near the steps of the state capitol , some jones supporters were at a bar celebrating , and plotting to flip more alabama elections blue . tabitha isner -- who 's running for the state 's 2nd congressional district , currently represented by republican rep. martha roby -- is one of those machinators . `` i 'm elated . it 's been a struggle so far to convince people that it 's possible to flip these districts . ",
        "people have this sense in alabama that it ca n't be done -- but we changed that mindset tonight , '' isner said . `` i 'm excited that so many more things are possible now that were not possible just a few hours ago . `` senior reporter , huffpostsuggest a correctionmore : u. s. newsrepublican politicsu . s. presidential electionsrepublican partyu . s. congressional elections .
