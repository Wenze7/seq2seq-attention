        "atletico madrid have been left with it all to do in the copa del rey quarter-finals as a late miguel angel moya own goal was followed by a joaquin correa winner in sevilla 's shock 2-1 triumph at the wanda metropolitano . diego costa 's third goal in four games since re-joining atletico 17 minutes from time appeared to have secured the hosts a slender victory , but a fortuitous moya own goal after a jesus navas cross made things interesting . then , with only two minutes left , joaquin correa punished atletico on the break to secure a fine result . ",
        "there was little indication of the two teams ' contrasting recent fortunes during the first half , as sevilla -- who had won just two of their previous eight in all competitions -- gave as good as they got in an entertaining encounter . correa , pablo sarabia and sergio escudero all went desperately close for the visitors , while costa twice troubled sergio rico in the sevilla goal . former chelsea star costa had seemingly ended sevilla 's resistance when he scored fairly late in the day with an emphatic left-footed strike . but sevilla rallied brilliantly to somehow leave the wanda with a result that means they will take a surprise lead to the typically raucous ramon sanchez pizjuan for next tuesday 's second leg .
