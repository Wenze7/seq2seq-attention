        "christopher columbus 's entrepreneurial journey offers lessons for anyone trying to innovate today . let 's just have a look at his story from an entrepreneurial perspective . at the end of the 15th century , it was nearly impossible to reach asia from europe by land . the route was long and arduous , and encounters with hostile armies were difficult to avoid . portuguese explorers solved this problem by taking to the sea : they sailed south along the west african coast and around the cape of good hope . but columbus had a different idea : why not sail west across the atlantic instead of around the massive african continent ? ",
        "columbus approached many officials in portugal and england with his business plan for some time , and eventually in 1491 that he found a willing investor : spanish monarchs ferdinand of aragon and isabella of castile . just like most entrepreneurs , columbus 's business plan underestimated the length of the voyage . he thought the long trip was 3,700 km , when it was twice that . and costs and dangers were n't linear as the problem was food supply . he also did n't find a better route to india , as was a part of his business plan nor any spices . ",
        "but he did find america . crux of the story : do n't be that christopher columbus when it comes to creating a business plan . because , your business plan will not sail , when you set out into the unknown waters . business plan , a traditional tool that is used for business planning when a new business is conceived , is no more relevant . what 's wrong with a business plan ? no current situationa business plan typically includes a past data on the market to justify the market opportunity . and it includes a 5 year forecast on how things are assumed to go once you launch your business . ",
        "but , there is no focus on current situation . makes you believe in your huncheswhen you write a big business plan , the whole process starts you to get into believing in what you write there as truth . you lose sight of the fact that most of the things you write there are your hunches and not absolute data . this has two effects -- one , you tend to follow an incorrect path and two , you lose a perspective on risk factors in your plans . all fictiona start-up is a stage in the process of turning a business idea into an established real company and a ` start-up ' is a company that is confused about -- what its product is ? ",
        "who its customers are ? how to make money ? we start with assumptions about almost everything , to begin with . the questions `` where will you be in 5 years ? ' do n't have any meaning , because , in the early days , there is very little certainty about where a startup is going . a business plan dwelling upon a 5 year forecast is a fiction story . no business plan survives first contact with the real worldyou spend 4 months writing a 60-page plan with 12 pages of spreadsheets . you collect information that justified your assumptions about the problem , opportunity , market size , solution and competitors and more . ",
        "you make a 5-year sales forecast with assumptions about their revenue model , pricing , sales , marketing , customer acquisition cost , etc. . the problem is that when you get out of the building talking to potential customers and users , you realize that at least 1/2 of their key assumptions in their wonderfully well-crafted business plan were wrong . so , what 's the message you get here ? if you are starting up , and when your business idea is essentially a bundle of hunches that you have about the customers , solution , price , and most of everything else ; writing a business plan is a waste of your time .
