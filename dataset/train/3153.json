        "adrian - 6wasn ' t really forced into too much action in the first half , made one superb claim from a diagonal high ball into the box to relieve some pressure midway through the first 45 . pablo zabaleta - 7 ian kington/afp/getty imagesdefensively solid as a rock up against the tricky sanchez . tried to get forward but was always wary of sanchez behind him so often resorted to sticking back . angelo ogbonna - 8very strong display as the italian looks to have re-captured his from of the middle of last season . made some excellent blocks and clearing headers at vital moments throughout the 90 minutes . ",
        "one superb piece of defending late on to deny danny welbeck any glimpse of a chance after cresswell gave the ball away . winston reid - 6didn ' t really figure too much in the game and in away , that 's a good thing as it means he did n't do anything wrong . aaron cresswell - 7seems to be very comfortable in a position on the left side of a back three which moyes kind of stumbled across but it has been effective for cresswell . west ham star oxford makes monchengladbach start as club consider permanent movearthur masuaku - 7he was quiet in the opening 15 minutes before displaying his crossing has improved with a terrific cross for arnautovic 's disallowed goal . ",
        "got better as the first half went on but did n't see an awful lot of the ball . never looked hurried once in defence . pedro obiang - 6mopped up effectively in front of the back three and sprayed a few lovely passesmark noble - 7bizarrely found himself on the right wing and even the hammers skipper looked a bit confused before he was brought down by maitland-niles . ran his socks off throughout , a very committed displayian kington/afp/getty imagesmanuel lanzini - 5off colour as his passing was borderline dreadful all night long , particularly after half time . ",
        "had a decent penalty shout turned down in the first half but that was the extent of his involvement . marko arnautovic - 7 shaun botterill/getty imagesunlucky to have a header ruled out for offside on the quarter of an hour . he was a real live wire throughout and gave nacho monreal a rough time of it . played through the middle in the second half and was n't anywhere near as effective . michail antonio - 6set his stall out early as he busted a gut to beat maitland-nles , who could only pull him back for a free kick . ",
        "ca n't be accused of not putting the effort in but was very sloppy in possession but did well to last 81 minutes . subbed for chicharito . subs javier hernandez - 5had by far the best chance of the game for west ham on the stroke of 90 minutes as he smashed the underside of the crossbar from inside the box - a chance he really should have buried . how did the hammers players fare against arsenal ?
