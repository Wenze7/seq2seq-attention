        "human error blamed for ` regrettable ' false alarm . los angeles - an emergency text alert on saturday warning residents in the us state of hawaii of an imminent ballistic missile threat was a false alarm sent out due to human error , state officials said . the united states military 's pacific command and state authorities confirmed that there was no missile threat . governor david ige said in comments aired on cnn that `` i was awakened by the alert like everyone else here in the state of hawaii . it was unfortunate and regrettable . '' ",
        "ige apologized for the incident , saying that someone at the hawaii emergency management agency `` pushed the wrong button '' during a routine shift change . such shift changes occur three times a day every day of the year , he added . `` while i am thankful this morning 's alert was a false alarm , the public must have confidence in our emergency alert system . i am working to get to the bottom of this so we can prevent an error of this type in the future . '' said ige in a statement . the alert , sent to mobile phones and also aired on television and radio , caused panic among hawaiians and on social media platforms . ",
        "sara donchey , who said she was in honolulu , hawaii , tweeted that her family who were on the north shore `` were hiding in the garage . my mom and sister were crying . '' wu qing , a chinese scholar working in hawaii , said in a phone interview that she still felt frightened . `` i was still sleeping when i received the message in the morning . several of my friends also called me or informed me through wechat after the missile alert mistake , '' said wu . the emergency alert , which was sent to cellphones statewide just before 8:10 am , said : `` ballistic missile threat inbound to hawaii . ",
        "seek immediate shelter . this is not a drill . '' on the h-3 , a major highway north of honolulu , vehicles sat empty after drivers left them to run to a nearby tunnel after the alert showed up , the honolulu star-advertiser reported . workers at a golf club huddled in a kitchen fearing the worst . professional golfer colt knost , staying at waikiki beach during a pga tour event , said `` everyone was panicking '' in the lobby of his hotel . `` everyone was running around like , ` what do we do ? ' '' ",
        "he said . cherese carlson , in honolulu for a class and away from her children , said she called to make sure they were inside after getting the alert . `` i thought , ` oh my god , this is it . something bad 's about to happen and i could die , ' '' she said . the hawaii emergency management agency tweeted there was no threat about 10 minutes after the initial alert , but that did n't reach people who are n't on the social media platform . a revised alert informing of the `` false alarm '' did n't reach cellphones until about 40 minutes later . ",
        "the incident prompted defense agencies including the pentagon and the us pacific command to issue the same statement , that they had `` detected no ballistic missile threat to hawaii '' . the white house said president donald trump was briefed on the incident at his private club in florida . the us federal communications commission , which has jurisdiction over the emergency alert system , announced it was initiating a full investigation . xinhua - ap - reuters .
