        "kansas city , mo. . -- alex smith threw for 231 yards and two touchdowns , kareem hunt ran for 155 yards and a score , and the kansas city chiefs routed the turnover-prone los angeles chargers 30-13 on saturday night to seize control of the afc west . hunt also had a td catch for the chiefs , whose eighth straight win over the chargers all but sewed up the division and a spot in the playoffs . the only way kansas city can squander it is by losing its last two games and the chargers or oakland raiders winning out . ",
        "the chargers led 13-10 early in the second half , but philip rivers threw three interceptions -- two of them to marcus peters -- and austin ekeler coughed up a fumble down the stretch . that ended their four-game win streak and quite possibly their playoff hopes . rivers finished with 221 yards passing and a touchdown , but has thrown 13 interceptions during the chargers ' losing streak to the chiefs . melvin gordon added 78 yards rushing and a score . the game shaped up as a matchup of teams going in opposite directions : the chiefs were 5-0 before watching their division lead waste away , while the chargers started out 0-4 but won seven of their next nine to forge a near-winner-take-all divisional showdown at arrowhead stadium . ",
        "instead , the chiefs looked like they did in their week 3 win over the chargers . so did the chargers , for that matter . the chiefs ' defense , which played so salty last week against oakland , was buoyed by the return of peters from a one-game disciplinary suspension in helping to build a 10-6 halftime lead . rivers soon got on track , going 5 for 5 for 88 yards on his first drive of the second half . and his 10-yard touchdown pass to trusty tight end antonio gates gave los angeles its only lead . ",
        "one that did n't last very long . the chiefs answered with a methodical , 69-yard scoring drive of their own . hunt supplied most of the work , and he capped the drive by catching smith 's short td toss to give the chiefs a 17-13 lead . two plays later , rivers floated a pass downfield and peters leaped up to make an easy interception , and his long return set up first-and-goal at the chargers 6 . the chiefs nearly turned it into another td when smith found hunt again , but the tip of the ball hit the turf for an incompletion . ",
        "the chiefs ' challenge failed and harrison butker knocked through a field goal for a 20-13 lead . the chargers ' offense , which had committed just six giveaways over the last nine games , coughed it up again three plays later . peters helped to pry loose the ball from ekeler , and butker tacked on a 51-yard field goal a short while for a comfortable cushion . rivers threw two more picks in the fourth quarter , giving him six in two games against kansas city this season , and ending any hopes of los angeles mounting a comeback .
