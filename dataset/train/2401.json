        "dear cabin crew , i am sure you all had very good reasons for being less than kind to your passengers today , especially to the younger ones . when a toddler who is potty training needs to go to the bathroom , he needs to go now . not after you played your fancy security video . it hurts to hold it in , or it can explode -- are you willing to handle a poop explosion ? because i will get you involved , this i promise you . when a toddler would like some milk , you do n't deny it to him because you want to save it so other passengers can have it in their coffee . ",
        "the coffee drinkers will get over . the toddler wo n't . frankly i 'd rather my son did n't drink your shit quality milk -- or any cow milk for that matter -- but the poor kid woke up at 4 am to be on your plane . so i 'll let him have it . give him the damn milk . now i understand , maybe you do n't like kids . that 's fair , not everybody does . i mostly like my own kid to be honest , not everyone else 's . what about the adults though ? ",
        "is it really necessary to yell at them because you can not understand their coffee order ? which by the way were black or with sugar , i did n't hear anyone order with milk , ha ! and that 2-meter tall guy who must obviously be very uncomfortable in his teeny tiny seat -- not everyone can afford the ridiculously expensive extra cost for extra leg room -- do you really have to shame him because he was stretching his leg onto the aisle ? yes , i know , the aisle is your office , and you probably had to repeat this a hundred times already today . ",
        "it 's annoying . people are annoying . you know it , i know it , we all know it . but this is what you signed up for , taking care of people . what happened ? maybe you were not expecting them to be that annoying -- i get it too , it can catch you by surprise . maybe you 're tired of your job but you still have to show up to pay the bills . i understand , i 've been there . maybe you had a shit night , a huge fight with your partner , or you had to leave your kid for a few days in a row . ",
        "maybe someone you care about is sick -- or is it you ? maybe you are just in a bad mood , and you do n't know better . i am sure you have very valid reasons for behaving the way you do . i would just like to tell you this . instead of frowning , yelling and puffing , try smiling . even if you do n't feel like it , give it a try . come on -- just one little smile , fake it til you make it . believe me , whatever weight you are carrying will feel much lighter once you exchange a smile with someone . ",
        "do n't do it for us , do it for yourself . until next time , stay calm and stock up on milk . sincerely yours , a mama who chose writing and smiling over physical violence towards the crew .   "
