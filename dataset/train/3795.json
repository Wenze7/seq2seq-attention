        "when australia 's one-day woes looked set to continue , a ginger headed reincarnation of shane warne saved the day . playing against old foes england in the under-19 cricket world cup quarterfinal in queenstown , australian leg-spinner lloyd pope put in a blessed performance to win them the game . as he ran in , pope 's long flowing ginger locks followed behind him . when he released the ball it was on a string , spinning sharply in either direction as he regularly used the wrong-un to bamboozle the english batsmen . after watching his under-19 side amass only 127 batting first , pope 's 8-35 saw england rolled for just 96 . ",
        "they tumbled to a loss by 31 runs , pope 's spell of leg-spin artistry pushing his team onto the semifinals . read more : * stokes to miss t20 in nz * root to skip kiwi t20 series only a fighting 58 from jason sangha , who has shades of ricky ponting in his batting , could push australia through to 127 , a total that did n't seem defendable . it looked even less likely to produce a win when england started with a bang , racing to 47-0 in the eighth over as tom banton blasted it to all parts . ",
        "but when his opening partner was felled by pope , introduced in just the sixth over , and the leggy then ripped a wrong-un through harry brooks for a golden duck , australia roared back . pope was born december 1 , 1999 , the same week that shane warne was in his hometown of adelaide for a test against india . warne took six wickets in that match , almost matching the feats of pope some 18 years later . on tuesday , the flight and variation that pope possessed was too much for the young english team . ",
        "he would rip leg-spin past the edge of the right handers , then send the other one clattering into pads . the spin was so sharp it was unplayable for much of the match . the runs england did score off his bowling were often fortunate , with edges thick and thin evading the field and running away on the fast outfield . banton fell for 58 , caught by sangha at slip off pope 's bowling , and then things really started to tumble . england 's 10 wickets fell for just 39 runs . pope 's spell of 8.35 is the best ever at the under-19 world cup , going past the 7-15 taken by team mate jason ralston against papua new guinea during the 2018 tournament . ",
        "trent boult , who did have the second best figures in the under-19 world cup with 7-20 against malaysia in 2008 , is now in fourth place , shunted off the podium .   "
