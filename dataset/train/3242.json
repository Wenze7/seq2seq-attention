        "demand for obamacare coverage remained relatively strong despite a year-long effort by president donald trump and congressional republicans to gut the health law . the number of people signing up for insurance on the federal healthcare . gov marketplace decreased to about 8.8 million in an abbreviated enrollment window , centers for medicare and medicaid services administrator seema verma said in a tweet thursday . that 's down about 4.4 percent from last year , when the obama administration oversaw the process . `` that 's a healthy number , '' said karen pollitz , senior fellow at the kaiser family foundation . ",
        "the demand shows that people shopping on the exchange , who are mostly subsidized buyers , were undeterred by the shorter window and political uncertainty about the law 's future . `` there were a lot of headwinds to sail against in this one , '' pollitz said . the trump administration and its republican allies in congress failed this year to completely overturn the affordable care act . but while the just-passed tax overhaul does away with the law 's requirement that all americans purchase insurance , interest in aca coverage was high even amid scant advertising and an accelerated timetable to pick a plan . ",
        "the 45-day signup period for affordable care act coverage closed last week in the 39 states that use the healthcare . gov website . last year , with twice as long to enroll , about 9.2 million people signed up . obamacare enrollment almost matches last year 's total americans in 39 states had half as long to select coverage on healthcare . gov source : centers for medicare and medicaid services note : data includes 39 states that use the healthcare . gov marketplace . a decline was anticipated after some insurers fled the obamacare marketplace , leaving consumers with fewer choices , and others raised premiums . ",
        "people who earn too much money to get federal assistance to buy coverage also faced higher prices , though the health law 's subsidies made it possible for 80 percent of people to buy plans costing $ 75 a month or less . before the enrollment period started , president trump ended cost-sharing subsidies that insurers relied on to offset out-of-pocket charges for poor patients . the administration also curtailed advertising and promotion for the sign-up period , which was half as long as in recent years . the tax bill passed by republicans in congress after midnight on wednesday would end penalties on people who opt to go without insurance , eliminating an incentive for some healthy people to buy coverage . ",
        "the market had already been shrinking toward the end of the obama administration , with about 4 percent fewer people nationwide signing up for 2017 coverage compared to the year before . in many of the 11 states that run their own marketplaces , enrollment so far has exceeded last year 's pace , and people have more time to shop . in new york , california , minnesota , and massachusetts , enrollment will continue until the middle or end of january . and millions of people in hurricane-affected areas in the southeast can continue to buy coverage through the end of december . ",
        "others may have extra time if their insurance carrier left the market . in washington state , where enrollment continues until jan. . 15 , 230,000 people have selected plans , more than the total number that signed up last year , the state reported wednesday . the enrollment numbers show that the aca markets remain an important source of health coverage for millions of americans , even as trump works to undo his predecessor 's legacy . the administration has said it plans to expand the use of short-term health plans and other products that are cheaper than aca policies but offer less financial protection for those who get sick or injured .
