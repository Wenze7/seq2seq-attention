        "even though the size of inverse and levered vix etps is small in the context of the broader us equity market , the growth of these products has become `` worrisome '' as they have come to dominate the market according to goldman sachs derivatives analyst rocky fishman . in a research note published earlier this week , fishman noted that although vix etps only have around $ 5 billion in assets under management today , they dominate a disproportionate amount of the market . according to goldman 's analysis , the xiv and svxy short vix products alone `` represent over 40 % of the open interest of first two month vix futures , and the gross size of vix etps tracking the first two vix futures represents more than 100 % of the open interest of the first two vix futures . '' ",
        "get the full ray dalio series in pdf . short vix trade is having a significant impact on the market . while fishman is n't particularly concerned about the net number of shorts , what does concern him is the impact a sudden rise in the vix futures would have on derivative products . he notes in the report that `` the net position of vix etps has become short over the past few weeks , for only the second time in their eight year history . '' what 's more , with the large volume of short vix positioning `` the potential for short and levered etps to start buying vix futures quickly on a sudden vol spike has grown . '' ",
        "fishman and team estimate that it would only take a three-point spike to cause a substantial impact : . `` the potential for short and levered etps to start buying vix futures quickly on a sudden vol spike has grown , making short-dated vix-based hedges timely . with the price of vix tail hedges unusually high for a low volatility environment , we prefer paired positions to outright options - particularly as a volatility spike would likely be short-lived as long as economic and equity fundamentals remain strong . we recommend : buy february vix calls vs. sell april vix calls .
