        "a suicide attacker blew himself up at a funeral in eastern afghanistan on sunday , killing at least 15 mourners and wounding another 14 , officials said , capping a deadly year for civilians . there was no immediate claim of responsiblity but taliban and islamic state militants have stepped up assaults in recent months , with ordinary afghans bearing the brunt of the violence . `` the death toll of the attack targeting a funeral ceremony in behsud district of nangarhar has increased to 15 , '' nangarhar governor spokesman attaullah khogyani told afp . another 14 were wounded . ",
        "all the casualties were civilians . an earlier statement from the governor 's office said 12 people had been killed in the attack near the provincial capital jalalabad . the bomber struck during the funeral ceremony for a former governor of haska mina district who died recently of natural causes , the statement said . provincial health director najib kamawal confirmed the toll . photos posted on twitter and facebook purportedly of the scene showed pools of blood , clothes and shoes scattered on the ground . other photos showed bodies lying in blood and a plume of black smoke rising into the sky . ",
        "terrified mourners , mostly elderly men , could be seen running from the scene . while the taliban is still responsible for the majority of attacks and casualties across afghanistan , is militants have been on a rampage this month . the incident in nangarhar , a restive province bordering pakistan and a stronghold for is , comes days after the group claimed an assault on a shiite cultural centre in kabul that left 41 people dead and more than 80 wounded . that followed a christmas day attack , also claimed by is , near an afghan intelligence agency compound in the afghan capital that left six civilians dead . ",
        "on december 18 militants from the group stormed an intelligence training compound in kabul , triggering an intense gunfight with police , two of whom were wounded . the middle eastern jihadist outfit has gained ground in afghanistan since it first appeared in the region in 2015 , and has scaled up its attacks in kabul and elsewhere , including on security installations and the country 's shiite minority . the latest news comes at the end of a particularly deadly year for afghans , with the number of civilian casualties on track to be one of the highest on record since the us invasion in 2001 . ",
        "more than 8,000 civilians were killed or wounded in conflict-related violence in the first nine months of this year , according to data compiled by the un assistance mission in afghanistan . last year 's civilian casualty toll of 11,418 was the highest for a single year since the un began systematically documenting civilian deaths and injuries in 2009 .
