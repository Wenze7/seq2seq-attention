        "ibf and wba world champion anthony joshua aimed a thinly veiled blow towards deontay wilder as he reaffirmed eddie hearn 's remarks that a fight with joseph parker looks increasingly likely . hearn hopes a fight between joshua and parker can be made for late march or early april 2018 , with a potential bout against wilder coming after . however , american wilder has consistently said that he would walk away from a potential fight unless a 50-50 split was agreed . kiwi parker has lowered his demands in an attempt to complete a deal , whereas the financial split with wilder appears to be a stumbling block in any talks . ",
        "`` i do n't like to give false promises , but i do agree . parker is remotely realistic in negotiations , '' joshua said in a video posted on social media . hearn wants his biggest star to unify the heavyweight belts next year and to do that , a fight with wilder , should he stay undefeated , is inevitable . `` we 're easy to work with , '' added hearn . `` we have negotiated a fight with the hardest people to negotiate with in world boxing , wladimir klitschko . good business . everyone was happy . ",
        "everyone left with a great taste in their mouth . `` it is not difficult . we are not trying to be arrogant . we are not trying to big-headed . it is my job to make the right moves for you . that 's all . `` hearn last week said that three uk venues were being considered for the fight with parker , with the principality stadium in cardiff joined by manchester united 's old trafford and twickenham as possible settings for the as-yet-unconfirmed bout .
