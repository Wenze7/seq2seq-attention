        "ultimate fighting championship star sage northcutt has thrown his hat into the ring to play ivan drago 's tough guy son in the creed sequel . sylvester stallone has put out a call to hollywood agents as he searches for a newcomer to play the son of his rocky foe in the follow-up to 2015 's creed , and ufc lightweight northcutt wants the role . `` the new creed 2 movie is coming out so i was actually going to audition for that , '' he recently told mmafighting . com . '' got a little audition tape , so hopefully that goes through . ",
        "that would be pretty neat . being ivan drago 's son in the movie ? that would be pretty fun . `` northcutt 's chiseled physique and sharp looks , including a blond flat-top hairstyle , certainly make him a contender to play dolph lundgren 's movie son , and he 's coming off a big win at ufc fight night 120 in virginia last month , beating michel quinones after an 11-month break from the octagon . his record stands at nine wins and two losses . he 's four and zero as a lightweight . meanwhile , stallone will reprise his beloved rocky balboa character in creed ii , which he has written , with michael b. jordan returning as boxer adonis johnson , also known as adonis creed . ",
        "lundgren , who played ivan drago in 1980s classic rocky iv , will also be part of the creed sequel . production on the film begins early next year ahead of a november release , with steven caple , jr. . set to direct . ryan coogler , who directed creed , is expected to join in an executive producer role . stallone considered directing creed 2 , but he has opted to pass on that responsibility . `` it 's an honor to be a part of such an iconic franchise and to work with such great collaborators , '' caple said in a statement . ",
        "`` mike , sly , and tessa thompson are extraordinarily talented and bring something special to today 's culture . i look forward to joining the family and continuing the precedent set by this franchise 's alumni of incredible filmmakers . `` the creed sequel will be caple 's first feature at a major studio , but stallone is convinced he has found the right man for the job . `` the character of adonis creed reflects this generation and its challenges , '' the movie star says . `` i believe it 's important for the director to also be a part of this generation like i was in mine , to make the story as relatable as possible . ",
        "we are extremely lucky to have the talented young filmmaker steven caple jr. . step up and accept the role of director . i am confident that he and michael b. jordan will hit it out of the park ! ''   "
