        "the stock market has been charging bullishly upward for years , so it 's no surprise that about half the respondents to a recent wells fargo/gallup poll were concerned that a major correction is due . what is surprising is that a good 72 % of the respondents to the poll had made little or no effort to diversify their portfolios . diversification is a simple way to protect your investments during market corrections , and failing to do so can lead to disaster . what is diversification ? in investing terms , diversification means spreading your money across a wide range of different investments to make a well-rounded portfolio . ",
        "the benefit of diversification is that no matter how the stock market or the economy is doing , at least some of your investments will be thriving -- and if a single investment tanks , it wo n't drag your entire portfolio down with it . diversification lowers your risk and also gives you more options in the event you need to sell off some investments to generate cash . diversifying between asset classesdifferent types of investments tend to react differently to the same conditions . for example , take stocks and bonds . when everything 's going smoothly , both types of investments tend to prosper . ",
        "however , when the economy starts to shift in one direction or another , stocks and bonds often react in opposite ways . when the economy is hurtling along , the fed often tries to curb the rate of inflation by raising interest rates . at this point , stocks will continue to climb , but the value of existing bonds will fall , because new bonds -- issued at the new , higher interest rate -- will have better returns than the old ones . and why would someone want to buy your existing bonds when they could get the same bonds with a higher return somewhere else ? ",
        "on the other hand , when the economy slows down and starts looking like it 's on the brink of a recession , the fed will generally try to spur business by lowering interest rates , which makes it easier for companies to borrow money and therefore to start growing and expanding again . the kind of economic behavior that will generate this reaction also tends to drag down stock prices , as stocks are based on businesses . the drop in stock prices will inspire many investors to sell out of stocks and buy bonds instead , driving up bond values . ",
        "and when the fed does lower interest rates , existing bonds become even more valuable , as they 're still paying interest at the former rate . stocks and bonds are n't the only assets available , though a savvy investor can do an excellent job of diversifying with just those two types of investments . if you 'd like to range further afield , you could also purchase real estate , cash or cash equivalents such as cds , or commodities such as gold . diversifying within an asset classbuying investments from two or more different asset classes is a great way to start diversifying , but it 's not enough by itself . ",
        "if you buy , say , both stocks and bonds issued by the same company , then you own two different types of investments , but you 're hardly diversified . if that company were to go out of business , your entire portfolio could go poof . that 's why it 's important to buy widely differing investments in each asset class . the simplest way to diversify your stock and bond holdings is to buy shares of stock and bond index funds . many of these index funds are already quite diversified for you . for stocks , an s&p 500 index fund is a great way to start , because it will automatically invest you in hundreds of large , established companies . ",
        "if you want to be even more diversified , you can go for a total stock market fund , which buys shares of everything on the entire u. s. market . bond funds allow you to invest in bonds that are grouped by term , type , and other qualities . as with stock funds , you can also choose an extremely broad bond index fund that will pick bonds from each and every one of these categories . diversifying geographicallyanother excellent way to diversify is to purchase some foreign investments . after all , a market crash here in the u. s. may not affect china 's stock market at all . ",
        "some wide-ranging stock and bond funds include a few foreign holdings ; you can also choose to purchase shares of one domestic index fund and one foreign index fund . if you choose the latter approach , be careful to select a foreign fund that includes investments from more than one country . once you 've diversified your portfolio , you 'll have a much better chance of riding out any economic turmoil that occurs in the future . market downturns are inevitable , but while certain investments are sinking , others will help to keep your portfolio afloat .
