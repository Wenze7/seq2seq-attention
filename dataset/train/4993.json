        "darien -- the darien high school boys ice hockey prides itself on playing one of the toughest schedules in the state each season . the challenge of battling that high caliber opposition paid dividends saturday morning as the blue wave conquered archrival new canaan high , 8-1 at the darien ice rink . it was a nice early christmas present for darien as it gained its first victory of the season following road losses to hamden and fairfield prep . `` our schedule is in response to the idea there are really good boys ice hockey teams across the state of connecticut . ",
        "with a schedule like ours , you are going to take some lumps along the way , '' said darien coach mac budd . `` you can coach at practice all you want . but the experience of doing something at game speed is how you learn best . '' too much passion in this rivalryhaving to play these darien-new canaan boys ice hockey games in the daytime has cooled the ardor of some fans on each side . but it has n't changed the physical , football-mentality of the players on the ice . darien scored with 15 seconds left in the first period and 3:37 into the second period for a 2-0 edge . ",
        "tempers flared with 10:57 left in the second period . a rough check into the boards resulted in two new canaan and one darien player drawing two-minute roughing penalties . darien 's matt stein also drew a five-minute major penalty and 10-minute misconduct penalty in the extended sequence . the contest 's turning point resulted as darien 's hunter hazelton and will dickson each scored in 4-on-4 for a 4-0 blue wave edge . gunnar granito had a powerplay tally and new canaan had another goal disallowed during a 3:22 sequence where the rams held a 5-on-3 skater edge for 4-1 . ",
        "`` we did n't manufacture many challenging shots in the first period , '' darien coach budd said . `` the 4-on-4 sequence with open ice helped our offense to get untracked . '' new canaan has things to correctnew canaan 's first-year coach clark jones faces the challenge of having 15 rams graduate from last season 's 19-5-1 squad . four forward lines , three defense pairings and two new goalies ca n't become a new masterpiece in a day . the rams are now 0-3 -lrb- losses to nd-west haven , hamden and darien -rrb- . with 10 days until hosting ridgefield on january 3 , 2018 , new canaan has concerns . ",
        "the rams have trouble getting out of their own end . they have allowed too many goals in the last minute of a period . new junior goalie jack spain has been beaten on rebounds . he was beaten often saturday on shots to the net 's top corner due in part to being screened by opponents . `` there are bumps in the road every season . our bumpy road is now with 15 new players , '' nc coach jones said . `` we had 10 penalties today . there 's no way you can win a game like that . ",
        "i thought we were okay in our long stretches of playing 5-on-5 . the coaching staff have to show these kids the way to play to find the road to success . '' winter classic for dariendarien hopes to return to action on saturday december 30 against greenwich . the present plan calls for the 4 p. m. clash to be played outdoors at the greenwich skating club . we 'll see if this coming week 's weather makes that possible . rdepreta@stamfordadvocate . comdarien 8 , new canaan 1new canaan 0 1 0 -- 1darien 1 5 2 -- 8at darien ice rink .
