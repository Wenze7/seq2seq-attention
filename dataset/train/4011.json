        "how do machines learn ? there are many methods in which a machine is able to learn . machines can learn from neural networks which are networks that are modeled after our human brain and how the brain learns . there are also a few different types of learning in machine learning that are useful for different situations . the three most common ones are supervised learning , unsupervised learning , and reinforcement learning . i 'll be going over these big three and explain them using analogies . enjoy ! supervised learningsupervised learning is a type of learning that uses labelled training data to come up with a function that corresponds the input with the desired output . ",
        "it takes data sets and compares the data to the output it produces . an incorrect answer is generated is very commonly when the system is n't trained but , a value called cost determines how far off the value is . the aim of supervised learning is to reduce the cost across a time of training until the developer is happy with the accuracy achieved . a well-known example of supervised learning is the neural networks that are able to recognize handwritten numbers . the network trains to become as accurate as possible in recognizing the written numbers and once trained can be used for that purpose . ",
        "analogy : let 's say you want to achieve a 95 % mark on your science test . now you ca n't just get a 95 % without studying or practicing . you have all the study material the teacher has given you but its up to you to study . you need to keep reviewing your notes and testing yourself until you know the information well . it 's difficult to achieve 100 % because you may have missed something , may not have taken notes on something , or not have all the study material . but , in our case you just want a 95 % or above so you study until you get a 95 % or over , when testing yourself . ",
        "so in supervised learning you need the input and outputs of test data and you teach the machine to use that data , find an inferred function , and achieve a certain accuracy . a simple breakdown of ai and machine learning . unsupervised learningunsupervised learning is a type of learning in which the machine must infer the function of input and outputs with unlabeled data . it is given data but the job of the machine is to figure out some sort of method to recognize the input and output from what it deems correct in that situation . ",
        "this is very good for probability and finance sets of information because it can recognize patterns in data to give useful results . many unsupervised learning methods are used for drawing inferences from data sets with input values but no output values . it is commonly used in data science and statistics . analogy : if you were to ask a group of people to rank themselves by body weight without being able to share their own weight , most people would classify the shortest and the skinniest to be the lightest of the group . in this situation the people in the group used two variables height and build to determine whether the person is lighter than the others . ",
        "this is an example in which people develop their own solution since they know that height and build play a role in body weight . this imitates how unsupervised data works . google 's deepmind bot that used reinforced learning to beat the best player of go in the world . reinforcement learningreinforcement learning is when an agent is put into an environment and is left to interact in it . the agent can do whatever it feels like but there are some reward systems coded into the machine . if the machine does something good , it is rewarded , but if it does something bad , it is punished . ",
        "the goal of the machine in reinforcement learning is to maximize its reward . this is a very famous type of learning that was used by openai to train a bot to become the best dota2 player in the world as well as google 's deepmind that beat the world 's best go player . analogy : you are playing a video game in which you can do whatever you feel . as every gamer wants , you want to come out on top and be the best and maintain the highest position on the leaderboard . you are only able to see your score and you are left to do whatever you want . ",
        "you start to notice that if you do somethings your score goes higher , and if you do some other things , your score goes lower . you keep messing around until you are fairly certain you know what the game would like you to do in order to achieve the greatest score possible . this reward and punishment system is what allows reinforced learningto function . recapsupervised learning is when a machine is given labelled data and is to achieve a certain accuracy by inferring the function between inputs and outputsunsupervised learning is when a machine is given unlabeled data and is useful for predicting patterns in data sets . ",
        "it is commonly used in data science and statistics . reinforcement learning is a reward/punishment based system in which the machine tries to maximize reward . i 've now given you a head-start . after reading this you know more about machine learning than most of the world . not many people are experts in this field and it may be your chance to get ahead of the world . now you 've learned the types of machine learning , try to learn how machines learn , or figure out how ai will affect other industries . there is so much to explore in ai and its the perfect opportunity for you to learn . ",
        "thank you for reading ! i hope the analogies helped you to understand the basics of the types of machine learning . if you want to learn how machines learn , check out my article on neural networks . also feel free to ask me questions in the comments and share with others as well !   "
