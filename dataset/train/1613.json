        "burger fans love shake shack , but a lot of investors do n't feel the same way . the fast-growing restaurant chain is attracting plenty of naysayers these days . there were 10.7 million shares of shake shack sold short at the end of november , a number that may not seem like a lot but represents nearly half of the stock 's public float . the short interest ratio of 47 % is high , and given the stock 's modest average daily trading volume of roughly 622,000 shares , it would theoretically take 17 days for shorts to clear out of shake shack at that pace . ",
        "there 's a lot of money riding on the stock heading lower , but shake shack 's fundamentals and recent momentum suggest that betting against the former market darling is not such a good idea . love shack . shake shack stock flew out of the gate when it went public in early 2015 at $ 21 . the stock was closing in on $ 100 just three months later , and that 's when valuation concerns began weighing on the investment . shake shack has defied its early volatility by holding relatively steady lately . the stock traded exclusively in the $ 30s for a 15-month run dating back to the summer of last year . ",
        "shares finally cracked the $ 40 ceiling last month , hitting fresh two-year highs earlier this week . one would think that a tight trading range and stability -- the stock 's one-year beta clocks in at a reasonable 1.22 -- would bore the pessimists . speculative shorts like hunting for fast-moving prey , and shake shack 's been a sloth . the two things keeping the boo birds close are the recent negative comps and the stock 's rich valuation . let 's tackle the problematic store-level sales trend first . shack shack saw its revenue climb 27 % in its latest quarter , but that was entirely the handiwork of expansion . ",
        "shake shack 's store count has grown from 105 to 143 over the past year . comps slipped 1.6 % . this is the third quarter in a row of negative comps . margins can get squeezed when unit-level sales are going the wrong way , but at least shake shack managed double-digit earnings and operating profit growth for the quarter . shake shack stock still rallied following last month 's third-quarter results . earnings exceeded wall street 's profit targets for the third quarter in a row , and the chain actually boosted its full-year revenue and comps guidance . ",
        "we 've seen shake shack 's top-line guidance for 2017 inch higher in three of the past four quarters . the burger flipper 's comps outlook did go from a gain of 2 % to 3 % to flat to a decline of 2 % to 3 % , but last month it revised the unit-level sales decline to between 1.5 % and 2 % . an uptick in expansion and even heartier growth plans on tap for 2018 will keep the top line coasting , and comps appear to be stabilizing . finding value in the overvalued . valuation concerns have been dogging shake shack since its initial rally in early 2015 , and if we boil things down to revenue and earnings multiples , we 're going to make value investors queasy . ",
        "shake shack is trading at 86 times this year 's projected earnings and a sky-high 77 times next year 's target . even looking out to 2019 , we 're at a p/e ratio of nearly 60 . high multiples and sluggish unit-level trends seem to give the bears the upper hand here , but let 's not forget that the stock 's not trading at two-year highs this week by accident . for starters , even through this year 's first three quarters of negative comps , we 've seen profits exceed analyst expectations by 13 % to 25 % . ",
        "if wall street 's underestimating shake shack 's power now -- meaning that those forward multiples are inflated -- just imagine the earnings power possible once comps turn positive again . shake shack also stands to be a major beneficiary of corporate tax rate reform -- if it passes -- as a fast-growing chain generating the lion 's share of its revenue from company-owned domestic restaurants . morgan stanley upgraded the stock earlier this month , suggesting that favorable revisions to the tax code could push his new price target of $ 41 on the stock up to $ 50 . ",
        "the upgrade was also based on the uptick in expansion for 2018 and performance improvements . the stock is n't cheap by most measuring sticks , and it 's paying the price of the renaissance at traditional fast-food giants at the expense of the `` better-burger '' shops . it 's still hard to bet against a stock hitting its highest levels in two years , coming off a quarter where it did nudge its revenue and comps guidance higher . the trend is shake shack 's friend right now .
