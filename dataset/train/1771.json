        "black people are less likely to be found carrying drugs when stopped and searched in england and wales than white people , according to a `` troubling '' finding by the police watchdog . an analysis by her majesty 's inspectorate of constabulary and fire and rescue services found that one in four black people searched for drugs were found to be carrying them , compared with one in three white people . the disproportionality persisted in cases where grounds for the search included the smell of cannabis . `` the disparity in find rates is troubling , '' said the watchdog . ",
        "`` t suggests that the use of stop and search on black people might be based on weaker grounds for suspicion than its use on white people , particularly in respect of drugs . `` there may be a number of reasons for these findings but , taken alongside the fact that black people are more than eight times more likely than white people to be stopped and searched , they require an explanation that the service is currently unable to provide . `` the hmicfrs analysis , contained within its annual report on policing legitimacy , assessed 8,574 stop and search records - about 200 from each force - for the reasonableness of the recorded ground for a stop and search , as well as the ethnicity of the person detained , and whether the item searched for was found . ",
        "disproportionality in the use of stop and search has increased despite an overall drop in the use of the tactic to about a quarter of that in 2011-12 , when black people were five times more likely to be stopped . while the number of white people stopped and searched was down 78 % , the number of black people stopped had fallen by just 66 % . the report also noted that many officers were unaware of recent college of policing guidance that the smell of cannabis would not normally justify a search , with 7 % of stop and search records citing it as the sole grounds . ",
        "it called on forces to train officers to consider `` multiple strong grounds '' when deciding whether to search . dep ch con adrian hanstock , the national police chiefs ' council 's lead for stop and search , said forces had made `` good progress '' in applying stop and search powers legitimately and fairly . he said the npcc was looking at why young black men are disproportionately stopped . `` we are working closely with the home office , college of policing and a range of independent experts to critically analyses the data we collect , as well as commission further research to help us better understand why some groups , such as young black men , are disproportionately reflected not only in stop and search figures but also as victims of violent crime and across the criminal justice system as a whole , '' hanstock said . ",
        "carson arthur , of the campaign group stopwatch , said the disproportionality in the use of stop and search reflected its history as a tactic employed in conjunction with drug laws to disrupt and control black and minority ethnic communities in britain . `` it 's not surprising to read that report , in particular that finding that white people are more likely to carrying drugs yet black people are disproportionately stopped and searched , '' he said . `` it just vindicates what a lot of black people who have been stopped and searched have been saying for many years .
