        "playerunknown 's battlegrounds launched on xbox one last week in the game preview program and it was a quick hit . playerunknown himself , brendan greene , said on twitter that the game reached 1 million players on xbox one after just two days . the game has not been without its issues on xbox one , which is to be expected given the game is in an unfinished state . greene said players can expect continuous updates for pubg to improve and expand on the game going forward . after all , developer bluehole is treating pubg as a games-as-a-service title , so this kind of support is to be expected . ",
        "`` this is humbling , so thank you all ! '' greene said of the 1 million player milestone . `` it 's the start of the road on console for us , '' greeene said . `` we 've lots to improve & update over the coming months & w / your feedback we 'll make a great game together ! `` over 1m players tried @pubattlegrounds within 48 hrs of launch on @xbox game preview ! this is humbling , so thank you all ! it 's the start of the road on console for us . we 've lots to improve & update over the coming months & w / your feedback we 'll make a great game together !

        "-- playerunknown december 15 , 2017it 's interesting that greene used the word `` tried '' when talking about how many people have played pubg so far on xbox one . unlike basically every other game preview title , pubg does not offer a free trial . this is a bummer , considering many would like to try an unfinished game like pubg before buying it , and microsoft 's reasoning for why there is no trial might leave some players unsatisfied . microsoft previously said that all xbox game preview titles would have a free trial available , making this news all the more troubling . ",
        "regarding pubg 's performance issues on xbox one , xbox boss phil spencer said on twitter that he recently met with the team at bluehole . `` we are seeing feedback and will continue to update , '' he said . pubg costs $ 30 usd on xbox one , so 1 million sales amounts to around $ 30 million in revenue . in other pubg news , microsoft is throwing in a free copy of the game with the purchase of a new xbox one x through the end of the year . you can learn more about this special offer in gamespot 's previous coverage .
