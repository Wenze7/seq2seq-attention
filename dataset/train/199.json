        "an administrative judge has ruled that the regional transportation district can resume testing on its gold line . by melissa garciadenver , -- an administrative judge has ruled that the regional transportation district can resume testing on its gold line . once open , the commuter rail g line will provide a direct route between downtown denver 's union station to wheat ridge , passing through north denver and arvada . testing on the line stopped in july after troubles with the a line commuter rail to denver international airport caused a ripple effect that delayed the g line 's opening . ",
        "from july up until tuesday 's ruling , rtd had only been allowed to test the line on a limited basis , up to once a week . the judicial decision means that full testing can resume . the commuter rail zoomed through a station in old town arvada wednesday morning , one of eight stops on the highly anticipated new infrastructure . `` it will take 15 minutes to get downtown , '' said richie ramos , an arvada resident who takes a bus from a park and ride station off wadsworth and 56th avenue every day to get to work in downtown denver . ",
        "`` it just takes longer , '' ramos said of his bus commute . `` kind of a big hassle . they late . if they 're stuck in snow , they kick off passengers . '' james lemieux , another arvada resident said the new g line will help him tremendously with his five day per week commute to work downtown . `` it will be awesome . i ca n't wait , '' said lemieux . multiple bus transfers to get to his destination make for a long commute . `` about an hour and a half or two hours sometimes , '' lemieux told cbs4 's melissa garcia . ",
        "problems with the a line 's crossing arms coming down too soon and staying down too long delayed testing of the gline , which also uses `` positive train control '' technology . the public utilities commission requires the full-on testing , scheduled to officially begin on tuesday , prior to allowing the line to open for public use . `` i think it 's going to be the best thing that ever happened to arvada , '' said gary gorman , a colorado native who grew up in the area . `` it 's going to be fast , and i hope they can get it straightened out . '' ",
        "rtd officials expect to open the g line to passengers sometime in 2018 . a re-hearing with the puc is scheduled for mid-march , but could happen as early as february . the hearing , in part , will determine how quickly the g line can get rolling . melissa garcia has been reporting for cbs4 news since march 2014 . find her bio here , follow her on twitter @melissagarciatv , or send your story idea to mkgarcia@cbs . com .
