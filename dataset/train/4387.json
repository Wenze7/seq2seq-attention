        "i 've been casually thinking and learning about bitcoin , cryptocurrency , and the blockchain for more than two years now . friends and acquaintances a like have been throwing questions my way at a feverish pace recently . the chart below probably has something to do with it . bitcoin is up more than 2000 % since last year . this chart will likely be irrelevant by the time this article is posted . we are witnessing the fastest appreciation of an asset class ever . as a college graduate of 2003 who missed both the dot com bubble and the real estate bubble , i finally get my shot at a bubble . ",
        "are we at the tail end of the mania or the beginning ? who knows and who cares , am i right ? sadly , i only dipped half a pinky toe into crypto mania and only recently . i 've been meaning to buy bitcoin for two years and like everyone else i procrastinated until recently . all kidding aside , whether bitcoin succeeds or not , we are talking about a world changing phenomenon . bitcoin might be the heir to gold in the internet age , it might the ultimate medium of value exchange , or it might be nothing at all . ",
        "but two important ideas have burst onto the scene and we ai n't ever going back : 1 -rrb- a decentralized , independent , and purely digital currency , and 2 -rrb- a distributed trust-less ledger aka the blockchain . much ink has been spilled on the glories of the blockchain while simultaneously throwing shade at bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general . while the blockchain is a technologic leap the idea of a independent currency is revolutionary . one reason people buy gold and invest in real estate is to protect their hard earned money against financial mismanagement by governments . ",
        "central authorities can deflate the value of your savings simply by printing more money . this forces you to either invest or spend . i personally believe a mathematically limited digital asset like bitcoin will eventually displace gold as a store of value . digital currency is easier to transport , will be easier to liquidate , and can evade authoritarian governments . in any case , money is simply an agreement between me and you regarding the value of something . it has been sea shells , sticks , silver , gold , paper , and now digital cryptocurrency . ",
        "right now , the frenzy is driven by the fear of missing out . however , i 'm still bullish on bitcoin in the very long run . it is still difficult to acquire and there is a massive learning curve . in the past few weeks , the most popular us exchange , coinbase , has experienced several periods of outage . as awareness of bitcoin builds worldwide it is only likely to continue upwards until the bubble officially pops . be vigilante and start learning . coinbase btc chart on 12/7/17 @ 7:29 pm pst .
