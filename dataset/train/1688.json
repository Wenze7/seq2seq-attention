        "old bridge , n. j. -- nearly everywhere you look , houses are decked out with lights for the holiday . in one new jersey neighborhood , residents are divided over decorations attracting lots of attention . while an afternoon snow on friday , made central ave in old bridge , look like a winter wonderland , some neighbors say one man 's light display is n't spreading joy , but instead creating a lot of tension . tom apruzzi said the decorations have been a 12 year tradition . `` we just love christmas . we do n't have any kids , we do have six dogs though . ",
        "it 's about bringing happiness to people , smiles on people 's faces , '' he said . people come from bear and far to experience the 28 minute show . `` anywhere from a couple hundred to thousands depending on what night it is , '' christina apruzzi said . not everyone on central avenue is delighted by the 300,000 lights or crowds . `` if it was n't a dead end road it would be a different story , '' one neighbor said . he said he 's concerned about safety , and others agreed saying access could be an issue in an emergency . ",
        "`` he goes on social media , you have everyone coming here , the road ca n't take it , dead end street , no lights , no sidewalks , '' a neighbor said . police addressed the issue and cars are no longer allowed to go down central ave. `` we have auxiliary officers there 6 to 10 p. m . they will block off the street , if you live on the street you 're allowed , '' captain joseph mandola said . visitors can park elsewhere in the neighborhood and walk up to the apruzzi 's . ",
        "apruzzi said there has been some retaliation against his family . `` there 's been a broken windshield on one of my trucks , there 's been spitting on sides of truck , harassment issues , starting to get pretty bad , '' he told cbs2 's meg baker . other neighbors fully support the 30 day decor , especially because every penny raised goes towards homes for disabled veterans . `` financially it 's hard , so everyone helping to support something like that goes a long way , '' neighbor jadine michaelson said . the apruzzis raised more than $ 9,000 last year and got to meet the veteran whose home it went towards . ",
        "the show runs until january 2 , then it 's lights out and hopefully peace on earth .   "
