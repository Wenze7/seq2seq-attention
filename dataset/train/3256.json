        "schertz - for 40 years , steve gooding 's works of art have shined at the highest levels in texas and several other states . literally . at 80 feet , 100 feet , 125 feet . even at more than 500 feet , atop the 30-story-tall tower life building in san antonio . gooding , 66 , is a flagpole painter , an avocation that a century ago surely counted thousands of craftsmen among its ranks , including hundreds in texas , as they climbed up the thin steel shafts with brush in hand . now , by most accounts , the affable aerialist is one of the last who works old school in the lone star state , climbing the poles a shimmy and a rope-pull at a time , when most other pole painters use mechanized lifts to do their business . ",
        "`` i 've been doing this so long , i do n't think anything about it , '' gooding said on a recent morning , as he carefully assembled his ropes and riggings for a job at the entrance to the northcliffe subdivision , where he repainted a 100-foot flagpole bronze - even polishing up the ball at the top with gold paint . `` heights do n't bother me . in this business , that 's good . `` even so , after years in the unusual business , he acknowledges , `` this is not an easy trade . ",
        "it 's not something most people would want to do . but i like doing it . `` in about 30 minutes on a recent job , gooding nimbly worked his way up the pole , moving up the safety ropes and a bosun 's chair a few feet at a time . then , after painting the golden ball , he worked his way down a foot or so at a time , painting the pole with a roller and bucket of paint hanging from his rigging . gooding 's aerial show went unnoticed with most drivers coming or going past the pole , though some who slowed or stopped to look at what the people on the ground were looking at were surprised - even shocked and noticeably shaken - when they spotted him way up there . ",
        "`` there 's no way you could get me to do that , '' said ed zukowski , a member of the homeowner 's association board , as he watched gooding 's measured progress up and down the pole . `` but you can tell be absolutely enjoys it . `` a climber 's beginninggooding got an early start on his unusual career . growing up in california during the 1960s , and eventually moving with his mother to near yosemite national park , where she ran a health food store , gooding said he had little idea what he wanted to do with his life . ",
        "by the mid 1970s , he had moved to colorado and was painting houses and doing school maintenance . he learned rappelling with a church youth group , got a job painting light poles at a car dealership and , after learning how to use a bosun 's chair from a man in wyoming , started painting flagpoles . his first one : a 100-footer on the courthouse in pueblo in december 1977 . in the years since , he has painted poles in 27 states - from nebraska to arizona and washington to california , utah and texas - as he and his family lived and traveled around the country in a fifth-wheel trailer . ",
        "he would return every few years to redo an earlier job , while stopping at courthouses , military bases , libraries , universities , hospitals , even state capitols to get new customers - many times just by stopping and asking for work . `` i painted the pole on the capitol in denver for 35 years , and i 'd come back every year , until they took that old 50-foot steel pole down and replaced with a new one that does n't need to be painted , '' gooding said . `` that was a nice pole on the capitol . ",
        "`` in recent years , though , he has cut back on his travels and now mostly paints poles for repeat customers and those who book his services through five texas flag companies that he works for as a sub-contractor . his average fee for painting a `` simple '' 100-foot flagpole : between $ 800 and $ 1,000 . `` how many can i paint in a day ? '' he said . `` i painted the poles at the abilene schools for years , all 18 of them , ranging from 80 feet to 20 feet . at one time , i painted 15 in a day - but that was a long day . ",
        "`` his coldest job , he recalls , was painting a 30-foot pole at the courthouse in clayton , n. m. , one december , `` in 8-to-12-degree temperatures , maybe 18 tops . it was cold . `` the hottest ? `` someplace in texas in the summer , '' he said . `` i start out at 5 a. m. with a flashlight to get the coolest part of the day when i do those jobs . `` rarely has he encountered another `` climber , '' as he calls the painters who do the work by hand , he said . ",
        "`` i did talk to a family in washington state one time , when i first got started , that were flagpole painters , '' he said . `` they got paid $ 3 a foot at that time . `` during his career , gooding has painted flagpoles on the state capitols in colorado , idaho and kansas , and has done repair work on the one at the texas capitol in austin . he also repairs the pulleys at the top , and makes other repairs , as he paints . the most difficult : untangling a 20-by-30-foot flag on a 115-foot flagpole atop the 30-story tower life building , where winds hampered his efforts and made the work more dangerous than usual . ",
        "among his favorite poles : an ornate 125-footer on the parade ground at fort sam houston in san antonio . ` i had to finish the job ' `` i moved to texas 30 years ago . there are a lot of flagpoles in texas , and the weather is better here , '' he said . `` when i was younger i wanted to see parts of the country . i would spend six months in colorado , and then come back to texas . you can make good money , but it takes agility and a lot of traveling . ",
        "`` in his long career , gooding said he has only fallen once , two years ago while painting a 30-footer at an austin bank . `` a knot came loose ... and i fell about 20 feet onto a grassy area , '' he said . `` i hit the ground and just lay there for a few minutes ... my seat was still up on the pole , so i had to get back up there and finish the job . i had to finish the job . i was really sore . so i drove home and went to bed . ",
        "`` two days later , gooding said , an x-ray showed he had three compression fractures in vertebrae in his back . he was back to work painting flagpoles in just a few weeks . `` he 's 67 but he 's really 37 , '' explains sharon gooding , his wife of 12 years . `` he puts new meaning into the word agile . i knew what he did for a living after we met , and i 've never tried to talk him out of what he does . he enjoys his work so much . `` not a family businessnone of his children - one son and three daughters - chose to follow him into flagpole painting , she said - although gooding insists he never pushed it because he thought they should pursue less-dangerous work . ",
        "`` i do n't have any interest in teaching them , '' he said . `` it 's hard money . this work is not easy . you have to go from town to town to get work . `` on the recent morning he was painting the schertz flagpole - not far from his home - his 19-year-old granddaughter , kaitlyn gist , watched him for the first time from the ground . `` there 's no way i would do that , '' she said , watching as he worked his way down the tall steel pole , maneuvering in his bosun 's chair to reach around the mast as he painted . ",
        "`` he 's like the flagpole painter in the famous norman rockwell painting , hanging on ropes at the tops of the pole as he paints an eagle gold , '' his wife said . `` the painting even looks like him . `` and what does one of texas ' last hand-painting-flagpole climbers do in his spare time ? `` we have a 60-foot flagpole at our house , '' sharon gooding says . `` he keeps it perfectly painted .
