        "republican senator roger wicker has been roundly criticised after he was caught in footage calling underage teenagers `` beautiful girls '' . the 66-year-old made the comments during monday 's senate vote on a temporary funding bill , in which democrats moved to end a federal government shutdown . the mississippi senator was speaking to senator cory booker , who said one senate page was from one of the most beautiful places in the country , according to a statement from mr wicker . a c-span video recording shows mr wicker gesturing towards a group of female pages and saying : `` i thought you were going to say this was one of the most beautiful girls . ",
        "what about these others ? '' senate pages are typically between 16 and 17 years old and work for the government as interns . ryan taylor , a spokesman for mr wicker , told the new york daily news the comment was `` meant as a light-hearted jest '' . but the senator came under fire on social media , with a number of people condemning what they labelled `` creepy '' behaviour . one twitter user , deb mochier-dunn , commented : '' did n't they notice the million women march outside their office this weekend ? '' referring to the mass protest that took place in washington on sunday , another user , pamela wallace , said : `` good to know his mind was on the important work at hand ... rating high school girls for hotness . '' ",
        "the comments come after a number of sexual assault scandals involving senior us politicians . former alabama chief justice roy moore , who ran as the republican nominee in the 2017 united states senate special election in alabama , has been accused of sexual misconduct by a number of different women . one accuser said she was assaulted by the judge when she was 14 and he was 32 . mr moore lost the alabama race to democratic candidate doug jones . in december , democratic senator al franken resigned following accusations by more than half a dozen women that he had tried to grope or forcibly kiss them . ",
        "on monday , the senate voted 81-18 to approve the spending bill before it was sent to the house , where members of congress also voted 266-150 to reopen the government . the bill funds the government for three weeks . in the meantime , negotiations will continue on the issue of immigration and a larger budget bill . the deal falls short of the democrats ' initial demand that republican leaders agree to the rough outlines of a measure that would provide protections for undocumented migrants brought to the us as children -- the so-called `` dreamers '' . ",
        "donald trump hailed the passing of the short-term spending bill as a `` big win '' for republicans .   "
