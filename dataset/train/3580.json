        "former international footballer george weah will be sworn in as liberia 's new president on monday , a landmark moment that marks the troubled country 's first peaceful democratic transition since 1944 . former international footballer george weah will be sworn in as liberia 's new president on monday , a landmark moment that marks the troubled country 's first peaceful democratic transition since 1944 . weah will become the 25th president of the west african nation , taking power from president ellen johnson sirleaf after 12 years , with expectations running sky-high among liberians that he will deliver on his promises of jobs and better schools . ",
        "the inauguration is due to begin at 9.45 am in samuel kanyon doe stadium near the capital , monrovia , with heads of state from ghana , mali , nigeria and togo expected to attend along with friends and former colleagues from his football years . weah played for a string of top-flight european teams in the 1990s and was crowned the world 's best player by fifa and won the coveted ballon d'or prize , the only african to have achieved this . after losing his first run at the presidency to sirleaf in 2005 , he has spent the last 13 years attempting to gain the political credibility to match his wild popularity at home , becoming a senator in 2014 . ",
        "volunteers were putting the final touches to decorations and giving the streets a final lick of paint on sunday , and many expressed hope the everyday difficulty of their lives would change . `` it 's my very first time to see liberia transferring power peacefully . people expect real democracy , '' said samuel harmon , 30 , a street trader . `` the expectation of the people and the country is all up to him . everybody believes that if he fails us , the majority will be disappointed with politics , '' he added . - under pressure - sirleaf will be remembered for maintaining peace after the harrowing 1989-2003 civil war left an estimated 250,000 dead . ",
        "but extreme poverty remains pervasive and liberia ranks near bottom in international rankings for health , education and development . at a church service attended by sirleaf and weah on sunday , the pair presented a united front following a bruising election campaign in which sirleaf 's longtime vice-president joseph boakai failed to convince as her successor while alleging fraud had marred the ballot . legal proceedings lodged by boakai delayed a run-off vote and the transition period , meaning weah has had less than a month to prepare for government rather than the three months initially scheduled . sirleaf told afp the inauguration `` implies continuity ; it implies meeting the challenges , '' as she left the event . ",
        "weah faces the challenges of a depressed export economy highly reliant on rubber and iron ore , and outsized expectations he can turn the country around within months and provide jobs for the overwhelmingly young population . more than 60 percent of liberia 's 4.6-million citizens are under 25 , and many voted for weah in the expectation he would quickly boost employment . he told journalists on saturday at a football game -- a friendly with the army -- that his first priority was keeping the peace , and hit out at critics who say he is unqualified for the position . ",
        "`` i am a human being , i strive to be excellent , and i can be successful , '' weah said . `` when i work hard i believe what i believe in and i showed i could persevere , '' he added , referring to early disbelief amongst his countrymen that he could make it in the top european leagues . experts are concerned however that hopes of tackling rampant corruption and bringing technocratic expertise into his cabinet are at risk from the need to repay favours . `` he is under pressure from various constituencies and unlikely to nominate a cabinet of experts as he claimed he would do shortly after his electoral success , '' said malte liewerscheidt , senior africa analyst at global risk consultancy verisk maplecroft . ",
        "the rumoured names were `` clearly tilted towards re-paying political and personal debts of gratitude , suggesting continuity rather than a new dawn in liberian politics , '' he wrote in a briefing note .   "
