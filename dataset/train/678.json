        "follow cbsmiami . com : facebook | twitterwashington -- republicans scored a big win this week by passing a sweeping overhaul of the u. s. tax system . but they 'll need to act quickly to avoid a government shutdown . congress must pass a stopgap funding bill before midnight on friday , or risk an embarrassing closure of government agencies . republicans in the house and senate -- who have competing legislative priorities -- were still at loggerheads over a potential deal on wednesday evening . as house republicans spilled out of a closed-door meeting , it was clear that things had n't gone well . ",
        "members gave wildly varying accounts of the proposal that 's being cobbled together to keep the government open . by the dozens , members quickly shuffled to the house chamber for an unrelated vote . the leadership 's whip team scurried about the floor , taking the temperature on a number of proposals to see which one could land them the coveted number of 218 votes . there are many different options and questions for gop leaders . will the bill be a clean continuing resolution keeping the government open through january 19 ? would a fisa extension be attached or separate ? ",
        "what about a chip extension ? would the disaster aid be separate ? how much for defense spending ? one especially thorny issue tripping up the gop leadership is whether to add a three-week extension of the surveillance program that collects intelligence on non-us citizens to the stopgap bill . `` we need to keep fisa off the bill , '' said ohio 's rep. jim jordan , a key player in the house freedom caucus . rep. steve womack of arkansas told reporters `` there 's obvious disagreement by particularly people on the defense side '' with a short term spending bill but that leaders would continue to work to find a way forward . ",
        "republicans who argue the military is suffering from a string of temporary funding fixes have said they 've had enough of punting and want to give the pentagon a full year budget . they 're incensed the senate wo n't accept their plan , arguing that standoffs with north korea and tensions in the middle east warrant putting a priority on military money . a republican member and leadership aide both confirmed that house speaker paul ryan told members in the conference meeting wednesday night that secretary of defense james mattis supported a short-term continuing resolution with defense anomalies attached , but it was n't clear that satisfied defense hawks . ",
        "asked if he 's confident the conference can muster the votes to avoid a shutdown , womack said there was n't much appetite to close the government . `` i do n't think that our conference , given the victory we 've just taken on tax , will risk a shutdown . '' still , members expressed concerns about timing and sending something to the senate that could pass before midnight friday . republicans are n't expected to make any concessions to democrats , meaning they need as many republican votes as possible . but for every piece of the puzzle they resolve , there 's a group of republicans unhappy . ",
        "and if they do n't come up with a plan b ? `` uh , we 'll be here , '' said rep. chris collins of new york .   "
