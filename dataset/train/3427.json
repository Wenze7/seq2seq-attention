        "courtesy of zerohedge . view original post here . marketwatch is out with a hard hitting story of a paris dominatrix who 's been pimping out clients to mine cryptocurrency in a `` crypto slave farm '' where they deposit the proceeds in a digital wallet . new ! join my crypto slave farm ‚öôÔ∏è üí∞ want to serve me financially , but ca n't afford exorbitant tributes ? first in the industry ... #themanipulatrix #findom #cryptodomme pic . twitter . com/b3lt4lwrgf -- theodora december 11 , 2017 . the woman who goes by theodora is a financial dominatrix , which marketwatch describes below : ... clients -- many of whom never meet her in person -- derive sexual pleasure from giving her gifts and money . ",
        "exchanges of money can range from several dollars in `` tributes , '' as they are called , to gifts of more than six figures . some clients even become a `` human atm , '' meaning they give her complete control over a bank account . theodora says she makes between $ 7,000 and $ 10,000 per month in cryptocurrencies , on top of $ 10,000 per month she earns making video hypnosis sessions and financial domination videos . last year she claims she made nearly $ 1 million from cryptocurrencies alone . theodora `` it 's a form of psychological domination where money is the tool for the transfer of power , '' says theodora , adding `` it 's quite common for powerful men like politicians or ceos to look for a form of sexual release by submitting to a woman -- they are in control all the time during the day -- and giving up control financially is a more tangible instrument of power for them . '' ",
        "theodora has been working as a dominatrix for eight years , and accepting payment in cryptocurrency for four . her clients , mostly from the u. s. and u. k. , are typically men in their late 30s to early 50s -- and include a `` core group of 20 to 25 regular big spenders who make donations as high as $ 100,000 at once -- some of whom she does `` real time '' session with in person . '' she also has a following of 200 to 300 people who make smaller contributions online for $ 25 / minute video chats . ",
        "marketwatch sat down with theodora for a few questions about her adventures in crypto : marketwatch : when did you decide to start taking cryptocurrency ? theodora : in this business of domination , it 's common for dominatrixes to take crypto payments . we can not take paypal because they blacklist sex workers . i have been making my clients mine for me for a couple of years . marketwatch : what is your crypto slave farm ? theodora : it is a little tool where people use the resources of your computer to mine for me from a distance . ",
        "so even though it might be a tiny amount , i have quite a lot of traffic on my website so it adds up quite nicely . marketwatch : how do you make money in cryptocurrencies ? theodora : i take donations and also have people mining for me . i take a lot of geek clients who like new technology and they were really excited when i taught them how to build a mining rig for me so they could mine 24/7 from their home . theodora says she has her `` favorite currencies '' she 's betting on , noting `` bitcoin could crash in two days , you do n't know what 's going to happen , so if you have enough to invest in smaller currency you should , '' and adding `` for me , it 's play money .
