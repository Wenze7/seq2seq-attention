        "doug jones , the democrat who pulled off a stunning upset victory in alabama 's nail-biter senate contest on tuesday , is considered a champion for civil rights in a state that played a seminal role in the 1960s movement . jones , 63 , had never run for office before throwing his hat into the ring in alabama -- and as a believer in climate change and abortion rights was initially given no chance in the solidly republican state , where president donald trump defeated democrat hillary clinton by 28 points . in defeating the republican roy moore -- whose campaign was dogged by claims of sexual misconduct -- jones becomes the first democrat since 1992 to carry a senate race in alabama , handing a major boost to the beleaguered us opposition party . ",
        "the former us attorney earned his reputation with the successful prosecution of two members of the ku klux klan for a 1963 dynamite attack on a black church in birmingham , alabama . the infamous sunday morning bombing of the 16th street baptist church , which left four young girls dead , helped galvanize support for the civil rights movement and came just months after martin luther king jr was arrested for organizing non-violent protests against racial segregation in birmingham . jones was a prosecutor in a pair of cases brought nearly 40 years later which led to the conviction of two of the white supremacists behind the attack . ",
        "bobby frank cherry and thomas blanton were sentenced to life in prison for their roles in the september 15 , 1963 church bombing . `` justice may have been delayed , but it was certainly not denied , '' jones said of the case , which he called `` the most tarnishing crime in alabama in the 20th century . '' while jones was plainly the underdog at the outset of the race to succeed jeff sessions , who left his senate seat vacant when appointed trump 's attorney general , his republican rival was a polarizing figure in alabama . ",
        "moore was forced to step down twice from the state supreme court , the second time for disobedience to the us supreme court 's ruling legalizing gay marriage . and jones ' electoral fortunes changed dramatically when the washington post reported that moore had allegedly preyed on teenage girls when he was a district attorney in his 30s -- allegations denied by the now 70-year-old former judge . democratic donors from around the country began pouring money into the race , buying television advertisements for jones and seeking to mobilize african-american voters , who make up about a quarter of the electorate in the state . ",
        "former vice president joe biden made an appearance at a jones rally in in birmingham in october and president barack obama pitched in with a robo-call for voters . `` this one 's serious . you ca n't sit it out , '' obama said . born in fairfield , alabama , the son of a steelworker , jones attended high school when the state was in the midst of court-ordered desegregation of its high schools . he became an assistant us attorney in birmingham in 1980 and was named us attorney for the northern district of alabama in 1997 by former president bill clinton . ",
        "jones and his wife , louise , have three children and two grandchildren .   "
