        "by : shira krinsky of the observerdr . marian gidea , chair of the math department at stern college for women , was recently awarded a $ 100,000 grant from the national aeronautics and space administration 's jet propulsion lab . the grant was awarded by nasa to a team of researchers from jpl , georgia institute of technology , and yeshiva university . gidea explained to the observer that `` the purpose of the grant is to support both research and education . on the research side , we study mathematical models for the dynamics of spacecraft operating in the solar system , and explore new methods on how to design spacecraft trajectories that are more fuel efficient and reasonably fast . ",
        "on the educational side , we are trying to attract students to study the pertaining mathematical fields , and to prepare them for potential careers at nasa . '' gidea has been collaborating on research with a professor at the georgia institute of technology for many years . this professor invited gidea to join him in the grant , as the georgia institute of technology and jpl have a strategic partnership program . gidea explained that this project was never his primary focus in research before , although he was exploring a similar topic . `` my own research is on certain mathematical aspect behind space mission design , and it involves tools from differential equations , classical mechanics , geometry and topology . ",
        "it also involves numerical experiments on a computer . i have been doing this type of work for quite a few years now , but it is only recently that i have been looking at some concrete examples that nasa is interested in , such as the dynamics near jupiter 's trojans , two large clusters of asteroids that pretty much lie on the same orbit as jupiter 's orbit around the sun , '' he told the observer . read the full post at the observer . photo via the yu observer .
