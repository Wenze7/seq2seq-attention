        "chapman university has published new research showing how hagfishes survive an initial attack from predators before they release large volumes of slime to defend themselves . because the slime is released after they are attacked , this defense strategy is only effective if they survive the initial bite . results show that hagfish skin is not puncture resistant ; it is both unattached and flaccid , which helps avoid internal damage from penetrating teeth . hagfishes are an ancient group of eel-like animals found at the bottom of the ocean . video footage of hagfishes being attacked , lab studies of how their defensive slime functions , and the fact hagfishes are rarely found in the stomachs of other fish , suggest that fish predators are rarely successful when they attempt to eat a hagfish . ",
        "this three-minute video shows how hagfishes use slime as their defense mechanism . `` this video really was the inspiration for our entire study , '' said douglas fudge , ph. d. , associate professor of biological sciences at chapman university and lead author on this study . `` a sizable slack volume in hagfishes , combined with minimal attachment of the skin to the muscle , allows the body to slip out of harm 's way even when the skin is punctured . `` researchers studied the three layers of hagfish skin to determine how they survive the initial attack . ",
        "they narrowed it down to two possibilities ; the hagfishes have either puncture-resistant skin or a loose and flaccid body design that makes it more difficult for teeth to penetrate . the performance of hagfish skin is notable because they lack scales that help boost puncture resistance in many fishes . hagfishes have a subcutaneous sinus system that runs the length of their body , containing 30 percent of their blood volume . although previous research has found evidence that this sinus system is crucial to burrowing and knot-tying , this study shows that it also plays a role in predator defense . ",
        "the study , called `` flaccid skin protects hagfishes from shark bites , '' was published in the journal of the royal society interface . researchers performed skin puncture tests of 22 fish species . they also used simulated shark bites on hagfish and their closest relatives , the sea lamprey .
