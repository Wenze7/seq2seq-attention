        "melbourne , australia -- it took venus williams more than an hour to face the media after her loss to belinda bencic in the opening round of the australian open , and it was clear as she settled into her chair that the media was on the clock . her responses to questions were short . her tone -- even with a microphone in front of her -- was barely audible . and just like that , following a press session she wanted no part of , williams -- in perhaps her most nimble move of the day -- was gone . ",
        "that 's what a straight-sets upset loss to belinda bencic in the opening round of the australian open will do to you . after the loss by williams -- by far the most shocking result of the first round -- everyone was left wondering what happened . just a year ago , williams reached the finals of the australian open before losing to her pregnant little sister , serena . going into monday , venus had played into the second weekend in seven straight grand slam tournaments . with serena skipping this year 's australian open to take care of her 4-month-old daughter , this was a golden opportunity for venus to make a run at one of the two grand slam tournaments that have eluded her . ",
        "but bencic beating williams , the no . 5 player in the world , was hardly a surprise to many . the reason : the difference between being in shape , and being in game shape . a year after reaching the aussie open final , venus williams fell in the first round . epa/julian smithwilliams was definitely not in game shape against bencic . how could she be ? before losing an australian open tune-up tournament last week in sydney , williams had n't played a match since october when she lost to caroline wozniacki in the wta finals in singapore at the end of october . ",
        "that 's not out of the ordinary for williams , who took the same approach going into the australian open last year . but last year williams did n't face an opening-round opponent as tough as bencic , who was a top-10 player as recently as two years ago . and bencic entered this year 's australian open with a 10-match winning streak . so bencic being unseeded did n't matter . neither did her world ranking . even though she lost her first-round match a year ago here against serena , bencic 's recent success had her confident going into her opening round match against venus . ",
        "`` for the matches i think i had a little bit too much respect , played a little bit careful and safe , '' bencic said . her last match against williams came in the third round of the 2015 us open . the outcome was a 6-3 , 6-4 win against bencic that williams claimed she could n't remember . williams wo n't soon forget this first loss to bencic . williams , who usually overpowers opponents , had fewer aces won fewer first serve points and had more unforced errors . williams was broken five times in the match . ",
        "`` i do n't think i played a bad match , '' williams said , one eye on the door as she spoke so low nearly every reporter in the room was forced to lean forward in attempts to hear her . `` she just played above and beyond . i just have to give her credit . `` a match that began under cool conditions and an open roof was delayed for about a half hour in the eighth game of the first set as light rain fell and bencic complained of a slippery surface . both players sat during the 20 minutes it took to close the roof . ",
        "when the chair umpire announced play would soon resume , there was a huge contrast in how the players prepared . bencic stood up and began jumping side to side on the baseline in an attempt to get loose . williams continued to sit and only slowly walked back on the court just before play restarted . it became clear who was ready . williams dropped the next six points -- and the first set -- even as fans in the crowd kept screaming , `` c'mon , venus '' in an attempt to get her fired up . but to no avail . ",
        "williams 's felt her sub-par performance was due more to her draw and less to her inactivity . `` you have to get started immediately , '' she said . `` just not the best luck in terms of , you know , a quick start . the rest of the year to go . `` a year ago , venus williams reached the australian open final . this year , she fell in the first round . clive brunskill/getty imagesit 's true williams got a bad draw . and , clearly , so did no . 10 seed coco vandeweghe and no . ",
        "13 seed sloane stephens , who both lost monday . yet watching williams go one-and-done leaves tennis fans scratching their heads , especially considering where she was at a year ago when she , at 36 , became the oldest women 's grand slam finalist in the open era . `` last year is last year , '' william added . `` this is , like , a new year . you ca n't live in the previous year . it 's impossible . `` that 's true . what 's also true is williams , even though she reached two grand slam finals last year , has n't won a major tournament since wimbledon in 2008 . ",
        "for that , she can blame her sister . but williams coming away empty-handed with serena absent in the last four majors is an indicator that she 's no longer playing at her previous level of dominance . even though her length and athleticism makes her dangerous every time she takes the court , we do n't know how much sjogren 's syndrome -- the autoimmune disorder she was diagnosed with in 2011 -- has taken a toll on her body . during points she looked fluid , but watching williams walking gingerly around the court between points was difficult to watch . ",
        "and even though a clearly stunned williams said she did n't know what her future schedule would be , none of us know how her outside business interests as a designer has had an impact on her commitment to tennis . her company , v starr interiors , just signed a deal to design the first apartments for a global home-sharing residential complex run by airbnb . do n't take this as a knock against williams . she was brilliant during 2017 , and nothing she does will change her impact on the sport . `` it 's unbelievable , '' bencic said of the success of williams . ",
        "`` i do n't think i would be near that when i 'm 37 . `` but williams lost a match in the first round of the australian open against a player who had never won a game against her . a player who admitted that she 's no longer intimidated by a player whose presence has loomed large over the game for the last two decades . the new australian open women 's champion crowned in two weeks will be the fourth different grand slam winner in the past four events . the game has , indeed , changed . ",
        "at the precise moment williams got up from her chair to take the court before her match against bencic , the bruno mars hit song `` 24k '' blared through the speakers at rod laver arena . the lyrics that played : `` 24 karat magic in the air . head to toe so player . `` head-to-toe , venus williams definitely looked the part . but there was very little magic .
