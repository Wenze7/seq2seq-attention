        "a los angeles man has been arrested in connection with the `` swatting '' hoax that left one man dead in wichita , kan. . tyler barriss , 25 , was taken into custody on a fugitive warrant according to a los angeles police department spokesperson . the associated press and nbc reported the arrest early this morning . `` swatting '' is a dangerous hoax in which someone telephones a fake emergency call to a police department with the intention of sending an armed response to the victim 's address . in this case , wichita 's 911 dispatch was called thursday by someone claiming to have shot his father dead in an argument with his parents . ",
        "the caller said he still had his weapon and was holding his mother and younger brother hostage . the caller also threatened to douse the home with gasoline and light it . he gave the address of the home twice . wichita police responded and confronted andrew finch , 28 . officers said finch was ordered to raise his hands but moved them to his waist . officers said they believed he was reaching for a weapon , and fired , killing him . finch was not armed . barriss is accused of making the false report to wichita 's 911 dispatchers . ",
        "the wichita police department posted the audio of that call to its facebook page yesterday . the following is a the 911 audio and video of the officer involved shooting we release today during our press conference , please be advised the following video contains graphic content , viewer discretion is advised . posted by wichita police department on friday , december 29 , 2017reports yesterday suggested that finch had been drawn into an argument among gamers playing call of duty : wwii . finch appears to have no connection to the game or the dispute arising from it . ",
        "instead , one gamer is said to have provided two others with the wichita address where finch was killed . that gamer was known by the handle `` miruhcle . '' it 's unknown whether that is barriss or if barriss is one of the other two , or which of the three phoned the threat . lisa finch , the mother of andrew finch , said her son was `` not a gamer . '' the professional call of duty player tommy `` zoomaa '' paparratto also accused the gamer known as swautistic of making swat threats in the past . ",
        "swatting has a long and ugly history in gamer culture over the past 10 years , usually as an ultimate means of harassing an online adversary . the fbi in 2008 published a bulletin describing the hoax 's onset . `` individuals did it for the bragging rights and ego , versus any monetary gain , '' said an official in the fbi 's dallas office . this year already , a maryland man was shot twice by police -- once in the face -- on a hoax call phoned in by 21-year-old robert mcdaid of coventry , england . ",
        "a popular runescape livestreamer had his home raided by a swat hoax in 2015 , in which his 10-year-old brother ended up held at gunpoint by police officers . also in 2015 , brandon wilson of nevada , 19 years old at the time , was arrested and accused of reporting a fake emergency call to naperville , ill. . police in 2014 , which sent armed law enforcement to the address . and in 2014 , a counter-strike streamer in littleton , colo. . had his play interrupted by police bursting through the door , called to the scene by a swat hoax .
