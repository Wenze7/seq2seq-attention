        "abbeville , ala. . -- recy taylor , a black alabama woman whose rape by six white men in 1944 drew national attention , died thursday . she was 97 . taylor died in her sleep at a nursing home in abbeville , her brother robert corbitt said . he said taylor had been in good spirits the previous day and her death was sudden . she would have been 98 on sunday . taylor was 24 when she was abducted and raped as she walked home from church in abbeville . her attackers left her on the side of the road in an isolated area . ",
        "the naacp assigned rosa parks to investigate the case , and she rallied support for justice for taylor . two all-white , all-male grand juries declined to indict the six white men who admitted to authorities that they assaulted her . in a 2010 interview , taylor told the associated press that she believes the men who attacked her are dead , but she still would like an apology from officials . `` it would mean a whole lot to me , '' taylor said . `` the people who done this to me , ... they ca n't do no apologizing . ",
        "most of them is gone . `` the alabama legislature passed a resolution apologizing to her in 2011 . taylor 's story , along with those of other black women attacked by white men during the civil rights era , is told in `` at the dark end of the street , '' a book by danielle mcguire released in 2010 . a documentary on her case , `` the rape of recy taylor , '' was released this year . `` it is recy taylor and rare other black women like her who spoke up first when danger was greatest , '' nancy buirski , the documentary 's director , told nbc news in an email . ",
        "`` it is these strong women 's voices of the 40 's and early 50 's and their efforts to take back their bodies that led to the montgomery bus boycott and other movements that followed , notably the one we are witnessing today . ''   "
