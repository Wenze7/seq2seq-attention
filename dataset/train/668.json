        "ukhia , bangladesh -- some of the massacre survivors hold precious photos or mementos that belonged to those they lost . others bear physical scars or painful memories that swirl in their nightmares . a few survived and found the most treasured gift of all , their loved ones . more than 650,000 rohingya muslims have fled to bangladesh from myanmar since august , bringing stories of atrocities committed by security forces in myanmar -- including reports of an aug. . 27 army massacre in the village of maung nu . the associated press interviewed dozens of survivors of that slaughter and found that many carried reminders of the tragedy with them into exile . ",
        "here are the stories of 10 : ___ the associated press reported this story with a grant from the pulitzer center on crisis reporting . shot and left for deadmohammadul hassan , 18 , still bears the scars on his chest and back from being shot by soldiers who tried to execute him . the soldiers entered hassan 's house and tied him up along with two of his brothers . all three were stripped naked and marched to a house where they were forced to kneel , then shot twice in the back by a firing squad . when one of the soldiers noticed hassan was still conscious , he shot him a third time in the chest . ",
        "incredibly , hassan found the strength to get up and stumble away after the soldiers left . he only received medical treatment two weeks later , after being carried over a mountain range and crossing into bangladesh by boat . when he thinks about leaving his brothers behind , he says : `` i burn up inside ... every day i see them . `` gunfire and panicli juhar , 32 , has vivid memories of soldiers arriving in maung nu . `` i was at home on sunday morning when they came , '' he recalls . `` they were shooting into the air , and straight into people 's houses . ",
        "it set off a panic . `` hundreds of people fled to a hillside compound belonging to a pair of prominent businessmen . but the soldiers came there , too , `` pointing guns '' and shouting `` get out ! get out ! `` the soldiers then separated the men and the women , and the massacre began . juhar survived by hiding behind a pair of metal fuel drums . blindfolded and boundmohamed yaha , 18 , saw soldiers tying the hands of men and teenagers behind their backs with nylon rope and blindfolding them with masking tape and headscarves ripped off the women . ",
        "`` they put the men on the ground in the courtyard , face down , and started kicking them while they were on their backs , '' the high school student says . then , `` they started hacking people to death with long knives . `` when yaha -- who was not yet tied up -- began running , soldiers fired in his direction . he escaped , but a bullet grazed his arm . painful memoriesshafir rahman , 50 , says he will never forget seeing one of the slaughter 's first , horrific moments : a soldier hammering a four-inch nail into the side of a man 's head with a rifle butt . ",
        "`` until that happened , until that moment , i did n't think they were really going to kill anybody , '' rahman says . `` women were crying for their husbands , saying ` do n't worry , they are n't going to do anything , they are just tying them up . ' `` rahman , who lost his father , a brother , a 17-year-old son and two nephews , also saw soldiers wrapping corpses into orange and blue tarps and hauling them away with push-carts . `` i do n't know where they took them , '' he says . ",
        "`` i just saw what was left . there was blood everywhere . `` a wife , a husband and one last photokulilla khatun , 65 , has just one photo of her 81-year-old husband , nazir ahmed -- a laminated image made several years ago . khatun says soldiers dragged away him into a courtyard outside the house she was cowering in , and decapitated him with machetes . `` people found his head , but they could n't find his body , '' she says , eyes welling with tears . khatun spent the rest of the day in a haze , barely able to move . ",
        "a precious identification cardthree months after the massacre , abdul jabar , 61 , never fails to carry a precious item with him in the front pocket of his shirt -- an identification card belonging to his son , who was slain . somebody who fled the compound the same day found it and gave it to him , covered in blood . now , it is the only photo of his son that he has left . jabar says he wants to show the photo to people who ask about his son and tell them what happened . `` i keep it with me because i 'm afraid it will get lost , '' he says , running his index finger over the laminated card . ",
        "`` if i look at it for a long time , i can not control my tears . `` escaping an executionmohammad nasir , 32 , was tied arm to arm to six other men and marched to the edge of a bank of trees , where he saw the bodies of dozens of people crumpled on the ground . `` i was certain i was going to be killed . only my final prayers were on my mind and lips , '' he says . `` everyone was screaming . `` the ropes binding nasir 's arms came loose , though , and he began to run . ",
        "the soldiers opened fire but did not give chase . nasir only realized half an hour later that he had been shot in the elbow . `` i want to know what the world has to say about all the people who 've been killed , '' he says . `` why have they killed so many of us , i want to know . `` a baby , lost and foundasmida , 20 , lost her 9-month-old son when she tried to stop soldiers from dragging her husband away . troops kicked her until she lost consciousness , and when she woke , the baby was gone and her husband was dead . ",
        "after the massacre ended , asmida -- who only uses one name -- searched unsuccessfully for the infant and eventually fled to another village , having given up hope of ever finding him alive . several days later , a relative brought her a small baby swathed in a blanket , crying with a high fever . it was her son , mohamed umair . `` it was unbelievable , '' she says of their reunion . `` it was like touching the sky . `` a boy , a shirt and a book bagwhen jamila begum , 35 , fled maung nu after the massacre , she only had time to take two mementos of the 15-year-old son she lost -- a shirt he often wore , and the book bag he always carried to school . ",
        "`` he used to keep it beside him when he was reading at night , '' she says of the bag , as tears roll down her cheeks . `` he was a good student . `` begum says she had first watched solders hack her husband to death with machetes . but when they tied her son , jahin gir , to a tree and prepared to shoot him , she could not look anymore . `` why did they kill him ? '' she says . `` what did he do ? `` one family reunitedbodru duza , 52 , is one of the luckiest survivors . ",
        "after the massacre , he lost track of his wife and children and fled to bangladesh alone , assuming all of them had been killed . but in mid-november , there a tearful reunion : the rest of his family joined him in a refugee camp in bangladesh . despite the happy ending , duza 's family did not emerge from the massacre unscathed . unprompted , his five-year-old son casually recounts the slaughter he watched , running his hand across his throat to mimic soldiers hacking villagers to death .
