        "there are three main strains of the flu virus circulating in irelandthe number of people who have died `` from flu directly '' in ireland has surged to 24 , it was announced on thursday - with dozens more fatalities expected . and 1,000 more have been hospitalised since before christmas with the deadly bug , with 50 ending up in intensive care unit . just last week the hse confirmed less than 10 people had died as a result of the flu prior to the first week in january , but the latest figures have revealed the virus has tightened its grip . ",
        "hse public health specialist dr kevin kelleher said the deaths occurred across all age-groups and the current outbreak is expected to last another five weeks and is the fifth-worst since 2000 . dr kelleher said : `` last week or this week will be the peak . `` there 's been just been a little bit of an increase this week - nowhere near the same degree of upsurge we 've seen in the previous two or three weeks . how to avoid deadly flu which has killed 24 - and symptoms to look out for `` so , this period we 've had 1,000 people hospitalised that we know and there has been around 50 admitted to intensive care units so far . ",
        "they 'll keep on going up . `` the main virus fuelling the outbreak is influenza b , which is not covered by the flu vaccine , while the next most prominent flu virus is the ah3n2 or the so-called aussie flu . `` it is expected that the death-count will continue to multiply with between 60 and 110 deaths anticipated before the end of the winter season '' . damien mccallion , the national director for the hse 's winter initiative , said he expects the situation to get a lot worse before it improves . he said : `` certainly the numbers are a lot higher than anyone would want at the moment and there 's certainly no disguising that and we 're working to try and reduce it . ",
        "he added : `` and there 's a lag in terms of how that impacts on hospitals . we anticipate hospitals and community services being under pressure for the next three or four weeks . '' hsehse reveal 24 people have died ` from flu directly ' in irelandthe latest hse figures confirmed 95.5 people per 100,000 were hospitalised last week as a result of flu , but that increased by 2.3 % to 97.8 people for every 100,000 in this week 's figures . dr kelleher confirmed infants , children , adults and all age-groups are being affected with a noticeable increase in the number of teens and adults aged from 15 to 64 getting the flu . ",
        "he said : `` the flu outbreak was widespread across ireland last week , bar the middle of the country . `` but for week two now it 's widespread across the whole country . `` the vast majority of the outbreaks are either in hospitals or the residential care facilities , which makes moving patients in , out , between hospitals and long-term care facilities slightly more problematic . so that is a difficulty for us . sean hughes ' rap lyrics read out to mourners as tragic dublin teen is laid to rest `` and interestingly looking at data coming in from other parts of the world there is a lot of outbreaks being reported this year compared to previous years and we 're not dissimilar . '' ",
        "dr kelleher also said the number of patients in hospitals and icu admissions with flu has jumped and that has added to the trolley crisis - with 394 people waiting for a bed on thursday-more than a 4 % increase on the same day last year . he said the flu outbreak has worsened because those with the virus in hospital would ideally be isolated but a lack of bed capacity has prevented that . the three main strains of flu in circulation in irelandinfluenza aone of the strains of influenza circulating around ireland is a type of a flu known aussie flu - the nickname given to the h3n2 strain of the virus , after australia was particularly affected by it in their last winter . ",
        "symptoms of aussie flu are similar to those caused by normal flu , and strains such as h1n1 and h3n2.doctors have warned the virus poses a major risk here to children - particularly those aged between five and 14influenza b and b yamagatathis virus is known to affect younger age-groups more than older people and in previous years it has usually been less common than a . but the rate of influenza b this year is substantially more than is usually seen at this time of year . a strain of b that was unexpected is the huge rise in cases of influenza b yamagata that account for over 60 % of confirmed flu cases so far . ",
        "it was not expected it to be so dominant in ireland this year . the only vaccine available from the hse is the trivalent flu vaccine but that provides no cover against influenza b yamagata .   "
