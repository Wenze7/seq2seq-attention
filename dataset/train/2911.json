        "here 's where i am with all of my current investment vehicles : . my personal investing account is successfully with vanguard and it currently contains $ 200 . i was n't able to invest in a vanguard mutual fund right away because i do n't have enough money for the buy-in , but i was able to buy one share of a vanguard etf -- and i did n't have to pay any commission or fees . i chose the etf primarily because the share price was low enough that i could buy one . it felt a little weird to buy a single share , but it also felt weird to have the money in the account and not try to invest it . ",
        "i 'm treating this as a learn-as-you-go project , and yesterday i learned how to buy an etf . next week i 'll look at the different ways to buy an etf -- market , limit , stop , etc. . -- so i can use that knowledge when i buy my next share . my hsa is successfully with healthequity and i just transferred $ 200 into the account . i ca n't invest the money yet because it 's still going through the transfer process -- planet money just did a podcast episode about why that process takes so long , if you 're curious -- and i 'm guessing i wo n't be able to invest it after the transfer is complete , because healthequity only lets members invest in vanguard mutual funds and $ 200 wo n't be enough to let me buy in . ",
        "i was able to electronically submit the paperwork for my rollover ira to tiaa , and received a 34-page form from tiaa that i 'll have to fill out before they 'll complete it . i also mailed the roth ira transfer request paperwork to vanguard . i ca n't do the transfer request for my traditional ira yet because i need to send it with an account statement , and since i only opened the traditional ira with capital one investing at the beginning of the month , i do n't have a statement yet . but once i do , i 'll be able to send it off -- and eventually all of my accounts will be with vanguard .
