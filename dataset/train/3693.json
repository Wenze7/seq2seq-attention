        "michael anthony , james beard award-winning chef and partner at gramercy tavern in new york city , is familiar with trying to convince people to like cauliflower . his now-wife did n't like it when they met : `` when i started dating her , although she ate nearly everything in the world , cauliflower was not on her list of go-to items . i was like , ` is this gon na work out ? ' '' the author of a whole cookbook devoted to vegetables , he decided to change her mind : `` i cooked cauliflower every way you could imagine for her to fall in love with it and me . ",
        "it worked ; she loves me and it now -- depending on the day ! '' here , anthony shares his best cauli cooking tips . buying per the new food lover 's companion , `` choose a firm cauliflower with compact florets ; the leaves should be crisp and green with no signs of yellowing . '' anthony notes that you might spy hues of purple , yellow , green , or white . ideally the head has no blemishes , but if there are small brown flecks , no problem ; cut those off . just make sure the head does n't look `` a little banged up or a little old , '' he says . ",
        "and flip it over to look at the stem end , to see that it 's `` been freshly cut and is in good shape . '' storing `` refrigerate raw cauliflower , tightly wrapped , for 3 to 5 days , '' says the flc . cooking blanch , do n't boil avoid boiling cauliflower unless you 're going to quickly blanch it cold water , suggests anthony . `` the danger is , when you cauliflower for a long time , that 's when you really get those cabbage-y sulfurous aromas . by blanching rather than boiling , with a short time in and out of salty water , it leaves a bit of texture and you do n't get a lot of heavy aromas . '' ",
        "steamed `` steaming is great , '' says anthony . `` i like biting into big pieces of it because you get to experience how thick it is and how it smashes easily in your mouth . '' he suggests serving it steamed `` with light sauces , salsa verde , crushed peppers , or mexican pepper and onion salsas . pickled anthony will often lightly pickle cauliflower `` to make it lovable , especially mixed with other veggies . '' roasted the chef loves to roast `` a cross-section of a whole head , which makes it hearty like a steak , maybe topping it with -- at gramercy -- quinoa and dates and toasted nuts . ",
        "the caramelization helps make it more lovable , preserving the thickness to show off the texture . '' he 's also partial to combining it with crispy roasted breadcrumbs , capers , raisins and lemon , which he calls `` a classic . '' raw you can , in fact , eat cauliflower raw . `` i like to thinly shave it and toss it in salads with cooked cauliflower , '' says anthony , for a mix of textures and flavors . he 'll add lemon juice , olive oil , salt and pepper , and pair with bitter greens such as radicchio . ",
        "sautéed `` if i were really thinking about speed , '' says anthony , he 'd stir-fry , adding `` a couple handfuls of peppers or zucchini or something else that cooks quickly , then liquid '' to a pan set over high heat , adding a bit of water `` for steam that allows it to tenderize really quickly . '' in soup do n't sleep on cauliflower soup ! it 's one of the most delicious ways to consume the veggie . by keeping the cauli out of the oven you 'll avoid browning and a less attractive color , suggests anthony . ",
        "think of white foods : sautéed onions , shallots , garlic , leeks , cream or lard . that said , he notes that the `` caramelization produced by roasting is definitely delicious , '' so if you 're finishing soup with chopped herbs or toasted pumpkin seeds , why not roast ? finish a well-blended soup with salt , pepper , a little drizzle of olive oil , or maybe croutons . eat the stems and tiny leaves `` i eat the whole stem , most of the time , '' says anthony . `` turn the whole head upside-down and use a paring knife to cut in a circular way around the stem , leaving the core or main stem intact . ",
        "you can then cut that into rounds or lengths , matchstick cut or leave it whole . '' cook whole stems in the embers of an open fire , or split it in half for the grill . `` stems connected to florets generally cook in same amount of time , '' he says , `` and i do eat all the tiny leaves , which are delicious , to save for salad or add to soup at very end .
