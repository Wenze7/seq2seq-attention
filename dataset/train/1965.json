        "blackhawks rookie forward alex debrincat was a star at lake forest academy , playing hockey just up the road from the united center , but there was little appeal of watching a star-studded team in chicago . a native of farmington hills , mich. , debrincat grew up a fan of the nearby detroit red wings . in fact , he downright hated the blackhawks , the team that would later select him in the first round of the 2016 nhl draft . debrincat confessed to his former red wings fandom on the spiegel & parkins show on friday . ",
        "`` we definitely considered the hawks as a rival , '' debrincat said . `` i was n't a very big hawks fan at all . i did n't like them one bit . `` they knocked us out of the playoffs a few years . i was n't very happy about that . '' of course , debrincat was n't at all disappointed when it was the blackhawks that drafted him in the first round . they recognized the potential in what he could become . the 19-year-old debrincat has posted 11 goals and eight assists in 25 games with the blackhawks , including a hat trick in a win over the ducks on monday . ",
        "he has been trusted to play a key role alongside stars like jonathan toews and patrick kane , two players he considered rivals watching the game as a kid . with the help of a veteran core , debrincat is emerging as a candidate for the calder trophy as the nhl 's top rookie . `` the guys have helped me out a lot , '' debrincat said . `` you know , at the beginning of the year , you 're nervous . you do n't know how much time you have and stuff . the guys just keep reassuring me , ` just play your game , and good things will happen . ' ",
        "i give a lot of credit to them in helping me feel comfortable and helping me play in this league . `` growing up watching all these guys , they were going through the stanley cups when i was kind of getting to watching hockey on my own and understanding the game . it 's crazy to play with these guys . it 's a tremendous honor . debrincat said there was no getting star struck when he got into the locker room . after all , the blackhawks were counting on him to help them get back to the stanley cup final . ",
        "the blackhawks are getting rewarded for their faith in debrincat 's readiness as he proves to be a scorer at this next level . `` when i was growing up , i always had pretty much the same amount of goals and assists , '' he said . `` but i was n't really classified as a scorer until probably ohl . before that , i could make some plays and pass the puck , too , but now i 'm mostly classified as a scorer .
