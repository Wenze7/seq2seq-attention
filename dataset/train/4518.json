        "melbourne , australia -- after nick kyrgios dropped the first two sets to grigor dimitrov in their tense , back-and-forth fourth-round match at the australian open , a spectator called out to him as he dejectedly walked back to the service line , `` pick your head up . `` kyrgios literally did lift his head for a moment , generating a laugh from the packed rod laver arena audience . he also picked up his spirits -- and his game -- and slowly clawed his way back into the match . as tends to be the case with kyrgios , however , his focus soon wavered . ",
        "dimitrov won the match 7-6 , 7-6 , 4-6 , 7-6 and kyrgios was left searching , yet again , for a solution to whatever is holding him back from contending for major titles . kyrgios has long been touted as a multiple grand slam winner and potential future no . 1 , but the 22-year-old is still struggling to get closer to the top . in fact , his results in recent years are moving in the wrong direction . he 's only reached two grand slam quarterfinals in his career , and the last came at the australian open three years ago . ",
        "he 's lost before the fourth round in nine of the last 12 majors . despite falling short on sunday , however , kyrgios was upbeat in defeat , believing he 's still a work in progress . `` i feel confident after losing that match . i gave my best efforts this week . i came up short . i beat three quality opponents , '' he said . `` i lost tonight to one of the best players in the world . went down swinging . obviously i feel a lot better this time around . `` last year i really did n't know what i was going to do after the australian open . ",
        "i feel like i have more of a vision and goal for this year . i think i 'm in a good head space . `` kyrgios has long been combustible , prone to magnificent play one moment and head-scratching errors the next . he seemed to be playing with newfound composure at melbourne park this year , though there were moments against dimitrov when he played too loosely and took unnecessary risks . he smacked a number of second serves at 200 kph . he went for -- and sometimes missed -- huge forehands to end lengthy rallies and charged the service line at times to receive dimitrov 's first serves . ",
        "`` frustrating , '' said dimitrov , when asked what it 's like to play someone as unpredictable as kyrgios . `` simple as that . you 've always got to be alert . you never know what 's going to happen . he served a couple of second serves over 200 today . what can you do ? `` kyrgios is without a coach again after briefly working with former french player sebastien grosjean last year , and he does n't appear to be looking for a new one . andre agassi , who 's currently coaching novak djokovic , believes a coach could be hugely beneficial to the young australian . ",
        "`` to go it alone and not get access to things tried and lessons learned is an unforced error , '' agassi told the australian media this week . for now , kyrgios believes he 's doing fine on his own . `` you know , i feel like i have lost one match this year , so i 'm doing all right , '' he said , reflecting on his australian open run and his title at the brisbane international , where he beat dimitrov in the semifinals . `` i was in a very structured environment when i was young and i did n't like it . ",
        "i guess i have just now gone to the other extreme . ''   "
