        "oakland , calif. . -- lou williams scored 27 of his career-high 50 points in the third quarter and the clippers beat the warriors for the first time in more than three years with a 125-106 win wednesday that spoiled a milestone night for kevin durant . williams shot 16 for 27 with a career-best eight 3-pointers and made all 10 of his free throws . durant became the 44th player in nba history to score 20,000 career points , finishing with 40 as the warriors had their five-game winning streak snapped along with a 12-game unbeaten stretch in the clippers rivalry . ",
        "durant reached the milestone on a pull-up jumper from the left wing at the 1:41 mark of the second quarter . the warriors announced his accomplishment on the main scoreboard and durant received a standing ovation , shaking his head in acknowledgment while still very much in game mode . by late in the fourth quarter , that crowd was making its way for the exits with the game out of reach . the nba finals mvp returned from a three-game absence due to a strained right calf and scored 25 points in the first half against the clippers -- kd 's biggest half of the season and the exact number he needed for 20,000 . ",
        "durant , who had a four-point play during the second quarter on the way to 14 points in the period , is at 29 the second-youngest player behind lebron james and first to reach the 20,000 mark as a member of the warriors . he shot 14 for 18 , including 6 of 7 from deep , and zaza pachulia added 12 points on a night when the warriors were without their starting backcourt . stephen curry re-sprained his right ankle during the morning shootaround , and klay thompson also was out for rest that had been previously scheduled . ",
        "williams also dished out seven assists and rookie tyrone wallace added a season-best 22 points off the bench for the clippers while returning to the bay area , where he starred in college at california . nick young started in place of thompson and had seven points but shot 3 for 11 and missed six of his seven 3-point tries . it was young 's first start with the warriors . shaun livingston played in place of curry and contributed eight points and four assists . draymond green missed his first five shots before connecting late in the third . ",
        "`` we still have two all-stars . it 's an embarrassment of riches , '' golden state coach steve kerr said of durant and green . `` i 'm not going to shy away from that . '' there were 13 lead changes in the first quarter alone . golden state went on a 10-0 run midway through the second during which durant scored eight points .   "
