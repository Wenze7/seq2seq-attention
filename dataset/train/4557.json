        "fitbit confirmed its $ 6 million investment in sano , a glucose-monitoring startupthe investment is fitbit 's first in a startupfitbit said the investment fits in the company 's future plans , but did not say whether a future device will have glucose trackingknown for making fitness-oriented wearables , fitbit is reported to have made its first-ever investment , with $ 6 million of the company 's funds going to glucose-monitoring startup sano . as cnbc reports , sano is a startup founded in 2011 that is working on a minimally-invasive patch that tracks your blood sugar levels . around the size of a coin , it is unknown whether the patch will be available to the masses or whether it will require fda approval . ",
        "what is known is that sano is not the only company trying to make minimally invasive glucose monitoring a reality -- alphabet 's verily is working on such technology , while apple is reported to be working on a noninvasive patch that does not use needles . by comparison , sano 's patch does use needles , but sano ceo ashwin pushpala said its option is less painful than current alternatives . editor 's pickfitbit ionic 's first software update brings more watch faces and apps , improved touch interactionwhen we reviewed the fitbit ionic in november , most of our gripes had to do with software . ",
        "fitbit os was quite laggy , and there were only a handful of third-party apps available at launch . now , ... also , even though sano 's solution will not be available for at least another year , pushpala said it is intended for those with type 1 or type 2 diabetes . the patch could even be intended for the pre-diabetic and those who want to learn more about their glucose levels and how they fluctuate throughout the day . as for fitbit , ceo james park said the investment plays into the company 's future plans : this fits into our strategy of looking beyond the device and thinking more about solutions . ",
        "i think the complete solution comes in the form of having some monitoring solution that is coupled with a display , and a wearable that can give you the interventions at the right moment . park did not say that future fitbit products will feature built-in blood sugar monitors , though it should be said that the company partnered up with dexcom , inc. . to incorporate a continuous glucose-monitoring display into the ionic smartwatch . what it comes down to , however , is fitbit wanting to remain competitive . it has lost significant ground in the wearable space to the likes of apple , xiaomi , and even samsung in recent years , so having this sort of technology could be a significant differentiator for the company .
