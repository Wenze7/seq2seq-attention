        "the sarcastic storytelling attitude of 2017 's most divisive moviethere 's a scene in rian johnson 's 2012 time-travel film looper in which bruce willis , playing an older version of a character played by joseph gordon-levitt , says to his younger counterpart : `` i do n't want to talk about time travel shit , because we 'll start talking about it and then we 'll be here all day making diagrams with straws . '' in effect , looper , a time-travel film , tells all the other time-travel films to go to hell . i was thinking about this scene a lot while watching johnson 's latest film , which so happens to be the last jedi , the latest installment in the star wars mega-franchise , which the popular consciousness is so invested in that the movie inevitably arrived with insurmountable expectations . ",
        "indeed , for the third holiday season in a row , the walt disney corporation has presented a new star wars film to the world , but this time , the new star wars is almost as divisive as the national political climate . critics everywhere have praised the last jedi , the eighth serial installment of the main star wars storyline , with the broad platitudes of having `` taken risks , '' `` done something new , '' and for being `` fresh . '' meanwhile , the `` fans '' have bemoaned the sacking of george lucas ' legacy and the apparent irreverence writer-director rian johnson placed in beloved characters and concepts . ",
        "but i 'm going to push back a little on both of these reactions . if the last jedi did something ` new ' -- it was n't really new . if the movie took some risks , then they were shallow risks , non-risks that really had little to lose . and if fans claim that the last jedi went too far in disrupting their expectations , i 'd say it did n't go far enough . allow me to explain . the great american irony binge `` from the '90s onward , a specific kind of rhetoric has draped itself over american culture : irony , that beloved tool with the power to humble one 's opponents , to help discern between people who get it and those who do n't , to fight back when one is in the minority , to make life 's traumas and tribulations a little easier to handle . '' ",
        "this lengthy , byzantine line is from an essay called `` the great american irony binge , '' authored by contemporary intellectual christy wampole in her 2015 book the other serious . in the essay , she goes on to argue that irony -- in the forms of sarcasm , snark , self-deprecating humor , and satire -- has grown to overwhelm and dominate popular american culture . in such fashion , though it was first glimpsed in cartoons such as the simpsons , american irony spread its tentacles into other media , such as through stephen colbert-esque political comedy , and eventually infected all mediums of american culture . ",
        "and when it comes to film -- genre movies in particular -- wampole 's polemic especially rings true . by the time the 21st century arrived , many genre movies had begun to feel worn-down and ridiculous . bombarded by tv 's csis and law and orders , film detective procedurals were only one genre that may have seemed played out . the same went for superheroes in the early 2000s , as a plethora of x-men and spider-men came and went and exhausted audiences in the process . even james bond had regressed from fighting greedy gold misers to fighting north korean-princelings-who-commit-plastic-surgery-to-look-british . ",
        "in 2008 , when the first iron man came out , audiences were pleasantly surprised when robert downey jr. 's tony stark openly admitted his super-powered alter ego to reporters -- thus dispensing with the tired trope of superheroes preserving a secret identity . but the throwaway joke signaled a tectonic shift in blockbuster storytelling . the ensuing marvel juggernaut went on to routinely shrug away from big moments , preferring to subvert clichés -- specifically by making fun of them . in subsequent films , iron man 's signature villain , the osama bin laden-esque mandarin , was revealed to be a phony . ",
        "the guardians of the galaxy laughed and danced their way into defeating their bad guy . the snarky attitude found its way into other films and genres -- in the lego movie , most tropes of the `` chosen one '' monomyths are playfully exploited and subverted ; in 22 jump street , the very idea of an unnecessary sequel is relentlessly mocked . sage hyden , the creator of the youtube channel just write , articulated the weaknesses of cinematic sarcasm in his video `` what writers should learn from wonder woman . '' he first screens a clip from spider-man 2 , in which tobey maguire 's peter parker reassumes the mantle of spider-man in an empowering , if not cheesy , scene . ",
        "he contrasts this with a similar scene in doctor strange , in which a joke involving his sentient magical cape undermines the mystic hero 's decision to dedicate his life to help others . `` what moments like these signal to me is that the creators do n't have confidence in their own stories , '' hyden says in his video essay . `` they 're using the joke to distract from the film 's dramatic shortcomings . '' in this argument , the resounding success of wonder woman in 2017 reflected a return to genuinely-felt emotion . throughout the movie , gal gadot 's character is self-serious and thoroughly dedicated to the idea of helping others . ",
        "when there are jokes in the film , they accentuate her authenticity , rather than undermine it . though the villains she faces are on the high-end of campy and ridiculous , wonder woman is aspirational and inspirational . she embodies what many people crave most in the world right now -- hope over jadedness . and here is where we return to the last jedi . new tone , old tropeseverything about the new star wars films have reflected different tacks on the beloved property . the force awakens was a soft reboot . j. j. abrams remade the original star wars film to invoke crippling nostalgia on the part of older generations , and made the movie flashy and fast-paced enough to introduce it to the ` younglings . ' ",
        "though it tried to do very few new things -- it featured a new desert planet , a new emperor , a new death star -- it made about $ 2 billion dollars worldwide . well-played , disney , well-played . next , rogue one tried to turn star wars into a gritty war movie . in it , the once-morally-flawless rebels routinely murder people . by the end , all the major characters are killed . but dogfight set-pieces are intact -- and more dramatically effective than ever . turn to the last jedi , and i wonder why we did n't see its sarcastic pivot coming . ",
        "after all , rian johnson has made a career in making genre films that subvert clichés . his first film , brick , is about a hardboiled detective -- set at a southern california high school . looper mocked time-travel tropes . with star wars , why did people think he might change his tune ? from poe dameron 's first prank call to the first order starship , we glean the idea that johnson is out to make a star wars parody . aside from character development and some ham-fisted commentary on arms dealing and horse-racing animal abuse , finn and rose 's side-quest amounts to nothing in terms of the greater plot . ",
        "meanwhile , luke throws away his own lightsaber . in a further subversion of the ` king arthur ' tropes star wars usually employs , rey 's parents turn out to be nobody special . the evil and grotesque snoke is dispatched rather quickly , and we still have no idea who he was . luke did n't really die -- and then he ` dies ' anyway . the sarcastic twists and subversions are so relentless that they no longer feel shocking . it feels like a thesis -- and it is . `` let the past die '' is the refrain touted by the villainous kylo ren . ",
        "sure , that 's fine . this is star wars , jump street-edition . . but to paraphrase an oft-quoted faulkner line , the past is never really dead . it 's not even past -- um , the actual content of the last jedi . the movie still borrows whole set-pieces from other star wars movies . if you wanted to prove your own originality , then why do you need a white-landscaped planet attacked by giant mechanized walkers ? rebel dogfights ? a new cute alien animal perfect for selling plush toys ? sure , there were some inspired twists , like luke 's hamlet/macbeth complex , given his failed assassination of kylo ren . ",
        "but making him a prankster felt out-of-line with his character 's past trajectory of maturation . what 's more , despite the relentless cop-outs and twists , the movie still felt painfully safe . whereas johnson gets so much credit for `` doing something new , '' all he did was turn the tables on j. j. abrams `` mystery box '' ethos -- that creating small mysteries helps hook audiences -- by throwing away each and every one of those boxes . but this feels like the lesser option to nuking the boxes . for instance , what if finn was killed ? ",
        "what if rey turned evil and joined kylo ? what if luke was left alive , now that both his apprentices have turned evil ? the series had an opportunity to dive into truly unexpected territory , an undiscovered country that would have left audiences gasping -- rather than smirking . a long galaxy to go from herej . j. abrams is set to wrap up the trilogy , all the more challenging now that his intended plot threads have been frayed . in all likelihood , he probably will not maintain johnson 's tonal shift , and make a crowd-pleasing , albeit disappointing , thriller -- god forbid , with starkiller base № 2 . ",
        "rian johnson , however , is off to craft a wholly new , unconnected trilogy , which should give him the freedom to craft his ironical tendencies as he pleases . some critics have claimed that the last jedi will be viewed differently , and more favorably in the distant future . i would n't be so optimistic . it 's neither the worst star wars film nor the best . it 'll just be one of maybe 30 star wars movies disney made in the early 21st century , part of the larger `` great american irony binge . '' ",
        "what this ` binge ' really tells us , and wonder woman 's positive reception in spite of it , is that we need something genuine , affecting , and get this -- new . after a decade of widespread sarcasm toward movie tropes , the last jedi is not exactly risky nor fresh , and it 's definitely not new .
