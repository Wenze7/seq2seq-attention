        "an agreement for north korea to send athletes to the winter olympics in the south signals a step change in relations , analysts say , but will do little to curb pyongyang 's nuclear capabilities . the north and south on tuesday held their first official dialogue in more than two years , agreeing that pyongyang would send a large delegation to next month 's winter olympics and promising further high-level talks . the meeting came after months of confrontation over north korea 's nuclear and missile tests , with both parties seeking to dial down tensions . `` both sides wanted to win and they got it , '' said john delury , a professor at seoul 's yonsei university . ",
        "seoul and olympic organizers have been keen for pyongyang -- which boycotted the 1988 summer games in south korea 's capital -- to take part in what they have repeatedly proclaimed as a `` peace olympics '' in pyeongchang . but the north gave no sign it would do so until leader kim jong-un 's new year speech . it pursued its banned weapons programmes in defiance of united nations sanctions , launched missiles it says are capable of reaching the u. s. , and staged its sixth and most powerful nuclear test . north korea 's participation in the pyeongchang games is a tacit guarantee that it will refrain from such provocations during february and march , when the olympics and paralympics are held . ",
        "seoul and washington also agreed earlier to delay their annual joint military drills -- which pyongyang views as rehearsals for an invasion -- until after the events . go myong-hyun , an analyst at the seoul-based asan institute of policy studies , said north korea secured so-called `` strategic composure '' -- shelter from a possible u. s. military strike which has repeatedly been described as an `` option on the table '' by trump administration officials . `` washington ca n't take any military action against the north during inter-korean talks because it does n't want to be blamed for any hiccups , '' go said . ",
        "but what happens when the lights are turned off at pyeongchang and geopolitics returns to normal on the peninsula ? `` whether this opening can be exploited to promote peace and security beyond the term of the olympics games themselves ... remains to be seen , '' wrote scott snyder of the council on foreign relations . square one despite a handful of agreements reached tuesday , north korea made no promises on its nuclear and missile programmes and its chief delegate lashed out when the issue was raised . ri son-gwon told south korean journalists that denuclearization was not an issue for the two koreas to discuss , saying : `` the target of all our nuclear and hydrogen bombs and icbms and all other sophisticated weapons is the u. s. `` there were `` many problems '' to settle between the two sides , he added , warning of `` unexpected obstacles '' down the road . '' ",
        "got to have a longer game plan and that needs to be happening right now because otherwise , once the olympics ends , we 're right back to square one , '' said delury . otherwise , `` we 're back to , week by week , a missile test in north korea , a tweet from the white house and situation getting worse and worse . `` analysts say south korea could find itself in a tight spot , sandwiched between its desire to improve ties with pyongyang and to work with washington to denuclearize the north . the united states has continuously stressed that the talks should lead to efforts for the north 's complete and verifiable denuclearization . ",
        "`` we all know the motive behind north korea 's sudden willingness to participate in the pyeongchang olympics , '' said an editorial in south korea 's mass-circulation chosun ilbo newspaper . `` it is to divide the south korean government , which wants inter-korean talks , and the u. s. government , which wants the denuclearization of the north , '' it said . president moon jae-in has long supported engagement with the north to bring it to the negotiating table over banned weapons programmes that have alarmed the u. s. and the global community , and have seen pyongyang subjected to multiple sets of un sanctions . ",
        "but the u. s. has said north korea must stop nuclear tests in order for negotiations with washington to take place . `` at some point , south korea will face a dilemma between pushing ahead with inter-korean ties or joining washington 's efforts to dismantle the north 's nuclear programmes , '' said kim hyun-wook , a professor at the korea national diplomatic academy . doveish president moon may not easily give up on the progress with pyongyang , kim said , `` which is bound to create noise in the alliance '' .
