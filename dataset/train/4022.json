        "my day 9 of the writing challengeone of my aunts said , `` i 'm sorry '' when i had a cold that she had nothing to do with . that leads me to think : i 'm also canadian , is this a stereotype , or are we always this way ? a comedian once said that we 're the ` designated driver ' of global peacekeeping forces ; we walk behind american ones to apologize for everything they do . when i was in high school , i apologized when i coughed or sneezed . fellow students found that a bit strange , but that was how i rolled . ",
        "in my case , my politeness was just from the way that i was raised to be , not a national thing . i 'm not more polite just because i 'm in canada ; i have rude people in my family here , and i know other montrealers who are anything but polite . stereotypes are very often wrong . take the stereotype that all folks from new york city are rude . one man that i know from there is ... but a guy who married into my family is also from nyc , but neither he nor his family are rude .
