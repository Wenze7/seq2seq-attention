        "even a late , controversial penalty , could n't halt peps men as a much changed side progressed to the semi finals at the kp . nine changes from the weekend victory over spurs saw only gundogan and mangala retain their starting spots . things looked secure after bernardo had put the visitors up midway through the first half . but , as we know in football , one goal is never enough . when the fourth official indicated the amount of stoppage time to be played you knew leicester would have time to initiate other attacks . so how did our ` second ' string blues do last night ? ",
        "bravo -- 7 . did well in the penalty shoot out , again . did show a few signs of last seasons claudio bravo during the game though . all in all a better display than last seaosn though . danilo -- 5 . again looked uncomfortable . maybe this league , coutnry climate etc is not good for danilo . certainly we are not getting what we might have expected from this player . mangala -- 5 . after a couple of decent performances in the league , this game he was off a little . substituted with ten minutes of the second half remaining he did n't concede a goal . ",
        "adarabioyo -- 7 . a great experience for the youngsters in this game . particularly tosin and zinchenko who did have to face vardy , okazaki and mahrez for some , if not all the game . got in a decent position forward also , although his header went wide . zinchenko -- 7 . same as tosin . equipped himself well and played reasonable comfortably on the left . toure -- 6 . said it before , guy has maybe a handful of games left in a city shirt . fantastic servant for the club and will be remembered for his fa cup goals and what he has done earlier in his career with us . ",
        "gundogan -- 8 . fantastic run into the box to set up the goal . starting to look the player we were promised . foden -- 6 . again , with the youth , it is all about getting that experience and minutes under your belt . phil did that , and did n't look out of place running at people . exciting prospect and maybe , in a couple of seasons , he will be a regular . bernardo -- 8 . scored the goal which so nearly saw us through in normal time . looked lively and maybe finally getting used to the english game . ",
        "we can certainly hope so . jesus -- 7 . first choice attacker starting with no aguero to be seen . offers something different to aguero but , unlike aguero , still has n't scored in december . diaz -6 . just like foden , any minutes completed at this level is all good for the future . walker -- 6 . got the wrong side of gray , who went down easily . penalty was converted to take us to extra time . nmecha -- 6 . did well for the time he was on , and considering the momentum was against us shortly after his arrival on the field . ",
        "dele-bashuri -- 6 . good to see another youth prospect get minutes . maybe he got a little more than pep expected , but it is all good for their futures . more from man city square carabao quarter final : potential city lineup1 d ago manchester city : pep tutors tottenham2d ago manchester city : matchday 18 ratings3d ago manchester city : eleven to face spurs4d ago manchester city : lessons from the liberty6d ago even a late , controversial penalty , could n't halt peps men as a much changed side progressed to the semi finals at the kp .
