        "miami - people who are hospitalized for opioids -- including prescription painkillers and heroin -- are four times more likely to die than they were 15 years ago , a us study said monday . white people who are over 50 and have lower incomes are the hardest hit by the spike , said the findings in the journal health affairs . in 2000 , less than one half of one percent of opioid-driven hospitalizations resulted in death , compared to 2.02 percent in 2014 , said the study , led by harvard university researchers . `` more than 35,000 people died from heroin and synthetic opioid overdoses last year , '' said study senior author zirui song , an assistant professor of health care policy at harvard medical school . ",
        "with the nation in the grips of a worsening opioid epidemic , reasons for the rise in mortality include the growing potency of heroin and the rising use of fentanyl , which is often deadly . the rate of opioid-driven hospitalizations has remained relatively stable , but `` patients are increasingly likely to be hospitalized for more deadly conditions such as opioid poisoning or heroin poisoning , '' said the report . prior to 2000 , most opioid hospitalizations were for opioid dependence and abuse . death rates are unchanged among people admitted to hospital for other kinds of non-opioid drugs . ",
        "the study is the first to focus on patients whose primary diagnosis was related to opioids . it also included people with both public and private insurance . `` these results are just scratching the surface of what health professionals and policymakers could use to help patients and the public , and the picture they paint is concerning , '' said song . `` as the united states combats the opioid epidemic , efforts to help hospitals respond to the increasing severity of opioid intoxication are acutely needed , especially in vulnerable and disabled populations .
