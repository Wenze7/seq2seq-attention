        "in 2010 a spate of suicides at factories in southern china owned by foxconn , a contract manufacturer for some of the world 's leading electronics brands , highlighted poor conditions faced by its assembly workers . foxconn promised to improve working conditions , but reports of further suicides or attempted suicides have continued to dog the company . three years later , more than 1,000 bangladeshi workers were crushed to death when the rana plaza just outside dhaka collapsed . the building was not designed to carry the weight and vibration of production machinery , yet had housed dozens of illegal factories producing clothes for a range of international brands . ",
        "the financial savings incentive for suppliers to hire child workers , impose excessive overtime , use unsafe factories , or procure raw material from unsustainable sources increases with the scale of productionin southeast asia , for several years owners of palm oil plantations have been blamed for burning large swathes of forest , causing periodic bouts of toxic haze to blanket the region . palm oil is a key ingredient in soaps , detergents and a wide range of processed food and other products . these examples share three points in common : outsourcing to low-cost suppliers ; behaviour by suppliers that is frequently illegal or at best irresponsible ; and finally , despite efforts at reform , the illegal or irresponsible behaviour has continued . ",
        "how can brands do better ? following the rana plaza disaster , big name western retailers and clothing manufacturers agreed to improve worker safety . but while steps have been taken , some bangladeshi garment workers still complain of insecurity in the workplace . amid mounting public concern over the recurring haze and pollution in southeast asia , nestle , procter and gamble , and unilever joined the `` roundtable on sustainable palm oil '' and have committed to responsible sourcing of palm oil products . yet open burning of large areas of forest continues across indonesia . the ultimate solution for firms is to cease outsourcing , and instead vertically integrate into the supply chain -- in other words , take direct ownership of several or all stages of production . ",
        "a brand that takes the vertically integrated path would have the appropriate incentives to achieve responsible sourcing . in retail markets , it would face consumers and stakeholders who care about legal and responsible sourcing . in the supply chain , it would have full control over employment , working conditions , factory safety , and the production of raw materials . unilever , for example , has committed to procuring all of its agricultural raw materials from sustainable sources by the year 2020 . yet by the very nature of the production process , palm oil derivatives are shipped over long distances , creating serious challenges when tracing their origin . ",
        "in response , unilever decided to literally take ownership of the problem . in 2013 , it set up a palm kernel oil processing plant in sumatra , indonesia , and said it was considering similar investments in processing crude palm oil derivatives -- all with the aim of achieving `` traceable supplies '' . what if brands do not want to go as far as vertical integration ? the conventional approach is to draw up a code of conduct and enforce it through monitoring by in-house teams and third-party compliance specialists . the consortiums for safe work in bangladesh and the `` roundtable on sustainable palm oil '' illustrate this approach . ",
        "my research with colleagues at the national university of singapore and university of hong kong points to another way . contract suppliers benefit from an economy of scale in bad behaviour . the financial savings incentive for suppliers to hire child workers , impose excessive overtime , use unsafe factories , or procure raw material from unsustainable sources increases with the scale of production . an obvious way to reverse this is to reduce the scale of production and spread the required quantity over more suppliers . in a case study of chinese contract factories used by sportswear manufacturer nike , we found evidence consistent with this strategy of spreading orders combined with enforcement . ",
        "factories that were located further from the regional hubs of beijing , shanghai , and guangzhou were smaller . more distant factories are costlier for the brand to monitor , and so would have more incentive to engage in bad behaviour . to counteract this , the brand should temper the scale of production at each supplier and spread the required quantity over more suppliers . spreading production over more suppliers also helps to diversify risks in the supply chain . of course , the strategy of tempering scale and spreading production to induce more responsible behaviour must be balanced against other considerations for optimising the supply chain . ",
        "these include economies of scale in production , logistics costs , and government regulation . dr ivan png is distinguished professor in the nus business school and department of economics at the national university of singapore .   "
