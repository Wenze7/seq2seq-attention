        "chelsea travelled up to the north-west to take on an everton side resurgent under new boss sam allardyce . coming into the game chelsea , themselves were in good form in all competitions . with alvaro morata sidelined through suspension , conte chose to play a 3-4-3 formation with eden hazard being flanked by pedro and willian . for everton , wayne rooney was missing through illness . chelsea made a positive start . a quick ball into the box by victor moses almost found hazard , but he could n`t quite get the crucial touch . with liverpool and arsenal playing out a 3-3 draw on friday , a win for the blues would see them extend the gap from third place to fourth by six points . ",
        "ten minutes in and chelsea should have taken the lead , only two goal line clearances by phil jagielka in quick succession prevented it . chelsea dominated possession early and hazard was looking like a man totally on top of his game , it ` s no wonder real madrid are desperate to get hold of him . the only concern for conte was the fact his side were creating , but no goal came . their build up play at times , though , was breathtaking . they lacked a finishing touch from somebody . it ` s a frustration that has become familiar to chelsea fans in recent weeks . ",
        "everton ` s attempts to stop chelsea ` s playmakers saw them pick up two yellow cards , whilst on the sidelines antonio conte stood conducting his players around the pitch as they searched for a breakthrough . pedro was played in on goal by tiemoue bakayoko , as goal attempts number grew . the spaniard fired hard at the goal but jordan pickford spectacularly pushed the ball away . as the half wore on chelsea were still looking the likelier to score . however , with the half time whistle imminent , everton had what was probably the best chance of the half . ",
        "andreas christensen allowed dominic calvert-lewin to get the ball whilst trying to sheperd it out . with gylfi sigurdsson in space in the penalty area , the youngster chose to shoot , only to see his effort blocked . sam allardyce made two substitutions at half time and changed formation , as he looked to alter the course of the game . initially though , it made no difference , as chelsea started the half strongly , backs to the wall defending once again keeping chelsea at bay early on . everton were forced to make their final substitutions with just 50 minutes gone when idrissa gueye had to depart through injury . ",
        "the game settled into pattern of scrappy play that most suited the home side , the rotational fouling of eden hazard began , as everton looked to stifle the belgian ` s build up play . conte made his first change of the afternoon with 25 minutes remaining , bringing cesc fabregas on for pedro . as the toffees sat deep , chelsea would need something special to find the win they desperately craved . conte ` s second change came with the introduction michy batshuayi for the ineffective willian . the hope being the one-time sup-sub could find that crucial goal . ",
        "the game was crying out for an n`golo kante cracker . chelsea very nearly took the lead when victor moses swung a cross in that ashley williams deflected onto the crossbar at pace . would the goal ever come . conte made his final change with ten minutes remaining , davide zappacosta replacing moses . chelsea continued to press , but still everton held firm . it was very frustrating to watch . a late goal saw bournemouth defeated , could someone find the winner . as the game entered injury time the scoreline remained goalless , and that ` s how the game ended , chelsea just could n`t find a way through a staunch everton defence .
