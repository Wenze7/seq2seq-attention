        "like many of us i 'm sure you have had your moments where you do n't really want to be brave but life means that you have to be . going somewhere because someone you love would like to go there , taking a step in your career because you have to rather than because you want to . confrontation when someone wrongs us ... . there is always going to be moments where we do n't want to do something . but what about when you have to do something ? how can you fake bravery until you feel it ? ",
        "here are my thoughts on the matter : keep your reasons for doing something clear . as you can imagine i 've been in the midst of change . i know in my heart of hearts that although i hate being brave and facing change head on i have to do exactly what i am doing to find my happiness . when these moments of doubt creep in i try to make sure that i take a step back before doing something i may regret . stepping back from the fear of change i remind myself of my reasons for the change . ",
        "because what i 'm doing does n't speak to my soul . because my future does n't look the way it should if i stay on the wrong track . because i 'm not happy . giving yourself a short , sharp burst of remembrance is often enough to get you back on track . a reality check . `` just because something is right , wo n't make it easy '' my own experiences with change have rarely been easy transitions . with the quickness of our lives it 's all too simple to assume that we should just get what we want without doing the work to back it up , however , i realise more and more that the best things in life do n't come with a click of a button . ",
        "instead , they come with work , and that work means being realistic with yourself . to change , is to be brave and to be brave you have to be prepared to work for the outcome you want . you ca n't buy happiness or have it guaranteed just because you 'd like it that day . you can only change , when you work to make it happen . look back , just do n't go that way . in the midst of big decisions and being brave there is always a moment where you think about the easy way out . ",
        "you think if i go back to the old way then it will be easier . i can succeed at that . but the thing is , maybe you could succeed at it quicker , but it 's not going to make you very happy in the end right ? what i 'm saying here is this , do n't repeat old mistakes because its easier , after all , you 're not going that way so stop trying to step backward . forward is the only way to be brave and to make change . bravery in conclusion . ",
        "there 's something to be said for actually learning bravery . i think it 's easy to be considered a trait you either have or you do n't . but honestly , i think we all have the capacity to learn bravery . in fact being brave means activity trying to be that way . any of us can be brave , its an act we have to practice to be good at and ultimately that 's how we overcome the fear . when you do n't want to be brave is exactly the moment where we need to practice being braver than we feel . ",
        "put our best feet forward , take the plunge and remember this : you only have to be brave when you are doing the right thing . if it does n't feel brave perhaps its too easy for you after all .   "
