        "a total of 2.54 million cars were registered in 2017 . so which were the ten best-selling models ? the figures are in for january 2018 - which cars have you been buying more than anything else ? established brands and models dominate the top 10 list of best-selling cars in the uk and the hatchback rules supreme . however , the latest sales figures show that some newer additions to britain 's roads are growing in popularity , despite an overall slowing down of market sales . britain 's best-selling cars of 2018 : ford fiesta -- 13,536 registrationsthe fiesta has been a british favourite for decades and that shows no signs of changing , even though the latest incarnation is now eight years old and its replacement is soon to arrive . ",
        "its sales figures are well ahead of the closest rivals ' , even though it 's not the cheapest choice in the segment . the fiesta 's sales performance is well deserved , though . the ford supermini as hugely impressive , as our four-star review proves . we particularly like its ride and handling , interior quality and smooth engine range . 2 : volkswagen golf - 7237 registrationsthe golf is another classic name in motoring that attracts legions of diehard fans to keep it riding high in the charts , even with volkswagen 's recent scandal . emissions concerns aside , the seventh-generation golf , including newly introduced facelifted version , is a consummate all-rounder - so much so that it was actually june 's best-selling car . ",
        "in our 4.5-star review , we called it the best hatchback in the world , and we 'll stand by that assessment . 3 : ford focus -- 6157 registrationsthe focus has delivered an outstanding drive since it replaced the escort with aplomb in 1998 , offering impressive road manners at a volume price . it has been so good , in fact , that we were slightly disappointed by the diluted dynamics of the latest version . however , as our review notes , it 's still a very appealing , complete car . it looks good , has a strong , economical engine range and offers a lot of quality for its price . ",
        "4 : vauxhall mokka x -- 5292 registrationsvauxhall 's mokka x occupies the hotly-contested small suv segment , along with the likes of the seat arona and nissan juke . the mokka has always been one of vauxhall 's strongest cars in the uk , appearing in the lower half of the monthly top ten frequently , although sales are never strong enough to keep it there over rivals from overseas . it 's currently the best-selling car in its segment in the uk , though , with the top suv , the nissan qashqai , occupying the market segment above the mokka x. 5 : mercedes-benz a-class - 5029 registrationsmercedes ' smallest model climbs from tenth last year to sixth so far in 2018 , stretching its lead over rivals like the audi a3 and bmw 1 series close behind . ",
        "there 's a new model arriving in showrooms later this year , which can both help sales with the excitement of a new model and deals available on examples of the outgoing car , and hinder them , with the changeover period required to introduce a new car to market . 6 : nissan qashqai -- 4896 registrationsis it really a decade since nissan 's now ubiquitous crossover first arrived ? its blend of hatchback size and suv pretensions have proved a huge draw for customers and it 's now the best-selling small suv in the country , leaving a trail of imitators in its wake . ",
        "the second-generation model , released in 2014 , keeps dynamic , economic and interior standards high , garnering a 4.5-star review from our road test team . no wonder it 's holding firm in the sales charts . 7 : ford kuga -- 4132 registrationsbritain 's fourth-best-selling suv , and ninth best-seller overall is the kuga , as ford 's hold on the uk market strengthens in 2018 . it 's decent-handling , refined and rides well , as well as having that magic combination of being an suv and having the blue oval on its snout and rear , so it 's little wonder it 's sold so well , so far . ",
        "just seven cars separated the kuga from the vauxhall corsa in january . 8 : kia sportage -- 3774 registrationstestament to the strength of the suv in 2018 is the kia sportage - a new entry into the top 10 , and a rival to the nissan qashqai . it 's the second-best-selling suv on the market , in a top ten more populated by the high-riding models than ever before . sales are buoyant after exactly two years of being on forecourts , although at such an early stage of the year and with several direct rivals arriving in the coming months , whether it retains its lofty position is yet to be seen . ",
        "9 : mercedes-benz c-class - 3677 registrationsit 's unusual for a premium car to find itself in the top 10 , but it 's testament to the c-class 's appeal , particularly among fleet customers , that it 's shifting so many units for mercedes . looking like a miniature s-class does n't hurt the latest version , which was launched in 2014 . it 's an excellent offering that garnered a four-star review from our test team , who fell for its high-quality interior and alluring looks . good residual values do it no harm , either . 10 : vauxhall corsa -- 3634 registrationsthe corsa is another established doyen in the uk and vauxhall 's perennial rival to the fiesta . ",
        "the latest generation arrived in 2014 and offers something for most people , from the 74bhp 1.4-litre petrol option to the 202bhp snorting vxr version . it 's competitively priced , drives and rides well and is designed and specced to please the car 's large fan base . it 's slid from fifth overall last year to eighth this year , although a facelifted version - overdue in the average product life cycle - should spruce up sales . january car sales in uk drop 6.3 % with diesel heavy hitthe most expensive number plates sold in the ukthe 12 most expensive cars sold at auction .
