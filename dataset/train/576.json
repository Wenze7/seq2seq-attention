        "focus on smart goals & rock your resolutions in the new year ! ' t is the season ... to make resolutions you hope to stick with but probably wo n't . you know them -- resolutions like getting healthier , learning another language or personal growth skill , reading more , developing a new hobby , getting a new job , saving more money , traveling more and so on . the list of things we want to change or improve upon often seems to have no end , which is actually pretty great ! the bad news is that statistics show most of us wo n't make it into february with our best intentions still intact . ",
        "the good news is that it does n't have to be that way -- as long as we 're smart about it . for years , managers have used smart goals to help their businesses , projects , and employees succeed . smart goals are specific , measurable , achievable , relevant and time-bound . but smart goals are n't just for business . they can be used in pretty much every area of life where a change of any size or type is desired . how to make smart resolutionsspecific : are you absolutely clear on what success looks like for your resolution ? ",
        "let 's take the ones mentioned above -- which were at or near the top of the most popular resolutions based on google search terms occurring from january to october of 2016 . none are specific enough to tip the scales of success in anyone 's favor . instead of ` get healthier ' , how about ` add a vegetable to at least one meal each day ' . rather than ` read more ' , what if you said ` read at least one blog post/book chapter/news story/magazine article a day ' in place of ` save more money ' , what if you went with ` save $ 15 each week ' -- or whatever amount best suits your budget . ",
        "the point is to take out as much ambiguity as possible so that you can clearly see paths to success . measurable : peter drucker famously said ` you ca n't manage what you do n't measure ' and he was right . if you 're not measuring anything , how do you know if you 've made any progress ? no matter what your goal is -- track it . did you decide to add that vegetable to one of your meals ? great ! how about keeping a food journal to measure how successful you are at each meal ? ",
        "maybe you decided to develop a new hobby such as crochet or wreath making ? terrific ! how about creating a pinterest board to track your projects -- and your progress ? there are so many ways to keep track of every gain you make , and it 's one of the absolute best ways to reinforce your commitment and keep you on the road to success . achievable : this is where your inner realist keeps your inner dreamer in line . ðŸ˜‰ if ` get healthier ' to you means ` lose 150 pounds ' you 'll need to be sure it 's a goal you can manage without it managing you . ",
        "just as you would n't set the bar too low for your goals , you also do n't want to set it so high or unrealistic that you lose your momentum , enthusiasm and , ultimately , your drive to see them through . relevant : what does your goal really mean to you ? why does it matter to you enough to make it your focus of attention ? if answers to those questions do n't come easily , the goal is likely not very relevant to you and , therefore , probably not very achievable for you . ",
        "it 's no secret that a lot of people make decisions to change this or that because of societal , professional or some other outward pressure that does n't really resonate on a personal level . so , whether it 's losing weight , learning mandarin or getting a job a new job -- if your ultimate goal is n't pertinent to you , your principles or your passions , you may be better off not doing it at all . time-bound : this is the timeline you give yourself to reach your goal . and , just as you would n't set the bar too low or too high on what 's achievable , you should n't be too lenient or too aggressive with the amount of time you believe it will take to sanely hit your target . ",
        "a great way to do this is to create smaller benchmark goals along the way so that you 're recording successes all along the path of your progress . maybe your goal of ` save more money ' was made more specific by updating it to ` save $ 5,000 in 12 months ' and you worked out the math for your budget to determine that you wo n't be able to save the same amount each month . if you set benchmarks for the tougher months , say a mid-month checkbook check-in with yourself , it can help keep you comfortably on track and in control . ",
        "as you 're reflecting back over 2017 and thinking about what you 'd like to do differently in 2018 , remember that starting smart can dramatically boost your chances of success ! #resolutions #newyear #change #goals #smartgoals #abetteryou #improveoriginally published at www . gretchenskalka . com on december 20 , 2017 .
