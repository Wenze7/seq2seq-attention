        "described as a `` unicorn '' property by the listing agent , this two-story condominium housed in a brick building in virgina-highland is quite the anomaly for the neighborhood . built in 1986 , the 1,206-square-foot home serves up two bedrooms and two bathrooms along with built-in shelves and a gas fireplace in the living room . the listing states the kitchen has been updated with corian countertops , stainless appliances , and maple cabinetry ; it 's not clear , though , when that update was executed given these features are n't the current trend . the balcony overlooking the interior courtyard is also an interesting contradiction . ",
        "squeezed in between two walls , it first comes across as private and cozy , but further inspection makes it seem a bit cramped . one definite bonus for the condo is the one-car garage , something not common for the surrounding community . additional parking is available behind the building , and the home also comes with a storage unit . magical ! the building stands an easy walk away from virginia-highland 's shops and restaurants , and the stroll to piedmont park and the beltline 's eastside trail is manageable , especially for outdoor enthusiasts . with the asking price of $ 315,000 on target for this desirable area , the condo may experience a short life on the market . ",
        "after all , unicorns are rarely available . 1170 highland ave. , unit 7a .   "
