        "live edmonton alberta finance minister joe ceci says a series of draft policies in a united conservative party document are `` risky and extreme '' for the province and the tax changes alone could cost billions . ceci made himself available to reporters thursday to discuss a ucp committee 's proposed policies , which have yet to be approved but include a return to a flat income tax and various arguments for providing publicly-funded private health services . ceci said that adopting the flat tax would mainly benefit wealthier albertans while resulting in about a `` $ 700-million hole '' in the provincial budget . ",
        "`` this is risky and extreme , and it 's not in the interest of alberta , '' said ceci , who estimated all the tax changes proposed by the ucp could end up costing billions of dollars . `` you know , i only got to page two of this document , '' ceci told reporters at the alberta legislature . `` i 'm sure if i got to page three , four , five , six he 'll talk about blowing up hospitals and saving money that way , '' ceci added , referring to ucp leader jason kenney . ",
        "draft policies distributed to ucp members last week , the ucp distributed a 21 page `` member policy declaration '' paper to party members to promote discussion before the party 's founding convention in may , said party executive director janice harrington . the document covers a broad range of policy areas , including health , energy , education , arts and culture and finance . among other suggestions , it calls for the elimination of alberta 's two per cent small business tax , and a return to a 10 percent flat tax . a 10.5 percent flat tax rate was adopted in 2000 under the progressive conservative government of former premier ralph klein , but dropped by the new ndp government in 2015 . ",
        "the pc government under former premier jim prentice had indicated it was ready to eliminate the flat tax rate before the pc government was defeated in the 2015 election . on the topic of heath , the ucp document says the united conservative party believes the government of alberta should allow for `` publicly-funded , privately-delivered health services to improve delivery efficiency and lower costs . '' that could `` address excessive wait - imes '' and `` improve delivery efficiency and lower costs . '' it also says the province 's budget should be balanced by the end of the first term of a new ucp government , which would be in 2023 , four years after the scheduled 2019 election . ",
        "`` i do n't get that , '' said cecii , who noted his government has talked about a `` path to balance '' of the budget by 2023-2024 , but without `` the reckless and extreme approaches being talked about by '' kenney and the ucp . ceci said the government 's plan for balancing the books will be included in the spring budget . consultation and surveys harrington said the final ucp policy paper may change after a full consultation , including two surveys , are done with ucp members and the issues are presented and discussed at the may convention . ",
        "`` what it 's going to look like may be completely different from what 's being proposed right now , '' said harrington . policies can be added for consideration by constituency associations or groups of at least 10 people . the ucp policy document was developed by members of the ucp policy committee , formed under an agreement in principle that was part of the merger of the former wildrose and pc parties , said harrington . ` those members just took a look at what had been historical policies for both legacy parties , then also their own ideas about some timely and topical issues , as well as some things they thought members would be interested in discussing , '' harrington explained . ",
        "despite the fact the paper has not been officially adopted as a campaign platform by the ucp , ceci characterized it as a `` glimpse of what the future alberta will look like under jason kenney . '' `` a life under jason kenney and gang , '' said ceci , `` would be back to the bad old days when they cut , cut cut cut . ''   "
