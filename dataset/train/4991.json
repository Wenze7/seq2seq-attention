        "or , what `` meridian creators '' is all about . in my opinion , creating and appreciating art in all its forms has always been the best way to connect with others , while also learning about yourself and where you stand . the way each individual person connects with art has always been fascinating to me , and in my head , i picture each person and their ideas falling somewhere on a grid , much like the invisible meridians that encircle our planet . since december 2012 , i have been interviewing up-and-coming musicians in nashville on a freelance basis . ",
        "i never found a good fit for a publication to work for full-time -- so going into 2018 , i finally decided to create my own . this , plus the images i mentioned in the first paragraph , are what gave way to meridian creators . starting out , i will be writing a weekly piece on local artists , and hopefully i will gain enough interest that other writers across the country will want to contribute pieces about their local artists as well . the goal is to eventually be able to hire and pay regularly-contributing journalists and an editor . ",
        "to be able to do this , i have launched a patreon page where readers can view behind the scenes updates and special messages from the artists i will be interviewing by subscribing to donate on a monthly basis . artistswhether you paint , dance , sing , or bake -- if you create art , i want to feature you on meridian creators ! you do n't have to be located in tennessee , as i am more than willing to schedule a phone or video interview . if you yourself are an artist who would like to be featured on meridian creators , or if you have any leads on artists to speak with , please shoot me an email at meridiancreators@gmail . ",
