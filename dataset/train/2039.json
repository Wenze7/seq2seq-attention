",
        "five ateliers were in place for the day in hermès ' sweeping location . at one , people could see how to wax shoes using john lobb products , while another was all about shoelaces . visitors learned the knack of sewing buttons onto hermès pouches , plus used their creativity in pasting leather and silk scraps onto notebooks , and making small leather earphone holders . nearby , an artisan hammered nails that ultimately would create the shape of the petit h logo on a wall . hermès also invited visitors to sample various culinary delights whose recipes were concocted to echo the various ateliers .
