        "rangers supporters have been drowning their sorrows in the transfer tavern over the festive period following their side 's disappointing back-to-back defeats in the scottish premiership , although they 'll hope for improvement when the gers host motherwell this evening . graeme murty 's men were riding a wave in second place in the table following a fourth successive league victory over hibernian on december 13 , but all that optimism has since dissipated following successive losses . the scottish giants went down 3-1 at home to st johnstone on december 16 before succumbing to steve clarke 's kilmarnock in their final game before christmas , two results that have seen them slip to third and 14 points adrift of celtic at the summit . ",
        "subsequently , there have been many downbeat rangers fans in the tavern in recent times , yet their mood may be improved by a recent report from the sun , which suggests that the gers are seeking a move for west brom striker tyler roberts when the transfer window reopens next week . the 18-year-old came up through the ranks at the hawthorns yet has since featured just once for the first team , which saw him come off the bench in their 1-1 draw with liverpool back in may 2016 . loan spells at oxford united , shrewsbury town , and currently walsall have since followed for the wales under-21 international , with his five goals in 15 games for the saddlers this term appearing to attract the interest of rangers , who have reportedly made ` contact ' with parent club west brom about taking roberts on loan in january . ",
        "and with the gers arguably in need of further attacking reinforcements ahead of the second half of the campaign , and roberts ' future seemingly uncertain given he 's out of contract in the summer , it 's a move which could well take place next month . landlord 's verdict : only two players have managed over five goals for rangers this season , so reports that manager graeme murty is seeking attacking reinforcements in january are hardly much of a surprise . and one man who appears to have caught his eye is west brom 's tyler roberts , who has bagged five goals in 15 games for league one side walsall so far this term , adding to the four he got in just 13 appearances for shrewsbury town last time round . ",
        "and with the 18-year-old 's contract at the hawthorns up in the summer , his future is far from certain , and rangers are seeking to exploit that having reportedly made ` contact ' with the baggies about a loan move in january . and were that to happen , it surely would increase the possibility to landing roberts permanently come the end of the campaign . rangers fans ... what do you make of the news ? let us know !
