        "u. s. stock markets tumbled on friday -- before creeping back up -- upon news that president donald trump 's former national security adviser michael flynn would plead guilty to providing false statements to the fbi , as part of the ongoing probe into trump 's campaign ties to russia . the fact that the gop tax plan , which is being sold as pro-business , is hurtling toward passage in the senate seems to have cushioned the blow for the day , with both the dow jones industrial average and the s&p 500 down only about 0.2 % as of market close friday , according to google finance . ",
        "for the longer term , the main question -- as former ethics counsel to president barack obama norm eisen pointed out on twitter -- is whether investors are underestimating the odds that the investigation could implicate trump personally , and the effects that could have on market uncertainty . though abc initially reported that flynn is prepared to testify against trump personally , it later deleted a tweet with that assertion and issued a `` clarification '' that suggested the earlier report was misleading . here is a screenshot of the earlier tweet that was deleted . meanwhile , a report by nbc suggests jared kushner could be a person of interest in the investigation by robert mueller 's team . ",
        "twitteras the first news broke , stocks started to fall . at one point , the dow jones industrial average -- a group stocks in the 30 of the largest u. s. companies that 's often used as a bellwether for the market as a whole -- had fallen by 350 points . it is generally hard to pinpoint a single reason when the stock market rises or falls , but one analyst told bloomberg that thanks to the flynn news , investors `` kind of have the rug jerked out of the trump trade , '' a stock market bet that the administration would pursue more business friendly policies . ",
        "but as politico 's ben white noted , the stock market usually falls for a spell on bad news for trump before rebounding . that 's in part because vice president mike pence is expected to pursue broadly similar policies as trump in the event that he ever becomes president himself . interestingly enough , the dip came just a day after the market hit a new 24,000 point high on hopes that the senate was close to passing a bill to overhaul the tax code . back in october , goldman sachs warned that without tax reform in the picture , stocks were likely `` overvalued . '' ",
        "that 's another way of saying that investors had already driven up stock prices in anticipation of tax reform that has n't happened yet -- and a correction or fall could occur if the bill fails to pass . want to learn more about the stock market ? here 's the payoff 's guide to investing and a basic explainer on investment concepts . sign up for the payoff -- your weekly crash course on how to live your best financial life . dec. . 1 , 2017 , 10:00 p. m. : this story has been updated .
