        "put the cookie down -- researchers create app to predict and intervene in users ' oversharon gaudin december 12 , 2017carolina ruiz , left , associate professor of computer science at worcester polytechnic institute , and bengisu tulu , associate professor in wpi 's foisie business school , are the developers of a smartphone app known as slipbuddy , which integrates behavioral strategies and technologies like mobile devices , machine learning , and text mining to help users avoid overeating . credit : worcester polytechnic institute researchers at worcester polytechnic institute and the university of connecticut are collaborating on a smartphone app aimed at helping users manage their overeating challenges in three key ways : by tracking eating patterns , providing interventions , and helping change behavior . ",
        "the app -- and its distinctive methodology -- showed tremendous promise in an early pilot study . a paper on the research was recently presented at the annual symposium for the american medical informatics association , a nonprofit organization that focuses on the development of information technology to benefit healthcare . the wpi/uconn research report noted that a user study of 16 participants , all over the age of 18 , overweight , and not necessarily trying to lose weight , showed positive results . at the end of the month-long pilot , nine of the participants lost an average of five pounds , three weighed the same , and four gained an average of two pounds . ",
        "the paper 's co-authors include the project 's principal investigators : bengisu tulu , associate professor in wpi 's foisie business school ; carolina ruiz , associate professor of computer science at wpi ; and sherry pagoto , professor of allied health sciences at the university of connecticut and director of uconn 's center for mhealth and social media . the research team 's three-pronged approach is an important differentiator in a crowded marketplace . according to a 2017 report in the international journal of obesity , there are nearly 29,000 weight-related apps on the market , with most focused only on tracking physical activity , calories , and body weight . ",
        "the drawback with most weight-loss apps is that they are burdensome to use and do n't focus on actually trying to change the user 's behavior . the wpi/uconn app , dubbed slipbuddy , is built to do just that . in addition to tracking stress and eating , it 's a personalized intervention system built through the integration of behavioral strategies and technologies like mobile devices , machine learning , and text mining . the work is aimed at helping users identify what triggers them to overeat and inserting new stimuli that , instead , trigger healthy behaviors . ",
        "the app 's name , slipbuddy , recognizes that it 's easy to `` slip up '' when trying to change unhealthy behaviors . its reminders help users keep accountable to a `` buddy '' that suggests better behaviors in a nonjudgmental way . slipbuddy is designed to keep user interaction simple . users are asked to check in three times a day to note their stress levels , fatigue , and hours of sleep , and whenever they feel they 've overaten . over time , as the app collects information , the system uses machine learning to find patterns that can be used to predict when the user is likely to overeat . ",
        "the app uncovers user-specific triggers , like late-night eating , watching tv , or sleepless nights . when the app predicts that the likelihood of overeating is high , it suggests interventions -- for example , taking a walk , turning off the tv , or engaging in other activities that can help users reduce stress without resorting to eating . `` mobile technology , which is ubiquitous today , has the capacity to deliver evidence-based weight loss interventions with lower cost and user burden than traditional intervention models , '' ruiz said . at the whiteboard , tulu and ruiz explore enhancements to the slipbuddy app , which could be ready for release as early as 2019 . ",
        "credit : worcester polytechnic instituteobesity affects health and mortality rates worldwide . according to the world health organization , at least 2.8 million people die each year as a result of being overweight or obese . and the problem is getting worse . the number of obese people worldwide has nearly tripled since 1975 . obesity-related health conditions include some of the leading causes of preventable death , such as heart disease , stroke , type 2 diabetes , and certain types of cancer . the global rate of obesity is highest in the americas , the who noted , with 62 percent of the population overweight and 26 percent obese . ",
        "`` i 'm very hopeful that what we 're doing will make a big difference , '' said tulu . `` most weightloss apps are all about tracking something -- tracking your calories , tracking your blood glucose , tracking your steps . this goes beyond that . we 're using machine learning to make this about intervention . `` the researchers are currently working on enhancing the app 's graphical user interface , integrating more intervention tools into the system , and fine-tuning the machine learning algorithms . a larger user study is expected later in 2018 . `` it 's not an easy thing to build , '' said tulu . ",
        "`` most weight-loss apps are developed by technologists , with not enough input from clinical psychologists or psychiatrists . the task is not trivial . we 're working out how to integrate clinical tools into our app . it 's an open question we 're trying to find answers to . `` in addition to work by the three principal investigators , the app has been the focus of two undergraduate major qualifying projects and two national science foundation-funded research experience for undergraduate summer programs . `` this is truly an interdisciplinary project that pushes the boundaries in obesity research , '' said ruiz . ",
        "`` the use of machine learning algorithms to uncover accurate predictive patterns of behavior allows our app to deliver user-centric , evidence-based , personalized approaches to prevent overeating , which will have a positive impact on combating obesity . `` the app was built for the android platform , but eventually will be available for ios devices , as well . while it is still in the research phase , the researchers say the app could be ready for release as early as 2019 . about worcester polytechnic instituteprovided by worcester polytechnic institutethis story is republished courtesy and copyrighted by medical xpress , a popular site that covers news about medical research .
