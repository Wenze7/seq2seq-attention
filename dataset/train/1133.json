        "in the wake of sexual assault and harassment allegations coming out against celebrated celebrity chefs and restaurateurs , anthony bourdain is again reflecting on his own time in the food industry . in a medium post published on tuesday , bourdain wrote about his role in possibly perpetuating a harmful kitchen culture that all started when his first book was published in 2000 . `` to the extent which my work in ` kitchen confidential ' celebrated or prolonged a culture that allowed the kind of grotesque behaviors we 're hearing about all too frequently is something i think about daily , with real remorse , '' bourdain wrote . ",
        "he addressed the allegations against celebrity chef mario batali , whom eight women have accused of sexual misconduct , and restaurateur ken friedman , whom 10 women this week accused of sexual misconduct . `` any admiration i have expressed in the past for mario batali and ken friedman , whatever i might feel about them , however much i admired and respected them , is , in light of these charges , irrelevant , '' bourdain wrote . he added : `` i will not waste anybody 's time with expressions of shock , surprise , or personal upset , beyond saying that i am ashamed that i was clearly not the kind of person that women friends who knew -- and had stories to tell -- felt comfortable confiding in . ",
        "`` the chef and tv personality credited his girlfriend , italian actress and director asia argento , for helping him recognize and speak out against sexual misconduct and inappropriate behavior . `` in these current circumstances , one must pick a side . i stand unhesitatingly and unwaveringly with the women , '' he wrote , later adding , `` right now , nothing else matters but women 's stories of what it 's like in the industry i have loved and celebrated for nearly 30 years . `` head to medium to read the rest of bourdain 's post .
