        "newark , n. j. -- a new jersey court on monday denied the israeli skating federation 's attempt to recover more than $ 500,000 from a woman who sued to be allowed to skate for the united states . the ruling by a three-member appeals court rejected the israeli ice skating federation 's argument that andrea davidovich should pay the federation 's attorneys ' fees , approximately $ 540,000 , because she filed the lawsuit frivolously and should have first appealed to the sports international governing body . davidovich , 20 , who lives in new jersey and has dual u. s.-israeli citizenship , and partner evgeni krasnopolski finished 15th in the pairs competition in the 2014 sochi olympics . ",
        "afterward , davidovich sought to be released from her obligation to the israeli ice skating federation . the israeli federation opposed her release , arguing it would encourage other skaters in whom it had invested substantial resources to take similar action . it said the new jersey court lacked jurisdiction to rule on the dispute , and argued davidovich should have sought a remedy from the international body before turning to the courts . the international skating union granted davidovich 's request in the fall of 2016 , a few months after it revised some of its rules . in its ruling monday , the new jersey court noted that before the isu rules changes , davidovich 's ability `` as an individual skater to seek redress directly from the isu was uncertain . ",
        "she did not deliberately choose to bypass administrative remedies that had yet to be clearly established . `` stuart slotnick , an attorney for davidovich , said the skater `` is thankful that the court recognized that she has a right to pursue her dreams . she now happily puts this unpleasant chapter in her life behind her . `` brian spector , an attorney for the israeli federation , said his clients `` are disappointed with the decision and are evaluating their options .
