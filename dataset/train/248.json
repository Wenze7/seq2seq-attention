        "we 've been going out for a month and we 've had a blast together . but she is to `` shy '' to be seen with me at school . yesterday i went to her house and we cooked and watched half movie . she let me lay kisses on her cheek and grab her by the arm and waist every once in a while as we shared a bed , then a couch and also when we walked to the store she was hugging me and letting grab her waist . before starting watching movies she took charge of getting drinks ready and being alone with the lights off . ",
        "later on i tried to hold her hand and she started resisting and laughing and giggling about it and telling me `` your moving too fast , friend '' . so i did n't took no for an answer and started tickling her and kissing her , as i was trying , so i used my strength and pulled her hand into my mouth and layed a kiss on it and she just kept on laughing repeating the same thing till the point we lost attention to the movie . when it was time to go i gave her a gift with her name on it and then she put her cheek letting me lay another kiss on her . ",
        "she told me she was looking forward to chat with me the next day as i did n't set up another plan afterwards like i 've done after every date . i said `` yeah , we 'll chat soon . '' so she let me lay another kiss on her . then i walked away as she get inside her house . once i got in my car she opened the door again and shouted to me to take care and i replied `` go to sleep '' in friendly way .
