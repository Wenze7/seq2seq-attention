        "teens exposed to traumatic or terror events may have a higher risk for weekly and daily migraines , according to a study of adolescents who survived a terror attack in norway . the findings further the idea that violence and psychological trauma could lead to physical symptoms . `` we have very little systematic knowledge about the physical consequences of terror and violent events , especially since people may not see the association or go to the doctor , '' said study author dr. synne stensland of the norwegian centre for violence and traumatic stress studies at the university of oslo . ",
        "`` there are people who are not getting the help they need for their physical and psychological complaints , especially when they become more severe or frequent , '' she told reuters health by phone . on july 22 , 2011 , a lone gunman opened fire on the annual norwegian labor party youth summer camp . the man , disguised as a policeman , killed 69 people and severely wounded 33 . many of the 358 survivors saw what happened and risked hypothermia and drowning trying to escape . most lost friends . the survivors have been part of several studies to understand how terror and trauma affect adolescents . ",
        "in this study , published in the journal neurology , stensland and colleagues looked at recurrent migraines and tension-type headaches in 213 of the survivors , ages 13 to 20 . trained personnel interviewed the survivors about four months after the attack , again 18 months afterward , and again three years after the attack . the research team found the terror attack survivors reported many recurring tension-type headaches and migraines , and headaches were generally more common in girls . in particular , the female survivors reported three times more weekly or daily headaches than similar young women in the general population in norway . ",
        "posttraumatic psychological distress levels were much higher , too . `` we were surprised . . . the link was so strong between terror and headaches , even though we accounted for , '' stensland said . future studies will continue to observe the physical and psychological symptoms that these teens experience . `` incidents of terror are unfortunately commonplace worldwide , and although the physical effects are well covered , the invisible scars of psychological trauma receive much less attention , '' said dr. gretchen tietjen , director of the headache treatment and research program at the university of toledo , ohio , who was n't involved with this study . ",
        "`` psychological trauma during critical periods of development affects the brain in ways that alter not only the psyche , but also the metabolic , immune , endocrine and nervous systems , '' she told reuters health by email . `` these changes lead to increased susceptibility to a wide variety of adult diseases that may even be passed on to the next generation . '' these associations extend beyond terror events to childhood maltreatment , emotional abuse and sexual violence , stensland added . abuse in peer relationships or social media bullying can have a similar effect . `` they 're keeping a secret and do n't want others to know what happened , '' she said . ",
        "`` it 's important for people to know that an increase in headaches could indicate something has happened , and it 's time to talk . '' stensland would also like to see research on medication and overuse of painkillers . teens may be able to treat their headaches with over-the-counter medicine , but that does n't treat the underlying issues related to the traumatic event , she noted . `` adolescents medicate themselves , and few go to the doctor , but if you keep medicating like that , it may actually contribute to the chronic behavior , '' she said . ",
        "`` seek help early . that 's the key . ''   "
