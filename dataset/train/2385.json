        "green bay , wis. . -- the green bay packers activated quarterback aaron rodgers from injured reserve saturday , a day before he starts sunday in a must-win game at carolina . rodgers broke his right collarbone at minnesota on oct. . 15 , had surgery and was placed on injured reserve on oct. . 20 . he returned to practice on a limited basis on dec. . 2 , was cleared by the team 's medical staff tuesday night and took the first-team reps this week . `` looks like the old aaron back in there , '' quarterbacks coach alex van pelt said thursday . ",
        "the biggest challenge for rodgers ? `` probably just getting used to the speed of the game again , '' van pelt said . `` the pocket movement , the pocket awareness , that 's a natural instinct . i think that 's like riding a bike -- once you have it , you 'll have it . the packers will need the `` old aaron '' to keep their faint playoff hopes alive . green bay went 4-1 to start the season before rodgers was injured on a hit by linebacker anthony barr in week 6 . the packers fell to 5-6 before brett hundley directed back-to-back overtime wins against tampa bay and cleveland . ",
        "at 7-6 , they are in ninth place in the nfc . the panthers are 9-4 and lead the race for the conference 's two wild-card spots . to make room on the roster , green bay released no . 3 quarterback joe callahan . rodgers has n't played for two months and acknowledged he might be a little rusty . heightening the challenge will be the caliber of the opponent . carolina ranks fifth in defense , including seventh against the pass , and third in sacks . `` i feel confident i will be able to go out there and play the way i 've always played , but i 've been off for seven games and been out for a while , '' rodgers said on wednesday . ",
        "`` so it 's going to take getting out there , getting that first pass , getting that first hit , and i 'll probably settle in . `` rodgers has gone through seven practices , including saturday before the team departed for carolina . coach mike mccarthy was pleased with how rodgers looked on thursday , the team 's biggest practice day and the only one conducted in pads . `` whether you 're running the ball or throwing the ball , there 's time clocks on everything , '' mccarthy said on friday . `` as far as the fitted protection , footwork , the quarterback throwing the ball , i thought he had a pretty clean day . ",
        "i was pleased with his work . ''   "
