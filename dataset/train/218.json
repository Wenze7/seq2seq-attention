        "a donkey who was at death 's door with a bad infestation of lice and worms is now a star after taking centre stage in a nativity play . tracy garton , who runs radcliffe donkey sanctuary with her husband , nursed alan the donkey back to health after he was so weak he could not hold his head up . lincoln mum of two , 35 , dies after woman , 80 , swerves onto wrong side of roada member of the public had called the sanctuary about a year ago when alan had been found in a car park - the sanctuary was n't in a position to take him on but tracy felt she could not let him down . ",
        "she said : `` i arrived to find the poor donkey at death 's door . `` he did n't even have the energy to lift his head from the floor . `` his hooves and teeth were horribly overgrown , he was riddled with lice and worms , and his hair had fallen off in clumps . `` even though i 've been running the sanctuary for 25 years , i 've never got used to seeing what humans can do to animals . looking into his deep , sad , brown eyes , i remembered why i was doing this . ",
        "`` tracy and her husband steve worked so hard to nurse alan back to health - they were n't able to give him a full meal as he was so emaciated . `` tracy had no idea whether he 'd survive because the neglect had been so extreme . slowly alan began to perk up - he started eating more and flicked his ears in response to the noises the other donkeys made . lincoln dad , 46 , found dead after friends leave him to sleeptracy said : `` his personality really began to shine through . `` there did n't seem to be anything particularly special about him at first , but as he began to recover , he turned into a right cheeky chappy , almost as if he was thanking us for rescuing him . ",
        "`` he wants to help with any job you are doing -- if you 're fencing , he 'll be away with the hammer , and if you put a coffee down he 'll pick it up by the handle . `` he 's an absolute lovable rogue with the loudest and most horrendous eeyore . if you ignore him then he comes and kicks the gate until you go to him . `` the sanctuary in alford relies on donations and although they had a busy summer with visitors , the budget was still tight to pay for food for the sanctuary 's 60 animals . ",
        "mrs garton said one of the volunteers suggested that the sanctuary should hold a nativity play to help increase funds . tracy said : `` one of our volunteers came up with a festive idea - we 'd make a nativity play with alan as the star , dressed up in some cute reindeer antlers . `` i was sceptical at first , as it sounded like a lot of hard work , but alan had such a funny , cheeky temperament that i could n't resist saying yes . `` over the next few weeks , staff at the sanctuary worked hard to get everything ready , hiring costumes , decorations and even a brass band . ",
        "teenager taken to hospital after van and motorbike crashon the day of the nativity a power cut hit the village - and the sanctuary had to use a generator for the show to go ahead . people living there descended on the sanctuary in their droves . tracy said : `` it could n't have gone better . `` alan was so sweet in his little antlers , and the volunteers were decked out as father christmas and his elves . `` every time the brass band started up a new carol , alan would throw his head back and sing along with his raucous eeyore . ",
        "`` the donations flooded in that night and it made enough money to get the sanctuary through the winter . schools in the area also made several requests for a visit from alan in his antlers . tracy said : `` no matter how much you clean him , he always looks scruffy , but people love him and i know why . `` he brings so much joy to all who meet him . `` hunt to find cyclist after woman left with multiple injuriesradcliffe donkey sanctuarylincoln dad , 46 , found dead after friends leave him to sleeptracy has now written a book about how alan saved the sanctuary that christmas .
