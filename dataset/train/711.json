        "the safety record of the north sea industry is once again under scrutiny after a fatal accident caused bp 's norwegian spin-off to shut off production from the rig while investigations take place . one person was confirmed dead , and another injured , after an accident on a maersk-owned drilling rig in the tambar oil field which is owned by aker bp and london-listed faroe petroleum . karl johnny hersvik , the chief executive of aker bp , said the company has cooperated closely with maersk drilling and will `` do everything we can to take care of those affected and their families in this difficult situation . '' ",
        "faroe , which owns 45pc of the project , said in a statement to the market that the serious accident was reported on thursday afternoon but how the incident occurred has not yet been clarified . `` this is a serious accident , and we will do our utmost to identify the cause . we will make all resources available in the upcoming investigation , '' said mr hersvik . the industry 's rigorous approach to offshore safety has helped cut the number of fatal accidents in the decades since the piper alpha disaster in 1988 in which 167 men lost their lives in the space of two hours . ",
        "in the last decade only 7 work-related fatalities were reported in the uk north sea , compared to nineteen in the decade before . the number of non-fatal injuries last year was less than half those reported in the construction or transport industries . trish sentance , from oil and gas uk , said : `` safety is of paramount importance to our sector and once the investigation into the circumstances is complete , any lessons learned will be shared with industry . '' `` we were saddened to hear of the tragic incident in the norwegian north sea , and our thoughts are with the family , friends and colleagues of the individual who passed away , as well as their injured colleague , '' she added . ",
        "faroe said the well currently being drilled by maersk is secure and production on tambar has been shut down temporarily while an investigation takes place .   "
