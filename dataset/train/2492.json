        "minneapolis -- a minnesota prosecutor said he does n't yet have enough evidence to charge a minneapolis police officer who killed an unarmed australian woman this summer , blaming investigators who `` have n't done their job . `` hennepin county attorney mike freeman is still deciding whether to charge officer mohamed noor , who shot justine ruszczyk damond in the alley behind her home in july . damond had called 911 to report a possible sexual assault . as she approached the squad car , noor fired from the passenger seat , across his partner and through the driver 's window . ",
        "damond 's death sparked protests and led to a police department shake-up , including the resignation of chief janee harteau . freeman was captured on video expressing his frustration at a minneapolis regional labor federation holiday reception wednesday night , after he was asked about a charging decision . union member sam sanchez recorded the conversation and posted it on facebook . it was n't clear if freeman knew he was being recorded . in the video , freeman said he does n't have enough evidence yet to decide whether to charge noor , who has declined to speak with investigators . ",
        "`` i 've got to have the evidence . and i do n't have it yet . and let me just say , it 's not my fault , '' freeman said . `` so if it is n't my fault , who did n't do their jobs ? investigators , and they do n't work for me . and they have n't done their job . `` freeman did n't name the investigators or their agency , but the state bureau of criminal apprehension is leading the investigation . the bca turned the case over to freeman in september . ",
        "the bureau issued a statement thursday saying it continues to work with freeman 's office . `` the bca conducts the majority of officer-involved shooting investigations in minnesota , and the collaboration between prosecutors and investigators as a case file is reviewed under the statutes is a typical part of the review process , '' the bca statement said . `` state law prohibits us from providing additional details , because it is an active investigation . `` freeman had previously said he expected to make a charging decision by the end of the year . his office acknowledged the video thursday and did not dispute its authenticity . ",
        "`` we are working diligently on the case to complete the investigation as soon as possible , '' the statement said . `` beyond that , we can not comment at this time . `` freeman indicated that noor 's refusal to speak had put prosecutors in a difficult position . `` i have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt , the moment he shot the gun , he feared for his life . and he used force because he thought he was gon na be killed , '' freeman said . `` but i ca n't . he wo n't answer my questions because he does n't have to , ok ? ",
        "we all have fifth amendment rights , and i respect that . so i ca n't talk to her because she 's gone , and the other cop just gave us some , ok ? so guess what ? i got ta figure out angles of the shot , gun residues , reckless use of force experts . `` sanchez is also an organizer with the twin cities coalition for justice 4 jamar , which was formed after fatal shooting of jamar clark by a minneapolis police officer in 2015 . freeman decided not to charge the officers involved in that case . ",
        "sanchez told minnesota public radio that he was surprised by freeman 's honesty , but disheartened that he has n't yet made a decision .   "
