        "everyone and their mother loves reptiles . that is why as a kid i never had one . because i did not want to conform what society had expected of me . i saved that shit for middle school . instead , i drank orange juice and listened to the clean version of the marshall mathers lp to really gain an edge on my peers . reptiles have scales but share no relation with ph. there is a popular conspiracy theory out there , maybe created by my long lost fifth uncle , that underneath our desirable human skin is reptilian skin ! ",
        "as someone who grew up in new england i know all about layers . that is where christopher nolan gained inspiration for inception , from small new england folk bundled up in ll bean drinking vodka mixed with hot chocolate . a real northern treat . nonetheless , now more than ever is the time to rebrand this conspiracy theory for the modern youth ! modern youth are attached to technology . let us create a marketing campaign that will infiltrate their facebook news feed and instagram stories . every campaign needs a spokesperson . i declare , without any discussion with this person before hand , that owen wilson leads the charge on this campaign ! ",
        "look at that man ! whatever he tells me i will without any critical thinking believe . he is famous , good looking , and has been memed into the eternal afterlife for saying `` wow ! '' `` wow '' is right , owen wilson ! with owen wilson as spokesperson for this rebranding youth everywhere will be convincing their friends and family of being reptilians in disguise . this will cause a spike in arguments throughout the year and lead us to doing things even more irrational . i do not know about you but that sounds like fun . ",
        "if owen wilson is uninterested or not available , tom cruise will helm control . as we all know tom is great at jumping on things . this conspiracy theory is no different . #wowareptitle .   "
