        "will muschamp has a big decision to make for next year . the south carolina gamecoks are still in search of a new offensive coordinator , and the head coach opted to bring in a special visitor to their bowl practices to help point him in the right direction . that visitor was none other than lane kiffin . the florida atlantic head coach was in the area visiting some friends . when he told muschamp about his plans , he was asked to come by the gamecocks ' practice and check things out . kiffin did n't name any offensive coordinator candidates publicly , but he did suggest a philosophy . ",
        "`` in my opinion , whether it 's right or wrong , in the age we are in , you have to go fast and have somebody who understands how to go fast . it 's not just snap the ball , '' kiffin said . `` there 's a lot to it . otherwise , everybody would do it . `` this sounds like solid advice . in today 's game , playing with tempo is everything -- but it 's not easy to pull off . not only does it need to be implemented in game situations , but it has to be established early on in practice and the players all have to believe in it as well . ",
        "with the outser of offensive coordinator kurt roper , wide receivers coach bryan mcclendon will call the plays for south carolina in the outback bowl against michigan . but it likely wo n't be long before muschamp announces a new offensive coordinator to help push things forward in columbia .
