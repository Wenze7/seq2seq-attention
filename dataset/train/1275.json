        "`` do n't you want me , baby ? '' the human league famously sang in its 1981 smash-hit record . well , the qantas business lounge in melbourne , australia , certainly did n't want one of the band 's female vocalists , joanne catherall , when she tried to gain access wearing ugg boots . the 55-year-old singer was refused admission on the grounds that she was wearing the popular sheepskin boots , which are on the airline lounge 's list of banned footwear . a brouhaha started last thursday when catherall , whose handle on twitter is @lubycat , tweeted : `` denied access @qantas business class in @melair melbourne airport apparently ugg boots are deemed sleepwear by the lady working there . '' ",
        "qantas responded , `` hi joanne , we endeavour to remain consistent and uphold our lounge 's dress guidelines to all our guests . '' the lounge also reportedly has a strict anti-flip-flop policy . the internet , at least , was quick to come to catherall 's defense . @lubycat @qantas @melair oh my goodness when would go bed in a pair of ugg boots ðŸ‘¢ ? ?? -- michelle teale december 14 , 2017 .
