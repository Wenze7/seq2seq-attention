        "new haven -- if anyone is to take the lead on a movement to keep social media safe and appropriate , it will have to be young people . the co-founders of welcome 2 reality , a company operated by five social work professionals , are leading a push for southern connecticut state university to adopt a student-led , campus-wide movement to demonstrate healthy , civil attitudes on social media , which they call wi-not . `` a question we ask folks is , who has the ear of our kids , '' said w2r director of learning and educational development marcus stallworth . ",
        "`` it 's probably the first time in history where kids know more than parents know . our parents did n't have twitter or instagram . '' stallworth and qur-an webb , director of operations , led two hour-long sessions for scsu resident assistants on the responsible use of social media . stallworth ran through several chat acronyms that the students in the room deciphered instantly through experience -- lol , wyd , ttyl and hmu , for example -- but what concerns him most is kys : `` kill yourself . '' `` you do n't know what someone is going through , '' webb said . ",
        "`` people potentially may just follow through on that . '' stallworth said that , although smartphones have positive benefits such as consolidating technology and giving people information quickly , conflict can play out in a way that is harmful . `` if there 's a conflict , people on the perimeter can egg it on , '' he said . `` here , at southern connecticut state university , we do n't really subscribe to those things . '' robert demezzo , scsu director of residence life , said social media use is pervasive among college students . `` it is important for our students to understand the benefits and risks associated with the various forms of social media , '' he said in an emailed statement . ",
        "`` the training session today helped inform our residence hall staff members on the latest trends in this form of communication . in turn , we will be able to convey this information to our students . '' brian . zahn@hearstmediact . com .   "
