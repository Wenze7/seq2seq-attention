        "republican representative blake farenthold of texas wo n't seek re-election , house speaker paul ryan said thursday , making him the fourth member of congress brought down this month by allegations of sexual misconduct . `` i think he 's making the right decision to retire , '' ryan said at a news conference . `` there are new stories that are very disconcerting . `` farenthold , 56 , settled a sex harassment claim by a former staff member with $ 84,000 of taxpayer money , politico reported two weeks ago . he had been sued in 2014 by his former communications director , who said she was sexually harassed and discriminated against on the basis of gender . ",
        "farenthold had refused two weeks ago to confirm or deny politico 's report of the settlement . last week , the house ethics committee announced an inquiry into farenthold 's actions . cnn reported this week that another former aide to farenthold described abusive behavior by the congressman , including sexually graphic jokes and screaming fits . ryan of wisconsin said he spoke with farenthold on wednesday . conyers resignationwhen democratic representative john conyers of michigan resigned on dec. . 5 amid sexual harassment allegations , third-ranking house democrat james clyburn questioned why conyers was being forced out while there was `` radio silence '' from ryan 's office on farenthold . ",
        "`` what is the difference ? '' asked clyburn of south carolina . democratic senator al franken of minnesota announced last week he will resign soon amid allegations by several women of unwanted groping and kissing . republican representative trent franks of arizona quit last week , under pressure from ryan , after acknowledging he discussed surrogate motherhood with two members of his staff . farenthold , a former conservative radio host , was among the lawmakers elected in 2010 as part of the right-wing backlash to the obama administration . he opposes abortion rights , seeks to cut government spending and in 2013 told constituents at a town-hall meeting , `` i 'm a texan -- my idea of gun control is hitting what you aim at and nothing else . ",
        "`` in july , farenthold suggested in a radio interview that if gop senator susan collins of maine were n't a woman he might challenge her to a duel because of her opposition to holding a vote to get rid of obamacare . collins later said she had received a handwritten apology from him . democratic representative ruben kihuen of nevada also is being pressured to leave congress . kihuen was accused by his former campaign finance director of unwanted touching and advances . another women , who was a lobbyist when kihuen was a state senator , accused him of touching her and sending her suggestive messages by text and facebook , according to the nevada independent website . ",
        "house democratic leader nancy pelosi of california , who has called on kihuen to resign , said thursday that she 's spoken to him but that `` he wants to go through the ethics process . ''   "
