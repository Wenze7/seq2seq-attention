        "the sexual harassment allegations that have been rocking hollywood as of late will be center stage on the red carpet of the 75th annual golden globes . the many major actresses and presenters that are part of the #metoo movement will be wearing all-black ensembles to the award ceremony as a sign of protest and solidarity against sexual harassment in hollywood . this political statement comes at a time when more and more hollywood figures , including salma hayek , lupita nyong ' o , angelina jolie , terry crews , anthony rapp , trace lysette and rose mcgowan , are coming forward with their own experiences with repeated harassment , assault and abuse by some of the most powerful men in hollywood , like harvey weinstein , kevin spacey , brett ratner , louis c. k. , russell simmons , jeffrey tambor and agent adam venit . ",
        "in the past , stars have made political statements on the red carpet albeit subtler , like the blue ribbons for the alcu that were worn to the oscars . however , this statement by the #metoo movement will be the first time in recent history that stars have banded together to make such a grand protest . as the outrage over sexual misconduct grows , #metoo 's politically charged sign of solidarity at the award ceremony will show that this misbehavior will no longer go unchallenged . the 75th golden globes will air on january 7 , 2018 at 8:00 p. m. est. .
