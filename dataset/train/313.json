        "-- thousands of people on two continents picked up the baton from the united states and rallied sunday in solidarity with women demanding equality , justice and an end to sexual harassment . demonstrations in london , paris , sydney and other european and australian cities followed much larger women 's marches held saturday across the u. s. to mark the anniversary of president donald trump 's inauguration , as well as the protests it inspired . in the british capital , demonstrators carried placards reading `` we are powerful '' and `` time 's up '' and chanted outside prime minister theresa may 's office as they raised grievances ranging from workplace inequities to misogynistic abuse on social media . ",
        "`` today is a call for action to bring about change , '' london protest co-organizer shola mos-shogbamimu said . `` this is so much more than trump . '' the london event drew thousands of people despite sleet and snow . heavy rain fell on the protesters who gathered near the eiffel tower , which could have been a factor in the small number of participants compared to the u. s. marches on saturday . `` it does n't matter if the weather is like this , '' maggie kan , who was one of the more than 100 people who did n't let the rain and cold deter them . ",
        "`` we 're still coming together , and we 're going to still fight against trump and his agenda . '' some of the slogans on posters at the paris rally read `` sorry for the inconvenience , we are trying to change the world '' and `` look back , march forward . '' the international events come at a time of reckoning for many men in hollywood , the media and other industries as women speak out about sexual misconduct and inequity in general . more are scheduled to take place in the united states on sunday . ",
        "they will culminate in a las vegas rally that will launch an effort to register 1 million voters and target swing states in the u. s. midterm elections later this year , which could shift control of congress . `` i think last year was that watershed moment of president trump 's election , '' said melissa goffin , the march organizer in melbourne , australia . `` it 's a new era of feminism . '' those who took part in this year 's events said they were galvanized by an avalanche of political and gender issues over the past year , as well as the #metoo movement , which has been credited with countering widespread sexual abuse and misconduct . ",
        "many of the marchers not only supported women 's rights , but also denounced trump 's views on issues including immigration , abortion and lgbt rights . demonstrators denounced trump 's views with colorful signs and even saltier language . trump dismissed the suggestion that his presidency has been bad for women . he tweeted saturday that it was a `` perfect day '' for women to march to celebrate the `` economic success and wealth creation '' of his first year in office . `` get out there now to celebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months , '' the republican wrote . ",
        "`` lowest female unemployment in 18 years ! '' in palm beach , florida , home to trump 's mar-a-lago estate , several hundred people marched saturday carrying anti-trump signs . a group of women wearing red cloaks and white hats like the characters in the book and television versions of `` the handmaid 's tale , '' which imagines a future in which women 's rights have been strictly limited , walked in formation with their heads bowed . on saturday , oklahoma city protesters chanted , `` we need a leader , not a creepy tweeter ! '' ",
        "the march in washington , d. c. , on saturday took on the feel of a political rally when u. s. sen. kirsten gillibrand on new york and rep. nancy pelosi of california , both democrats , urged women to run for office and vote to oppose trump and the republicans ' agenda . `` we march , we run , we vote , we win , '' pelosi said to applause . cathy muldoon , a high school librarian from dallas , pennsylvania , took her two teenage daughters to the new york rally and said marching gives people hope . ",
        "she said this year 's action is set against the backdrop of the trump presidency , which `` turned out to be as scary as we thought it would be . '' `` i 've not seen any checks and balances , '' she said . `` everything is moving toward the right , and we have a president who seems to have no decency . '' in los angeles , eva longoria , natalie portman , viola davis , alfre woodard , scarlett johansson , constance wu , adam scott and rob reiner were among the celebrities who addressed a crowd of hundreds of thousands at the women 's march there . ",
        "longoria , who starred in tv 's `` desperate housewives , '' told marchers their presence mattered , `` especially when those in power seem to have turned their backs on reason and justice . '' woodard urged everyone to register and vote , saying , `` the 2018 midterms start now . ''   "
