        "the holiday season is a key time for store execution . the flood of seasonal shopping means increased foot traffic , but if stores ca n't succeed in converting shoppers to buyers , all the traffic is for naught . to keep conversion rates high , stores need high-quality execution during this critical time . unfortunately , the best-designed in-store program wo n't have its intended effect if implemented partially , incorrectly , late , or at all . therefore , it is critical for any holiday program to ensure that stores follow plans accurately and thoroughly . district managers and store managers need to be able to quickly solve problems as they arise , course-correct plans where necessary , and share best practices across their teams . ",
        "that may be more easily said than done . geographically dispersed stores are difficult to spot-check , and busy managers on the floor may have a hard time interpreting instructions for in-store programs and reporting back on them . most store managers do their earnest best , so shortcomings in execution are largely down to environmental circumstances . to ensure you get the most out of your holiday programs this december -- and into the new year -- follow these five tips for giving store managers their best chance to execute correctly : provide simple instructionssuccessful store managers spend most of their time away from their desks . ",
        "the best ones prefer to be on the floor helping customers and supervising employees rather than sitting in the back room puzzling over complex e-mails . provide store managers with simple instructions that are easy to read , understand and remember . try to break information into snackable pieces that can be absorbed in the spare moments between other more immediate needs . clarify the relative urgency and importance of communications so that store personnel know what requires attention now and what can wait for a quieter time . and finally , make sure the content you 're providing is easily consumable on mobile devices from the sales floor .

        "help store managers help each othereven the savviest retail operation organizations might miss subtleties that are discovered by employees on the ground . encourage your store managers to share their practical experiences with programs to improve the whole company 's performance . provide a feedback channel for store managers to make recommendations back to the planners at headquarters . also build opportunities for store managers to communicate directly with each other to share critical tips and tricks -- this is where shared photos come into their own -- for making programs succeed in the hectic holiday season environment . close the loopdo n't just broadcast your plans to store managers and hope for the best . ",
        "too many retailers benefit from little or no visibility back at headquarters . make sure store managers understand that you expect confirmation of their execution on programs as specified . that can include sharing photos of a tabletop or window display . at the same time , try to make it easy for managers to demonstrate compliance . every minute spent writing e-mails to headquarters is a minute away from the floor , so build feedback loops that are simple , quick and easy to execute . and again , make sure they can do it with minimum effort using a mobile device .

        "measure and track executionyou 've given your stores strong programs to maximize conversion . you 've made programs easy to understand and implement in hectic environments . you 've put stores in touch with headquarters and also each other so they can get the information they need to succeed , and you 've created a process to easily understand which stores executed on programs , how and when . that means you have all the pieces to track and measure program performance . capture store feedback in a single place to measure how well your programs do in the field . ",
        "key metrics can include completion rates and timing . also collect feedback on program effectiveness , execution difficulties or pitfalls and suggestions for future programs . track the same metrics on programs over time and use them to measure your execution . set goals based on historical performance and strive for continuous improvement . compare results across program types to identify which activities work better or worse for your business . and identify consistently underperforming stores for extra training or hand-holding on critical programs . think biggerfor some retailers , the holiday season might bring in 40 percent of annual revenue . ",
        "while that makes the holidays monumentally important , it also means that the rest of the season has to bring in that other 60 percent . consider expanding these techniques into year-round habits . excellent store communication and execution is a key success factor in marketing and merchandising programs of all stripes -- and during all seasons . use this holiday season as an opportunity to improve execution not only for december , but year-round . damian cowell is the director of product management at inkling and has more than 15 years of experience in building b2b technology . started in 2009 , inkling builds software that enables businesses to power their desk-less workforce .
