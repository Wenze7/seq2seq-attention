        "let 's be clear . the murdoch equation has changed utterly as rupert and sons bail out of hollywood , movies , archives , star of india and sky . that empire will belong to disney now . and what the family has left is much smaller : fox news , some us sports and business channels , some tv stations . not a shrimp beside disney 's whale , but just one more middling flatfish in the seas of the blue planet . that does n't mean penury , of course . fox 's cable interests made more than $ 16bn last year . ",
        "the sale to disney - a complexity of share dealing - hits $ 66bn . but it is retreat , not advance . it is also a tad more fragile than it appears . fox news may be cock of the cable-news walk , but its narrow ploughing of an extreme rightwing audience - as that audience , average age more than 70 , dies - is vulnerable to the changing winds of political fashion . sports cable is under pressure as the price of the events meets consumer resistance . television stations without their own tame hollywood content factory are n't exactly the future of mass entertainment . ",
        "meanwhile , the disentangling of news corp from 21st century fox - a penalty of public disgust about phone hacking - is over , to be followed , surely , by a re-tangling of the wall street journal , london times et al in a new `` news oriented '' fox . since mr m has been complaining lately that most of his papers are struggling to make money , that does n't seem like prime profit-centre stuff - especially since news corp 's overall digital performance appears a little below par , uncertain where and when to build paywalls . ",
        "there 's a profound change of direction here , then . what son james does best has been sold off - with james looking for work elsewhere . son lachlan , by default , is the inheritor . dad has more money than he knows what to do with , but the edge of his appetite has gone . in uk terms , his three remaining papers sit alongside the mails and the telegraphs in the clout premiership . his sun is a sore problem . the guardian and observer stand taller on the worldwide web . when and if disney decides that sky news chips away at sky profits for no good entertainment reason , there will no doubt be wails of parliamentary anguish . ",
        "seldom have so many competition regulators toiled to no purpose . seldom have murdoch 's printed papers and websites faced a more testing decade . what do you do with untold billions in this residual neck of the fox woods ? rupert , post-disney , has the cash . but does he have the ideas , or the hunger ? fox news can feed the wall street journal for years , and succour other papers from sydney to the shard . yet there needs to be a vision in play . the old rupert was always striking out in search of that vision , buying , experimenting , throwing away . ",
        "this old , old rupert seems content to try to shape what he has left . time to stop quaking . this is wholly new territory .   "
