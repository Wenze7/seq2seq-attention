        "photo : apthis month , tesla said that issues with the production line for its model 3 sedan are being addressed , but the hiccups have caused a months-long delay to the automaker 's manufacturing schedule for 2018 . now two high-ranking employees involved with launching the model 3 line left the company in recent weeks , jalopnik has learned . jason mendez , who joined tesla back in 2005 , worked an array of jobs at the company , most recently as senior director for manufacturing engineering , according to his linkedin profile . mendez did n't respond to a request for comment . ",
        "along with mendez , will mccoll , a former senior manager for equipment engineering , has also left the company . mccoll could n't be immediately reached for comment , but he confirmed his departure on linkedin , saying he resigned from tesla earlier this month . `` it was an action-packed 7 years of automation equipment design and i will truly miss the team , '' mccoll wrote . `` i will treasure our countless moments of laughter as we fearlessly dismantled the edifice of ` impossible ! ' '' a source familiar with the matter said both mendez and kroll were involved in the automation of the model 3 production line , as well as the integration of german supplier grohmann automation , which tesla acquired in late 2016 . ",
        "another source confirmed the two are n't listed anymore in the company 's employee directory . the circumstance of their departures is n't immediately clear -- tesla has said issues with the production line emanated from its gigafactory battery plant -- nor if they 're connected to the model 3 issues . tesla declined to comment . `` i 'm continually inspired by my colleagues ' resolve , '' mccoll said on linkedin , `` and i wish them strength as they ramp and refine model 3 . it 's an amazing car ! '' mccoll said in his post on linkedin that he 's planning to move home from germany in the coming months . ",
        "`` stay tuned ! '' he wrote . tesla launched production of the model 3 in july , but the manufacturing process got off to a sluggish start . the company reported it produced only 260 model 3s in the third quarter of 2017 , far short of its goal . the company pinned blame on issues that emerged at its gigafactory , and pushed back a target of production 5,000 model 3s per week by the end of 2017 to late march 2018 . tesla reported making 2,425 model 3s in the final quarter of 2017 , and said that the production rate increased `` significantly '' in december . ",
        "but then the company said it had to again push back the 5,000-per-week target to this summer . `` as we continue to focus on quality and efficiency rather than simply pushing for the highest possible volume in the shortest period of time , we expect to have a slightly more gradual ramp through q1 , likely ending the quarter at a weekly rate of about 2,500 model 3 vehicles , '' tesla wrote in a letter to investors . `` we intend to achieve the 5,000 per week milestone by the end of q2 . '' tesla has since started deliveries of the all-electric sedan , which starts at $ 35,000 , to early customers . ",
        "the company previously said it has about 450,000 model 3 reservations .   "
