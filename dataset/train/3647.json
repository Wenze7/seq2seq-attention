        "jerusalem - israeli authorities have approved more than 1,100 new settlement homes in the occupied west bank , the peace now ngo said thursday , the latest in a raft of such moves in recent months . the approvals were given on wednesday by a defence ministry committee with authority over settlement construction . some 352 of the homes received final approval , while the others are at an earlier stage in the process , hagit ofran of peace now , which monitors settlement building , told afp . a total of 1,122 housing units were advanced , including seven already existing homes given retroactive approval . ",
        "according to ofran , the majority of the approvals are for settlements deep in the west bank that israel would likely need to evacuate as part of a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict . `` it 's a part of the general trend that the government is doing , which is to build all over the west bank , even more in places that israel would need to evict , and in this way to torpedo the possibility for a two-state solution , '' she said . a shooting that killed an israeli settler on tuesday in the west bank led to fresh calls for further settlement building , though the plans approved on wednesday were already in the works . ",
        "according to peace now , 6,742 housing projects were approved in the settlements last year , the highest figure since 2013 . israeli settlements are seen as illegal under international law and major obstacles to peace as they are built on land the palestinians see as part of their future state . prominent members of israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's right-wing government openly oppose palestinian statehood . israel faced sharp criticism from the administration of former us president barack obama over settlement construction , but that has not been the case with us president donald trump 's white house and israeli officials have sought to take advantage of his backing .
