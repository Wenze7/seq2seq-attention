        "kate ashbrook says hard-pressed local authorities are having to exploit parks as venues for damaging commercial events ; hal moggridge writes that urban pollution makes parks , with their purer air quality , more vital than ever ; david jolley says parks must be a statutory responsibility of local authoritieslettersyour correspondents set out the bleak prospects for public parks . to combat austerity , local authorities are increasingly exploiting parks as venues for exclusive , damaging , commercial events -- lucrative for the local authority but against the wishes of day-to-day users . the government should impose a statutory duty on councils to provide , monitor , manage and maintain parks and open spaces for their residents , whom the councils should consult in their running of these vital assets .

        "kate ashbrookgeneral secretary , open spaces society • good sense supports the letter from david lambert and 11 others deploring the closing of the heritage lottery fund 's parks for people funding programme . urban parks are places where air quality is purer , making them suitable for physical exercise both by children and active adults , unlike streets polluted by traffic . research in recent decades has also discovered that natural surroundings alleviate stress and reduce mental illness in urban populations , a money-saver for the health service . in london , one-third of those using the parks are foreign tourists who enhance national income .

        "joined-up political thinking would therefore make upkeep of urban parks a properly financed statutory service , contributing as they do to the national exchequer . and as a result these parks would continue to delight us all . hal moggridgelechlade , gloucestershire • it is right that respected senior figures of the parks agency draw attention to the ending of parks for people as a special programme . we have to thank the heritage lottery fund for what they have given . now we move on . in the end the message should be that the funding of parks , along with other essential services such as health , welfare and education , should not be left to voluntary organisations . ",
        "we need parliament to be persuaded by the evidence collected by the communities and local government committee , but bizarrely set aside last year : the maintenance of parks should be given the status of a statutory responsibility of local authorities . appropriate funding must be provided . david jolleyhonorary secretary , friends of john leigh park , altrincham • join the debate -- email guardian . letters@theguardian . com • read more guardian letters -- click here to visit gu . com/letters .
