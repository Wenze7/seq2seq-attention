        "google has finally lowered the developer transaction fees for google play subscriptions , a change which it said last year that it would be making as of january 1st 2018 . now that it 's january 3rd google has lowered the fees for developers from 30 percent to 15 percent , meaning that developers now get 85 percent of the revenues from subscriptions instead of the previous 70 percent that they were getting . the revenues are only for users which are subscribed to an app or game for at least 12 months , but even with that time frame required a 15 percent increase in the revenue is likely to be a big jump , especially for those which have a high number of users which are still subscribed following the 12 months . ",
        "google 's change for the fee will continue to stay in place for each specific subscriber as long as developers retain those subscribers after the 12-month time frame , and for any users which have been paying for the subscription for an app or game for less than a year developers will end up getting 85 percent of that revenue once they go beyond 12 paid months , so there is now even more incentive for developers to make the best apps that they can , and improve on ones they already offer to users . the biggest android and tech holiday giveaway contest of the year ! ",
        "prizes from sprint , htc , motorola , huawei , google , sony , lg , nvidia and more . enter today ! it 's also important for developers to keep in mind what would count towards a user 's 12 paid months of subscription fees , now more than ever since they will be getting more revenue from those fees as of today . these changes that google put in place were part of an announcement that google made alongside changes for the google play store , back on october 19th , such as a reworked editor 's choice section and reminders for users to check out recently installed apps or games that they have n't spent much time using . ",
        "more to the point , google 's changes for the subscription fee revenues following 12 months of paid subscriptions showcases that google wants to make sure that developers are making more money for the platform , which is a good thing for developers as it means more developers will want to create content for the google play platform , and that 's a good thing for users because it means more potential high-quality content .
