        "a gay man who was denied a marriage licence in kentucky two years ago by a county clerk who refused to issue licences for same-sex marriages will run to unseat her next year , he said on wednesday . david ermold , of morehead , ky. , announced his candidacy as a democrat against rowan county clerk kim davis , who drew worldwide attention when she refused to grant marriage licences to same-sex couples , citing apostolic christian beliefs . ermold and his partner were one of the four couples who sued davis . `` we need to restore the integrity of that office , '' ermold said in a phone interview with reuters after his campaign announcement on facebook . ",
        "`` i was n't treated fairly myself . '' davis intends to seek re-election as a republican in 2018 . she said in an email on wednesday that she helped ermold with his candidacy paperwork . `` i shook his hand and told him ` congratulations , and may the best candidate win , ' '' davis said . davis spent five days in jail in september 2015 after refusing a court order to issue marriage licences following the u. s. supreme court 's decision legalizing same-sex marriage . her case in 2015 drew hundreds of protesters and supporters to her office in morehead , in rural eastern kentucky . ",
        "while she was in jail , then-republican presidential candidates mike huckabee and ted cruz visited her . less than a month after she was released from jail , davis , who won election to the office in 2014 as a democrat , switched her affiliation to the republican party . after her case , kentucky lawmakers removed all county clerks ' names from the state marriage licence form . ermold and david moore obtained a licence and were wed on sept. . 26 , 2015 , ermold said . the couple had a wedding ceremony the following month . `` we need someone who is going to stay focused on our community instead of focusing on the interests or agendas of outside organizations and politicians , '' ermold said . ",
        "in october 2017 , davis travelled to meet with religious and political leaders in romania , where those opposing same-sex marriage sought a referendum on the issue .   "
