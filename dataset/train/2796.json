        "that 's how much insurance money a woman convicted of criminally negligent homicide could receive even though she was found to have caused her fiance 's death . poughkeepsie , n. y. -- half-a-million dollars . that 's how much insurance money a woman convicted of criminally negligent homicide could receive even though she was found to have caused her fiance 's death . `` there 's nothing worse than losing a child , and that is something you will never get over . you have to live with it every day , '' the victim 's mother mary ann viafore said exclusively to cbs2 's marc liverman . ",
        "now , viafore and the rest of her family were faced with more anguish in the death of her son vincent . the woman who was connected to the man 's death in a kayak on the hudson river -- fiancee angelika graswald -- might get some $ 500,000 from his life insurance policy . `` she got enough money from my son . he supported her , he gave her money every payday , she does n't deserve the rest of his money . it belongs to the family , '' she said . viafore plans on fighting for it . ",
        "`` we are going to go through this until the bitter end and make sure she does n't get a penny of the that insurance policy , '' she said . a judge has ordered a hearing to determine if graswald still has a right to collect that money . her hearing is scheduled for february 27 , at the dutchess county courthouse . cbs2 spoke with her attorney earlier who said that he could not comment on pending litigation . cbs2 's liverman met with former federal prosecutor michael wildes who said when it comes to a civil case like this one , the burden of proof is actually on the victim 's family . ",
        "`` i would say it 's an uphill battle for the county and for the family to have to prove this . how do they prove what was in her mind ? '' wildes said . unlike someone who commits intentional murder or homicide and automatically forfeits any right to inherit from a victim , new york law does not automatically forfeit that right for someone who pleads guilty to criminally negligent homicide . `` this case stands to set a precedent throughout our nation . nobody should profit from criminal negligence . yes , she did n't want to purposefully kill him , but she allowed him to die . ",
        "she should not benefit from this financially , '' wildes said . graswald served just over 2-and-a-half years in prison and was released last month . in new york the maximum sentence for this type of crime is four years . viafore 's mother said if the judge does n't rule in favor of the family they will proceed with a wrongful death suit in civil court . graswald could still face deportation to her native latvia even after last month 's hearing .
