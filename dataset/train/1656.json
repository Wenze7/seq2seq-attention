        "taking charge of the elephantpicture an image of a human rider on top of an elephant walking down a path . who is in charge ? it depends . if the elephant is traveling a well-worn and familiar path , the rider probably is n't exerting much control . it 's just along for the ride . the six-ton elephant 's strength and size carry it forward without much thought or need for intervention . but what happens if the rider wants to take the elephant on a new path ? what if the rider wants to take a sudden and sharp left turn ? ",
        "will the elephant listen ? why should it ? the elephant and rider metaphor was developed by psychologist jonathan haidt to describe the two sides of our brain : conscious and unconscious . the elephant is our unconscious brain , and most of the time it walks through the familiar routines of the day without much thought . the unconscious elephant brain is in control when we brush our teeth , take the same route to school or work , scroll through instagram or do any repetitive task that we 've done many times over . this part of our brain is predictable and powerful . ",
        "sometimes the rider has to take control , and that can cause tension . if the elephant and rider disagree over taking a new path , the rider is n't going to win . the elephant wants to stick to the routine . it 's unlikely that the rider can convince the elephant to make sudden moves and take sharp turns out of the blue . over time , though , the rider can nudge the elephant to travel new areas until they become familiar . the conscious brain can influence unconscious patterns . the elephant and rider can work together to forge a new path , rather than fighting over control . ",
        "following the scriptthe elephant 's job is to focus on what is immediately in front of its path , the here and now . the elephant is n't scouting ahead for different routes or creating new off-the-beaten paths . that 's the rider 's job . we naturally follow paths laid out for us by other people since childhood . in playful parenting , psychologist lawrence j. cohen talks about how children are apt to act out `` invisible scripts '' they see reinforced from cartoons or video games . these scripts do n't inspire creativity : these prescripted scenarios kill imagination and creativity . ",
        "look around at children playing ; for the most part , you will see them acting out someone else 's script instead of their own . their own imagination is overpowered by the repetition and intensity of what they see on the screen . merely taking a break from a screen is n't always enough , as cohen writes : if they break away from the screen at all to play , the game follows the pre-scripted story line exactly , or it fizzles out to boredom , or else the game becomes violent . toys that are spinoffs from movies and television are video games keep the play locked to that script . ",
        "a toy gun , for instance , is designed to do just one thing : pretend to shoot . that 's how most toys are designed . following the unconscious scripted path is a journey to the same destinations . taking control of our unconscious brainthe solution , according to cohen , is simple , though it may not be easy . cohen writes that children -- and adults -- need to first be aware of these prescripted paths , and their influence on our unconscious brains . then , cohen recommends starting out in a wide-open field rather than a narrow trail . ",
        "find toys and situations that are open-ended , rather than closed off . `` most toys are junk , by which i mean that they can do only one thing , over and over , '' he writes . `` great toys , like good dramatic play , allow children to make a world of their own and allow full expression of their creativity . '' the more the elephant takes the same familiar paths , the deeper the ruts become . the more the elephant thinks it is in complete control . the harder it is to take a turn and try something new . ",
        "this is where the rider has to come in and train the elephant , slowly and deliberately . by mixing up the routines and not simply following the pre-scripted paths , the rider can train the elephant to go more easily in new directions . riding atop the elephant , the rider can choose to look ahead , plan for the long-term , strategize and see if there 's a better way . but the rider can only do that if they choose to do more than simply go along for the ride . the rider has to remember who 's in charge .
