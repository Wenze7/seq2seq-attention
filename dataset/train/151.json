        "when yoko nomura moved from warm , dry california to the subtropical island of okinawa , she was struck by the stifling heat and humidity . searching for ways to survive the okinawan summer months , nomura , from the science and technology group at the okinawa institute of science and technology graduate university , discovered a traditional secret to keeping cool : a material called basho-fu . basho-fu is an okinawan textile fabric made from banana plant fibers . originating from the 13th or 14th century , basho-fu was used to make traditional okinawan kimonos . basho-fu kimonos were popular among all classes of people in the ryukyu kingdom , which ruled okinawa from 1429 to 1879 . ",
        "basho-fu textiles were highly durable for hard labor such as farming and fishing , and were comfortable to wear in the hot and humid subtropical climate of okinawa . the expertise required to make basho-fu textiles has been passed down through generations of craftspeople in okinawa . however , the traditional craft is now under threat from a shortage of banana plant materials and an infiltration of modern methods . in an effort to rescue and document this important part of okinawan folk culture , researchers from oist , in collaboration with the university of the ryukyus and the kijoka basho-fu association , used scientific techniques to characterize basho-fu materials and to compare traditional and laboratory basho-fu production processes . ",
        "in their paper , recently published in the journal of fiber science and technology , the researchers used one of oist 's scanning electron microscopes to observe the structure of the basho-fu materials in high resolution . they also used other analytical techniques , such as x-ray diffraction , to investigate aspects of the chemical structure of the material , including crystallinity and molecular bonds . `` our first finding was that the outer part of the harvested leaf sheaths , which is the part of the plant used to make basho-fu textiles , contains many vascular bundles , '' says nomura , lead author of the paper . ",
        "vascular bundles are collections of conducting vessels used to transport water and nutrients in the plant . the presence of vascular bundles in basho-fu material makes it highly breathable , keeping the wearer cool on hot days by allowing sweat to evaporate through pore-like structures . `` next , we compared basho-fu materials that had been made using the traditional degumming process with those made using modern laboratory methods , '' says nomura . degumming is one of the refining steps in the long and complicated traditional basho-fu production process . the researchers found that , although the vascular bundles remained in the material after both traditional and laboratory degumming processes , the laboratory-made materials were lower in quality . ",
        "material that had been subject to laboratory degumming showed some additional changes compared with material that had been traditionally degummed . for instance , some of the vascular bundles in the laboratory-treated material were flattened , with fewer air voids . this shows that the traditional process of degumming is milder than the laboratory process , retaining more air voids and therefore maintaining greater breathability . although the traditional method is more difficult and time-consuming , it is more delicate and produces basho-fu textiles of better quality . the next step is to analyze other features of the basho-fu fibers and other steps in the long production process . ",
        "present and future studies of banana tree fibers will help to conserve the traditional okinawan craft of basho-fu , and may also aid the development of new textile materials .   "
