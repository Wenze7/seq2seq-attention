        "`` chachu , i want to become an astronaut when i grow up , '' said my 6-year-old nephew , while he was playing with some toys . his words put a smile on my face . i looked at my brother who was sitting on the opposite side of the dining table and could see a similar smile on his face too . i could feel the happiness that was radiating out of my brother . any parent would be happy if they saw their child being so ambitious . this incident took place earlier this year during my visit to my home in calcutta . ",
        "although it might be very common , it made me ask myself a few questions , what happens to our ambitions once we grow up ? why are so many of us confused about the purpose our lives ? why ca n't more people be happy with their work life ? in today 's fast-paced world , where things are changing every minute , getting an hour of free time every day is considered to be a luxury . but , even when we get that hour of free time , it is usually spent on relaxation or entertainment . ",
        "procrastination kicks in and whatever plans we had made to use that 1 hour for self-development gets delayed to the next day . this process keeps on happening day after day , till it reaches a point where we simply give up . this is the reason why the guitarist in you never got a chance to perform at his first event or the writer in you never got her first story break . now comes the main question -- is there any way to take out some time from our busy lives and dedicate that time towards self-improvement ? ",
        "the answer is yes , there is not a single way but rather multiple ways to do that . over here we will take a look at two such methods . first , we have to understand that the key to success is not through being busy but rather being productive . a very important skill that one should pick up in order to become more productive is time-management . time is the most important thing that we have , and if we learn to manage it , we can really become successful in our lives . the book `` 7 habits of highly effective people '' by stephen r covey talks a lot about time management and habit formation and anybody who is looking to get the most out of their day should give it a read . ",
        "but , what if you fall asleep after reading just one page of a book ? how can you learn time management without self-study ? well , the answer is simple ; get a mentor in your life . a mentor will teach you not only about time management but many more useful skills and will also help you to stay on track throughout the entire journey . let us analyse this situation from another point of view . imagine that you are a car . motivation is like fuel . it only helps to run a vehicle which in this case is you . ",
        "but a vehicle can not run without an engine . in human beings , our purpose acts like the engine . even with engine and fuel , you still can not drive a car if there is no steering wheel . dedication is the steering wheel . but can you drive a car if there are no roads ? no , so you need a road , a direction . planning creates the road for you . but i do n't think anybody would ever want to drive a car with a single gear ? experiences and failures are our gears . ",
        "sometimes you will move at fourth or fifth gear and sometimes you may even need to put your ` life 's car ' on the reverse . what about windscreen wipers ? yes , we have them too , education , it helps us to see the world clearly . horn ? come on , that is your voice , both verbal as well as written . rear view mirrors ? your memory . headlights ? spiritual learningsbacklight ? your workindicators ? your presence . entertainment system ? whatever keeps you happy . ac ? mindfulnessbut all of this will not work unless you start the engine and for that , you need a key . ",
        "in the case of our lives , the `` key '' is our decisions . now comes the most important question , where does a mentor fit into all of this ? the answer is simple , the mentor acts like `` google maps '' . you may have all of the above things , but if you are using a wrong road map , no amount of dedication or motivation will be able to help you to achieve your goals . just like `` google maps '' your mentor helps you to find the right track , gives you proper notifications , makes sure you have your route and time mapped out and get there when you need to . ",
        "even without a mentor , you can still achieve your goals , but sometimes it is better to have somebody by your side to help you in your journey to greatness . shubham chakrabortylink to the original article .   "
