        "fire in jaffathis week started off on quite a low note , with our local hardware store collapsing after a fire broke out . i was home doing some work , and noticed a sound which i recognised as mild thunder , like the type of thud you hear before the main thud hits the sky . within minutes , sarah called me from her work , asking `` did you feel that ? '' her building had shaken from the explosion . then there were multiple sirens racing down yefet street , and that 's when i realised that something was n't right . ",
        "so at 11:45 pm , i raced down the street , perhaps just less than a kilometre to be greeted with this sight : the entire of jaffa were outside , staring as firefighters fought valliantly to qualm the blaze and rescue as many people who were trapped beneath the rubble . obviously given the geographical and politcal landscape we now live in , thoughts about what happened started filtering through my head . but to be honest , i never let myself believe anything other than it was a simple fire that then caused the explosion and eventually , the demise of the building . ",
        "spare a thought for the owners of the businesses operating at this building . it was only days before when i noticed our local felafel and shawarma restaurant being renovated on the outside with new tiles . unfortunately , 4 people were confirmed dead , with approximately 12 seriously injured . a shocking scene , no doubt . thinking about the owners of the building/businesses and how their livelihoods are immediately affected is a horrific concept . be-all happy hourthis week saw the commemoration of the israeli declaration of independence in 1948 . the building at work have a weekly `` happy hour '' on thursday with an alternating theme , and this week it was traditional israeli food , with felafels and pita . ",
        "suffice to say , i came , i ate , i ate , i ate , then i rolled back into the office . what i really enjoy about the building , is meeting the other startups and exchanging ideas . it 's such a refreshing environment and one that i think will keep me enthralled for a long time . i 'm asked all the time what the people are like here . the best answer i can give is : real . everybody operates with perspective , with pettiness at an all time zero . there 's a significant entreprenerial culture here , which i think stems from the service that people experience in the army .

        "once they come out , they are widely independent and ready to tackle the world in ways that perhaps australian 's and most others are n't . originally published at www . facebook . com .   "
