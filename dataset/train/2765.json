        "handle with care . the way i really think of it is , ` i 'm here to listen . we 're here to listen . ' we 're going to handle this story responsibly . we 're not just going to willy nilly put it in the paper . we 're going to handle it with care . stephanie mccrummen on investigative journalism . in the washington post and libby casey 's `` how to be a reporter , '' national enterprise reporter stephanie mccrummen details the lengthy process in which she and her colleague , investigative journalist beth reinhard , meticulously researched allegations of sexual assault , combing through public records , making an exhaustive list of possible witnesses , extensively interviewing multiple individuals who could possess some knowledge on the allegations brought forth during an otherwise run-of-the-mill trip to alabama for a much tamer story . ",
        "as casey put it , `` what started as a tip became a story that could shake an election . '' the accused ? senatorial candidate , roy moore . more than a month removed from the historic alabama senate election , we know just how much mccrummen and reinhard 's investigative journalism shook the election . moore , who was endorsed by the president of the united states , lost to underdog democrat doug jones . jones ' victory marked the first time alabama had elected a democrat to senate since 1992 . in babe and katie way 's biggest feature to date , way details an anonymous woman 's date with celebrity aziz ansari . ",
        "seemingly a mix of personal essay and expos√© , way uses the anonymous woman 's account of her night with ansari to accuse the actor , in no uncertain terms , of sexual assault . in an interview with mashable , babe editor amanda ross provides insight to babe and way 's own process of investigating allegations of sexual assault : for a few days we made ourselves crazy over every detail of this story . katie way , the writer , did about a half-dozen interviews all over nyc . we all spent our saturday on laptops fact-checking , redrafting , discussing the story with our lawyer verifying texts , trying to get a statement from his people and then finally publishing at about 7 pm . ",
        "mashable writer kerry flynn writes : `` according to babe 's editors , grace 's story deserves attention in part because the personal encounter contradicts ansari 's image . '' yes -- while we 're all having heated conversations with friends , coworkers , and internet strangers on what constitutes sexual assault and how society can mend the disconnect of consent and redefine sexual dynamics so that `` the next girl does n't have to cry on the ride home , '' the women who sparked those conversations feel ansari should be called out by his name in the public sphere because he is n't who his television persona would have you believe . ",
        "perhaps they 've encountered ansari in their own contradictory gap ? you know , the one touted on babe . net 's ` manifesto ' : i was surprised to read in black and white that ross believes the importance of grace 's story lies not within grace , but within the discovery that aziz ansari is not the fictionalized version of himself in master of none , nor is he tom haverford , nor is he the idealized version to whom grace gave her number . does this revelation keep ross up at night ? do n't count on it . ",
        "as she says , `` i 'm just glad people are talking about it at all . '' `` find us in the gap between our image of ourselves and how we actually behave . '' katie way maintains the anonymity of ansari 's accuser throughout her article , simply calling the woman grace . however , she does provide detail that , while not at all pertinent to the story at hand , was enough for a number of internet sleuths to remove the shroud of mystery surrounding the anonymous woman whose shitty september evening with ansari is now headline news . ",
        "i wo n't write her name here . it 's not my place . a simple google search will provide you with plenty of photos of the woman , select pieces of her art , and plenty of posts viciously attacking the young woman who told her story to a publication she felt she could trust . a publication she felt would handle her story responsibly . a writer who spent maybe a week preparing what she undoubtedly hoped would be the story of her career before publishing it at 7pm on saturday . a writer who `` willy nilly put it in the paper , '' as stephanie mccrummen might say . ",
        "katie way did n't call grace out by name . she did n't have to . katie way did n't ensure grace 's anonymity . she did n't care to . katie way did , however , call grace the bravest person she 's ever met . she praised grace 's courage in the same letter in which she shamed ashleigh banfield for targeting a 23 year-old woman `` in one of the most vulnerable moments of her life ... ... someone she 's never f -- -- -- met before , for a little attention . '' i hope when she has more distance from the moment she has enough of a conscience left to feel remotely ashamed -- doubt it , but still . ",
        "must be nice to piggyback off of the fact that another woman was brave enough to speak up and add another dimension to the societal conversation about sexual assault . excerpt from katie way 's letter to ashleigh banfieldpot , meet kettle . you 'll be hard-pressed to find any of grace 's social media accounts , even if you do know her identity . as i was fact-checking my sources for this very essay , grace 's online presence seemed to slowly vanish before my eyes . even a tweet from october in which grace accused ansari of being her `` aggressor '' has been deleted , though seemingly soon after it was first published . ",
        "imagine entrusting your most vulnerable moments with a woman and publication who exploit you for their own personal gain , for more clicks through to their website , for a chance to appear on the morning news and propagate their big break . their only break . imagine the publication you trusted with your most vulnerable moments taking no precautions to protect you other than shielding you with the virginal moniker of grace . grace , the meaning of which katie way and her colleagues at babe know nothing . i think it 's only fitting to close this with a quote from katie way herself , taken from her letter to ashleigh banfield . ",
        "`` i hope the ratings were worth it . '' grace 's tweet . katie way on cbs this morning , chicago .   "
