        "prince edward island live pei to declaw , or not to declaw . that 's what readers on the cbc pei facebook page have been debating since the nova scotia veterinary medical association announced on tuesday that it will ban elective and non-therapeutic declawing , effective in march 2018 . the p. e.i. veterinary medical association says it has no plans for a ban following nova scotia 's announcement this week that it would make the practice illegal . but readers are divided on whether or not p. e.i. should follow suit , with some arguing the practice is inhumane while others say it 's still necessary . ",
        "` absolutely it should be banned ' reader kayla vangorkum said declawing should have been banned years ago . `` very inhumane , '' she said . `` if this procedure was performed on a human beings , declawing would be like cutting off each finger at the last knuckle . '' fallon berry agreed . `` if this procedure were done to dogs , i think there would be much more protest . i do n't think it 's right . '' dwayne robbie reminded people that `` it is a painful surgery , with a painful recovery period . '' ",
        "`` and remember that during the time of recuperation from the surgery your cat would still have to use its feet to walk , jump , and scratch in its litter box regardless of the pain it is experiencing . '' damaged furniture defenders of declawing cats say it 's necessary because of the damage scratching can do to furniture , but several readers said it 's not a good enough reason for the procedure . `` cats have claws . you know that when you choose to get one , and therefore should also know that them scratching destroying things is always a possibility , '' kendre jackson said . ",
        "`` if you ca n't handle that happening then you should not get a pet that has claws . get a fish . '' cara llewellyn said she believes declawing should be banned , and for those who are worried about furniture damage , they should look to alternative solutions . `` trim their nails or use soft paws . by declawing them you are basically torturing them , '' she said . ` i 'm glad i did it ' but some readers said from personal experience , declawing was necessary . teresa mcneill sellick said she tried scratching posts , nail trimming and nail tips , but nothing worked . ",
        "`` i had to have her declawed , '' she said . `` she has good balance , she still jumps , uses the litter box and does n't bite . she is the same good-natured girl she always was , just does n't destroy everything . `` i 'm glad i did it and would do it again if i had to . '' phyllis clark said if declawing were n't an option , she would n't have cats as a household pet . `` expensive furniture can get shredded in seconds , wooden doors and stair components . ",
        "my cats get declawed or out the door they go . '' ` a slippery slope ' krista macleod said if people are determined to declaw their cats , it should at least be done by professionals . `` as with any ban you risk people just doing it themselves incorrectly and unsafely . if done young enough before the actual development if the bones takes place it is not that extreme , '' she said . `` you can ban all you want , it just means it will be done unsafely . it is a slippery slope . '' ",
        "scott macleod agreed , saying the province 's measures to educate the public on declawing was effective enough . more p. e.i. news | newcomer entrepreneurs need more training in hospitality industry , says tiapei more p. e.i. news | changes coming to er response to sexual assault on p. e.i.
