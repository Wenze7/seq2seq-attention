        "botellón , a new castro cocktail bar and restaurant at the flatiron corner of market and 15th streets , is ready to host the kinds of informal gatherings for which it 's named . el botellón , literally meaning `` big bottle , '' is the spanish habit of communal street drinking -- but at this botelllón , it 's probably best to keep the party inside the chic new space , which was designed by the firm architecture + light , than to bring the party outside onto market street . botellón is the latest restaurant from the andalé management group , which opened mezcalito in russian hill in 2016 and runs the andalé restaurants in los gatos and the san francisco and oakland airports . ",
        "now , they 've taken on the space first occupied by hecho , which opened in 2014 and closed last spring . the updated space at 2200 market boasts new lighting and murals from artists david flores and caroline zarraga , but hews roughly to the same layout as its predecessor . the new restaurant also retains the cocktail focus that hecho landed on near the end of its run , with botellón 's drinks from jesse ostroski and cocktail consultant saul ranella . those include many with mescal , like the mission statement , and several boozy slushy options including one with absinthe , sherry , and black cherry juice called sherry , cherry , and the green fairy . ",
        "botellón is billing its food as `` california cuisine with mediterranean influences , '' and the menu comes from two executive chefs , nicholas andoe and matthew d'ambrosi . it 's divided into sharable plates , salads , large plates , and seasonal pizzas from a sizable stone hearth . botellón quietly opened before the holidays and celebrates its grand opening tonight . hours are 5 p. m. to 11 p. m. monday through thursday , friday 5 p. m. to midnight , saturday 4 p. m. to midnight , and sunday 5 p. m. to 10 p. m. weekend brunch service is coming soon .
