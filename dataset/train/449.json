        "about half an hour into call me by your name , luca guadagnino 's film adaptation of andr√© aciman 's 2007 novel of the same name , a precocious 17-year-old named elio sits at an outdoor club . he 's surrounded by some friends who are gabbing about a duo on the dance floor : oliver and chiara . `` who would n't love to be in her shoes ? '' one of elio 's friends swoons . a handsome american graduate student , oliver does n't look all that different from the hellenistic statues of buff men he 's helping his professor , who 's also elio 's father , study for six weeks . ",
        "the music eventually switches to the psychedelic furs ' 1982 track `` love my way , '' drawing elio 's friends to the floor . at first , elio hangs back , puffing on a cigarette and gazing , intrigued , at oliver . he smiles , then joins the group . and there elio and oliver are , bopping and bouncing to the music -- the only thing , in that moment , connecting the two young men , whose romantic feelings for one another unfurl over the course of the coming-of-age drama . released as a sneak peek before the film 's november release , this particular scene has become the stuff of memes . ",
        "but it deserves more serious attention , too . though other memorable encounters between elio and oliver follow , this moving scene is arguably a set piece of call me by your name . it 's the first real moment of closeness between the story 's two main queer characters , who are testing out ways to nurture their growing intimacy -- even if they have to navigate it wordlessly and out in the open . guadagnino 's film , set in an italian village in the summer of 1983 , is filled with similarly loaded moments , including a flirty touch during an afternoon volleyball game and a piano recital that 's better described , perhaps , as a coy game of cat and mouse . ",
        "yet the dance scene stands out for the way it zooms in on the different layers of tacit emotional wrangling familiar to so many queer people -- starting with that earlier remark about chiara : `` who would n't love to be in her shoes ? '' there 's a dark duality to elio 's friend 's words . on the one hand , they speak to an innocent wistfulness felt by the crowd of rapt women ogling oliver . but her question means something different for elio , who understands that there 's something not right about his own interest in oliver . ",
        "the film takes place a couple of years after the aids epidemic began , and deeper cultural anxieties and taboos that society has long had around homosexuality complicate elio 's already-muddy feelings . this conversation is n't for you , the scene seems to tell him . given the times , what can elio really do about his attraction to a man ? well , he can dance . maybe not `` in her shoes , '' but he can get as close to oliver as possible -- a move that feels like an act of rebellion , though the two never quite make eye contact . ",
        "virginia woolf , an author who herself was queer at an even earlier time , once described the transformative and soothing power of dancing . `` that is the quality which dance music has -- no other , '' a 21-year-old woolf wrote , exquisitely , in 1903 . `` it stirs some barbaric instinct -- lulled asleep in our sober lives ... we dance to drown our sorrows -- but dance , dance -- if you stop you are lost . `` woolf 's words could easily apply to elio and oliver on the dance floor , where their free-form movement mirrors the choreography of their own searching sexuality . ",
        "neither seems to have received any direction or guidance on how to explore his same-sex attraction , but they 're beginning to learn . hammer recently told npr that `` so much of that scene was about watching someone be totally enraptured and just lost in a moment and enjoying themselves , because that 's one of the things that oliver is able to do that elio really appreciates . `` even the song used for the sequence is significant : `` love my way '' is very much a tune of its era -- that brooding , besotted british pop that sat atop the charts in the '80s and telegraphed a range of queer sensibilities , including isolation , maddening expectation , and unexplored love . ",
        "`` love my way , it 's a new road / i follow where my mind goes , '' the psychedelic furs vocalist richard butler sings . `` they 'd put us on a railroad / they 'd dearly make us pay for laughing in their faces and making it our way . '' like the song 's narrator , elio and oliver , too , are learning to love their own way , and they must do so without the benefit of a shared script for how to navigate that passion . the lyrics help articulate what otherwise ca n't be expressed aloud by either elio or oliver , as they dance side by side . ",
        "an important sequence near the end of call me by your name not only winks to that initial dance , but also offers a melancholy vision of what 's to come . as the summer approaches its bittersweet end , elio and oliver , at the suggestion of elio 's suspecting-and-supportive parents , take a trip to bergamo . on an empty street one night , the couple , drunk and affectionate , move around each other in a wheeling dance , stopping only to kiss ; elio is , for the briefest of moments , `` in her shoes . '' ",
        "but then , oliver detects a familiar tune playing in the distance . it is , of course , `` love my way . '' `` you 're missing it ! '' shrieks oliver , excitedly , hurrying elio to hunt down the source of the song that was so central to those first heady summer days . they find the source : several people are blaring the song from their car . oliver grabs a woman 's hand and begins to dance with her , while elio sits and watches them . though it 's a callback , this sequence could also be read as an aching nod to oliver 's future : he eventually leaves elio behind , and later gets engaged to a woman . ",
        "call me by your name grapples with subjects that are n't altogether uncommon in cinema : adolescence , desire , heartache . even so , it is unique among coming-of-age romances for how precisely , but tenderly , it portrays the private lives of its queer characters . the at times unspoken longing that ricochets between elio and oliver -- a lingering stare across the dance floor -- is exhilarating and sensuous in a way language is n't always able to be . a dance ca n't last forever , of course , and it does n't , necessarily , promise a rosy boy-meets-boy future . ",
        "but it can leave an indelible mark on the dancers ' lives , long after the night is over , again calling to mind woolf 's words . `` this one night we will be mad , '' the author wrote . `` what matters anything so long as one 's step is in time -- so long as one 's whole body and mind are dancing , too -- what shall end it ? ''   "
