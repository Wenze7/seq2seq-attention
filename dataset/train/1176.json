        "when i read the actress salma hayek 's op-ed in the new york times about her stressful relationship with harvey weinstein , i had an immediate flash of recognition . when he ordered her to film a sex scene , she had a physical breakdown . she called it a nervous breakdown . `` my body began to shake uncontrollably , my breath was short and i began to cry and cry , unable to stop , as if i were throwing up tears . my mind understood that i had to do it , but my body would n't stop crying and convulsing . '' ",
        "then she started throwing up . her reaction was n't just about doing a sex scene . it was the result of many years of physical and psychological harassment from this powerful man . harassment and bullying can cause stress that manifests in physical health problems that affect our work and lives . women in male-dominated fields like construction understand this connection between stress and physical illness because it happens to us . in 1981 i worked as the only female electrician on a big construction site in san francisco . two other women also worked on that site and we sought each other out at lunch breaks . ",
        "cece , a black woman , was one of the very first of us to make it into the elevator constructor trade . she was a `` helper . '' she told me stories about her relationship with her violent white supremacist journeyman that made me fear for her life . juanita , a carpenter , was mexican-american . i saw comments about her written in the porta potties . `` the little woman carpenter takes it in the ass . '' then others had crossed out ass and written in other orifices . it was a game with the men and it appeared they all participated . ",
        "as the weeks went on , both these women began having health problems . cece disappeared from the job and i learned she had fallen ill with some undiagnosable stomach ailment and landed in the hospital . then juanita , who seldom was able to eat much at lunch , did n't come to work one day . my tool buddy on that job -- the only guy who would work with me -- had my back . but one day he decided to drag up -- to quit the job -- and i was left on my own . ",
        "without my protector , i too became ill and had to leave the job . all three of us women had worked hard to get into our trades and we were proud of our status as the first females . we were determined to succeed . but even though our minds told us we had to go to work , our bodies rebelled . we were forced to leave in spite of our commitment to stay . the same thing happened to shannon faulkner , the first woman to be admitted to the citadel military academy in 1995 . she was well prepared physically , but it was the stress and its physical manifestations that did her in . ",
        "she dropped out after four days of pledge week citing emotional and psychological abuse and physical exhaustion . she was derided by men as a wimp and by women because she made us look bad . few believed that the stress of a hostile environment caused her failure . it 's time we start to believe .
