        "i met this woman at my gym back in august , had spoken to her a couple times before asking her out , which is when she admits she had a boyfriend . she 'd always act super excited whenever we ran into each other , would touch me , etc. . i told her i 'd be interested if she was single and after that every time we 'd run into each other she 'd always have a huge smile on her face and would talk with me , even just lock eyes with me and smile . during one particular conversation she is letting me put my hand on her thigh/knee and smiling/laughing when this is all going down . ",
        "about a month ago she mentions that is free over the weekend and asked me if i was , so i made a move . she has this huge smile on her face but then says she has to mention her boyfriend , but after that she just stood there smiling . i had n't seen her since then until last night and she is there with her boyfriend . she briefly says hi but when he leaves she is staring at me smiling so i walked over to her and started talking to her . i leave the conversation shortly afterwards and i see the boyfriend and immediately feel bad for him , i wanted to say something but i opted out of it , later see them leave together .
