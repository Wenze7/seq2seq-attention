        "north korea wants to engage directly with the us to assure its security , russia 's foreign minister has revealed . sergey lavrov said he has briefed us secretary of state rex tillerson on the developments and that moscow is ready to `` facilitate such talks . '' `` we know that , above all , north korea wants to talk to the us about its own security assurances , '' he said in vienna following his meeting with tillerson . `` russia is ready to take part in facilitating such talks . '' lavrov and tillerson spoke on the sidelines of an organization for security and cooperation in europe meeting . ",
        "lavrov reiterated that all parties involved in the korean crisis should `` break the vicious cycle of confrontation , reckless schemes and sanctions '' and engage in meaningful dialogue instead . he also pointed to american military exercises near the korean peninsula and washington 's aggressive rhetoric , which he said only leads to a further escalation of tensions . this is `` unacceptable , '' lavrov made clear . earlier thursday , the head of russia 's senate 's foreign affairs committee , konsantin kosachev , met with north korea 's ambassador to moscow to discuss the situation on the peninsula . ",
        "following his exchange with kim young jae , kosachev said pyongyang has absolutely no interest in ratcheting tensions , not to mention starting a full-blown military conflict . but , kim added , pyongyang `` does not fear war '' either . kosachev said a viable way to resolve the crisis is an all-in dialogue between relevant parties and joint efforts aimed at lowering tensions . `` we are absolutely not interested in the escalation of tensions , in any military action , '' kosachev told the interfax news agency following the meeting . russia `` will do everything it can to prevent this escalation , '' he added . ",
        "both lavrov and kosachev once again referred to the so-called `` double freeze '' initiative put forward by russia and china soon after tensions heightened in early september . the plan envisages the us and its allies stop all major military exercises in the region in exchange for pyongyang suspending its nuclear and ballistic missile program . the initiative , however , has been spurned by washington , with the us envoy to the un , nikki haley , denouncing it as `` insulting . '' on wednesday , the north korean foreign ministry said us military drills near the korean peninsula as well as washington 's belligerent rhetoric make an outbreak of war in the region inevitable . ",
        "`` the remaining question now is , when will the war break out , '' the ministry 's spokesperson told the north korean state news agency kcna wednesday . on monday , the us launched massive air drills together with south korea . the five-day exercises , scheduled to last until december 8 , involve a total of 12,000 personnel and over 230 military aircraft . pointedly , the maneuvers particularly simulate attacks on pyongyang 's nuclear and missile installations while claiming it to be `` defensive . '' in late november , north korea conducted yet another missile test , claiming it had successfully launched a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking the us mainland . "
