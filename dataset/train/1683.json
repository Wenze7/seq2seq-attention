        "it 's a win-win deal for all you marvel fans out there . after years of speculation and what-if moments , the x-men , fantastic four and deadpool will finally join the rest of the marvel juggernaut following the media deal of the year , if not the decade . but it is difficult to be similarly enthusiastic about the walt disney company 's dis $ 52.4 billion takeover of key twenty-first century fox foxa assets . while disney does gain many mouthwatering options , it remains to be seen how these assets will help it launch its own streaming offensive in 2019 . ",
        "and was the asset sale , murdoch 's way of acknowledging that he 's largely quitting the entertainment side of things ? the media mogul refused to acknowledge such feelings at a recent news conference saying : `` are we retreating ? absolutely not . '' has disney really benefited ? probably the biggest media player of them all at present , disney 's performance on the bourses has lagged far behind its soaring ambition . since late 2015 , the stock assumed a sluggish trajectory and has gained only 4.4 % over the last two years , underperforming the broader industry over this period . ",
        "disney has a zacks rank # 3 . you can see the complete list of today 's zacks # 1 rank stocks here . at the time of this acquisition , disney is beset by several problems , particularly at espn where its subscriber base is shrinking even as it has to bear high programming costs . recently , it decided to terminate the distribution agreement with netflix inc. . nflx for subscription streaming and is on the verge of launching its own streaming services -- one for disney and pixar brands and another for espn followers . disney does gain several key media assets as it prepares to launch its own streaming service . ",
        "but is difficult to decipher how the large number of regional sporting networks it owns , reputedly worth nearly a third of the entire deal value , will help in shoring up its losing tv business . surely , all these businesses are also facing the prospect of a wave of ensuing cord cutting . further , the media behemoth now has access to fox 's massive collection of movies and television programming . but what disney needs to do at this point is to build a streaming service with a loyal customer base . recent trends in this segment clearly point to a fragmented scenario where the popularity of niche offerings is rising . ",
        "disney may be better off launching a more focused service and only time will tell how it utilizes its new found assets . the acquisition of a large stake in hulu , on the other hand , is more of a clear victory . intensifying competition forced murdoch 's hand ? the view on the fox end of things is even less clear and the jury is still out on what forced murdoch 's hand . essentially , he has offered up to disney the lion 's share of fox 's media and entertainment assets . this is an unlikely move for a media baron who was well known for aggressive deal making . ",
        "for instance , in 2014 , murdoch famously , and presciently , bid for time warner inc. . twx . but his confident posturing notwithstanding , the deal is probably a quiet acknowledgement of not only how much the media business has changed but also of how technology centric it has become . further , the space has been marked by hectic acquisitions which have created even bigger media behemoths . for instance , verizon communications inc. . vz has acquired huffington post , aol and yahoo . disney is an even stronger case in point , since it now owns not only marvel but also lucasfilm which makes the star wars motion pictures . ",
        "the sale of these fox assets will allow murdoch to focus on his beloved newspaper assets which includes the likes of the wall street journal and the times . this is murdoch 's first love since he built his business from the lone paper in adelaide that he inherited from his father . murdoch has indicated that he may merge new fox , the entity to be created from surviving twenty-first century fox assets with news corporation nwsa or news corp. . murdhoch 's heir apparent and his older son lachlan has said : `` the new fox is about returning to our roots as a lean , aggressive , challenger brand . '' ",
        "personal equations also at playindustry watchers have also characterized the deal as a turning point in murdoch 's relationship with his younger son james , the chief executive of 21st century fox . apparently , differences between father and son have accumulated over the years , and are now difficult to resolve . essentially , murdoch believes his younger son failed to develop his empire 's entertainment assets to their full potential . james murdoch probably has a future at disney and the media behemoth 's chairman bob iger has hinted at such a prospect . but at this point , their seems to be no clear and immediate winners from a deal which has captured the imagination of investors and industry watchers alike .
