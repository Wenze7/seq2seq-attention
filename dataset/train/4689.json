        "holiday cookies can be beautiful and alluring - especially those with the little silver beads sprinkled on them - but a compliance guide has cleared up whether those are actually edible or not . simply put , they are defined as a decorative , non-food item by the food and drug administration . `` when small silver balls known as ` silver drag√©es ' are sold exclusively for decorating cakes and are used under conditions which preclude their consumption as confectionery , they are not considered to be in the category of a food or confectionery , '' the fda wrote of the `` unsafe '' color additive online . ",
        "if you 're worried about the little silver sprinkles touching your food , do n't worry . they are safe to be cooked with , but just need to be taken off before the holiday treat is eaten . do n't let this news prevent you from spreading holiday joy in the form of cookies , just change your decoration plans . if you 're in the need of a delicious recipe for a cookie , go through the photos in the gallery above . heather leighton is a digital reporter at chron . com . she considers herself as a jack of all trades and covers various topics from entertainment to politics .
