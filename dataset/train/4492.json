        "wilton -- after 17 years of selling shoes , clothing and accessories in wilton center , katherine sanford is moving her contemporary boutique chou chou closer to home . the store will be downsized from its current 3,000-square-foot space at 21 river road to a 900-square-foot storefront at 165 rowayton ave. while this decision was n't easy to make , the timing seemed right , said katie senter , one of sanford 's daughters who helps run the store . `` wilton has been a great community to have a business in , but things have definitely changed in our personal lives , '' senter said , referring to her recent move to texas , among other changes . ",
        "`` also , retail has definitely changed dramatically . so we just found that we do n't need such a large space any longer to be able to deliver the value to our customers . '' like other loyal chou chou customers , joyce andersen is sad to see the boutique go . she 's been a customer since chou chou opened its original store in 2001 , before the boutique expanded to its current space . `` i have been so reliant on them for everything , from dressy clothes to everyday stuff , '' andersen said . `` they 've become good friends and they 're kind people and a great asset to our town . ",
        "the shopping in wilton is limited . '' building relationships with customers like andersen was the most memorable part of conducting business in wilton , senter said , especially for her mom . `` she loved being a part of the wilton community . she will miss it very , very much . they 've become family to her , '' senter said . while reasons for moving the business were mostly personal , senter said high rent costs did n't make it any easier for them to stay . kimco realty owns the wilton executive campus chou chou is in , as well as the wilton river park shopping complex right next to it . ",
        "a total of 14 kimco-owned spaces are currently available for lease , according to its website , including a space across from chou chou and another one a few doors down . `` as a tenant , there does n't seem to be a level of concern that certainly the community of wilton has about the stores and the business that are in wilton , '' senter said . kimco realty said chou chou 's relocation was n't a matter of a rent issue . while the realty company is disappointed to see chou chou leave the center , leasing representative amy daniels said it is still an exciting time for wilton river park . ",
        "`` between the upcoming opening of tim labant 's parlor concept , the recent opening of the sprouting spaces art studio , and our new event programming , we 've certainly felt a renewed excitement around the center , '' daniels said in an email . `` we 'll be actively marketing the chou chou space , with the goal of adding yet another great option to the mix for wilton residents . '' chou chou is in the final weeks of its liquidation sale , with discounts from 50 to 70 percent off . any new and existing store credits will be honored at the new location , which will open in the spring .
