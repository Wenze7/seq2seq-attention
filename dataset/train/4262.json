        "tesla 's model 3 may still be a rarity on the road , never mind in dealerships , but one early owner is already taking his ev on a road trip -- and recounting all the positives and problems along the way . the electric sedan has only just begun deliveries for non-employees at the california company , but that has only stoked the massive interest in just how closely it keeps to tesla founder and ceo elon musk 's promises . the answer to that question , it seems , is `` sometimes it does , sometimes it does n't . '' ",
        "owner you you xue 's so-called tesla model 3 road trip has shaken out some early glitches , certainly . they range from the fairly mundane , like warning lights for the tire pressure sensors not working as expected , through everyday annoyances , like knocking noises from the wipers and mistakes in how the car calculates charging rates . then there are the more worrying faults . they include an air bag warning light , some unexpected pops that led to their own warning notifications , and a music system that suffers weird crackling sounds , despite having been upgraded to tesla 's premium version . ",
        "at the same time , it 's also proving to be a demonstration of what continues to help set tesla apart from its auto-industry peers . a software update for the model 3 has been released today , for example , and though you ca n't install them while the car is charging , that 's still a lot more convenient than having to take it to the dealership as would be the case with most other vehicles . tesla also dispatched a service technician out to the side of the road to address a touchscreen issue on the car . ",
        "the hope is that the new software version will fix some of the lingering glitches xue has observed , like the ui on the central touchscreen soft-resetting during charging . he 's also seen the controls for the steering wheel adjustment freeze unexpectedly , and some lag from the rear-view camera . nonetheless , xue still seems impressed by the car , and pleased with his purchase . his drive has also proved an unexpected way to give the model 3-curious a chance to see the car in action . the automaker 's most affordable electric car was originally intended to be well into production by this point , but elon musk & co. 's ambitious estimates have failed to pan out . ",
        "even had that been achieved , mind , with hundreds of thousands of people on the pre-registration list it 's going to be some time before a fraction of that number get up close with their car . so , in addition to driving his model 3 , xue has also been offering other reservation holders the chance to briefly get behind the wheel . with around 5,000 miles already covered in five days -- and including a number of donuts , the road trip team reports -- it sounds like this is a whole lot more than the `` drive around the block '' a typical car dealership 's test drive might consist of .
