        "we are tackling the best question supplied by iowa fans each day . if you 'd like to submit a question , tweet to scott dochterman here . look for our iowa question of the day every monday through friday . go here to see all of our previous answers . answer : one of the more talked-about subjects in iowa the last few weeks is the hy-vee classic , which includes the state 's four division i basketball schools : iowa , iowa state , northern iowa and drake . the schools formerly played in an annual round-robin on campuses before iowa and iowa state pulled the plug after the 2011 season . ",
        "in 2012 , the schools began playing a one-day event in des moines . one season , iowa faces drake and iowa state plays northern iowa and it rotates the next . in 2016 , the schools agreed to a four-year extension that 's up after the 2019 classic , which will be held dec. . 21 , 2019 . there is a clause in the contract where if one of the schools ' leagues expands its schedule and the number of required games jumps to 22 , then that school can withdraw from the classic by giving 18 months notice . ",
        "the big ten recently increased its schedule to 20 games , beginning with the 2018-19 season . with an annual game in the big ten-acc challenge , plus a regular appearance in the gavitt games , iowa qualifies for that withdrawal . would it exercise that clause for the final year ? `` i have n't talked about that after this , '' iowa coach fran mccaffery said . `` i just play the games that are on the schedule . we 've got uni next year , that 's all i know . they 're going to be good . '' ",
        "the previous round-robin was popular with basketball fans , and it was unusual . in kentucky , for instance , you would n't see kentucky and louisville playing at murray state and western kentucky every other year . but it happened at iowa . then it ended because , well , power 5 schools do n't want to play road games at mid-majors , especially those with an incredible home-court advantage such as at northern iowa . with the big ten expanding to 20 league games , an extension is unlikely . there 's no way iowa will play at drake or northern iowa in the near future . ",
        "so enjoy the hy-vee classic next year and possibly in 2019 because it 's probably coming to an end . the post here 's the status of iowa 's basketball classic for 2018 and beyond appeared first on land of 10 .   "
