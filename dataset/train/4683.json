        "houston -- a forensic pathologist with an impressive collection of cookbooks , dr. stephen pustilnik has spent much of his life wielding a knife . the houston chronicle reports his houston kitchen is crowded with a formidable collection of the world 's sharpest knives . long , sleek japanese blades mingle with thick , sturdy german ones . among his favorites is a cobalt-handled knife with a slight curve -- an amateur 's mistake . it was the first one he made himself as he learned the craft of knife making in 2012 . since then , he has built a business that combines his life 's two passions : good cooking and precise autopsies . ",
        "he is now working his way through a year-and-a-half-long waiting list of chefs , home cooks and pathologists willing to spend hundreds of dollars on knives that hold an edge and make clean work of anything from gnarly vegetables to sinewy flesh . he started the business , called houston edge works , in 2013 with the promise of sharp blades made from extra-hard steel alloys . he customizes lustrous handles to fit the buyer 's hand . the fascination began when he was an undergraduate at the university of pennsylvania , determined to improve on the dishes his mother had prepared during his childhood . ",
        "he taught himself to cook with bargain-priced knives until he was able to afford the pricier japanese ones kept locked behind glass at cookware shops . `` to be a better cook , you need a better knife , '' he said . as he cooked his way through medical school at washington university in st. louis , he realized that his success in both the kitchen and the lab depended on knife quality . his stiff steel chef knives severed animal flesh with ease , but the dull , flexible blades used in the morgue slipped against human organs and made dissections difficult . ",
        "he started his pathology career in florida before moving to alabama and finally texas , all the while seeking a sharp , sturdy knife that would make clean cuts in body parts photographed for presentation in court . for years , he made do with a sanitary food service knife typically used to carve wheels of hard cheese . but the cheap knife needed constant sharpening , eventually frustrating him to the point of giving up the search and making his own . he worked with a craftsman to design a 20-inch chalef , a type of knife traditionally used for kosher slaughter , out of premium steel . ",
        "`` it is the perfect knife for autopsy , '' he said . though he tends to use a scalpel for eviscerations , the custom knife became his go-to tool . the process of making it enthralled him , so he began apprenticing with a local knifemaker who allowed him to use his equipment in exchange for materials . now , he most often makes chefs ' knives from sheets of some of the toughest steel alloys , strengthened with tungston , vanadium or chromium and heat-treated by a metallurgist . he finishes the blades in a shower of sparks and pixie-like steel dust that accumulates beneath the belt grinder on his garage workbench . ",
        "the two-month process wraps up with the careful construction of a customized knife handle , designed and crafted in a backroom workshop lined with stacks of rare materials . centuries-old wood preserved in the acidic depths of ukrainian bogs . mammoth teeth . abalone . pustilnik solicited some of houston 's best-known chefs when he started the business , hoping that a shared passion and word-of-mouth advertising would grow his customer base . he one day appeared without warning at the restaurant bar of chris shepherd 's underbelly . shepherd emerged from the kitchen and was taken aback by the fast-talking stranger unfurling a roll of knives . ",
        "`` it was just a whirlwind when he walked in , '' he said . shepherd , a self-described knife freak , turned out to be an easy sell . pustilnik returned weeks later with a large chef 's knife fashioned with texans colors . but when shepherd picked it up , something did n't feel right . pustilnik zeroed in on his grip , watching how his wrist moved across a cutting board . he whisked the knife back to his shop and returned later with a new one , a 12-incher with a handle specially designed for shepherd 's large hand . ",
        "`` it 's like a freakin ' dream now , so ergonomic and beautiful , '' shepherd said . `` you do n't get that every day . `` pustilnik , after spending years examining human bodies , speaks easily of the particular mechanics of the hands . he measures his customers ' palms and observes where the metacarpophalangeal joints -- the hinges at the knuckles -- rest on a knife handle . the goal , he said , is for the chef to focus solely on the food , not the way the knife feels . `` when the hand and the blade come together in an ergonomic way , it 's seamless , '' he said . ",
        "`` it 's just the chef executing his vision . `` the blades he makes now far outshine the blue-handled one that started the business . he made knives for well-known chefs including michael voltaggio , jet tila , scott conant as well as medical professionals in private practice and skilled home cooks with money to spend on a lifelong tool . he agonizes over each one until he 's forced to part with it , a bittersweet ending to a weekslong affair . `` i 'm just staring at it and thinking , ` i love this knife , ' '' he said . ",
        "`` then i call the customer and tell them it 's ready . '' ___ information from : houston chronicle , is an ap member exchange shared by the houston chronicle .   "
