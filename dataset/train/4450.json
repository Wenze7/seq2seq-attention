        "jacksonville -- each time a big fish hits the market in sports free agency , we 're all reminded there is no personal income tax in florida . that $ 100 million contract looks a lot more like $ 100 million when you can keep those percentage points . but at least one florida team has been paying a different tax in recent years . losers of 74 of their past 96 games entering last offseason , the jaguars have had to pay a bad team tax for years -- a surcharge doled out by perennially poor teams hoping to attract top free agents . ",
        "how do you snag the guy deciding between last place in the afc south and a possible super bowl run elsewhere ? you 'll typically have to pay him more than market price . the jaguars aggressively pursued the policy in recent years . loaded with cap room , from 2014 to 2016 jacksonville signed 28 free agents to a total of $ 488 million in contracts -- more money than any other team in the league . the on-field results over those three seasons : 11 wins , total . undaunted , new evp tom coughlin brought in another group of pricy free agents this offseason : defensive end calais campbell , cornerback a. j. bouye and safety barry church . ",
        "this time the great free agency spend-all worked . the jags made the playoffs for the first time since the bush administration , won a home playoff game for the first time since the clinton administration and face a team this weekend that they drubbed earlier this year , with an afc title game berth on the line . `` i came here because i knew it was possible -- that this was the place for me because i knew this place had potential , '' campbell told the mmqb after last week 's 10-3 win over buffalo . `` we worked really hard to try to bring that potential to life . ",
        "we earned this . there 's no mistake . i mean , we earned this . '' you can be forgiven for thinking at the start of the year that these would be the same old jags . quarterback blake bortles had declined noticeably in 2016 , his third season ; head coach doug marrone had a losing record going into his first full year at the helm ; and no one was sure how coughlin 's return to jacksonville , where he 'd coached from 1995 to 2002 , would work . veteran left tackle branden albert , whom coughlin brought in through a trade with miami , failed even before he had a chance to succeed -- the oft-injured albert retired four days into training camp . ",
        "in week 1 , receiver allen robinson tore his acl . but there was that defense , constructed in earnest beginning in 2016 through the draft and free agency . with campbell , bouye and church joining all-star corner jalen ramsey , the 2016 first-round pick , and defensive tackle malik jackson , the splash 2016 free-agent signing , a dominant defense took shape . marrone was n't afraid to admit that jacksonville would be a run-heavy offense , with 2017 first-rounder leonard fournette the centerpiece . the nfl 's second-ranked defense has been fine with that approach . `` we just ask to get up by seven , '' bouye says . ",
        "`` once we get up by seven , we know what we 're capable of . '' bouye was a prime addition at cornerback , after the texans chose not to franchise-tag him . he had six picks and was named second-team all-pro . church , the former cowboy , had four interceptions and further helped solidify the secondary . but the biggest catch was campbell , the longtime cardinal who chose jacksonville 's offer over a smaller deal from his hometown broncos . the 10th-year veteran had a career-high 14.5 sacks and was named all-pro for the first time . ",
        "the free agents of years past who have succeeded in jacksonville -- jackson , safety tashaun gipson and punter brad nortman -- are far outnumbered by the failures : dan skuta , prince amukamara , mackenzy bernadeau , davon house , kelvin beachum , jared odrick , julius thomas . `` as far as who we have in here , you know what you 're going to get every day , '' says 12th-year tight end marcedes lewis , the only person in the locker room who knew what playoff football in a jaguars uniform looked like before sunday . ",
        "`` you know they 're coming in there fighting for the right reasons , and not putting their paycheck in front of the main goal . it 's been a blessing this year . '' on most monday nights the defensive line will go out to dinner with each other . on thursdays during the season , bouye would host fellow defensive backs at his home , where they would watch thursday night football while getting dry needling and other soft-tissue work done . the dbs will go out to eat on away-game saturdays , though a player can be excused if he has family in town that weekend . ",
        "`` a. j. is a very unselfish player , '' fourth-year cornerback aaron colvin says . `` i think that 's why he 'll just continue to elevate , because he puts others before himself . he 's been a huge blessing in my life this season and he 's trying to bring everyone along with him . it 's just another form of leadership . sometimes it does n't get talked about because everyone does n't see it but week in and week out he 's taking care of us . '' if the infusion of this year 's free agents has helped build camaraderie , the return of coughlin has brought discipline . ",
        "gone are the days of friendly gus bradley ; this is the era of marrone and coughlin , both of whom are called `` coach '' by the players . coughlin brought a level of discipline with him unseen in jacksonville since , well ... coughlin . players are to wear black socks , not white , around the building . in meetings at the hotel during road trips , players are to wear team-issued gear . there are no hats , beanies or hoodies up during those meetings , either . `` the other way did n't work , so we need to see if this is it , '' says lewis . ",
        "`` if the feeling of having a little structure is going to make you tighten up in a way that you can perform and know you have to be accountable to this guy , then let 's do it . '' the jaguars did n't have to sell bouye on bortles when he came to jacksonville . the two overlapped at central florida for two years , and the corner kept an eye on his knights during bortles ' big junior season . `` i saw him when they won the fiesta bowl and he did everything he could to take care of the ball . ",
        "he had good defense at ucf , '' bouye says . `` when i came here , i figured that 's what they were going to try to do . everything has n't been perfect , but we 're afc south division champs . `` he just has to stay hungry , ignore the noise , and he 's going to be one of the reasons we get to where we want to get . '' bouye is being generous -- bortles was the 20th-ranked passer in the nfl this year -- but the quarterback is at least protecting the football . ",
        "he threw a career-low 13 interceptions this season . he was also sacked a career-low 24 times . in jacksonville 's 30-9 win in pittsburgh in october , bortles had just eight completions for 95 yards and a pick , but the defense intercepted ben roethlisberger five times . all but three of jacksonville 's points in that game came off turnovers , including two pick-sixes . it 's difficult to imagine a two-time super bowl-winning quarterback will repeat that performance in the postseason , but colvin says the jaguars can take a lot from that game . the defense , finally coalescing after all those years of free-agent failures , played some of its best football in pittsburgh , and it looks forward to showing it again sunday . ",
        "`` we love when the game is on our shoulders , '' colvin says . `` it 's just a different look in our eye when the game is in our hands . i do n't think at any given moment we ever feel like we 're out of a game . we feel like we can make a game-changing play . if we 've got to score all the points , we feel like we can do that .
