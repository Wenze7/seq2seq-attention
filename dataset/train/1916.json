        "progression and development are important in every profession . for teachers even more so . we 'd all like to give students the best possible knowledge-base to rely on in their future professional life . so , where should teacher improvement come from ? how have seasoned teaching-masters gotten so incredibly good ? part of it comes from pure experience and formal training . but the factor most experts point to when it comes to improving skills is recieving and acting on feedback . the thing is just that teacher receive a notoriously small amount of feedback over the duration of their career . ",
        "just ask bill gates . i hope no one has missed this inspiring ted-talk on the subject . and he 's not alone to think of feedback as a key to professional development . in almost every profession , feedback is the main driver of improvement , from athletes to ceos to authors . we all need feedback to become better . in 2009 , the oecd organization appointed a group of experts to investigate what effect feedback has within the teaching profession . here are just some of the highlights from the report : feedback has a strong positive influence on teachers and their work . ",
        "feedback increases job satisfaction . feedback significantly increases teacher development . the more detailed the feedback , the better improvement . many countries have a lacking feedback system , if it exists in the first place . adding to the low occurrence of feedback , many schools and universities have for a long time advocated a system where student feedback surveys constitute a high stake evaluation of the teacher himself . results have a direct influence on decisions such as tenure , salary raise , and career advancement . for these schools and universities ` teacher feedback ' has become synonymous to ` teacher evaluations ' . ",
        "the problem with such a system is that it removes focus from improving teaching practices and replaces it with an easy way for administration to get rid of unruly teachers . so , has teacher evaluations derailed completely ? many claim they have . a long time ago . for example , although findings are conflicting , some researchers have found a correlation between teachers with high remarks on end-course evaluations and a more generous grading . if that 's true , there 's a risk of teacher evaluations actually causing more harm than good in education . do n't get me wrong , we absolutely need to evaluate teachers . ",
        "but a system where the main driver of improvement is also what decides a continued employment is far from ideal . taking matters into own handsa group of educators realized the feedback system was flawed a while back and started to collect feedback on their own initiative at different times during courses . the practice was an instant success and later became a more integrated part of the standard feedback procedure in forward-thinking schools . today this is what we refer to as formative and mid-term evaluations . when the purpose is to collect valuable feedback to improve teaching skills , formative and mid-course evaluations have been proven superior to end-course evaluations for several reasons : their only purpose is to improve teaching practices . ",
        "informal . administered and review directly by the teacher . focused and short . improvements can be implemented immediately . luckily , most institutions have now realized the greatness that comes with informal feedback collection . if you belong to an institution without a clear strategy of teacher improvement and feedback gathering , i strongly suggest you take matters into your own hands . next , let 's look at how feedback is being collected . out of every 10 feedback survey questions students are being asked , approximately 8 are closed-ended likert-scale questions . close-ended questions are great for following trends over time and as a framework for statistical analysis . ",
        "what they 're less good at is providing useful information that can be used as a basis for improvement . for that , we need open-ended questions as they provide a way to collect detailed information without limiting responses . something as complex as teaching simply ca n't be described using 5 or 7 pre-set stances . what 's more is that you 'll often learn about things you did n't expect at all using written feedback . the setback , of course , is analyzing the result . digging the gems out of even a small evaluation can be a arduos and time-consuming task . ",
        "fortunately , technology is about to bring us a way of handling open-ended responses with a breeze . a couple of innovative edtech-companies across the world are competing to develop a way of automatically making sense of open-ended student feedback using advanced technology . the goal is to translate student comments into actionable recomendations on how to improve teachingif you 're curious about how it works or like to try yourself , take a look at this great report containing everything you need to know about text analytics for student comments . a well-functioning system is n't that far off , it turns out .
