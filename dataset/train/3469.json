        "the victorian pub closed its doors several years ago and ended-up being boarded-upa former coventry pub which dates back to the mid-19th century is enjoying a new lease of life as an apartment complex . the old craven arms in woodway lane , walsgrave , has been transformed into 20 new flats . the victorian pub closed its doors several years ago and ended-up being boarded-up . permission was granted for it to be redeveloped by coventry city council planners in november 2015 . approval was given for an extension and a new block in the pub grounds , along with parking for residents . ",
        "planners ruled the flats would fit in well with the area which is mainly housing . following an extensive refurbishment the former pub has been given the new name of montague court and the development is being managed and let by local estate agents loveitts . the new residential development consists of three studios , six one-bedroom flats and 11 two-bedroom homes . six of the apartments have already been let . paul barnes , director of coventry-based loveitts , said : `` this new development is another great boost for the city , providing more high-quality homes in a prominent and sought after location . ",
        "`` we are thrilled to be involved in the management and letting of the site -- it is yet another impressive development to add to our already extensive portfolio of properties to let . `` the craven arms has served the people of coventry for many years , but like a number of pubs around the country , it was forced to close . since then it has been abandoned and left boarded-up . `` this exciting new development has once again breathed life into the old building and will enable it to remain a functional part of the local community . '' ",
        "montague court came under the management of loveitts just weeks after the estate agents announced it had been instructed to manage and let 11 new flats in foleshill , after the old vauxhall working mens ' club was transformed into a new housing complex . the new development in eld road also includes a mix of one and two-bedroom apartments -- with properties at both sites now on the market and others occupied . mr barnes added : `` with the ongoing issue of finding enough affordable housing in cities across the country , both developments in coventry provide a solution to this much publicised dilemma . ",
        "`` we are conducting a high volume of viewings on the development and have now received applications on over half of the properties in a short amount of time since marketing .
