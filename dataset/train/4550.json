        "a morning meeting at the white house showed progress in ongoing discussions over the future of immigrants brought to the u. s. as children . president trump hosted a bipartisan meeting with lawmakers to discuss a compromise on immigration issues , including the how to deal with participants in deferred action for childhood arrivals , an obama-era program the administration is winding down . by the time the tuesday discussions came to a close , lawmakers had agreed to focus on a narrow plan that includes four main components : a permanent solution for daca recipients , border security and reforms to the diversity-visa lottery program and what the president calls `` chain-migration , '' or when immigrants sponsor relatives to join them in the u. s. , the white house said in a statement . ",
        "the group also appeared to agree to take up the issue of immigration in two parts : first by handling daca recipients and securing the border , and later via a comprehensive immigration reform plan . the exact details of the deal have yet to be ironed out -- an immigration working group is expected to meet this week to continue negotiations -- but republican lawmakers walked away confident that they would be able to get something done . `` what was most productive was that the president embraced a solution , no animosity toward to dream-act kids , and understanding that the wall is not going to be 2,200 miles wide , '' said sen. lindsey graham , a republican from south carolina and a co-sponsor of the dream act . ",
        "`` there 's no reason we ca n't get there . '' republican sen. james lankford of oklahoma told reporters on capitol hill after the meeting that the narrow focus of the bill is a good step forward . `` our biggest battle for the last several months has been to get the scope to actually what will be in the negotiation and today that got defined out , '' lankford said . and for almost an hour , those negotiations played out in front of the news media , which had been invited in for a photo opportunity . ",
        "it was a rare opportunity for reporters to actually sit in on high-level negotiations as they happen , rather than try to recreate the scene from readouts and off-the-record accounts from attendees . the meeting also provided a glimpse of the diverse perspectives that exist on the issue of immigration on capitol hill . and it showed how difficult it can be to parse out exactly what president trump wants . when reporters entered the cabinet room , where trump and a group of around two dozen lawmakers had gathered for the meeting , the president was seated next to a democrat who predicted just days ago that the commander-in-chief 's hardline demands would imperil chances of getting something done . ",
        "`` president trump has said he may need a good government shutdown to get his wall , '' sen. richard durbin of illinois said in a statement on friday . `` with this demand , he seems to be heading in that direction . '' with the illinois democrat by his side , trump called on lawmakers to `` put country before party '' and pass a permanent solution to daca and a long-term spending bill in the coming weeks . `` i really do believe democrat and republican , the people sitting in this room , really want to get something done , '' trump said . ",
        "`` i hope we 're going to come up with an answer for daca . '' after the meeting , durbin said in a statement that everyone in the room agreed there is an urgent need for a daca fix . but , while republicans laid out their priorities at the tuesday meeting , durbin said democrats ' priority remains the dream act , which would give daca recipients a pathway to citizenship . at one point during the meeting , democratic sen. dianne feinstein of california asked the president if he would be willing to accept a `` clean '' version of the dream act in which congress only voted on that specific issue . ",
        "the president 's first response was , yes , but house majority leader kevin mccarthy chimed in to say any proposal would have to include border security . trump said he thought that 's what sen. feinstein meant , but democrats jumped in to clarify that was not the case . in the meeting , graham also implored the president to help congress `` close the deal '' if and when it comes down to passing a major immigration overhaul . `` you created an opportunity here , mr. president , and you need to close the deal , '' he told the president , according to a pool report . ",
        "`` if you want to take it that further step , i 'll take the heat , '' the president responded . `` you are not that far away from comprehensive immigration reform . '' getting to that next step wo n't be easy . congress has not passed a comprehensive immigration reform package in over three decades . the last time they tried , in 2013 , the bill passed the senate only to never reach the house floor for a vote . the fact that members on both sides of the debate trekked to the white house on tuesday shows there exists some political will to get something done on daca and , possibly , on broader reform . ",
        "but , a lot of loose strings remain . senate minority leader chuck schumer told reporters on tuesday that he does not believe any bill to protect daca recipients from deportation would reach the floor for a vote if it is not included in a must-pass bill . `` the bottom line is , it must go in a must-pass bill and the only must-pass bill that we see coming down the road between now and march 5th is this bill , '' schumer said , referring to the jan. . 19 spending bill that is before the congress . ",
        "`` we continue to believe , insist , that it be in this bill . '' the details of the daca solution also remain to be determined . democrats and some republicans are pushing for a bill that aligns closely with the dream act , which would offer daca recipients a pathway to u. s. citizenship . more conservative members want legislation that also curbs some family migration and takes aim at the diversity visa lottery program . and trump wants all of those things plus a wall along the southern u. s. border . veterans of immigration reform who are still tending the wounds left by past battles on the issue , warn that the bigger these negotiations get , the harder it is to get anything done . ",
        "`` i 've seen debates , discussions and negotiations where the republicans and the democrats find the sweet spot in the overlap and when they do n't , '' frank sharry of the immigration reform group america 's voice said at a roundtable discussion last week . `` balance and proportionality essential to finding the sweet spot . '' on tuesday , time spoke to republican rep. will hurd who worked with democratic congressman pete aguilar of new york on a narrow solution that beefs up border security and provides so-called dreamers a pathway to citizenship . the texas republican , whose district is along the u. s. border with mexico , said his bill could serve as a framework to build upon if other elements need to be included in order to get a final deal done . ",
        "`` this is our attempt to try to solve a big problem and get more colleagues involved , '' hurd told time on monday . `` i think everybody agrees that the only way we 're going to get this problem done is in a bipartisan way . i think most people realize that you 've got to solve this problem for almost 1 million kids that have only known the united states of america and have been contributing to our society , culture , and history . '' chair of the congressional hispanic caucus michelle lujan grisham , who crashed the white house meeting on tuesday said that she felt good about the president 's insistence that he would sign a bill that solves the daca issue . ",
        "she did , however , push back on the idea that family reunification , or `` chain migration '' and the diversity visa lottery program should be included in the final package .   "
