        "by daniel benjaminbilled as the `` game of the year , '' the pittsburgh steelers and new england patriots did not disappoint on sunday . the steelers and patriots went toe-to-toe as heavyweight fighters would , and just like in a championship boxing match , each team absorbed the other team 's jabs and responded with round houses of their own . unfortunately for the steelers , the patriots defense delivered the knockout punch just before the final buzzer as cornerback eric rowe deflected ben roethlisberger 's pass to eli rogers , into the hands of safety duron harmon , who took a knee in the end zone for a touchback with five seconds left . ",
        "the steelers , who took their first lead in the last five meetings early in the second quarter , took a 17-10 lead into halftime . pittsburgh led the entire second half except for the final 56 seconds of the game . while the game as a whole was tremendous , there was some controversy at the end . following a new england touchdown that put the patriots up 27-24 , the steelers got down to the patriots 21-yard line on a 69-yard catch-and-run by rookie juju smith-schuster . on the very next play , roethlisberger connected with tight end jesse james for what appeared to be the go-ahead touchdown . ",
        "but after a replay review , it was ruled that james did not have complete control as he reached for the ball over the end zone . roethlisberger was intercepted three plays later . the loss snaps the steelers ' eight-game winning streak and also gives the patriots the inside tact for the top seed in the afc , thus home field advantage throughout the playoffs . offense : b+t he steelers offense was highly efficient and controlled the ball and pace of the game . pittsburgh averaged 6.7 yards per play and controlled the ball for over 35 minutes . ",
        "roethlisberger had an outstanding first half , completing nine of his first 12 passes and 15-of-19 for 189 yards in the first two quarters . he spread the ball around as eight different receivers had at least one reception . he finished 22-of-30 for 281 yards along with two touchdowns and one interception . roethlisberger did make a poor decision by trying to force the ball into coverage on the steelers ' final play of the game . a more prudent thing would have been to either clock the ball or throw a fade rather than going over the middle . ",
        "le'veon bell did an excellent job running ball , particularly in the second half . he totaled 117 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries , 67 of those yards came on 12 second half attempts . it hurt that star receiver antonio brown left the game early with a leg injury . brown had two catches for 24 yards . smith-schuster caught all six of his targets for 114 yards , which is the second most in his young career . martavis bryant made an excellent diving catch on a huge third down play early in the second quarter that went for 39 yards and set up a field goal . ",
        "defense : cthe steelers looked a lot better than they did against baltimore last sunday night . they got a lot of pressure on patriots quarterback tom brady , and their defensive line was very active and disruptive . cam heyward and linebacker bud dupree each recorded a sack . vince williams came up with an interception while mike hilton did a nice job breaking up a few passes . the problem was that the steelers had no answer for tight end rob gronkowski , who caught nine passes for a season-high 168 yards . gronkowski hauled in three passes on the patriots ' game-winning drive and caused a pass interference penalty on artie burns that resulted in a field goal to cut the pats ' deficit to 24-19 . ",
        "special teams : b+c hris boswell did n't have a lot of work , however , he did connect on his fourth 50-yard field goal in the past five games with a 51-yarder early in the second quarter . boswell has made all 13 of his field goals during this five-game stretch . punter jordan berry boomed a nice 60-yarder that was returned 11 yards . berry 's other three punts were not returned . coaching : c+t he steelers ' game plan was solid , though there were some costly coaching mistakes . on the positive side , defensive coordinator keith butler made some nice adjustments , specifically switching to man-to-man coverage after the patriots marched down the field on their opening drive of the game . ",
        "the steelers had a communication issue early in the fourth quarter that forced them to use a timeout as the play clock was running down . mike tomlin wisely called a timeout with one minute left in the game in order to save time for their offense as the patriots were threatening to take the lead . new england scored the touchdown on the first play after the timeout , leaving the steelers with 56 seconds . however , the use of the two timeouts -- specifically the one to prevent the delay of game -- ultimately cost the steelers as they did not have one to stop the clock before the final two plays of the game . ",
        "the steelers used their final timeout after the big play to smith-schuster . the biggest coaching mistake was probably not trusting roethlisberger to win the game after brown was forced to leave . roethlisberger threw 19 passes prior to halftime and just 11 passes in the second half , with four of those coming on the steelers ' final possession . up nextthe steelers make their final road trip of the season next week as they will face the houston texans at nrg stadium stadium on christmas day . the texans have been in a tailspin since losing rookie quarterback deshaun watson for the season prior to week 8 , and have lost four straight and seven of eight .
