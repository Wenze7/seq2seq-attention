        "feeling stressed out ? i have been posing this question to some of the people i know and they either do n't want to tell me or they have n't thought about it . because , the majority of the answers i got was that they have no idea what they want to ship in 2018 . it is customary for me to spend a few days in december looking back at the things i have shipped this year , and look forward to what i want to get done in the next year . the end of the year is no different from any other time of the year . ",
        "but , it is a psychological check point . and i have coincided my long term planning with the arrival of this psychological check point . there are several advantages to thinking about and planning out the coming year . some of them being an increase in productivity , more informed prioritization and decision making , the motivation that comes from committing to achieving and chasing a goal . but one of the advantages that is less talked about is how this can reduce stress and anxiety . in a world where majority of the people in the world who do n't have to immediately worry about the next day 's lunch or mere survival , are suffering from ailments whose root cause can be drilled down to stress and anxiety , this is an advantage to not scoff at and discard without consideration . ",
        "anxiety is that uneasy feeling that something is going to go wrong , or the feeling that we wo n't live up to societal expectations , or something a little more nuanced . but it is just the onset of worry and panic . which means that it is primarily in our minds . our minds are funny things . they are like gases that expand to fill all the empty space available . only our minds tend to fill all of the empty space with thoughts of stress and anxiety . setting ourselves goals and working towards them is meditative . ",
        "when done right , this leaves us every day with a set of things that we need to get done and make tiny little progress on . the closer these things are to actually taking us where we want to go , the more engaged we are in doing them . and guess what happens when we are engaged ? we fill our minds . and in doing so , remove the space that it can fill with thoughts of worry and anxiety . feeling stressed out ? sure , take that vacation which will give you a break from it all for a week or two . ",
        "spend time planning and reflecting and you could be driving away stress the other fifty weeks of the year as well . happy de-stressing ! before you go ... if you liked this , support my work . all you need to do is clap .   "
