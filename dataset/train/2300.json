",
        "so as you can probably guess , the movie will also feature a talking pikachu , very likely speaking in reynolds ' voice . it 's not the first time a pokemon movie will feature talking pikachus . last month , fans were left shocked when , in a scene in `` pokemon : i choose you , '' pikachu lay next to its trainer , ash ketchum , opened its mouth and out came the words : `` i always want to be with you . '' in a high-pitched voice . reynolds ' role will be `` motion-capture in nature , '' according to an unnamed source quoted by thr . ",
        "this means pikachu will be digitally added to the film . reynolds follows in the motion-captured footsteps of andy serkis , who pioneered motion-capture technology in his role as gollum in the lord of the rings films , king kong , and caesar in the planet of the apes franchise . now playing : watch this : why pokemon go is so popular 2:28 technically incorrect : bringing you a fresh and irreverent take on tech . special reports : cnet 's in-depth features in one place .
