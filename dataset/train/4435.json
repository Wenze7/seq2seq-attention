        "11 gifts for 7 types of science enthusiast treats for physicists , chemists , biologists , and others . if you 're visiting this website , you probably like science , or at least have friends that do . and within the category of general fans , you 'll always find specialists : those who love learning about , or actually work in , a field like physics or paleontology . so when you start shopping for science gifts , get specific . we 've collected the best picks for everyone from mathematicians to medical doctors . for mathematicianson the venn diagram of scientists and punsters , you 'll find significant overlap . ",
        "and that 's never more evident than on pi day , when geeks celebrate everyone 's favorite irrational constant . this nifty oven-safe and microwave-safe ceramic pi dish will give your math-loving friend an excuse to celebrate pi day whenever she fires up the oven . . the soma cube may look like a 3d version of tetris , but it 's actually a puzzle that mathematicians have enjoyed analyzing for the better part of a century . the goal : combine the seven pieces , each a different combination of cubes , into a single larger cube . advanced players can try to unpack all 240 different ways of forming said cube , or start building more complex shapes . ",
        ". for physiciststhis desk toy demonstrates a classic physics principle : conservation of momentum . like the soma cube , you can play with newton 's cradle on multiple levels . beyond the simple satisfaction of setting the spheres off into a swinging pattern , you can measure their motion ; compare the effect of starting with one moving orb versus two , three , or four ; and try out more advanced tricks . serious physics nuts can even build mathematical models of their cradles . . for astronomerstelescopes let you get up close and personal with celestial objects . ",
        "smartphone cameras let you snap and share amazing everyday sights . to combine the two , your starry-eyed friend needs a specialized mount like this one , which lets her attach her phone directly to her scope . with it , she can photograph the moon and even certain planets without investing in professional equipment . as a bonus , this type of smartphone mount also works with microscopes . give it to a biologist who wants to turn tardigrades , amoebae , and other wee organisms into instagram stars . . there 's nothing quite like gazing up at a night sky full of stars . ",
        "but if you live in a light-polluted area , or the weather drives you indoors , there 's an alternative : a home planetarium can bring those stars directly into your home . while amateurs might settle for generic pinpricks of light , more serious astronomers will want a projector -- like this one -- that throws accurate constellations onto the walls . . for chemistsyou never know when you 'll have to check the atomic number of rubidium . well , this might not be an issue for you , but to a chemist , consulting a periodic table is an everyday concern . ",
        "give your element-obsessed pal this sturdy metal wallet card , and they 'll never need to google the periodic table again . plus , your buddy gets the joy of calling himself a card-carrying chemist . . if you want to spend a little more money on the chemist in your life , consider a spice rack that puts the `` lab '' in ... um ... lablabi . these containers , shaped like test tubes and erlenmeyer flasks , will let your geeky friend play mad scientist every time he cooks . . for biologistswhile lots of biologists sequence dna as part of their research , not all of them have the chance to analyze their own genes . ",
        "help your friend unravel her personal biology with this dna kit . she wo n't have to do her own pcr -- or any other type of genetic processing -- because the 23andme team take care of all the analysis . these tests will reveal users ' ancestry and even whether they have distant , as-yet-unknown relatives . just do n't rely on it to figure out your risk of disease . . for paleontologistswhen most people think about dinosaurs , they picture the scaly reptiles of jurassic park fame . but dedicated paleontologists know that these extinct creatures actually had feathers -- and in some cases , scientists have even figured out the color of their plumage . ",
        "so if you have a friend who likes to argue about the existence of the brontosaurus , give him a scientifically accurate figurine that he can display with pride . just one caveat : beasts of the mesozoic started out as a kickstarter , and as often happens with crowdfunded projects , its development took a little longer than expected . at the moment , preorders are not guaranteed to reach recipients in time for the holidays -- but for some nerds , this gift would be worth the wait . . for medical doctorswhether medicine is an art or a science , its practitioners deserve as many gifts as the next nerd . ",
        "although these coasters -- each of which illustrates a different slice of a human brain -- would make a perfect gift for a neurosurgeon , any doctor worth her salt can display them with pride . . dealing with bodies every day can encourage a -- shall we say -- unique sense of humor . let your favorite doctor joke around with an insulated lunch bag that advertises the presence of human organs within . hey , at the very least his coworkers might think twice before stealing his sandwich . .
