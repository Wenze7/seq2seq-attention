        "manchester united manager jose mourinho has claimed that manchester city have an unfair advantage over his side due to an extra day 's rest during the festive period . united have been held to two draws in the space of three days either side of christmas , conceding a late goal in their 2-2 draw with leicester city last weekend before needing a stoppage-time strike of their own to share the spoils with burnley on boxing day . premier league leaders man city have an extra day of rest before taking on newcastle united on wednesday , and mourinho believes that the fixture list favours pep guardiola 's side . ",
        "`` i 'm not just talking about the privileged runs with six days to recover and enjoy and to prepare but ones with a little bit more than us , '' mourinho told sky sports news . `` for example the ones with a little bit more rest , like one day . the extra day means a lot because it means they are n't working , means they can be back to work and be ready for the next day . `` the problem i see here is the difference between some teams . `` united , who face southampton in their final game of 2017 on saturday , could fall 15 points behind city at the top of the premier league table should guardiola 's side rack up an 18th successive win tomorrow .
