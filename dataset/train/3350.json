        "i have an old iphone , a hand-me-down from my mother . it 's an iphone 5s , i think . i am not savvy in that lingo at all . in fact , i am that inane person at starbucks that says , small cafe latte please . anyways , i am grateful for this phone . it seriously has held my life together on several occasions when i had to connect to an airport wi-fi and get some quick work done , or send some emails when the hotel internet was down . it has been a life saver in so many ways , more than i can remember or count , and i am grateful for it . ",
        "my phone is cool , i promisein fact , here in chiang mai , thailand , i do n't even think twice about how cool my phone is . sometimes , i will be putting in my facebook details into someone else 's phone because they want to be my friend , and that 's when i will notice the massive screen that their phone holds . `` yikes , this screen is as big as my face ! '' i intone , rather uncoolly , i must add . but , even in those moments , i never , ever have a moment of doubt towards my phone . ",
        "not even for a single moment . sometimes , some people will crack a joke about my kermit the frog phone cover . `` what are you , two ? get a cooler phone and cover , for god 's sake . '' at those moments , i only wonder about why invoking the name of god is necessary for this minor infraction . and , if they know how cool kermit the frog really is okay , so i love my phone , and it 's usefulness . it works fine for me and my purpose . toronto leaves me wantingbut , when i go to toronto to visit , even if only for two weeks or so , instantaneously , i feel the errors of my ways . ",
        "`` how dare i choose a phone like this ? everyone 's laughing at me . why am i so stupid ? i need to go to buy a new phone , asap . i want to be at the same level as everyone else here . '' all of these random thoughts start filtering through to me , through other people 's comments , and through my own thinking . as i spend more and more time in toronto , i notice the shabbiness of the jacket i wear , or the phone that i carry . i feel the inadequacy of my haircut , and my walk . ",
        "how can i even be alive when i am so not up to par ? !! ! in those moments , i really have to step back , take a deep breath , and reassess the situation . `` it 's alright , shikha . it 's just subliminal messages from the media and advertising . it 's nothing real . you can calm down now ! '' the messages in canada are much strongerokay , i do n't know about you , but i realize as i spend more time away from the first world countries of the world , that there is definitely an undertone , a subtle message that exists as background noise in these countries . ",
        "i never ever feel inadequate or wanting when i am here in thailand , but as soon as i land in toronto , and watch all of those stylish people in the airport walking around with designer purses , and designer shoes , and designer bums , that i feel so wholly inadequate . shame fills me up and tells me , i should n't live anymore , especially if i do n't , this very minute , go to buy a better coat , better jeans , better shoes , better handbag , and a better phone . and for god 's sake , do something with that face and hair of yours . ",
        "while you are at it , get some butt implants , dental work done , and some face lifts . ah , much better . thankfully , i do not spend much time in the first world countries anymore . thank god for that . i 'm not saying that the thread of consumerism and the beat of inadequacy is n't ever present in thailand as well . but for some reason , the thread and beat are at a lower frequency here , just turned down a bit . so that if you do n't really pay attention , it does n't bother you . ",
        "but in toronto , oh man , that thread and beat are turned up so high that i can not hear my own thoughts sometimes . i am deafened by it . i can hear only it , and nothing else . i do not hear my own thoughts telling me i am good enough . i hear only the beat of the media and advertising telling me , i will never be good enough , unless , i buy , buy , buy , and buy some more . please let me goas soon as i come back home to thailand , i breathe a sigh of relief . ",
        "my scattered thoughts release themselves . they come back to stability . i feel calmer here . the ratty clothes that i wear are not commented upon at all . my face is fine as it is without any enhancements . my bum is used for sitting and no one says a word about its thickness . i also do n't watch tv here , whereas in toronto , the tv blasts the households of every single family from the time they wake up , to the time they go to sleep . it is like the military constantly telling you , get up now , go for a run , and so on . ",
        "but instead of these commands , the media is telling you , go buy this , and then go buy that , and that one is on sale as well . in addition , there is only one real mall here , and there are hundreds of tiny stores , and markets . but it is really very easy to avoid them , because i do n't really need anything here . all of my cooking is done by food vendors and i can just walk over to them , in minutes . no need to spend my time barging through costco every 2 -- 3 days , to see what i can purchase , what i can fill my homes with , what i can use to satiate that monster inside of me . ",
        "i thank the universe for letting me live here , unencumbered with thoughts of consumerism , and inadequacy . i am fine here as i am . i feel good enough . worthy . unlike toronto . if you liked this piece , let me know by hitting clap a few times . if not , let me know how i can improve my writing . thanks for visiting !
