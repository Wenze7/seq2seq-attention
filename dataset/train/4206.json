        "feedback on the future of christchurch 's red zone shows clear support for turning much of the area back to nature , but mixed support for re-establishing houses on the earthquake-damaged land . rebuild authority regenerate christchurch on tuesday released the 1866 submissions it received on 10 concepts for using the 602 hectares of red zoned land running along the avon river in east christchurch . the public were given four weeks to have their say on the ideas , ending november 6 . all options included a green river corridor spanning the central city to the coastal suburbs , and about half included options for residential development in the area . ",
        "six themes were identified from the mountain of feedback -- ecological restoration , residential development , recreation , visitor attractions , productive land uses , and comment on the work to develop the area to date . read more : * nz-style garden of eden and whitewater rapids : dreaming big in christchurch 's red zone returning the red zone to natural environments got the most support , with 906 responses in favour of prioritising ecological restoration . regenerate christchurch chief executive ivan iafeta said there had been a lot of support for the idea of a `` green spine '' or area either side of the river that could be used for ecological projects . ",
        "he said feedback `` often supported recreation , visitor attractions and productive uses , as long as they had an ecological focus '' . horseshoe lake and bexley were specifically mentioned as having high ecological importance . a lake for rowing and other watersports was the most common recreation request , with 688 people favouring an out-of-river lake and 442 supporting an in-river option that incorporated the avon river . iafeta said those supporting ecological restoration were opposed to the out-of-river lake in particular though , because of possible effects on horseshoe lake , which `` does create a bit of a conflict in terms of people 's preferences for how that area might be used '' . ",
        "cycling and walking trails and whitewater facilities also received support . residential development in the red zone proved divisive , with 343 against it and 342 in favour . many of those supporting residential development wanted innovative and sustainable housing that was adaptive to climate change and limited in size and number . iafeta said it was `` always going to be a land use option that would spark a lot of discussion and debate '' and was an important matter for those who formerly or still lived there . the case for residential development throughout the residential red zone `` is n't a strong one '' , but regenerate christchurch wanted to test whether or not people would support it , he said . ",
        "plans to use land in rawhiti domain and avondale golf course for residential housing in exchange for a new golf course in the red zone proved unpopular , with 416 submissions opposing the idea of the 463 that mentioned it . iafeta said the driver behind the land swap idea was to bring people back to depopulated areas , to support local community groups and the local economy . the feedback on the idea `` came through pretty loud and clear '' and would be considered when developing further options . up to three concepts would now be shortlisted and released to the public in a major summer exhibition . ",
        "they could include ideas from more than one concept plan and would feature more design details and costs , and an outline of the timeline , benefits and tradeoffs for each combination . from there , a draft regeneration plan would be developed by july or august , which would include a preferred plan for the area and an opportunity for public feedback . `` we are approaching decisions that will shape the future of our city for hundreds of years and influence how people experience life in christchurch for generations to come . '' while a lot of ideas had been generated , there were not a lot of advocates for particular uses who had lined up funding strategies or had deep pockets to pay for it , iafeta said . ",
        "`` rather than asking people do you like this idea or that idea , it becomes more of a conversation about how much people are willing to pay for the potential ways this area could be used . '' it was something the crown and the christchurch city council would have to consider , but there was the potential for private contribution and development . , he said . by the numbers : - 1866 submissions received - 906 supporting ecological restoration - 343 against residential development , 342 supporting - 617 supporting recreational uses - 565 in favour of visitor attractions , 22 against - 384 supporting productive land uses , 58 against .
