        "the green bay packers went through a lot of running backs in 2017 . ty montgomery began the season as the starter . he played with broken ribs before going on ir with a wrist injury . rookie rusher aaron jones took over the backfield next . his season was cut short by knee problems . the next man up was fourth-round pick , jamaal williams . williams finished the season as the packers workhorse . he led the team in rushing with 153 carries for 556 yards and four touchdowns . the 134th overall pick also added 25 catches for 262 yards and two scores in the passing game . ",
        "williams was the only packers ' rusher available all 16 games this season . looking ahead to 2018 . the packers are going to have a lot of options at running back next season when jones and montgomery are healthy . williams finished the year with the starting job , but he has stiff competition to keep it . jones looks to be the frontrunner to run the backfield in 2018 . jones averaged almost six yards per carry last season . the backup role is completely up for grabs . williams and montgomery had near even rushing yard averages . ",
        "they are also both pretty effective in the passing game . williams will have to work hard to win the backup role this offseason or he could drop back to third on the depth chart in 2018 . fantasy slant . williams turned out to be a solid fantasy back by the end of 2017 . he was not a game-changing back though . next season a lot of things have to shake out in the packers running game . owners will not invest too much into williams in a loaded packers backfield . he is worth a look around the 12th round as a player to stash for later in the season .
