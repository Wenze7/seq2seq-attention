        "part ii : bulgariayesterday , december 20 , i drove through the -- still very hot -- mojave desert in a t-shirt and shorts . i made it to st. george , utah with its beautiful red rocks and equally appealing climate at 6 pm . i stopped by my friends ' kat and monty 's house to wish them a merry christmas just as a storm was blowing in . when we checked the weather , we noticed that a `` winter weather advisory '' had been issued , and decided it would be best to stay with them overnight . ",
        "i woke up this morning to the red rocks dusted white , a surreal scene , and the cacti spikes had to poke through a layer of snow . driving though this sight where desert meets winter helped me develop my thoughts about winter in bulgaria : i laced up my snow boots over two pairs of thick socks , and prayed that would be enough for a january day in sofia , bulgaria . it never was . i lived in a large maze of a house with four generations of one bulgarian family . my bulgarian family . ",
        "by january only three generations lived there with me , since cveta , the owner of the house , had moved to germany . this left me with a grandmother who constantly tested my limited bulgarian , since that was the only language in which we could communicate . i would find out that same month that cveta 's son and daughter-in-law , dimo and sunny , were expecting their second child in the autumn . i would have to plan a way to come out to meet him then . their oldest son was maybe my favorite person in all of bulgaria . ",
        "he was one and some months , the same age as my niece , brinn , back in utah . he wished me лека нощ every evening , and no matter what kind of day i had had , that was the highlight , and two small dogs at any moment while at home scoured my feet . those two bit at my shoelaces now as i tried to make my way out the door , `` i would rather play with you guys , '' i say to them as i breathed in deeply before opening the door to the bone-chilling cold . ",
        "later in the year , when talking about this winter with my friends in bulgaria , they would comment that it was not so bad , despite the fact it was the most snow sofia had seen in 126 years . i probably found it horrific due to the fact that i found public transportation even less reliable during the winter than it was during the rest of the year , which i was n't sure was possible . this day was a sunday , sunday , january 1 , 2017 , and i was headed to church to start the new year . ",
        "it was my first sunday in a couple weeks , since i had decided to spend christmas by myself in zagreb , croatia for `` europe 's best christmas market '' . i opened the door to a cloudy and crisp morning . the streets of my neighborhood were sloshy and wet , but clear of major snow fall , and the sun desperately wanted to show herself . this new year 's day i rode the bus downtown , the remnants of the night before scattered along sidewalks and streets from one end of town to the other . ",
        "no other soul , but mine and the bus driver 's , seemed to be waking with the new year . streamers stretched from lightposts to the street and the loud noisemakers that kept the whole city awake for hours lay abandoned along my way . this scene describes my year . it started out with such force and exhilaration . a bipolar year , with very high highs and painfully low lows . i walk through this scene now , entering the last month of a tumultuous year seeing both the excitement and the garbage scattered out before me , and hope for that same calm and serenity walking alone in a major european city provides . ",
        "and even in california , it 's cold again now , and it 's a good time to wrap yourself in self-reflection and a good story . my friends were not at church that day . i could n't help but think of my first sunday in sofia , when strangers i did not know came to pick me up at my house to take me to church . sunny stimmler and her two daughters showed up at my front gate after i had messaged her several times about who i was , why i was going to be in bulgaria , and lowkey if we could be friends . ",
        "my friend lindsey feala -- living in omaha , nebraska -- arranged for her employers to send her and her coworker on a trip to salt lake city wherein she could see me before i left . this awesome friend of mine made sure she could see me before i left the states for a year , but to do so required dinners with her coworker as well . as it turned out , her coworker 's brother was a mormon living in sofia , who happened to work for the embassy . he told me that his brother was generally unresponsive via any sort of phone messaging , but that his wife would probably help me get to church . ",
        "i met his brother , bryan stimmler , at the first fulbright function i attended , because he happened to be the liaison between fulbright at the embassy . i met his wife for the first time outside the gate of my house when she had come to get me for church . i ended my time in bulgaria with short and cold days , warmed only by an itching to start the next phase of my year abroad . i walked or took buses many places in the city , because i lived on the outskirts of town . ",
        "i spent considerable time on public transportation listening to books on tape , and trying to eavesdrop on introductory bulgarian conversations , with little success . at some point during my last month in the city , i walked through the botanical gardens that sat just below the stimmler 's house , and along the foothills of mount vitosha . it was a gloomy day , but i turned around nearly done with the short hike to see the city stretched out before me in every direction with snow falling lightly on top . this was the same day i was able to walk into the gardens , but was locked in on the other end . ",
        "i hopped the fence and then immediately learned the fence did not extend more than 20 yards to either side . bulgaria is this way : fraught with frivolous and frustrating obstacles only there to stand in your way , and not to actually keep you from doing the task . january and february came and i realized how little time i had left in bulgaria , and i knew i needed to make some more effort to see what this country and it 's surroundings had to offer , even in the cold . the three other fulbright researchers and i decided that january and february would be full of excitement and exploration . ",
        "lizzy and her visiting boyfriend invited me to join them on several trips around the country to see the places i most wanted to see : philippopolis , kazanlak and the thracian tombs , and the surva festival just a short distance outside of sofia . as i went on several freezing trips around the country , valentina and i decided to take one warm trip to get a view of the mediterranean from thessaloniki , greece . this last trip ending just three days before i had to move from bulgaria to romania . those months , laura and i joined a boxing gym , which we trudged through the snow to get to in the mornings , and work on our projects in the afternoon . ",
        "i needed that time boxing to build my strength for something else , a more intense adventure that would require all the endurance i could acquire over the following months . i developed a crazy idea that new year 's day walking around sofia . i thought , `` would n't it be fun to walk like this all along the black sea ? '' i realized that seemed a little too crazy . but . what if i biked ? i emailed my friend jp that same week with a scheduled plan for biking from sozopol , bulgaria on the black sea to constanta , romania . ",
        "this hairbrained new year 's pebble of an idea grew quickly into a boulder , as jp responded with an immediate , `` yes , '' on january 6 . the plan was set in motion for a late spring adventure . originally , i had proposed i live in three different cities in my five months in bulgaria , moving after my first month , then twice more after living two months in a place . this plan fell through my first week in sofia . i ca n't imagine how much more chaotic my life would have been had i stuck to this plan . ",
        "living the five months in sofia was not long enough at all . i learned a great deal , and made valuable friendships , but also , moving around this often takes its toll on a body and psyche . since , however , this had been my original plan , i made sure i packed all my belongings into small enough bags that i could haul on trains easily . i had one large rolling suitcase , a duffle bag which fit on top , and a backpack . i have lived a year out of these bags . ",
        "i thought i was clever in my packing , but you can easily tire of even this much baggage in your life , especially when dragging it through a european rain storm . but at the end of february , i was set to leave bulgaria . a surge of exhilaration flowed through me at the thought of leaving bulgaria for romania . i had made many friends in bulgaria , but life was not so easy there . i lived far from most people , i never did get used to the cyrillic alphabet surrounding me , and i was ready for a change , mostly of seasons , but if i could n't have that , a change of scenery would do . ",
        "but what you forget is that you ca n't have those moments back . once you leave , you ca n't step back into that same life . you leave , and everything changes . despite the fact that there were struggles , i enjoyed bulgaria ; i had made a life there . i found a place inside that maze of a home , i carved out my own spot in the snow-covered city , i had made friends -- lifelong friends , whom i adored . but three days after i arrived back from greece , my bags were packed , and i was headed on to the next stop . ",
        "i was going to go to romania , where i had no place to live , other than a hotel in bucharest for the next three nights , and a hotel in constanta for another two nights , and then , hopefully , i would have another temporary home for the following months . until then , i was homeless in eastern europe , and leaving a life i knew again .
