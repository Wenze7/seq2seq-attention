",
        "and while it looks as though de bruyne has avoided a potentially lengthy spell on the sidelines , guardiola believes more should be done to protect players from unnecessary physicality . @debruynekev pic . twitter . com/qlo94tb6cf -- manchester city december 31 , 2017 `` we were lucky in the recent games , and today we will see , '' guardiola told reporters . `` it 's the same , i admire the physicality , but referees need to protect players . that 's all i ask . hopefully it will not be bad . `` not just the best players , all the best players . ",
        "why would you protect just the players we like the most ? `` people are talking about diving and about how they need to focus on the diving , that 's okay . but not just man city players , all the players of the league . `` i know the contact is maybe more allowed here than any other country , that 's okay , but there are limits . `` we were lucky against tottenham with raz and kevin , newcastle with gundogan . and we will see . `` maybe it 's just a huge kick , but maybe he will not be ready for the watford game in two days .
