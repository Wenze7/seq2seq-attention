        "kawhi leonard jumps in front of the pass and takes it all the way to the hole for the jam . the san antonio spurs and phoenix suns will look to get back on the winning track after losses on the road when they square off on friday at the at&t center in san antonio , texas . the spurs head into friday 's matchup on the heels of a 112-106 loss at philadelphia on wednesday that dropped san antonio to 9-11 on the road . the spurs , on a back-to-back after a win in new york on tuesday , played without five players , including forward kawhi leonard , guards tony parker , danny green , and key reserve manu ginobili , all of whom were held out for rest or rehab from injuries . ",
        "even playing short-handed , san antonio made a game of it , erasing a 16-point philadelphia lead and moving on top via a 3-pointer from patty mills , who led the team with a season-high 26 points , with less than three minutes to play . but the sixers made the plays they needed down the stretch and beat san antonio for first time in 13 meetings . philadelphia center joel embid was ranked as questionable until he was announced with the starting lineup . san antonio coach gregg popovich said he talked with sixers coach brett brown for `` about 95 minutes before the game and he never mentioned that embid would play . ",
        "`` you are who you are -- you do n't change your offense or defense for one player , '' popovich said . `` you just go out and play . i was glad embid played -- i want to see him just like everyone else . `` we ca n't turn the ball over like we did and expect to win on the road . overall too many fouls and too many turnovers . `` the suns head to the alamo city after losing 134-111 at denver on wednesday in what amounted to a back-to-back-games with a travel nightmare in between . ",
        "six players scored in double figures as devin booker scored a team-high 17 points . greg monroe had 16 points and 10 rebounds . marquese chriss added 16 points , josh jackson scored 14 and tj warren had 13 for phoenix . the suns scored 41 points in the second quarter and led 67-61 at halftime before going cold with 44 points in the second half . `` we did n't execute as well , '' chriss said . `` lacking energy and being at this altitude you need to lock in a little bit more and we did n't play the way we wanted to play . ",
        "`` after beating atlanta in phoenix on tuesday , the suns waited until 2 a. m. to board their charter jet to denver . eventually the team was sent home while mechanical repairs were made to their plane and did n't arrive in denver until wednesday afternoon , hours before game time . `` we try not to make no excuses , '' said phoenix guard isaiah canaan , who had 11 points off the bench . `` obviously , it was a tough travel day . it 's part of the game and it 's our job . we 've got to come out and play no matter what the circumstance is . ",
        "`` booker is averaging 27.0 points in road games this season , fourth in the nba behind only james harden , giannis antetokounmpo and stephen curry . the suns are 6-4 over their last 10 games , making 10.1 three-pointers per game and shooting 36.3 percent from distance during that span . the spurs are 2-0 against the suns this season , winning 112-95 in san antonio on nov. . 5 and 104-101 in phoenix on dec. . 9 , with aldridge leading the way in scoring with 21 and 20 points , respectively .
