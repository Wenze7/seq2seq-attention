        "tens of thousands gathered in cities across iran on wednesday in a massive show of support for the government after days of deadly unrest , state television showed . crowds chanted `` leader , we are ready '' as images showed vast numbers marching through the cities of ahvaz , kermanshah , gorgan and elsewhere . the crowds waved iranian flags and pictures of supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , as well as placards reading `` death to seditionists '' . `` we offer the blood in our veins to our leader , '' was another popular chant . the rallies followed several days of unrest -- initially sparked by protests over economic problems but quickly turning against the regime as a whole -- in which 21 people lost their lives and hundreds were arrested . ",
        "the unrest has remained focused on provincial towns and cities , with only sporadic protests reported in the capital , tehran . the demonstrations are the largest seen in iran since its disputed 2009 presidential election . breaking his silence on the unrest , khamenei blamed foreign `` enemies '' for the demonstrations in a speech on tuesday . shortly after , the us ambassador to the united nations , nikki haley , urged the international community to speak out on the unfolding protests in iran , saying the us would seek emergency un talks on the situation .
