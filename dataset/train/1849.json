        "there were rumors that mclaren would return to indy again in 2018 in partnership with andretti autosport , just like it did with fernando alonso in 2017 . however , the announcement that carlos munoz would be back with the team for the 2018 500 without assistance from mclaren really put the possibility of a return in doubt . now , it 's official that mclaren wo n't be back . mclaren executive director zak brown has confirmed that the 2018 500 is `` off the table . '' but brown has n't ruled out a full time indycar team or an indy one-off that occurs every year for a decade . ",
        "but 2018 wo n't be the start of either . a new rdx ! acura . you might not find this all that exciting , but acura will debut a prototype for the new rdx at next month 's detroit auto show . this is the biggest redesign for the rdx in a decade , and it 's an important one . like it or not small suvs are the money makers , so if we want an nsx type r , we need the rdx to succeed . honda proudif you paid any attention to the 2017 f1 season , you 'd know that mclaren honda had the opposite of a good season , with myriad power unit failures . ",
        "despite that , honda believes it can be proud of its progress . the main thing here is that it 's the rate of development it 's proud of , not the actual on track performance , as it was lackluster . but the team prioritized performance over reliability , which honda believes it can fix in 2018 . let 's see if it can . ford/mazda pickup recallthe takata recall has struck 380,000 ford rangers and mazda b2000s built between 2004 and 2006 . if you have one of these trucks , please take it in to be fixed .
