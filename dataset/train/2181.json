        "lg 's foldable displays are coming , but when ? recent patents might indicate that bold take on the dual-screened smartphone is well underway . there 's more proof today that lg is poised to launch foldable phone , just a few months after company execs told us at last year 's mwc that they could release a foldable phone in the next two years . time certainly moves fast in tech . we 're now seeing patents that hint at the beginnings of lg 's flexible future , and there are two different flexible phone designs to pour over thanks to diagrams published on january 12 with the world intellectual property organization . ",
        "lg 's patent shows off a fold-out phone with one seamless display that spans across the two sections . it 's unlike the foldable zte axon m , which utilizes two independent screens that join together with a slight gap . everything we 're seeing so far makes lg 's on-paper concept quite the looker in terms of its minimal bezels and a consistent tablet-like display . you still have to wonder if the inevitable crease in the display will be distracting . based on the patents , it 's tough to tell exactly how the models differ , if at all , on their insides . ",
        "but as gsminfo points out , their outer shells take two different paths . something to look forward to in 2018 ? one version of what could be lg 's rumored flexible phone shows the camera facing the rear , with a similar circular design on the front that might act as a front facing camera or a small screen that can show off notifications . additionally , this patent shows the time on the front , though it 's hard to tell if it will be a full-functioning display or just a small spot designated for telling the time . ",
        "credit : lgthe other version is far more interesting , looking to possibly feature a casing that rolls back to show off a vertical take on the second display introduced in the lg v10 . here , we might expect to have access to music controls and other light-touch interactions , like weather and checking out text messages . it 's possible that we 'll see this foldable phone from lg popping up this year , but how early ? mwc 2018 is coming soon , and frankly , that seems a little too soon to expect such a true , ambitious-looking take on the flexible phone . ",
        "we 're more likely to see the lg g7 , or whatever the company has next in its flagship , before it lands . via the verge .   "
