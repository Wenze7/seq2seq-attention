        "10 gifs that epitomise student summer it 's still summer and for uni students that 's a whole lot of time off . of course it will fly by , and you 'll have next to no money , but we thought we 'd toast to the beauty of a full 3 months off in the form of gifs that epitomise student summer ... every time one of your housemates moves out it 's like a part of you dies , you just ca n't imagine getting through three whole months without them . who will you have drunken heart to hearts with ? ",
        "who will you ` borrow ' milk from ? who will you compare your results from a buzzfeed quiz on which piece of garden furniture you are with ? 2 -rrb- seeing your school friends again : you spent the last term communicating almost solely through tagging each other in memes , so there is a lot to catch up on . but seeing old friends can be weird . there 's always one who 's completely changed since going to uni and another who seems to have picked up the regional accent . despite all this , these people know you better than anyone . ",
        "no matter what 's gone on since you left 6th form , it feels like nothing 's changed once you 're all back together . 3 -rrb- moving back in with your parents : to begin with , things seem great : you get to eat something other than pasta and ketchup ; there 's no mould in the shower ; there 's no one blasting out grime when you 're trying to sleep . but your parents just do n't seem to understand you 're now an adult . they get annoyed when you sleep in past 10 am and they insist that breakfast pizza is n't a thing . ",
        "it does n't take long until you remember why you left in the first place . 4 -rrb- being broke : you thought you 'd have loads of money over summer , after all , you do n't have to pay rent or bills , and your parents buy your food . but you miscalculated : your last loan instalment was months ago and you splashed the remainder on results day vks , so now you have to spend summer on a budget and a very tight budget at that . 5 -rrb- part time work : penniless and destitute , you 're forced to go back to your old weekend job so that you can afford all the summer plans you 've arranged . ",
        "the customers may be terrible and your boss may be an idiot , but when you 're lying in bed debating whether you really need a degree , the memory of this summer will force you to get up and go to your 9 am . 6 -rrb- internships : or better yet , you 've somehow managed to land yourself an internship in some fancy office in the city . you 've got a smart suit and some swanky stationary , but you 're way out of your depth and have absolutely no idea what you 're doing . ",
        "7 -rrb- festivals : a student summer staple . it will inevitably rain all weekend , yet your tent will be hotter than the sahara desert . come monday , you 'll get home covered in mud and glitter , with a cumulative five hours of sleep for the last three days , unsure of what your own name is . but you 'll still buy tickets for next year , because nothing 's better than being drunk in a field with your mates . 8 -rrb- day drinking : most of the year , day drinking is frowned upon . ",
        "but somehow summer makes drinking in a park at midday not just acceptable , but practically encouraged . maybe it 's because of the amount of fruit in pimm 's and kopparberg -- they 're practically one of your five a day . 9 -rrb- endless holiday instagrams : if you do manage to go on holiday , it is absolutely paramount that you post about it on instagram on a daily basis . this summer , with the glorious addition of stories and multiple picture posts , you can make your followers even more jealous/annoyed . think : regular updates on your tan and panoramas of the same zante beach five times a day . ",
        "if you 're really cool you 'll move away from the typical beach selfies and post a photo of a polaroid of the amsterdam letters . remember , if you do n't share it online , you may as well not have gone . 10 -rrb- getting a bit carried away with buying new stationary : as autumn term approaches the magnetic properties of paperchase intensify . safe in the knowledge that the long-awaited student loan will imminently pull you out of your overdraft , you spend money that you do n't have yet on stuff that you will never need .
