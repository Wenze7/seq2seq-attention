        "one of the pleasures of going out for a daily hike is letting your mind wander while enjoying the scenery all around you . but have you ever considered that hiking might also be a great way to practice mindfulness ? in short , going out for a solo hike can be a great way to recalibrate your inner personal life , take your mind off concerns like relationships and finances , and truly live `` in the moment . '' the first step in practicing mindfulness is making it a conscious decision before you even embark on your hike . ",
        "once you 've reached your hiking area , it 's important to establish beforehand that you are going to dedicate 15 to 20 minutes of the hike to embracing mindfulness . in order to do this , you need to make a few changes to your normal hiking routine . for example , if you usually take along a pair of headphones and music with you as part of your trail running routine , you might want to stash those in your backpack for later . as part of this conscious decision to embrace mindfulness , the first thing that you will want to do is focus on your breathing . ",
        "take deep breaths , slowly in and out . with each new breath , let go of whatever you 've been thinking about recently . it 's time to focus only on you at this point . the real secret here is that you have to focus on the physical act of breathing -- think about what is actually happening to your body with each inhalation or exhalation . train yourself to slow down and reach a deep , reflective and almost meditative state . once you 've become in tune with your breathing and have reached a state of calmness , it 's time to focus on your other senses . ",
        "what are you seeing ? what are you hearing ? close your eyes and see if you can visualize what is happening around you . you 'll be pleasantly surprised at how heightened all of your senses are . and , in so doing , you will feel more alive . best of all , you will feel more in tune with nature . while modernity has brought so many conveniences , it has also distanced us from the natural world around us . so hiking is a great way to reaffirm the ageless link with nature . you may even find yourself rediscovering some of the lost joys of childhood . ",
        "take time to study the flora and fauna around you . even the act of studying a leaf -- the texture , the shape and the sound that it makes when being crinkled underfoot by your winter traction hiking spikes -- can help to heighten your senses and bring you closer to nature . that 's especially true in winter , when it 's much easier to embrace the solitude of nature . everything seems to slow down . if you are traversing snowy trails with your micro spikes and navigating icy patches with your ice grippers , then it 's the perfect time to contemplate the enormous changes that nature undergoes throughout the year -- and especially during the winter time . ",
        "finally , as you near the end of the 15 - to 20-minute period that you have set aside for mindfulness on this hike , focus again on your breathing . with each new inhalation , focus on breathing in the positive energy around you . with each new exhalation , focus on breathing out the negative energy from your own life . practicing mindfulness is not always easy , but once you 've felt what it likes to reach a deeply meditative state perfectly at peace with the world around you , it can actually become a learned trait that you can use even when you are not out hiking .
