        "i 'll bet you have been on one side or another of the following conversation : person 1 : what is x ? person 2 : here 's a link that describes x. * titter titter snort * person 1 : let me google that for you ? ah , very clever , thank you ... jerk . let me google that for you , a snarky site that demonstrates how to execute a google query , was born out of frustration . we were a small group of engineers each of whom had to deal with `` help vampires '' -- those too lazy or not google-savvy enough to search on their own . ",
        "we were tired of being asked easily google-able questions like `` how do i create a signature in gmail ? '' or `` what 's postgresql ? '' . we felt our knowledge and time were being abused . we vented about it at lunch one day , imagined how cool it would be to throw this site back at our colleague , then ryan mcgeary and jim garvin went back to the office and created it . an internet sensation sprung to life . the success it achieved underscores how many people felt the exact same way we did . ",
        "now you see it everywhere , and if you have been on the receiving end of a lmgtfy link , you may -- like i do -- fear getting one again whenever you ask a question . years later i now have mixed feelings about it . being engineers we 're not necessarily great with people so without having to say it out loud the site tells a person `` look , i 'm pretty busy . could you maybe google it yourself next time ? '' . for us the passive-aggressive tone was just a bonus . on the other side it has it has helped show people how easy it is to google for an answer . ",
        "but some times the question `` what is x ? '' is n't always necessarily about what x is . my brothers and i were discussing bit torrent over email . my oldest brother , paul , asked me `` what 's a magnet link ? '' my first instinct was to send him a lmgtfy link . that probably would 've put an end to the discussion . it 's tough to respond to snark like that even when it 's good natured . i replied to paul 's question with a helpful link and my thoughts on , and experiences with , magnet links . ",
        "now , paul did n't reply and the thread did die with me but i like to think i made the right choice . in another email thread about a funny video i had wanted to ask `` what is g-loc ? '' but i was afraid of getting a lmgtfy link . i looked it up myself and went on with my day . i realized later i was n't necessarily looking for the wikipedia definition . instead i wanted to convey that i liked the video and wanted to discuss it further . this is what the fear of getting a lmgtfy reply can take away from us -- an oft used way of saying `` i 'm listening , please do go on . '' ",
        "in person you would n't get snarky with someone that asked you to explain what a term meant . in fact , i relish the opportunity to show off my passion and knowledge of a subject . that should n't change in an online conversation . lmgtfy is a fun answer to `` how do i '' type questions especially when asked by those that unnecessarily rely on you for help . for `` what is '' or `` why does '' type questions , please do n't google that for me . let me hear your thoughts on it . ",
        "i 'll learn more about it , and you , in the process . now , is that so hard ?   "
