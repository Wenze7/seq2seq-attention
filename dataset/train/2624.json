        "he 's tied for an nhl-high eight points in three games , which earned him nhlpa player of the week . he also jammed out to bon jovi because that 's what you do when you 're flying high : . another player we do n't want to see cool down . the colorado avalanche also have some secondary scorers who do n't need to get cold . they 're streaky , but they 're starting to pot some in . carl soderberg had two goals in the last game , and rookie alexander `` please leave my head attached , doobs '' kerfoot assisted on both .
