        "the uk is famous for being one of the most powerful financial centres in the world . but this status also attracts criminals , who try to exploit the system through fraudulent activity and money laundering . while there are procedures in place to prevent this kind of activity , there are also failings which urgently need to be addressed . at the moment , 25 organisations supervise those companies most at risk of being used in money laundering schemes , which largely include accountancy and legal services providers . other sectors , including high value dealers and money service businesses , are currently regulated by hmrc , which is severely under-resourced . ",
        "earlier this year , the economic secretary to the treasury , simon kirby , announced plans for a new watchdog : the office for professional body anti-money laundering supervision , which will exclude those companies supervised by hmrc . this is staggering , and creates even less consistency in anti-money laundering supervision . the government should use their powers to match the private sector effort , providing consistency across all anti-money-laundering bodies . serious and organised crime costs the uk an estimated £ 24bn every year , and government needs to be stricter on itself to reduce this figure . ",
        "in its recent report , transparency international uk found hundreds of uk-registered shell companies at the heart of scandals amounting to £ 80bn . and yet there are just six staff in companies house who are responsible with policing four million companies . as the government 's official registrar , it is effectively an unregulated company service provider , exempt from rules that require checks on those registering a company . this means that the uk is at risk of illicit financial flows as a result of the government 's own processes . so while regulation in the private sector is being ramped up , with accountants and other service providers required by law to carry out checks , there is a `` no questions asked '' approach for those going to companies house directly . ",
        "a reformed regime could fill this due diligence gap and remove the need for the extensive duplication of cost and effort elsewhere . the final area where reform is needed is in relation to suspicious activity reports . businesses which comply with money laundering regulation need to inform the national crime agency of suspicious activity through sars . however , intelligence-sharing from the nca has historically been limited to the banking sector . sharing intelligence on schemes and crimes relevant to a business ' type and location would go a long way towards helping professionals identify suspicious activity . progress is being made , but we must formalise information sharing to increase the quality and usefulness of sars . ",
        "the home secretary has announced that a national economic crime centre is to be established , which is encouraging . but it will be interesting to see whether this bold announcement translates into additional resources -- or even just more efficient use of existing ones . we can not risk the uk 's reputation as a financial centre . financial crime costs our country billions and harms our businesses , so there is real value in creating a true partnership between the private and public sectors to help tackle the risks of financial crime .
