        "i have always been the girl with the boyfriend . although i only started dating at 18 , i sure as hell have had my fair share of boyfriends over the past ten years . short term , long term , long distance , casual flings -- i have list of men for every single category . now here you are thinking to yourself , is this girl seriously going to complain about the fact that she always has a boyfriend ? yes , yes i am . why , you ask ? because i am exhausted . i am exhausted of dating . ",
        "i am exhausted of the continuous let down when i have realized that he is not ` the one . ' i am exhausted of my friends choosing my dating life as the prime topic of conversation around the dinner table . i am exhausted listening to taylor swift 's albums on repeat . this morning , i realized that being in a relationship does not make me a better person . it does not make me more successful , it does not make me happier , smarter , kinder , or prettier . breaking up with my boyfriend last week , i realized that being in a relationship has been my security blanket . ",
        "a walking , talking , sometimes hairy , security blanket . i have finally decided to acknowledge the elephant in the room , the key ingredient in every successful relationship -- self-love . we all talk about how we need to love ourselves because we love others . and to be fully transparent , i always thought that was a load of crap . but here i am , sitting in a crowded starbucks wondering if this really is the key element in a successful relationship . so as the year comes to an end , so does all of self-hate . ",
        "here are the ways i have decided to practice self-love : plan an adventure . get my sweat on . treat myself . to something you love every day . keep a journal . disconnect from the online world for the first hour in the morning , and last hour of the day . read a new book every month . meditate . give myself a day off every now and then . practice forgiveness . with the rise of social media , it is so easy to get caught up in constantly comparing yourself , which can significantly lower your self-esteem . ",
        "i encourage each and every one of you to come up with a list of things you can do to improve your self-love . if you need some inspiration , here is a link for some fun ideas : always remember , you will never influence the world trying to be like it . nigel tadyanehondo .   "
