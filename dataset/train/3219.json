        "immediately following james franco 's golden globe win , he was accused of inappropriate behavior by several women , and others brought up his well-documented flirtation with a 17-year-old girl in 2014 . many wondered if franco would skip the sag awards , but he showed up while choosing to avoid the red carpet , where his sister-in-law , alison brie , fielded a question on subject that 's on everyone 's mind these days . the glow actress first voiced support for victims of sexual misconduct , but she stressed that she did support her family , which obviously includes james as an in-law . ",
        "she also asserted that `` not everything '' that has appeared in reports is true , all while maintaining that it 's important to listen to accusers : `` i think that above all , what we 've always said is it remains vital that anyone that feels victimized should and does have the right to speak out and come forward . i obviously support my family . not everything that has been reported is fully accurate , so i think we 're waiting to get all the information . but of course now is the time for listening and that 's what we 're all trying to do . ",
        "it remains vital that anyone that feels victimized should and does have the right to speak out and come forward . '' certainly , this was n't a question that brie wished to answer on the red carpet during an important night for her own career , and it 's not an enviable spot in which to stand . she stood in the precarious position of potentially upsetting many people , and brie was also following scarlett johannson 's speech at the women 's march , where she called out franco 's apparent hypocrisy for wearing a times up pin at the globes and said that she 'd like that pin back . ",
        "for those who anticipated an uncomfortable franco speech on sunday night , it never happened . franco lost the outstanding performance by a male actor in a leading role award to gary oldman , and it remains to be seen whether franco gets an oscar nod following those sexual misconduct allegations .
