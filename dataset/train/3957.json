        "for corpus christi residents , a new downtown tourist attraction is long overdue . a group of businessmen in the coastal city think they have the answer for that . the concept is called seatown and would be placed on land that 's occupied by the current harbor bridge . if all goes as planned , the vision would come to fruition sometime after 2020 , when the bridge is torn down . seatown is described in its proposal as `` a walkable district offering arts , culture , entertainment and food and beverage . '' connecting these stores would be a multipurpose canal that would be carved into the corpus christi bay . ",

",
        "the amount would be split up among the city , nueces county and the regional transportation authority . the concept fits perfectly with the rest of downtown corpus christi , perkes said . surrounding attractions nearby include the american bank center , concrete street amphitheater and whataburger field . `` this could create a huge number of jobs , '' perkes said . `` no . 2 would be sales tax . revenue would be raised in a district like this . `` though the economic benefits are hard to ignore , perkes said the project would also pay homage to corpus christi 's history .

        "seatown will help tell the story of alonzo alvarez de pineda , who first discovered the bay and named it corpus christi in honor of the roman catholic feast day . if the project goes through as planned , perkes said corpus christi will have a tourist attraction on par with other major cities in texas , like austin , san antonio and mcallen . fares sabawi covers crime in san antonio and bexar county for mysa . com . read more of his stories here . | fsabawi@mysa . com | twitter : @faresinsa .
