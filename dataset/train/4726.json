        "starbucks has officially `` mellowed out , '' ushering in a mild , light-roast espresso blend to its shops across the u. s. on tuesday , january 9 , the first espresso option added to the company 's u. s. menu in more than 40 years . known widely for dark roast coffee -- bold-bodied and bitter -- the coffee chain is offering a light blonde espresso for an `` easier '' coffee-drinking experience . customers can now choose between a `` starbucks signature '' or `` starbucks blonde '' espresso for any of the chain 's beverages like lattes , cappuccinos , flat whites , americanos , macchiatos , or shots . ",
        "beverages were already customizable , as evidenced by starbucks ' best-kept secret menu that features over 200 drink recipes and counting . starbucks beverages can be custom-fitted even more now . coffee-drinkers with a distaste for starbucks ' signature full-bodied roasts will especially enjoy blonde roasts which have a light-bodied profile , contrary to starbucks ' traditional dark roasts . andrew linnemann , vice president of global coffee for the coffee company said in a press release that the lighter alternative , a `` bright taste with sweet citrus notes and a smooth body , '' is breaking starbucks ' long-held rule with full-bodied roasts . ",
        "avid starbucks drinkers raise their noses to americans who ca n't handle the chain 's overly-bitter coffee profiles , lest they are drowned in the works -- half dozen pumps of mocha syrup and powder , whipped cream frosted skyward , a caramel sauce drizzle for good measure , all thoroughly diluted with soy milk . sensitive palettes are sure to welcome starbucks ' light roast without all the bells and whistles , perhaps saving a few calories in sweeteners . blonde espresso , the company says , sources beans from latin america and east africa , after which they 're roasted to peak flavor for a balanced , subtle coffee . ",
        "third wave cafes have treated blonde roasts with the same critical care and snobbiness as sommeliers . alongside artisanal foodstuffs and elaborate drip apparatuses , blonde roasts have been peddled by `` coffee artisans '' for years . starbucks , with all things considered , was a little slow on the draw , offering blonde roasts since 2012 everywhere else but the u. s . in canada , austin , and tampa locations , blonde was received with overwhelming reviews , sparking the company to do a full rollout now in the u. s. at all 8,000 company-run stores beginning january 9 .
