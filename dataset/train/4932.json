        "notes from a girl to her dogto my darling beast , it 's commonly implied when a character says `` i stayed with my uncle so and so '' that that person was not an uncle at all and that character -- most likely a young child -- was left by some inattentive mother with a would-be beau . as much as i feel like this much-maligned mother figure whenever i have to leave town , i want you to take a moment to appreciate the fact that your dog uncle spent a week baking you squash and walking you around the city and probably singing to you whenever the moment called for it . ",
        "sometimes an uncle is actually an uncle and sometimes a mother is simply doing what she has to in order to get through a year . besides , if we believed every trope and stereotype , you would 've ripped my face off and left my neighbors to discover my body by smell a long time ago . behave yourself while i 'm gone this week . yes , you have two dog uncles now get that look off your face . all my love as always , -- dog momi honestly do n't like you enough to bake you squash every day .
