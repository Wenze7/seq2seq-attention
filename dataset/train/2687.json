        "bonjour tout les gents ! bienvenue à mon tout premier bulletin ! fitria salma people often said `` tak kenal , maka tak sayang . '' so , first i 'd want to introduce myself . my name is fitria salma and people call me by ` vivit ' . i 'm placed in les ollieres , which is a small city located in ardèche , france . here i always wake up with beautiful landscape greeting me from the window . in case you 're all curious , i 'm surrounded by those green mountains and trees . it 's the perfect picture of the rural painting . ",
        "with that , i 'd like to give you a glimpse of the wonderfulness of france ! three weeks ago , i had two weeks off from school for the autumn holiday . i 'm so excited because it meant that i could explore more of france ! for the first two days , i spent it with my friends from all over the world in the afs camp . we were sleeping at the chateu d'anjou . it was a really old castle , so we got the chance to feel the vibes of living in the old century . ",
        "it was magnificent ! that camp was a really good start for my holiday . the next day , i went to valence with my host dad . valence is the capital city of the drôme department in the southeastern france . it 's well known for its famous museums , castles , architecture and industrial department . i went there to visit my friend 's apartment . we ate lunch together with his family and then we 'd just hang out until noon . we decided to walk a little around valence to visit the park , ate crepes and chilling out while waiting for my host dad to pick me up . ",
        "at wednesday , i went touring ardèche with my friends from the other town . the first spot was located in the saint-martial . we hiked the mont gerbier-de-jonc , it 's not that high so it was n't that hard . when we reached the top , it was marvelous ! i 've never seen such a view before . there , you can see the top of the famous mont blanc , the green hills , the blue mountains , the valleys , the rivers . dear lord , it was such a pleasure ! after that , we went to cascade du ray pic to see the waterfall and after we had a little picnic for lunch . ",
        "we 've also visited the famous church in burzet , the grand casino in aubenas vals , and we finally ended our journey in aubenas . at thursday , i went back to valence to meet my afs friends . we had kebab for lunch and after we decided to visit one of our friend 's house in the center of the city . the next day , i went shopping with my friend in valence . one of many things that i liked about france is that , it has so many little shops outdoor ! you could just hop from one to another . ",
        "we also ate mcdonalds that day for breakfast ! the week after , i met people from iraq , tunisia and egypt . we all had lunch together with menus from each country . i served nasi goreng for that day . it was really interesting to exchange our culture ! i 've also celebrated my very first halloween with my school 's mates ! we 're dressed up as a ghost , scary doll , the witch and the mask man . at night , we went to people 's houses and ask for ` des bonbon ou un sort ! ' ",
        "it was so fun ! we got so many candies at the end . at thursday , i volunteered myself at the retirement house . we did some activity together , and we had tea time in the afternoon ! the next day , i went to lyon with my host sisters and my host mother . lyon is the third largest city in france and the center of the second largest metropolitan area in the country . it is known as a gastronomic and historical city with a vibrant cultural scene . it is also the birthplace of cinema . ",
        "we spent the whole day with shopping and touring the museums . i also found ` indomie ' in the asiatic store ! i 'm so happy because i did n't bring any of it from indonesia and there 's no shop in ardèche that sells such thing ! the last two days of my holiday , i went to aix en provence to visit my host sister 's place and then we went to marseille . marseille is the second-largest city in france . it was also the most important trading center in the region and the main commercial port of the french republic . ",
        "we went for a night walk to enjoy the sea and we had lebanese cuisine for dinner . the next morning , we went touring the monuments , museums , the famous spot and of course the sea . so , that is my journey for the last autumn vacation . i ca n't wait to explore more of france in the future ! it still amazed me , on how it has a lot of beautiful scenery . starting from the mountains to the sea , the metropolitans to the country side , they have it all ! and after you read this , i hope you 'd understand that france is not only about paris .
