        "afp/file / tobias schwarz germany has been in political paralysis since a september election in which chancellor angela merkel failed to win a clear majority -- in part due to the rise of the far-right and anti-immigration alternative for germany german chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives reached a `` breakthrough '' deal friday with the country 's second biggest party , the social democrats , toward building a new coalition government , sources close to the negotiations said . after more than 24 hours of talks , party chiefs reached an in-principle deal to start formal coalition talks that could lead in the coming months to a new government for the biggest eu economy , the sources told afp . ",
        "in the all-night talks in berlin , the party chiefs -- merkel of the christian democrats as well as social democrats leader martin schulz and the head of merkel 's bavarian allies , horst seehofer -- and their negotiators hammered out a 28-page joint paper that will form the basis for the talks ahead . potential pitfalls remain , including votes by sceptical spd delegates and later the labour party 's rank-and-file members that could yet give the thumbs down to another left-right `` grand coalition '' , the constellation that has ruled germany for the past four years .

        "germany has been in political paralysis since a september 24 election in which merkel failed to win a clear majority -- in part due to the rise of the far-right and anti-immigration alternative for germany which took millions of votes from all major parties . merkel initially turned to two smaller parties , the free democrats and greens , to form a new coalition government for her forth term , but when those talks collapsed in november , she had to once more woo a reluctant spd for a new power pact . - marathon talks - both merkel and schulz went into the talks thursday warning of `` big obstacles '' ahead , and major sticking points in the red-eye negotiations that followed were immigration , finances and health policy , sources said . ",
        "everything was at stake for merkel and the other party leaders in the marathon talks . `` the negotiations are not just about a coalition , but also their careers , '' said karl-rudolf korte of duisburg-essen university . `` it would be the end for all three if this coalition does not come about . `` germany 's rude economic health has stood in stark contrast to the political paralysis which has entered a fourth month , with merkel currently running a caretaker government . in fact the political talks were tripped up by the country 's strong finances , as parties had opposing views on how to spend the cash .

        "dpa/afp/file / peter steffen protests broke out after the far-right afd party won nearly 13 percent of the vote in septemberthe spd , seeking to push its social welfare agenda , is demanding greater relief for the lower and middle income brackets and tax hikes for top earners , while the conservatives had campaigned with a promise of `` tax cuts for all '' . the embattled mainstream parties are also struggling to fend off the encroaching far right , which has seized on anger and fears over a mass influx of refugees and netted a record showing at the september poll . ",
        "to halt a haemorrhage to the afd , merkel 's alliance wants a tougher stance on immigration , something that is hard to sell to the spd . - ` spd mood grim ' - a new coalition deal can still be torpedoed when spd delegates , and later rank-and-file members , get to vote on whether the party should once again govern in merkel 's shadow . scepticism is high after the spd scored a humiliating result in september . the spd 's youth wing chief kevin kuehnert has vowed to embark on a national tour to press his case to opposing a new grand coalition before a september 21 party congress . ",
        "afp/file / john macdougall the resistance campaign against any grand coalition , known as `` groko '' in german , has adopted the hashtag #nogroko `` the mood of the party rank and file with regards to a grand coalition is still grim . that 's why i think we have a good chance , '' said kuehnert . opinion polls suggest most germans are less than enthusiastic about a new conservative-spd alliance . a survey published by focus magazine found that only 30 percent of germans favour a return of the grand coalition , while 34 percent prefer new elections . ",
        "another poll published by public broadcaster ard found that only 45 percent viewed a new grand coalition positively , while 52 percent did not .   "
