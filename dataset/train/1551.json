        "city suffering from the winter blues . birmingham city 1 queens park rangers 2 . the form book does n't make good reading for birmingham city fans . the once-fancied midlands club have lost their last three , only registering one win in their last ten , and have scored just four times since the end of september , making them the league 's lowest scorers by some margin . steve cotterill , the club 's second manager of the season , has made little progress during his time in charge and relegation to the third tier remains an alarming possibility . ",
        "on saturday , visiting queens park rangers took the lead at st. andrews through an unlikely source . seventeen minutes into the first-half , ex-liverpool full-back jack robinson headed home his first league goal for the west-london club after a beautifully flighted set-piece from luke freeman . birmingham were fortunate not to fall two behind , when robinson looped a free-header over the crossbar , but they levelled soon after . maikel kieftenbeld , who nearly joined derby in the summer but for an issue with the transfer 's paperwork , rifled a low shot towards goal , and when the usually reliable alex smithies spilled the ball , sam gallagher pounced to equalise . ",
        "it was n't to be birmingham 's day . with goals for burton and sunderland agitating the home crowd , the blues conceded once more and it was robinson again who delivered the fatal blow . his left-foot strike from range nestled in the bottom corner and resigned cotterill 's sorry birmingham to the foot of the championship table . so , who 's to blame ? well , some city fans will point to the players who have underachieved despite the off-season hype . having narrowly avoided the drop last season , more would have been expected from birmingham 's stalwarts this time around , whilst few would have predicted that the seemingly smart acquisitions of the likes of stockdale , jota , dean , boga and colin would have had such little influence on the team 's results . ",
        "others , however , will hark back to a decision made on the 14th december 2016 -- the outrageous and unjustified sacking of gary rowett . since rowett 's departure , cotterill is the third manager to try and fail to emulate his success and , to date , birmingham 's loss has been derby 's gain . cotterill surely deserves more time , but there 's no doubt that saturday 's poor result against qpr leaves the birmingham board with imminent decisions to make . do they ride out this poor run in the hope of a revival in the new year , or do they need to be hatching a ` plan c ' ?

        "dream league debut for sunderland 's hero . sunderland 1 fulham 0 . the black cats ended an embarrassing winless run this weekend , securing their first home victory in 2017 after a 364-day wait . a late goal from 18-year-old striker josh maja earned a 1-0 win over fulham at the stadium of light and , in turn , hauled chris coleman 's side out of the championship relegation zone . maja , whose only previous appearance came in a league cup win over qpr in 2016 , took his opportunity just five minutes after coming on as a substitute , swivelling and finishing cooly past marcus bettinelli . ",
        "the goal was cruel on the fulham keeper , who had produced a string of outstanding saves to deny lewis grabban and james vaughan earlier in the match , but may prove crucial in sunderland 's battle against back-to-back relegations . coleman 's appointment was considered to be a coup by many and it has n't taken long for his influence to show . his team have won two out of five under his leadership , almost doubling their points tally from the previous seventeen games . they have looked more assured defensively , keeping three clean sheets in their last four games , including an impressive shut-out against league leaders wolves , and his trust in youngsters josh maja and joel asoro has eased some of the pressure on lewis grabban and james vaughan up front . ",
        "next up for sunderland it 's a relegation six-pointer with bottom-side birmingham and , with the black cats buoyed by saturday 's result , few would bet against a second home-win of the year . elsewhere in the championship ... wolves maintained their four-point lead at the top of the championship , winning 1-0 at hillsborough against 10-man sheffield wednesday . as we approach the halfway mark , it appears that nuno espirito santo 's side could even threaten reading 's 106-point record if they continue their sensational form . cardiff followed up their late comeback at the madejski with a hard-fought 1-0 win over nigel adkins ' hull . ",
        "bluebirds captain sol bamba headed home the only goal . bristol city also maintained pressure on the top-two with a 2-1 victory over forest . gary rowett 's derby county are mounting a promotion challenge . andreas weimann 's goal against his former employers set them on their way to a 2-0 victory over fellow playoff candidates aston villa . sheffield united , however , are barely clinging onto their place in the top-six . the blades succumbed to defeat at preston and finished the weekend just one point above rivals leeds united . thomas christiansen 's team appear to have recovered from a recent blip , winning 1-0 against norwich on saturday . ",
        "millwall secured an impressive three-points against an underwhelming middlesborough . jed wallace and george saville inflicted the damage for the home side in the first-half , before a stewart downing consolation goal set-up a nervy finish . meanwhile , lloyd dyer 's goal helped burton to a crucial win at fellow-strugglers bolton and barnsley ended a five-game losing streak when they earned a point in a bore-draw at griffin park . coming up next week : . cardiff 's late equaliser and a deflating defeat at portman road has given the royals a reality check . burton visit berkshire next weekend and an expectant crowd will demand no less than three points . ",
        "it will be the 500th reading game at the madejski stadium . elsewhere , birmingham 's trip to sunderland will be worth monitoring and it will be interesting to see if millwall can spring another surprise when they travel to pride park .   "
