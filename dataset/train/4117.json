        "courtesy of zerohedge . view original post here . while the rest of draghi 's presser was uneventful , the two things investors were looking for were the ecb 's revised gdp and inflation forecasts . and while the first saw a modest improvement across the board relative to the september forecast as follows : 2017 at 2.4 % vs 2.2 % in sept. 2018 at 2.3 % vs 1.8 19 at 1.9 % vs 1.7 20 at 1.7 % , new forecastit was the inflation projections that were more interesting especially after the fed yesterday kept its own inflation forecasts unchanged despite tax reform . ",
        "here is what draghi unviled moments ago for the ecb 's latest inflation expectations : 2017 : 1.5 % vs 1.5 % in sept 2018 : 1.4 % vs 1.2 % prev 2019 : 1.5 % vs 1.5 % prev 2020 : 1.7 % , new forecastand draghi 's commentary : according to eurostat 's flash estimate , euro area annual hicp inflation was 1.5 % in november , up from 1.4 % in october . at the same time , measures of underlying inflation have moderated somewhat recently , in part owing to special factors . looking ahead , on the basis of current futures prices for oil , annual rates of headline inflation are likely to moderate in the coming months , mainly reflecting base effects in energy prices , before increasing again . ",
        "underlying inflation is expected to rise gradually over the medium term , supported by our monetary policy measures , the continuing economic expansion , the corresponding absorption of economic slack and rising wage growth . this assessment is also broadly reflected in the december 2017 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area , which foresee annual hicp inflation at 1.5 % in 2017 , 1.4 % in 2018 , 1.5 % in 2019 and 1.7 % in 2020 . compared with the september 2017 ecb staff macroeconomic projections , the outlook for headline hicp inflation has been revised up , mainly reflecting higher oil and food prices . ",
        "finally , this is how the ecb 's revised inflation forecasts look visually , including the first 2020 inflation forecast : following the incrase in 2017 and 2019 inflation expectations , and the new -- and quite high -- 2020 inflation forecast of 1.7 % , the eur briefly moved higher , while 10y yields pushed higher ... ... although with draghi repeating during the press conference q&a that `` inflation remains muted '' , we expect the kneejerk reaction to be quickly faded , and indeed the eur is already retracing session lows .
