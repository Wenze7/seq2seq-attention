        "zhuhai - china 's first large amphibious aircraft ag600 on sunday completed its maiden flight in south china 's guangdong province . at 9:39 am , the aircraft ag600 , code named `` kunlong , '' left jinwan airport in the city of zhuhai . the flight lasted about one hour . `` the maiden flight makes china among the few countries capable of developing a large amphibious aircraft , '' said huang lingcai , chief designer of ag600 . the communist party of china central committee and the state council congratulated all those engaged in the mission , including those from the ministry of industry and information , the civil aviation administration of china and the aviation industry corporation of china . ",
        "the congratulatory message said that the maiden flight was a major breakthrough in developing special-purpose aircraft following the maiden flight of the large c919 passenger jet in may . its name `` kunlong '' stands for a high expectation in chinese culture with the `` kun '' meaning an enormous legendary fish and `` long , '' a dragon . `` it has taken eight years to develop the aircraft . it is the result of several generations of chinese aviation work , '' said huang . the 36.9-meter aircraft is powered by four domestically-built turboprop engines , according to its developer the avic . ",
        "aviation engines have long been a problem and the ag600 engine is a major step forward . with a maximum take-off weight of 53.5 tonnes and a maximum cruising speed of 500 kilometers per hour , the ag600 has a range of 12 hours . designed to be the world 's largest amphibious aircraft , the ag600 will be mainly used for maritime rescue , fighting forest fires and marine monitoring . it can carry 50 people during search-and-rescue missions , collect 12 tonnes of water in 20 seconds for fire fighting and transport up to 370 tonnes of water on a single tank of fuel . ",
        "`` its operational range of more than 4,000 km and ability to land on and take off from water put china 's islands in the south china sea well within range , '' said huang . china released a guideline on large aircraft projects in 2006 which has resulted in three large aircraft models . in 2013 , transport aircraft y-20 made maiden flight and entered into service with china 's air force in july 2016 . in 2017 , china ' s first domestically-produced large passenger aircraft c919 completed first flight , allowing china entry in a civil aviation market currently monopolized by the airbus and boeing . ",
        "the ag600 is the third . `` its successful maiden flight helps china enter the global aviation industry chain , '' said chen mingsheng , one of the designers of the ag600 . the aircraft has already received 17 orders due to its multiple uses and advanced manufacturing technique .   "
