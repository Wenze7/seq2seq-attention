        "it looked very much like something from a science fiction film . if you happened to look up at the sky at around 5.30 pm in california on friday , you would probably have been very confused , and perhaps a little alarmed . that is , unless you take an interest in what spacex , a company that `` designs , manufactures and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft '' , gets up to . the company , whose ceo is elon musk , launched a rocket to propel 10 satellites into orbit for communications firm iridium , but the result was like something out of a science fiction film . ",
        "many took to twitter to share their reaction to the sunset illuminations . although not everybody was impressed . meanwhile , musk himself had fun with some of the rumours . spacex tweeted throughout the process , proclaiming it to be a success . a statement on spacex 's website read : `` on friday , december 22nd at 5:27 p. m. pst , spacex 's falcon 9 successfully lifted off from space launch complex 4e at vandenberg air force base in california , carrying the iridium-4 mission to orbit . `` this was the fourth set of 10 satellites in a series of 75 total satellites that spacex will launch for iridium 's next generation global satellite constellation , iridium next . '' ",
        "furthermore , musk tweeted that there will be more coming next month . just make sure everybody knows it 's not aliens next time please , elon .   "
