        "foxborough , mass. . -- tom brady passed for three touchdowns and 337 yards , and the new england patriots cruised past the tennessee titans 35-14 on saturday night to advance to their seventh consecutive afc championship game . new england will host the winner of sunday 's divisional matchup between jacksonville and pittsburgh . it was brady 's 10th career postseason game with at least three td tosses , moving him past joe montana for the most in nfl history . james white caught a touchdown pass and ran for another , and danny amendola had 11 catches for 112 yards . ",
        "the titans took an early 7-0 lead , but new england scored 35 straight points to take control . marcus mariota completed 22 of 37 passes for 254 yards and two touchdowns , but was under duress for most of the second half . he was sacked eight times , a patriots playoff record . new england also held derrick henry to just 28 yards rushing on 12 carries . new england 's victory came on the heels of a week filled with drama following reports of turmoil involving brady , coach bill belichick and team owner robert kraft .

        "none of that showed on the field saturday . `` it definitely sounds crazy . but you have to keep ignoring the noise on the outside , just keep working every time you walk into the building and just keep grinding , '' tight end rob gronkowski said of how his team handled the media firestorm this week . the titans came back from an 18-point deficit in the second half to beat the chiefs 22-21 in the wild-card round last week -- the largest comeback on the road in the super bowl era . but the patriots did n't give them a chance for an encore . ",
        "leading 14-7 , the patriots stretched their lead to 14 just before halftime thanks to a trio of careless penalties on the titans . tennessee initially forced a three-and-out , but gave up a first down via a fourth-and-5 neutral zone infraction on brynden trawick before new england 's punt attempt . armed with a new set of downs , brady went to work moving the patriots down the field with a steady diet of short passes . the titans helped along the way with illegal contact and unnecessary roughness penalties . it eventually culminated in a 4-yard td pass from brady to chris hogan in the back of the end zone that made it 21-7 . ",
        "brady threw a short shovel pass to white , who ran it in from the 5-yard line to make it 7-7 early in the second quarter . the patriots appeared to have a touchdown three plays earlier , when dion lewis caught a pass from brady and was tackled by wesley woodyard at the 19 . lewis landed on top of the defender , then got up and continued to the end zone . the officials initially ruled that he had never been down and called it a touchdown . but replays showed lewis ' butt hit the ground at the 19 .
