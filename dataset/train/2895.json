        "jared kushner 's rise to power mirrors trump 's president donald trump 's chief negotiator for brokering a middle east peace agreement said he does n't want to upstage his father-in-law by prematurely announcing a decision on moving the u. s. embassy in israel to jerusalem from tel aviv . `` he 's still looking at a lot of different facts and when he makes his decision he 'll be the one who 'll want to tell you , not me , '' jared kushner , a senior adviser to trump , told israeli billionaire haim saban at a conference in washington on sunday . ",
        "`` so , we 'll make sure he does that . '' trump may declare that the u. s. recognizes jerusalem as israel 's capital during a speech on wednesday , according to a report by axios on dec. . 1 , citing two unidentified sources with direct knowledge of the matter . saban suggested lightheartedly -- at the brookings institution forum that bears his name -- that he call kushner on thursday to confirm the news . kushner 's comments were his first public remarks on his work to restart talks between israel and the palestinians . those efforts have included talks with saudi arabia that have cut out secretary of state rex tillerson and key state department personnel , according to people familiar with tillerson 's concerns . ",
        "earlier on sunday , white house national security adviser h. r. mcmaster said he did n't know whether trump would move the u. s. embassy to jerusalem , while adding in an interview on `` fox news sunday '' that doing so could be used to create `` momentum '' to broker a peace agreement in the middle east `` and a solution that works both for israelis and for palestinians . '' mcmaster said that he and his team have presented trump with various options , and that he 's not sure what the final decision will be . ",
        "the president signed a waiver in june to keep the u. s. embassy in tel aviv . previous u. s. presidents , including bill clinton and george w. bush , pledged to move the israel embassy in their campaigns , only to abandon the promise in the face of political reality . despite mcmaster 's comment about creating `` momentum , '' middle east experts have said that moving the u. s. embassy in jerusalem would make it harder for israelis and palestinians to reach a final peace agreement . israel captured east jerusalem in the 1967 six-day war and formally annexed those portions of the city to form one municipality under israeli law .
