        "a brooklyn nets fan who was dissed by a snarky mayor de blasio over the team 's performance says he has the perfect way for hizzoner to make amends -- come to a game with him . `` at this point , he needs to redeem himself -- he should be right in front where the team can look him in the eye , '' queens resident edwin williams said of de blasio , who grew up rooting for the boston celtics . de blasio landed in hot water earlier this month when williams was trying to ask him a question about local traffic safety during a town-hall meeting in belle harbor -- and the mayor interrupted him to rib him about why he was wearing a nets jacket , considering the local nba franchise has been among the league 's worst teams the past few seasons . ",
        "williams , a 50-year-old engineer , told de blasio that he supports the nets because he is originally from brooklyn . de blasio shot back , `` i 'm from brooklyn too , but this brooklyn nets idea has not been working out as it was planned , so i admire you for sticking with them . '' the mayor 's clueless remarks immediately angered nets fans . edwin williams pictured alongside mayor bill de blasiothey also did n't make much sense . as a former neighborhood councilman a decade ago , de blasio was a big booster of green-lighting the controversial atlantic yards development project that included the nets ' new arena in prospect heights , brooklyn . ",
        "the nets have called de blasio out over his remarks and invited him to see the team in person as it tries to rebuild . `` hello , @nycmayor . from one brooklynite to another , you should know that we always have each other 's backs , '' the nets tweeted dec. . 6 . `` like all of nyc , we 're always grinding to get better . if you want to see some real grit , our doors are always open . '' nba commissioner adam silver has even weighed in by defending the nets ' 2012 move from new jersey to brooklyn . ",
        "silver said the team 's switch was good for the borough because it helped jump-start economic development near its home court , the barclays center . williams said he is willing to shell out hundreds of dollars to buy tickets for him and de blasio to sit behind the team 's bench at a game so the mayor can redeem himself with nets nation . `` as mayor of new york city , you should support all your teams , whether they 're winning or losing , '' williams said . de blasio spokesman eric phillips told the post that the mayor is `` happy the nets are in brooklyn '' and `` would be happy to go to a game with , so long as they sit in the cheap seats . '' ",
        "de blasio 's town-hall diss should have come as no surprise to new yorkers , seeing how the mayor has already managed to tick off giants , jets and yankees fans with his unabashed love for new england sports teams , especially the red sox and patriots . while he was born in manhattan , de blasio 's parents later moved to massachusetts and raised him in cambridge . his claim that he 's `` from brooklyn , too '' stems simply from the fact that he and wife chirlane mccray own two houses in park slope , including one they lived in for more than a decade before moving into the mayoral gracie mansion in manhattan in 2014 . ",
        "de blasio cemented his status as public enemy no . 1 to yankee nation in october when he refused to root for the bronx bombers during their unexpected playoff push .   "
