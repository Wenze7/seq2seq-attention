        "carphone warehouse has been fined a joint-record £ 400,000 after a cyber attack exposed the personal details of more than 3m of its customers and staff . the information commissioner 's office , which is responsible for enforcing data protection rules , said the phone retailer 's failure to secure its systems allowed hackers to gain access to names , addresses , phone numbers , dates of birth , marital status and , for more than 18,000 customers , historical payment card details . the fine is an embarrassment for carphone warehouse founder sir charles dunstone , who was chairman at the time and also chairs talktalk , which was spun out of the retailer in 2010 and is the only other company to have been slapped with a £ 400,000 bill by the ico . ",
        "elizabeth denham , the information commissioner , said : `` carphone warehouse should be at the top of its game when it comes to cyber-security , and it is concerning that the systemic failures we found related to rudimentary , commonplace measures . '' the ico said it found `` multiple inadequacies '' in carphone warehouse 's data security practices and that the company had `` failed to take adequate steps '' to protect customer information , neglecting to update important software and not carrying out routine security checks . carphone warehouse will only have to pay £ 320,000 of the fine , as there is a 20pc discount for early payment . ",
        "talktalk was fined £ 400,000 in 2016 after hackers breached the accounts of 157,000 customers . companies that break data protection rules currently face a fine of up to £ 500,000 . that will rise to € 20m or 4pc of global annual revenues , whichever is higher , once the new europe-wide general data protection regulation come into force later this year . a spokesman for the company said it was sorry for any distress caused by the incident . `` we accept today 's decision by the ico and have co-operated fully throughout its investigation into the illegal cyberattack on a specific system within one of carphone warehouse 's uk divisions in 2015 , '' he said . ",
        "`` as the ico notes in its report , we moved quickly at the time to secure our systems , to put in place additional security measures and to inform the ico and potentially affected customers and colleagues . '' shares in dixons carphone , the company created by carphone warehouse 's merger with dixons retail in 2014 , were flat at 203p in afternoon trade .   "
