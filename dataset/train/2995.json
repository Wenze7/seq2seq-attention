        "sen. jeff flake has revealed that he 's been promised an amnesty for nearly 800,000 illegal aliens by the senate republican leadership so long as he votes in favor of a year-end tax reform bill . in a statement , flake -- a longtime advocate for mass immigration and amnesty -- said he was originally going to vote against the tax reform plan , but was promised by gop leadership that if he voted in favor of the bill , he would be backed later on by leadership with a plan to give amnesty to hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens who have been shielded from deportation by the president obama-created deferred action for childhood arrivals program . ",
        "the washington post noted : . almost simultaneously , sen. jeff flake , a prominent holdout , announced his support for the legislation . he said he had secured leadership backing for two priorities : one related to how businesses can deduct major investments like equipment purchases ; and the second involving a solution for immigrants brought wihtout authorization to the united states as children . `` having secured both of those objectives , i am pleased to announce i will vote in support of the tax reform bill , '' flake said in a statement . in another statement , flake not only said that he got a commitment by the gop leadership to support a daca amnesty , but also that the `` solution '' would be `` growth-oriented '' which loosely refers to more legal immigration and more imported foreign workers for big business . ",
        "from the outset of the current debate on tax reform , my goal has been to ensure that congress passes a tax reform package that is both fiscally-responsible and promotes economic growth . during the debate over the current bill , i 've focused on two specific objectives . the first was to eliminate the $ 85 billion expensing budget gimmick in the bill . the second was to obtain a firm commitment from the senate leadership and the administration to work with me on a growth-oriented legislative solution to enact fair and permanent protections for daca recipients . flake 's statement would mean the passage of the tax legislation is actually serving as an assurance to the republican establishment , democrats , the open borders lobby and corporate interests that an amnesty for daca illegal aliens will happen , no matter the amount of opposition to it by president trump 's base and the american people . ",
        "earlier in the week , the u. s. chamber of commerce and corporate interests gathered in washington , d. c. with illegal aliens to lobby lawmakers to support an amnesty for daca recipients . the open borders efforts , though , have not pushed the white house to move from the trump administration 's stance that any deal on daca would have to include the president 's pro-american immigration principles in order for it to be considered . in september , attorney general jeff sessions announced that the daca program would officially be ended in march 2018 . since then , the political establishment , the open borders lobby , and big business have attempted to quickly lobby and pass an amnesty deal that could potentially result in a flood of between 9.9 to 19 million foreign extended family members arriving in the u. s. in years to come .
