        "our long idea reports aim to identify stocks that the market has overlooked and that , when analyzed with more rigor than provided by tradition financial metrics , offer excellent risk/reward . get the timeless reading ebook in pdfget the entire 10-part series on timeless reading in pdf . save it to your desktop , read it on your tablet , or email to your colleagues . tumisu / pixabayit pays to read our long idea reports . in 2017 , 19 out of our 29 long idea picks saw positive returns and 13 outperformed the market . however , the thesis does not always play out as we expect and , at times , some stocks only get more undervalued . ",
        "below , we present the long idea highlights and lowlights . long idea highlightshighlight 1 : nvr inc. . -- published april 17 -- reiterated november 28 : up 63 % vs. s&p up 14 % when we first featured nvr inc. . as a long idea , we felt its shareholder friendly exec comp plan , history of increasing market share , and a rising housing market could propel shares over the long-term . despite positive catalysts and a strong competitive position , the market had priced nvr for permanent profit decline at the time of writing . nvr had a price-to-economic book value ratio of 0.9 . ",
        "this ratio meant the market expected nvr 's after-tax profit to permanently decline by 10 % . instead , over the past twelve months nvr has grown nopat 27 % over the prior trailing twelve months . ttm nopat margin improved to 9 % versus 8 % in 2016 , and its return on invested capital improved 380 basis points over the prior ttm . these impressive results led to multiple earnings beats and a 59 % increase in stock price , which caused us to revisit , and reiterate , the idea in late november . at that time , we still found nvr to be undervalued by the market and maintained our long idea . ",
        "by the end of 2017 , nvr increased 63 % from the publish date while the s&p rose 14 % . the stock still earns an attractive rating and its strong fundamentals coupled with its valuation land it a spot in the most attractive stocks , exec comp aligned with roic , and focus list -- long model portfolios . highlight 2 : spirit aerosystems -- published june 26 -- reiterated september 22 : up 56 % vs. s&p up 10 % spirit aerosystems was an underappreciated industrials stock with strong fundamentals that the market had failed to recognize . ",
        "since restructuring in 2013 , the company 's profitability was on the rise , and its competitive position within the aircraft supplier market was improving . at the time of publishing , we noted that spr 's top-quintile 16 % roic exceeded its peer average and the company 's balance sheet efficiency , as measured by average invested capital turns , were more than double its peer average . despite the rising strength in the business ' fundamentals , the market undervalued the stock . at the time of publishing , spr had a pebv of 0.7 . this ratio meant the market expected spr 's nopat to permanently decline by 30 % . ",
        "however , this expectation proved too pessimistic . instead , spr beat expectations in the past three quarterly earnings reports , and its largest customers , boeing and airbus , increased production throughout the year . after the stock rose 40 % , we reiterated spr as a long idea because it still presented an attractive risk/reward tradeoff . we found that , despite the increase in price , the stock was still undervalued relative to industrial peers , and its profitability was still well above industry averages . spr ended 2017 up 56 % since the publish date while the s&p was up 10 % . ",
        "spr earns our attractive rating and a spot in our focus list -- long model portfolio . highlight 3 : ross stores -- published september 11 : up 35 % vs. s&p up 7 % we first featured ross stores in july as one of our `` 5 unappreciated stocks with high roics . '' we followed with a feature as a long idea in september with the thesis that it could buck the `` failing retail '' trend . despite large box retailers turning in years of disappointing profits , rost has consistently grown nopat since 2007 . better yet , the firm 's profit margins were nearly double some competitors , and its balance sheet efficiency , as measured by invested capital turns , ranked well above industry averages . ",
        "perhaps , most telling of ross ' sustained success was its track record of comparable store sales growth , which at the time of writing spanned 34 consecutive quarters . since then , ross continued this consecutive comparable store sales growth . rost was not given a premium valuation despite the clear outperformance in a struggling retail market , which created a buying opportunity . at the time of publishing , rost had a pebv ratio of 1.1 , which implied just 10 % nopat growth over the remaining life of the firm . keep in mind rost has grown nopat 16 % compounded annually since 2007 . ",
        "this pessimistic expectation , coupled with a potential 5 % shareholder yield made ross an excellent portfolio addition . rost ended the year up 35 % since the publish date while the s&p was up 7 % . its continued profit growth and ability to navigate a tough retail environment help it earn a spot in our focus list -- long model portfolio . long idea lowlightsbelow , we highlight long idea picks that did not work . even where we 've been wrong , we think our reasoning for featuring these stocks was solid despite their underperformance . lowlight 1 : hooker furniture -- published december 6 : down 18 % vs. s&p up 2 % hooker furniture exhibited many of the same characteristics of the successful picks above . ",
        "it has a history of profit growth , an improving roic , and margins above its competitors . at the same time , the improving economy seemed to bode well for hoft 's long-term profit growth . more money in consumers ' pockets should lead to increased spending on discretionary items such as those sold by hoft . in our pick , we noted that upcoming earnings could be a positive catalyst for the firm , but the opposite proved true . fiscal 3q18 revenue and earnings , despite both rising year-over-year , missed expectations and the stock fell 20 % in the four days following the report . ",
        "despite the miss , signs of a strong black friday holiday could bode well for future earnings . we 've seen before that hoft can be volatile around earnings releases , and one positive beat could send shares back on an upward trajectory . hoft ended 2017 down 18 % since publish while the s&p was up 2 % . the stock still earns our attractive rating and shares still look undervalued . lowlight 2 : hasbro inc. . -- published june 5 : down 16 % vs. s&p up 10 % hasbro started as a promising long idea after rising 8 % in the six weeks following our long idea report . ",
        "when analyzing the business fundamentals , stock price outperformance did not come as a surprise . the company had more than a decade of profit growth and rising margins , as well as an executive compensation plan tied to improvements in roic . the firm 's margin and roic ranked near the top of its main competitors , and its licensing deal with disney provided an attractive runway for future profit growth . however , when has reported 2q17 earnings , the stock fell 9 % despite beating on both top and bottom line expectations . the selling would continue when it was reported that hasbro was calling off merger talks with lions gate and toys ` r ' us filed bankruptcy in september . ",
        "the stock largely traded sideways until it was reported in november that hasbro was interested in acquiring mattel . the stock jumped 6 % following the report , but the increase would be short lived . when we analyzed the potential acquisition , we found that a combined hasbro/mattel could provide big profits for investors . the combined firm would have leverage over distributors , larger intellectual property to monetize , and significant cost synergies . with or without the acquisition , we remain confident in hasbro 's future . all told , the stock ended 2017 down 16 % since the publish date while the s&p was up 10 % . ",
        "however , we believe this price decline has only made shares more attractive . the stock finds itself in our dividend growth , exec comp aligned with roic , and focus list -- long model portfolios . lowlight 3 : spectrum brand holdings -- published may 15 : down 14 % vs. s&p up 11 % spectrum brands holdings , a conglomeration of numerous household products , represented a bet on the growing economy . the company exhibited strong profit growth over the past five years and had improved its roic from 6 % in 2011 to 8 % ttm . ",
        "the company 's profitability , which outranked nearly all competition , allowed the firm flexibility to maintain its share in its many markets while continually growing profits . best of all , the firm was expanding its higher margin segments and focusing less on its lower margin global batteries segment . at the time of writing , spb had a pebv ratio of 0.9 , which seemed overly pessimistic given spb 's historical profit growth . unfortunately , strong fundamentals would fall short of expectations in fiscal 3q17 , when spb missed both top and bottom line expectations . the stock fell 12 % over the next month . ",
        "fiscal 4q17 results helped , as revenue beat expectations and the stock price would jump 10 % the next day . despite the rebound , spb still finished 2017 down 14 % from publish while the s&p was up 11 % . spb still earns an attractive rating , and its 2017 underperformance could be a thing of the past . in january , spb announced a deal to sell its global battery and lighting business to energizer holdings , and spb jumped 5 % on the news . moving focus to its fastest growing and highest margin businesses could lead to the long-term profit growth we expected when we first featured spb in may 2017 .
