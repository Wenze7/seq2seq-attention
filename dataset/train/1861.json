        "let 's get real : relationships are difficult . whether you 've been dating your so for the last four days or four years , there 's always a kink or two in even the healthiest relationship . even if the smallest complication in you and your bae 's relationship does n't seem like a big deal , it can turn into a plague on your relationship if you continue to obsess over the same small things . after all , the little things in life matter and the little things in your relationship should n't be treated any differently . ",
        "learning how to let go of certain things will help your relationship become ever healthier . 1 . overthinkingwe know as soon as you tell yourself to stop overthinking , you 're going to start overthinking even more . one thing will lead to another , and you 'll be contemplating how your beau is planning to move to a different country and marry a victoria 's secret model all because he said he was too busy to meet for lunch today . we can all be professional overthinkers at times , but if you 're consistently overthinking simple things that your so does , then you should talk to your partner about this . ",
        "let them know that you 've been overthinking things . communicating to your so about why you 've been overthinking will allow you both to understand some of the triggers and underlying reasons for your overthinking . if you notice that you tend to dwell on similar situations , then you might be worried that your partner does n't like you as much as they used to . talking to your so about this can make your relations a lot less stressful . as a chronic overthinker myself , it 's better to have a discussion with your so about how you interpret what they are and are n't doing . ",
        "rather than letting those thoughts consume your emotional health , chatting with your so will allow you both to get some clarify . if talking to your partner about the miniscule things that make you overthink does n't help , then you both could work on ways to calm your overactive imagination : do n't focus on the things that can go wrong . harmless overthinking can be exacerbated because you only focus on the things that could go wrong . so if you start to worry that your so is becoming distant because he or she could n't netflix and binge eat pizza this week , then you should stop yourself short of thinking that bae has a side piece . ",
        "instead , think of the positive things your so could be doing . he or she could be working , finishing an essay or even visiting the local animal shelter to surprise you with the cutest and softest puppy ever . regardless , try to focus on the optimistic scenarios too , so your overthinking does n't consume you . be proactive about your overthinking . noticing when you 're overthinking is a skill that is mastered by few . however , when you do first notice your exaggerated thinking , do n't just think about it and wait for all those thoughts to resurface at the most inopportune time -- do something about it . ",
        "think about what you can actively do about whatever it is that causes you to overthink . whatever that action is , you need to do it . realize that overthinking wo n't solve anything . you probably ca n't predict the future , and even if you could , overthinking is n't going to fix whatever minor issues you 're having in your relationship . 2 . getting hung up on the differencesit should n't be news that everyone 's different . even you and your bestie have your differences , so it 's completely natural for you and your so to have different likes and dislikes . ",
        "granted , it 's important that you and your beau agree on more significant issues , but you should n't fret if your partner has a slightly different lifestyle than you . molly crum , a james madison university alumna , explains that you should n't `` let small differences in personality or preferences totally freak you out . '' molly continues , `` for example , i really enjoy working out daily whereas my boyfriend only exercises when he can around his busy schedule and if he truly feels like it . however , our differences are nothing drastic ; he never tries to change me or stop me from doing my workouts , and i never pressure him to join me at the gym . ",
        "of course shared values and interests are important , but small differences can actually keep a relationship interesting as long as each of you accept the other for who they are . '' after all , you should n't want to change your partner . obviously , any lifestyle differences might seem like a deal breaker in the long run , but ultimately it does n't matter if your so exercises less than you or puts milk in the bowl before the cereal . therefore , you should n't worry about any small differences between the two of you . ",
        "3 . comparing your partner to anyone elsewhile you may not be verbalizing these comparisons to your so , it 's unrealistic to compare your current so to your ex . obviously , your so is n't your ex , but that is n't a bad thing -- seeing as your ex is your ex for a reason . regardless , if you 're still doting on whatever good qualities your ex had , you should instead focus on the awesome qualities that made you fall in love with your so . after all , it 's not very healthy to mentally compare your partner with anyone else . ",
        "john remus , a senior at iowa state university , explains that also `` you should n't compare yourself to other people . '' john continues , `` i used to compare myself to other guys , and that made me feel really inadequate in my past relationships . '' after all , comparing yourself to other people is n't healthy either and can cause some serious jealous and intimacy issues in your relationship . regardless , your so is a different person and you should love that your bae is different . instead of obsessing over the little things in your relationship , you should learn to enjoy your so 's company - so you can be truly happy in your relationship .
