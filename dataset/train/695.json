        "the convenience store , amazon go , opens monday in seattlerachel leah2018-01-22t17 : 31:04 z • 2018-01-22t17:31:04z • 0 commentsamazon opens its first cashier-less convenience store in seattle monday , in a move potentially revolutionary for tech , automation and business , though possibly devastating for workers . at the new amazon go store , customers can bypass checkout lines , thanks to hundreds of tiny cameras and a computer algorithm that keeps track of every item shoppers grab . the only requirement is to have an amazon account and the amazon go app , which operates via your amazon login . ",
        "as you shop , each item you grab is added to your amazon cart and an amazon receipt gets sent to your phone once you leave the store . the store had already been beta tested by amazon employees , who 've been using it without any reported incidents for months . for those wondering how savvy the system is , a new york times reporter did try shoplifting for the sake of journalism and was unsuccessful . `` with permission from amazon , i tried to trick the store 's camera system by wrapping a shopping bag around a $ 4.35 four-pack of vanilla soda while it was still on a shelf , tucking it under my arm and walking out of the store . ",
        "amazon charged me for it , '' times reporter nick wingfield wrote . he also noted that the entrance is like entering a subway station , as gates guard the front door and only those with the app are allowed passage . now , the amazon go store is less like a full , robust supermarket or grocery store than it is a haute convenience store , in terms of what products are available . that 's fine for the moment . but what , other than a faster shopping experience , is at stake here ? the new york times estimates that in 2016 , there were approximately 3.5 million cashiers , jobs undeniably at risk if the systems amazon go represents succeed and spread . ",
        "it should be noted that amazon go is n't completely employee-free . there are real people who restock shelves , assist with technical problems , help customers locate items and checks i. d. 's in the wine and beer section . still , it 's unclear whether those jobs are equal in pay and number to the millions of cashier jobs the retail industry currently supports . at this time , amazon has n't yet announced whether this seattle store will be a stand-alone project or if the company plans to expand this model to new amazon go stores around the country , or even with its recent acquisition , whole foods .
