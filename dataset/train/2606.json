        "how one revolutionary mixtape changed music . remember the days of making mixtapes for the significant individuals in our lives ? with the rise of streaming services , personalized playlists are always appreciated , but there 's something extra special about a freshly burnt cd covered in doodles and a ridiculous title like `` ryman 's awesome summer mix '' . it 's a tradition that 's been lost with shifting technologies . while we all would like to think we are mixtape-making champions , none of us can claim to have produced anything as cool -- or revolutionary -- as paul mccartney 's 1965 custom vinyl mixtape . ",
        "titled unforgettable , mccartney only produced three or four versions of the homemade record , gifting them to his beatles ' bandmates george harrison , john lennon , and ringo starr for christmas that year . the record contains original sketches , avant-garde loops , and sampled songs from artists like elvis presley , the rolling stones , and the beach boys , with mccartney playing host along the way . one of the beatles ' most-rare curios , the experimental compilation has remained an item of mystery , unheard until a 18-minute clip was recently uploaded to youtube . ",
        "`` i had two brenell tape recorders set up at home , on which i made experimental recordings and tape loops , like the ones in tomorrow never knows , '' mccartney said in a 1995 interview for the unreleased beatles : music and film . `` and once i put together something crazy , something left field , just for the other beatles , a fun thing which they could play late in the evening . it was just something for the mates , basically . '' he continued : `` it was called unforgettable and it started with nat ` king ' cole singing unforgettable . ",
        "then i came in over the top as the announcer : ` yes , unforgettable , that 's what you are ! and today in unforgettable ... ' '' describing his experiments as a `` stoned kind of thing '' in an interview with author barry miles in many years from now , mccartney further detailed his growing obsession with creating sound collages popular in the london underground at the time . mccartney went on : `` be playing in the evening ... and there was often quite a bit of time when i was just in the house on my own so i had a lot of time for this . ",
        "i was n't in a routine . i could stay up till three in the morning , sleep through till two in the afternoon , and often did . it was a very free , formless time for me . formative yet formless . i did n't have to be up for the baby , at that time there was none of that . so i would sit around all day , creating little tapes . '' in an 1986 interview with rolling stone , mccartney explained how he once told lennon that he wanted to release an album of tape loops under the title paul mccartney goes too far . ",
        "while lennon supported mccartney 's project , it never saw the light of day . however , mccartney 's new influences were immediately apparent on the beatles ' seventh studio album revolver , especially on the closing track tomorrow never knows . described as the band 's `` greatest leap into the future '' by robert rodriguez in his book revolver : how the beatles reimagined rock 'n' roll -- where he also asserted that the album marked the moment mccartney attained equal creative control with lennon over the band 's musical direction -- the song 's foundation is built from mccartney 's tape loops . ",
        "as barry miles went on to write , revolver was a `` trailblazing '' record that proved rock 'n' roll could function as `` an art form . '' pitchfork noted that it `` redefin what was expected from popular music , '' and rolling stone claimed it `` signaled that in popular music , anything -- any theme , any musical idea -- could now be realized .
