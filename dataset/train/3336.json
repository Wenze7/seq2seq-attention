        "the great irony is this : the schedule had smiled on the 2017 giants . are you kidding ? just get to week 12 , head above water , and this is what they would be looking at : four games to play , three of them in the chilly but comfortably charming confines of metlife stadium . one against the cowboys . one against the eagles . one against the redskins . you could n't dream that up any better if you were the one drawing up the schedule yourself , and if your first goal of the year was to win the nfc east . ",
        "get to december within shouting distance of first place , then let your fans loose on the scoundrels from dallas and philly and d. c . it was , quite literally , a dream scenario . some dream . with dreams like that , who needs nightmares ? instead , this is is what john mara was looking at for the final furlong of his season : a best-case scenario of fans burning their tickets , buying up billboards , flying planes with messages attached to the back , with the added a bonus of an alumni insurrection , ex-players possibly showing up with no . ",
        "10 jerseys , all of this before an empty stadium . a worse-case scenario of those fans keeping their tickets , coming simply to chant for eli manning and slander ben mcadoo . and a worst-case scenario of cowboys fans , eagles fans and redskins fans snapping up all those unused tickets , filling the stadium with their foreign vestments , and turning met life into at&tl incolnfedex field . mara was profoundly shaped by the downtrodden giants of the '60s and '70s , the hapless teams of his childhood and his teen-age and college years when losing was the norm , when entire generations of new york fans adopted the cowboys and the dolphins and the steelers and the raiders . ",
        "those years are never far away from his conscience because he knows , first hand , that sometimes it 's not simply an idle threat when fans talk about fighting back with their voices first , then their wallets , then their loyalties . `` i 've lived through this before , '' he has said hundreds of times , most recently at giants headquarters monday afternoon . he knows what football apocalypse looks like . and wanted no part of it . `` i know how much the fans are suffering , '' mara said , a few hours after dismissing jerry reese as his general manager and ben mcadoo as hiscoach , the first such massive housecleaning since the aftermath of the fumble in 1978 . ",
        "`` believe me , i 'm suffering more . i guarantee it . '' so sensitive is mara to what his customers want , it sure seems by all appearances that eli manning will be back behind center sunday againstthe cowboys , which flies in the face of what he insisted last week , that it was a top-down decision to use the balance of a lost season tosee what 's been hiding behind manning on the depth chart . it 's a significant shift . fans were n't necessarily enraged by the fact of manning being benched , just the tone-deaf way mcadoo went about it -- and the fact that it was geno smith being foisted on them , not davis webb . ",
        "but you can also see , pretty clearly , what the thinking around the giants is now : in for a dime , in for a dollar . mara and steve tisch not only feed their frenzied faithful raw red meat by tossing them the professional carcasses of reese and mcadoo , but they throw in dessert , allowing them at least one more chance to see no . 10 fully restored behind center -- against the detested cowboys , no less . `` after all this losing , i 'm focused on winning games , '' mara said , adding for emphasis : `` i wo n't put up with any talk about tanking . '' ",
        "that , of course , is also sure to create a reaction among fans who , in putting up with this grisly 2-10 start to the season , also saw the giants leap-frog the 49ers by losing to the raiders sunday and figure a high draft pick would be an acceptable consolation prize for an unwatchable football season . not that it really matters . eli may be the people 's choice but it 's not like the giants ' offense looked significantly worse in smith 's hands in oakland than it did in manning 's for the 11 weeks prior . ",
        "`` it was n't any one final straw , '' mara said of monday 's reckoning . `` where we are as a franchise right now we were spiraling out of control . we need a complete overhaul . '' and they will get one , a new gm , a new coach , a fresh start to erase the sting of this season , of the mcadoo era , of the last half of reese 's reign that featured too many empty drafts and too many short rosters , wasting the bulk of manning 's prime . the fans get what they want , and mara gets what he wants , something to camouflage the chaos that 's co-opted his franchise . ",
        "he -- and you -- should be less concerned about re-establishing the `` giants way '' that has always been far more fable than fact . those 18 playoff-free years connecting 1963 and 1981 that so shaped the sensibilities of the giants ' president ? there was plenty of slapstick and dysfunction to go around in those days , too . that did n't end by recommitting to some ethereal `` way ; '' -- it ended when mara 's father and uncle hired a gm named young and a coach named parcells with the goods to make their own way . ",
        "that 's the mission for mara and tisch now . they may have avoided an east rutherford revolution on monday . starting tuesday comes the tricky part .   "
