        "blizzard has been on a hiring spree since as early as last summer for an unannounced first-person shooter project . several job listings popped up back in june for the unannounced shooter , in development at blizzard 's hq in irvine . blizzard has obviously not talked publicly about this project , but a new job ad was recently spotted by resetera . the ad is for a software engineer who will specifically be working on vehicle gameplay . the candidate would help create vehicles , set handling features and so on , and blizzard wants someone with experience in the field . ",
        "the job ad mentions the unannounced first-person project several times , but that 's kind of about it . still , it 's very exciting news for blizzard fans as the project seems big . a first-person shooter with vehicles made by blizzard could shake up the sub-genre dominated by battlefield and halo for years . that said , it sounds like it 's a ways out , and given how blizzard typically takes its time working on games , it may be a while yet before we find out what it is .
