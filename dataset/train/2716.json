        "i am not a gun owner , and have only shot a gun a handful of times . i do not come from a `` gun family '' , or even a close group of friends who are gun enthusiasts . i believe we talk about gun control only because we are too proud to admit we do n't currently have a root cause fix . a common engineering tool to identify a root cause is called `` 5 whys '' , which is a process of asking why and repeating for each subsequent answer . i like using this technique for subjects outside of engineering problems . ",
        "why do we need guns ? why do we need `` freedom '' ? why do we need relationships ? why do we need 1 star hotels or 5 star hotels ? why do we need country music ? why do we need rap music ? why do we need fast food ? why do we need fine dining ? what questions like these demonstrate to me , is that there are two categories of `` need '' . this is what the founding fathers of the united states realized , but may have lacked a complete understanding of and/or an imperfect ability to communicate to future generations . ",
        "there are unalienable rights , what i would prefer to call universal rights . certain things which are universally sought after , and the foundation to the human experience . things like `` freedom '' , nutrition , shelter , information availability , and human relationship . we are slowly learning to understand what these are over time , and time is the only solution to our understanding of our universal rights . on the other hand , there are needs and wants , which for some reason are not universally sought and agreed on . these are things like cell phones , hotels , music , and guns . ",
        "these needs and wants are defined by our societies depending on the societal pressures and circumstances . they are relative , and while some people tend to desire the status quo , others desire different . one could dive down the rabbit hole of why this is , which is a perfectly valid search in my opinion , or we can simply acknowledge that human differences are the reality in which we live . it is however , these differences which are the triggers for human conflict . whether on the micro scale , such as one on one arguments , or on the macro scale through war , mutiny , and revolution . ",
        "if we ask why this is , we inevitably come to control . a person or group attempts to control another person or group to force or restrict something which is of value or conflicting to one 's ideology . however , the more you attempt to control someone and pull them closer , like a suffocating dog they will squirm until they are eventually let free . control breeds conflict , while understanding and positive solutions enable society to thrive . why have i written this long explanation ? of course it is due to the recent las vegas shooting , and the once again , public arguing over how to solve this problem . ",
        "unfortunately , almost universally , i have seen only one major discussion point , guns . one group `` does n't get it '' and wants to control gun ownership , some calling for a `` complete ban '' , some calling for restricting what types of guns or accessories , and others calling for more restrictions on who and how these guns and accessories can be acquired . than you have another group , who believes it is their `` unalienable right '' to own a gun because some guys wrote it on a piece of paper a few hundred years ago , or due to some macho vision of taking down the us military with a couple rifles . ",
        "the bill of rights and the united states constitution are among some of the most brilliant documents in history and positively shaped the entire world we live in today . however , the right for humans to own guns is false . it is not some part of the human spirit which must have guns . we are not born yearning for guns . society has shaped the view that it is a `` right '' . it is not a universal right . it is important to understand this , because attempting to control a human 's access to their needs and wants leads to division and conflict . ",
        "however , history repeats itself , it literally always has , and we would be foolish to believe it wo n't again . we are demonstrating the same exact cycle , and the only attempt to stop this cycle ... is to use the same tactic in which defines the cycle , control . gun supporters are right ... guns do not kill people . the only capacity for a gun to end a human life is through human action . to a certain extent , they are also right , take away the guns , people will find other ways of ending human life . ",
        "i do n't believe anyone thinks murder entered the world when guns were created . but for now , the gun , is the easiest way for a single human , or small group , to end human life . but that 's not that point , what i 'm concerned with again is , `` why , are they ending human life ? '' a quick aside . please , please , please , if you want to attempt to place controls on something or someone , have a complete understanding of what you are attempting to control . ",
        "it will be impossible for us to move forward in the right direction when you have congressman addressing `` suppressors '' as `` silencers '' , or news anchors calling `` semi-automatic assault rifles '' , `` automatic machine guns '' . when a knowledgeable person , especially in a passionate hobby or field of study , hears another individual use the wrong terminology they instantly will assume the other does not know what they are talking about , and thus has no authority to control or even recommend . this only makes the discussion more confusing for interested parties , and avoids the real question ... '' why ? '' ",
        "why do humans end other human life ? that question is far too broad for this medium , so let me rephrase to fit this context . `` why would a single human being , decide to end one or multiple human beings life in an intimate form ? '' there is something intimate about pre-meditated mass shootings . there is a big difference in emotion and human connection between a commander ordering a war ship to strike the enemy , and an individual opening fire , detonating a bomb , or driving a vehicle through a crowd . there is however , a direct correlation between mass killings and poverty induced gang violence . ",
        "that of human happiness and connection . sure , banning guns may cut down on the headcount . banning guns may even cut down on the number of incidents due to it being more difficult to carry out some fantasy of home bomb creation or other method of death . however , attempting to increase controls on guns only addresses the symptoms , and cuts a divide deeper within our country . those are symptoms of the greater question of what would drive a human to carry out an attack in the first place . how are we not focused on this question ? ",
        "i am not sure if it is a societal mindset , a human weakness , or another factor , but symptom curing is evident in most `` solutions '' found in human history . i believe it is simply laziness . it is much easier to fix symptoms , because they are direct and apparent . have a headache , take a pain reliever . gotten too far into debt , file bankruptcy and try again . depressed , take this pill . person robbed a convenience store , lock him up . crazy person shot up a crowd , ban the guns . ",
        "no one is attempting to solve , why do you have a headache , why are you so far in debt , why are they depressed , why did the criminal rob the store , and why did the person decide it was in his best interest to end innocent human life . it is pure laziness to chalk this up to `` it 's just people , nothing can be done '' . we know depression and suicide rates are on the rise . we know mass murder is on the rise . is anyone noticing the warning signs of a society which is continuing to demonstrate symptoms of being unhappy ? ",
        "this is where the conversation usually ends though . `` it 's mental health , lets increase availability of mental health care '' . that is not enough . i am deeply concerned about a society in which depression and anxiety is on the rise , ratings of personal human connection are decreasing , and overall life happiness is decreasing . all of this , while on the surface , the human experience is better . why , is our mental health declining ? we could ban the guns , but we still have people who are deeply depressed or otherwise so disconnected from our reality that they would conceive an attack . ",
        "we could `` increase availability of mental health access '' , but we would still have the societal inputs which caused one 's mental stability to decrease . my final `` why '' ... why is our current way of life causing an increase in occurrence of depression and disconnection from society in tandem with an increase in intimate murder ? now , we can discuss how to fix the root cause of the problem . this writing is n't to propose a solution . it is only to help push people to avoid the divisive argument , gain the perspective of the opposing side , understand the real problem , and discuss reasonable root cause solutions . ",
        "we 'd all be better off if we started down the path of asking the right questions about the major problems today instead of focusing on easy to consume talking points , semantics , and control .   "
