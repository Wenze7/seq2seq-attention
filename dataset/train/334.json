        "jawbone loss caused by periodontitis predates the onset of rheumatoid arthritis . this according to research from umeå university in sweden presented in the journal arthritis & rheumatology . the research also shows a causal relationship between jawbone loss and elevated levels of the bone resorption inducing molecule rankl in the blood . jawbone loss caused by inflammation is characteristic to both periodontitis - a disease leading to tooth loss - and rheumatoid arthritis . despite differences in what causes the inflammation in periodontitis or rheumatoid arthritis , it has now been established that there is a correlation between the two . ",
        "`` for example , it 's known that individuals with rheumatoid arthritis to a great extent show symptoms of tooth loss than individuals with healthy joints . it 's also been known that treatments aimed at periodontitis also ease symptoms from joints in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis . what 's not been proven so far , however , is a causal relationship between the two , '' says pernilla lundberg , senior lecturer at the department of odontology at umeå university , and one of the researchers behind the study . in a collaboration , pernilla lundberg and solbritt rantapää-dahlqvist , who is a researcher at the department of public health and clinical medicine at umeå university , have analysed the prevalence of jawbone loss in dental x-rays of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis . ",
        "the x-rays were performed before arthritis symptoms had developed , and were compared with x-rays from matching controls . all participants in the study had on numerous occasions donated blood to the medical biobank northern sweden health and disease study . dental x-rays had been retrieved from the treating dentists . the results , now presented in the journal arthritis & rheumatology , show for the first time that the individuals who later develop rheumatoid arthritis to a greater degree show signs of jawbone loss . individuals with rheumatoid arthritis also to a greater extent develop jawbone loss over time . ",
        "among the individuals who later developed rheumatoid arthritis , the greatest degree of bone loss was detected in individuals who also showed elevated levels of the bone resorption inducing molecule rankl in the blood . `` as far as we know , no one has previously been able to show that individuals who later develop rheumatoid arthritis have a higher degree of jawbone loss before showing any symptoms of arthritis , '' says solbritt rantapää-dahlqvist . `` our results indicate a causal relationship between periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis . nevertheless , further clinical studies and studies on basic mechanisms are needed in order to prove the existence of a causal relationship with certainty .
