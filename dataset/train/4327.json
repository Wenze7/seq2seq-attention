        "following monday 's false dawn britain , the eu and ireland have finally reached a deal on brexit , meaning talks can now move onto phase two . talks ran through the night between uk prime minister theresa may , leader of the dup -- northern ireland 's biggest party -- arlene foster , european commission president jean-claude juncker and irish leader leo varadkar . tensions between the leaders had reached fever pitch during the week as the heads of state fought their country 's corner . however , by friday morning it was announced that marathon all-night talks had culminated in an initial plan on which everyone agreed . ",
        "here rt breaks down the key points of that agreement : . ireland gets to keep its soft border . the irish government was unhappy with the language in the initial proposal from the uk on the border between northern ireland and the republic . earlier in the week taoiseach varadkar , even threatened to delay negotiations until the new year if a deal could n't be brokered . determined to move on to phase two of negotiations before the christmas break , the group worked through the night to come up with a new agreement that varadkar called `` cast iron '' and `` bulletproof . '' ",
        "all other issues are to be ironed out in phase two but , if those negotiations break down , there is now a clear default or insurance policy that guarantees there will be no customs or trade barriers between the republic of ireland and the uk . citizens get to keep their rights . as per the agreement , the more than 3 million eu citizens living and working in the uk will continue to enjoy the current freedom of movement principals . the guarantee also applies to british citizens living in other parts of the eu . crucially , everyone born in northern ireland will still retain eu and british citizenship . ",
        "the european court of justice will continue overseeing the rights of eu citizens in the uk for eight years after their withdrawal . in his press conference friday varadkar told unionists in northern ireland : `` we want to build bridges , not borders , '' and to nationalists : `` your birthright as an irish citizen is protected . '' common travel area . under friday 's 11th hour deal citizens on the island of ireland will continue to move freely between the north and republic . this had been a major concern for business people , and the thousands who live and work either side of the border . ",
        "going forward . talks will now turn to the transition period . the uk has asked for a two-year implementation period from the exit date , bringing the cut-off point to march 2021 , in which they would remain in the single market and customs union -- the terms of just how involved britain will be in the eu during that period has yet to be determined . britain and the eu will also have to decipher what their relationship will look like post-divorce , specifically if and how the two will fight issues such terrorism and international crime together . ",
        "`` we all know that breaking up is hard . but breaking up and building a new relation is much harder , '' said president of the european council donald tusk , harking back to neil sadaka 's 1975 hit . `` since the brexit referendum , a year and a half has passed . so much time has been devoted to the easier part of the task . and now , to negotiate a transition arrangement and the framework for our future relationship , we have de facto less than a year . '' given that this so-called `` easier part '' of the negotiations was far from plain sailing , the transition talks look likely to be particularly arduous . ",
        "for his part varadkar had one final message for citizens of northern ireland . `` there will be no hard border on our island . you will never again be left behind by an irish government . ''   "
