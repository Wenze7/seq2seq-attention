        "on the heels of the bombshell espn report that painted an internal power struggle between the new england patriots ' `` big 3 '' of quarterback tom brady , head coach bill belichick and team owner robert kraft , brady is dealing with a new distraction ahead of the club 's saturday playoff game . on thursday in his weekly meeting with reporters , brady declined to get into the specifics of a new documentary on the five-time super bowl champion quarterback 's life called `` tom vs. time . '' the movie is set to be released in late january . ",
        "some criticism arose of the timing of brady 's documentary with the patriots set to host the tennessee titans in the afc divisional playoffs saturday night in foxborough , mass. . a trailer promoting the movie came out earlier this week . `` that 's a good question , '' brady said when asked about why he commissioned the documentary and what he hopes viewers will get from it . `` this is about tennessee . we 're two days from the biggest game of the year . `` when pressed further on the issue , brady said , `` we 'll see . ",
        "we 'll see after the tennessee game . `` brady also commented on how the patriots have been able to tune out the noise created by stories such as the espn report that suggested this could be the final year together for the him , belichick and kraft . `` we do what we always do . we show up to work and try to do the best we can do , '' brady said . `` we know there 's a lot at stake and i think everyone 's put a lot into it . it does n't really matter what happened outside of this facility and what we 're trying to accomplish . ",
        "`` it 's a big task to go out and win a playoff game . we 're playing against a good team , divisional round , and i 'm glad we earned the chance to be here to do it , and we 've just got to go take care of business . `` the documentary was directed by filmmaker gotham chopra and will be released on facebook 's own video service called facebook watch . -- field level media .
