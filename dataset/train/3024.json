        "vladimir putin praises trump quite often , whether you like it or not . just days after returning from syria where he declared `` victory '' for russian forces in aid of bashar al-assad , russian president vladimir putin held a four-hour-long annual press conference on thursday . unsurprisingly , putin had a lot of good things to say about the us president donald trump . the two call each other by their first names , according to putin . the russian president also dismissed the allegations of links between the kremlin and donald trump . image source : youtube video screenshotvladimir putin praises trump : ` look at the us stock market ` putin told media that the allegations of collusion between the kremlin and trump 's election campaign were `` invented '' by the us president 's opponents . ",
        "talking about trump 's presidency , putin said he was `` not the one to evaluate '' the us president 's work . that 's up to the american people . but trump has `` some quite serious achievements , even in the short period of time he 's been working , '' added putin . the us stocks have soared under trump 's presidency . `` that shows investors ' confidence in the american economy , it shows they believe in what president trump is doing , '' said the russian president . trump has also pointed to the rising us stocks as proof that his agenda was working . ",
        "putin added that there are a few things such as reforming the us healthcare system that trump had been unable to achieve because of domestic opposition . putin said thursday that the us was gripped by a fabricated `` spy-mania '' created by trump 's opponents . accusations of links between members of president trump 's administration and russia were `` all invented by people who are in opposition to trump in order to make his work look illegitimate , '' said vladimir putin . he called these accusations `` very bizarre . '' those behind such allegations were trying to `` impede '' trump 's agenda . ",
        "in fact , they were damaging the american political system by not respecting voters who chose the president . a number of contacts between russia and donald trump 's election campaign surfaced during robert mueller 's investigation into the russian meddling in the last year 's us presidential election . it 's not that only vladimir putin praises trump all the time . the us president has also praised his russian counterpart on many occasions . we would n't be surprised if putin praises trump again publicly sometime soon . it 's pretty common for governments to meet foreign candidatesputin said it was a `` common '' practice for governments to meet the overseas representatives and candidates . ",
        "the us congress is investigating the ties between moscow and trump 's election campaign to see if russia indeed influenced the us presidential election . relations between the us and russia were expected to improve after trump 's election , but the ties have hit bottom amid investigations . president trump has denied the allegations on many occasions . vladimir putin hopes the us-russia ties would improve in the future . he said the two countries should `` go forward without trying to be at one another 's throats . '' he also took potshots at the us lawmakers for their handling of international relations . ",
        "the americans put russia in the `` same category alongside iran and north korea . '' and now they want to persuade putin to help resolve the issues with iran and north korea 's nuclear program . vladimir putin seeks re-election as an independent65-year-old putin has also declared that he would run for re-election in march 2018 . if he gets re-elected , which he will because there is no strong opponent , he will become the longest-serving russian leader since the soviet dictator joseph stalin . putin has been in power for 18 years . the re-election would extend it by another six years . ",
        "surprisingly , he announced that he would run as an independent candidate rather than as a candidate of the ruling united russia party . the move makes sense considering putin himself has a much higher support rating than the united russia party . according to levada , the russian president has an approval rating of above 80 % . putin is hoping that `` some popular groups , movements , parties '' would support him . he began thursday 's conference by pledging to improve the incomes of the russian people . he assured his countrymen that the russian economy had recovered from the worst recession in years caused by western sanctions and falling oil prices . ",
        "putin said domestic issues such as infrastructure , health , and education would be his biggest electoral priorities . not my duty to create opponentsputin has no strong opponents to make the 2018 election interesting . when reporters asked him whether it was `` boring '' not to have any real opponent in the upcoming elections , putin said it was not his responsibility to create an opposition . however , he believes that the country 's electoral system `` should be competitive . '' putin said the lack of opponents was due to the economic improvements under his tenure . ",
        "noted anti-corruption crusader alexei navalny has announced that he would run for the presidency . navalny has been jailed many times in the last few years for organizing protest rallies . without directly mentioning alexei navalny , putin said the kremlin would not allow opponents to create instability . the post vladimir putin heaps praise on donald trump , lashes out at the us spy-mania appeared first on valuewalk .
