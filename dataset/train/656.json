        "there was a prevailing belief in the first years of the syrian war that the sides would exhaust each other , apparently beneficially , and that the assad regime would emerge from the fight weakened . in fact , syrian dictator bashar assad , to prevent the collapse of his regime and to protect himself from international courts tied his fate to the rogue iranian state . now , seven years later , many seem certain that assad and his iranian allies control the war and are steering it to achieve their long-term goals . indeed , they have imposed this asymmetrical war on the syrian people , and determined the time and place to instigate it , after preparing for it for many years in the military , security , economic , political , diplomatic and communications arenas . ",
        "now the mullahs are using the lessons learned from eight years of fighting iraq , and have decided not to fight a state-tostate war with iran 's regular army , and not to allow the fighting to start on iran 's borders . iran has instead opted for infiltration , the creation of division and sectarianism , undermining the status quo in arab countries by pumping in money and weapons to fight arabs with arab youths on arab soil -- and even worse is that they are mobilizing the survivors to fight against their enemies to fulfill their historic nationalist dream . ",
        "although the theocratic state seeks to eventually dominate the wealthy gulf states , it does not dare attack saudi arabia directly because it is home to the two holy mosques , which are close to the hearts of 1.5 billion muslims -- the same hearts the iranians would like to win over to shi'ism . naturally , the shortest and easiest way to these hearts and minds is through the removal of israel and the liberation of jerusalem . therefore , we find that they are fully immersed in preparation for that battle . it is certain that iran has many effective and active plans to use against israel , but i will mention just mention one of them , one which can be neutralized relatively easily in comparison to its danger : regardless of how things transpired at the start of the revolution , and who is to blame for the way it turned out , shaping the way we see it today , it is clear that the regime has managed to transform a conflict of loyalists vs opposition into a sectarian struggle . ",
        "this can be seen clearly in the area surrounding mount hermon , a patchwork of sunni , druse and christian villages , and in particular along the southern slopes of the mountain . beit jinn sits in the mountain passageway connecting syria , lebanon and israel , and together with five villages and their farms has suffered under a regime-imposed siege for four years . however , recently the regime managed to coerce three of the villages into normalization and incorporation into the iranian-financed fawj al-hermon , ** as a precondition to the lifting of the siege to avoid famine this winter . ",
        "previous experience has established that by means of inciting events in the ranks of the syrian druse , the assad regime can incite a significant part of the druse sect in israel and consequently create internal confusion that could lead to a headache for the israeli home front . in addition , pro-assad media spreads fear by portraying israel as a supporter of jabhat al-nusra , as part of a grand conspiracy against syrian stability and resolve . for instance , in the summer of 2015 , syrian intelligence leaked to the druse of majdal shams that nusra agents were being transferred for treatment in israel . ",
        "subsequently , several druse youths attacked an israeli military ambulance with two syrians in it near majdal shams , killing one of the wounded passengers and severely wounding the other . they even attacked the israeli soldiers driving the ambulance , two of whom were lightly wounded . then , just a few weeks ago , a number of druse sheikhs in israel threatened to take their sons out of the idf and other state institutions in opposition to alleged israeli state support of hts `` takfiri '' fighters , and for treating them in israeli hospitals . currently , there are various militias fighting around the beit jinn area . ",
        "the area along israel 's border that has been controlled by the rebels for more than four years has narrowed considerably in the past 100 days , following intense government shelling and a fierce campaign . our battle is against the criminal regime and not against our neighbors ; the rebels are ready to completely hand over the druse shrine of abdullah to druse control , in order to take it out of the arena of battle . i can assure readers that there is no one in beit jinn who wishes to infringe on the shrine of abdullah or any religious symbol of any other sect . ",
        "that said , we would have offered the druse of hader access to this shrine near beit jinn in exchange for free passage of civilians and essential supplies between beit jinn and jubatha al-hashab , which is currently cut off by hader and the pro-assad militias . israel is of course now in a very uncomfortable situation , because iranian - backed militias now control beit jinn as well as the mountain passages linking lebanon , syria and israel . their incursion into the rough terrain of mount hermon constitutes a real threat to israel 's national security . on the other hand , because the druse of southern syria look to these militias for protection , israel would have a difficult time defeating them without also harming the druse of druse mountain , whom israel has vowed to protect . ",
        "so far , israeli humanitarian initiatives have altered stereotypes of israel in the eyes of the syrian citizens revolting for the sake of freedom . israel 's good-neighbor policies have dispersed all the allegations against israel put forward by the syrian media , its educational institutions and even its politicized religious podiums , which have been brainwashing people for generations . however , the recent israeli declaration of commitment to protect the druse population has surprised many , since it comes just as these same druse invite in iranian militias and even rush to join them to protect assad and the iranian project . ",
        "we are increasingly worried that iran will attack a druse holy site and blame it on the rebels of beit jinn , or bomb a school or some civilian gathering in hader or one of the other druse villages in the area , casting the blame on `` israeli - backed '' hts in the iranian media . this will lead to more confusion and a complication of the rebel position to the benefit of iran , which is now very close by , and a policy of complacency and reacting will no longer be useful . the complex regional and international arena adds to the risks and dangers of all options for israel . ",
        "on the other hand , the least dangerous , costly and closest to reality would be if the israeli government were to use its influence to coordinate with reasonable druse sheikhs in israel to implement a non-aggression pact between the druse and sunni villages in the golan , with the supervision and the guarantee of the idf , which is a neutral party able to ensure the success of this endeavor . by neutralizing the threat both to and from within the druse communities of southern syria , israel would be taking a card from the iranian hand . we already have international agreements that can come back into force , or even be modified , to ensure the full implementation of a demilitarized zone under the auspices of the un . ",
        "we , for our part , will likewise ensure that all the military and civilian elements of the opposition in the area fully comply with any agreement , in order to restore tranquility between neighbors and to stop this crazy war which has no benefit for anyone other than iran and its allies , enemies of humanity and civilization . now is the time for israel to take a moral and historic stand , and finally face the syrian tragedy head-on , to help stem this cascade of blood that has been flowing for seven years . the best way to for israel to advance the cause of protecting the honorable druse sect is to rescue them from being mobilized into fantastic iranian wars of domination . ",
        "** translator 's note : though technically part of the syrian regime , not an iranian proxy force , the fawj al-hermon militia receives financing supported through economic ties to iran . aymenn jawad al-tamimi wrote in syria comment that its financing comes from bashar al-assad 's cousin , rami makhlouf , who is a target of eu and us sanctions . issam zeitoun is an independent member of the syrian opposition , based in germany . translated by dr. joel d. parker is a researcher at the moshe dayan center for middle eastern and african studies at tel aviv university .
