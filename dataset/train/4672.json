        "a popular police recruitment video has received a complaint for showing a vehicle parked on a footpath . a lobby group for pedestrians , living streets aotearoa , said there were two instances in the video where a vehicle can be seen parked on a footpath - in one case forcing a pedestrian to walk onto the road to get around it . the group complained to the advertising standards authority which ruled the complaint did not have the necessary grounds to proceed . but it is the second complaint the police recruitment video has received - some members of the sikh community took offence that police faked the appearance of a sikh officer . ",
        "it was in fact a samoan wearing a turban . read more : * police release ` world 's most entertaining recruitment video ' - and it 's pretty good andy smith , the president of living streets aotearoa , said parking cars to block footpaths should not be promoted in any advertisement . `` this is the problem , the people who own cars think they can park on the footpath , '' said smith . `` give footpaths back to those who walk , run , wheelchair and push babies . '' but the asa ruled : `` the advertisement was not promoting parking on a footpath as an appropriate behaviour and it was unlikely to encourage a disregard for safety . ",
        "the advertisement did not reach the threshold to breach the code of ethics . '' however in the case of the fake sikh officer , a member of the sikh community told police they `` violated tradition '' when they used the samoan officer decked out in a turban . constable heber gasu , the officer featured wearing a badly wrapped turban , is seen running through a container yard during the video . a spokesperson of the nz police has since responded to the individual who laid that complaint .
