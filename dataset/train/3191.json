        "bill skarsgard scared the living bejeezus out of all of us when he played pennywise the clown in new line 's `` it '' last year -- and now , the actor says the iconic character haunted his dreams well after shooting . `` i liken every character that i do to a relationship that you 're in , '' skarsg√•rd told entertainment weekly . `` pennywise and bill go into this sort of relationship together , and i 'm trying to figure out who he is and i have to devote so much time and effort to this other person -- or thing , in this case -- and that goes on for months . '' ",
        "he added , `` after we wrapped , i was in my childhood home in sweden , sitting having coffee with my mom at our kitchen table , and realized , ` oh , holy sh -- , i do n't have to deal with this relationship anymore ! ' it was a very quick shift of just feeling better , like , ` oh my god , i 'm relieved that i do n't have to deal with the darkness of the character . ' i likened it to an exorcism -- him exiting my body and getting rid of the pennywise toxins . '' ",
        "but that did n't mean pennywise was done with skarsgard . `` i was home , done with the movie , and i started having very strange and vivid pennywise dreams , '' he said . `` every night , he came and visited . '' and like in the film , pennywise took on different forms , depending on your own personal fear : `` it was in the shape of either me dealing with him , sort of pennywise as a separate entity of me , and then also me as pennywise in circumstances that i did n't appreciate . ",
        "like , i 'm pennywise and i 'm really upset that i 'm out in public and people are looking at me . '' skarsgard will play the evil clown in the upcoming sequel , which will focus on the adult part of stephen king 's famous novel . and skarsgard is `` good with it . ''   "
