        "new york -- already co-writing a political thriller with former president bill clinton , james patterson is now set for a collaboration with the managers of albert einstein 's archives . the best-selling and prolific novelist is developing a series for middle schoolers inspired by einstein 's scientific discoveries . in a licensing deal with the einstein archive , little brown will publish the first of three planned books , currently untitled , next fall . the release will come through the author 's own jimmy patterson children 's imprint . `` i love the idea of introducing einstein and the ideas of science to millions of kids around the world , '' says patterson , sounding childlike himself as he speaks of `` taking this so freaking seriously . ",
        "`` patterson , admittedly still learning when it comes to science , has worked in an innovation of his own . the series ' young protagonist , max einstein , is a girl . `` women are definitely underrated in science and i wanted to address that , '' he told the associated press during a recent telephone interview . little , brown describes max as `` inventive , irreverent , highly imaginative , '' one who `` loves to solve problems in fun , unconventional ways , much like einstein himself . '' `` the high-stakes adventure series follows max and the world 's brightest kids as they travel the globe to solve humanity 's biggest problems with the power of science , '' the publisher announced . ",
        "financial terms for the books were not disclosed . according to little brown , einstein archivists will assist patterson with research and also have input in the manuscripts and artwork . proceeds will be divided among the archive , the publisher and patterson . einstein has inspired fiction before , such as alan lightman 's critically praised `` einstein 's dreams . '' he also was the subject of a best-selling biography by walter isaacson and of numerous biographies for children . officials for the einstein archives , which are based at hebrew university in jerusalem , cite patterson 's enormous popularity and see the new series as an ideal way to expand einstein 's appeal among young people . ",
        "dr. roni grosz , curator of the archives , praised patterson 's ability to keep readers interested . `` you do n't want readers just putting the books down because they 're not interesting enough , '' he told the ap . `` there 's tremendous interest in einstein , but it 's not easy to convey his lessons and his knowledge . these books are one way to package this rather complex information and present it to young readers .
