",
        "`` we are not talking about our grandmas ' pressure cookers here , the ones from decades ago that had a tendency to literally blow up , '' johnson said . these ones , she said , can do much more than grandma 's ever could . they work as a slow cooker , can steam or saut√© food , and significantly cut down cooking time . `` you can do a whole chicken , for example , in about half an hour , '' johnson said . `` dishes with dried beans take about 20 minutes , because the high pressure accelerates softening . '' ",
        "pulled pork or a roast can be ready in a mere 40 minutes and soup stock takes just one hour rather than several , she added . `` there are a lot of people out there who would benefit from one of these units : working parents , busy professionals , university students , or even people who simply do n't like spending a lot of time in the kitchen , '' she said . other gift ideas : sous-vide machines `` it 's a way of cooking in which food is vacuum-sealed in plastic then immersed in a low-temperature water bath for a long period . ",
        "... the beauty of this method is that meat , fish and veggies all end up deeply flavourful , evenly cooked , and tender -- never overcooked . '' spiralizer `` these are the tools that make noodles out of vegetables . you can use produce such as broccoli stalks , carrots , zucchini , cucumbers and sweet potatoes . '' knife sharpener `` there 's nothing worse than a kitchen knife that can barely make it through a cucumber . '' digital thermometer `` i treated myself to one recently and love it . way easier to use and read than my old needle one ! '' ",
