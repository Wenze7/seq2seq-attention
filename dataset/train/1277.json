        "the security situation facing japan is the most perilous since world war two because of north korea 's `` unacceptable '' provocations , prime minister shinzo abe said on thursday and he vowed to bolster defenses to protect the japanese people . tension in the region has been rising , particularly since north korea conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test in september , and then in november , said it had successfully tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach all of the u. s. mainland . `` it is not an exaggeration to say that the security environment surrounding japan is at its severest since world war two . ",
        "i will protect the people 's lives and peaceful living in any situation , '' abe told a new year news conference . abe said japan would take new steps to strengthen its defense posture but he did not go to specifics . the government approved a record military budget last month , with defense outlays due to rise for a sixth year , increasing by 1.3 percent to 5.19 trillion yen , with the biggest item 137 billion yen in reinforcing defenses against north korean ballistic missiles . the u. s. ambassador to the united nations , nikki haley , said this week the united states was hearing reports that north korea might be preparing to fire another missile , and she warned it not to . ",
        "`` it is absolutely unacceptable that north korea is trampling the strong desire of japan and the rest of the international community for peaceful resolutions and continuing with its provocative behavior , '' abe said . abe has said he wants to amend japan 's pacifist constitution with the aim of loosening constraints on the military , although the public is divided over changes to the charter imposed after japan 's world war two defeat . war-renouncing article 9 of the constitution , if read literally , bans the existence of standing armed forces , but has long been interpreted to allow a military for exclusively defensive purposes . ",
        "abe said he wanted more debate on the issue . `` i would like this to be a year in which public debate over a constitutional revision will be deepened further , '' he said . abe 's liberal democratic party-led coalition retained its two-thirds `` super majority '' in parliament 's lower house in an oct. . 22 election , re-energizing his push to revise the constitution .
