        "orchard parkrichie incognito is so accustomed to people counting out the bills this season , the veteran guard is n't fazed by questions regarding injured running back lesean mccoy 's uncertain status for buffalo 's afc wild-card playoff game at jacksonville on sunday . in a year buffalo has overcome various obstacles -- a snowstorm , roster purge and a four-way playoff tiebreaker -- to snap a 17-season postseason drought , what 's one more hurdle , the 11-year veteran wondered . `` this team thrives off adversity . it thrives off negative situations . it thrives off everyone picking against us . ",
        "so we have everything going our way , '' incognito said wednesday . `` people are picking against us . we 're missing a couple of guys . so i like our chances . `` mccoy 's status is up in the air after the bills ' top offensive threat missed practice because of an injured right ankle . he was carted off the field after being hurt on the opening drive of buffalo 's 22-16 win over miami on sunday . coach sean mcdermott would only say medical tests were negative and listed mccoy as day to day . ",
        "mcdermott declined to speculate whether mccoy will be able to practice at all this week . mccoy was initially scheduled to address reporters following practice , but was not made available because team officials said he was still being treated by trainers during the period designated for interviews . mccoy 's value to the bills is difficult to underestimate in a season the 29-year-old became the nfl 's 30th player to top 10,000 career yards rushing . the ninth-year player leads buffalo with 1,138 yards rushing , 59 catches and eight touchdowns , including two receiving . overall , his 1,586 yards from scrimmage account for 33 percent of the bills ' total . ",
        "in finishing 9-7 , the bills were 8-2 when topping 100 yards rushing . `` of course , shady is a special playmaker . you miss him when he 's not out there , '' quarterback tyrod taylor said , referring to mccoy , who 's nicknamed `` shady . '' `` but at the same time , you ca n't use it as an excuse . we have to go out there and make plays , myself , the receivers , '' he added . `` we 'll pick him up if he 's not out there . `` buffalo lacks depth at the position a week after backup travaris cadet broke his ankle . ",
        "that leaves mike tolbert and marcus murphy as the only running backs on the roster , along with fullback patrick dimarco . murphy was promoted off the practice squad last week and led buffalo with 41 yards rushing , while adding two catches for seven yards against miami . murphy had one career carry for no gain during his previous two seasons with new orleans . he understands he alone ca n't replace mccoy . `` i really do n't think about it like that . i know i have a role in this offense just like everyone else , '' murphy said . ",
        "`` i ca n't be shady . `` the bills have persevered with a next-man up approach in a season in which they traded three starters , including receiver sammy watkins to the los angeles rams in august and defensive tackle marcell dareus to jacksonville in october . despite a roster that closed the regular season with just 20 returning players , buffalo clinched the afc 's sixth and final playoff berth by beating miami . the bills then got help when baltimore gave up a last-minute touchdown on fourth-and-12 in a 31-27 loss to cincinnati . that left buffalo in a four-way tie , and it inched ahead of baltimore based on having a better strength of victory percentage . ",
        "the bills were 2-4 against playoff-bound teams , while baltimore went 0-5 .   "
