        "in an extreme oled burn-in test , the iphone x showed another aspect of superiority over the galaxy note 8 . oled screens look amazing on smartphones , but they come with the risk of suffering from burn-in , or the appearance of images that are left behind on the display even if it is turned off . apple 's iphone x and samsung 's galaxy note 8 and galaxy s7 edge are examples of recently released smartphones that feature oled screens . iphone x wins in extreme oled burn-in testan extreme oled burn-in test , performed by south korean tech website and marketplace cetizen , subjected the iphone x , the galaxy note 8 , and the galaxy s7 edge to 510 hours of showing a static image on the screen at full brightness . ",
        "at the start , the iphone x appeared to fall behind , as the smartphone already started showing faint signs of burn-in after only 17 hours . however , it was not too bad to be noticed by users with regular use . more importantly , the burn-in never got worse after that point . it took the galaxy note 8 more time to show signs of burn-in . however , at the 62-hour mark , the smartphone 's display exhibited a burn-in that can be identified by a general user . by the end of the 510-hour test , the galaxy note 8 performed the worst among the three smartphones . ",
        "the galaxy s7 edge , meanwhile , performed better than the galaxy note 8 , but not as well as the iphone x . the galaxy s7 edge display did not look as bad as that of the galaxy note 8 after the test , but the burn-in was more evident compared to the iphone x. apple burn-in prevention measures workedapple knew about the burn-in risk when it used oled screens for the iphone x , and the company designed the hardware and software of the smartphone to try to reduce the chances of such a thing from happening . ",
        "from the results of cetizen 's test , it would appear that apple 's work to address the burn-in issue has paid off . the likelihood that anyone would have his or her iphone x at full brightness displaying a single image for 510 hours is rather slim , but it is good to know that apple thought about the potential problem . however , users should note that while the iphone x performed the best among the three smartphones in the extreme oled burn-in test , the galaxy note 8 and the galaxy s7 edge did not do poorly . ",
        "customers thinking of buying these smartphones will not likely have to worry about burn-in issues on their smartphones , though the same could not be said for the google pixel 2 xl .   "
