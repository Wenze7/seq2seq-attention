        "your letters to the national newspaper of walesin london there would be an outcryone of the glories of south wales is its well-used bus stations . they enable people to gain access to services such as hospitals etc. . and all this is denied to the people of our capital city . if there was a plan to demolish victoria coach station , london , and replace it with two blocks , there would be an outcry . for these stations do subserve a need which is in human terms , irreplaceable . in particular the elderly and physically disadvantaged benefit from services which enable them to socialise and stay mobile . ",
        "all of this is lost in cardiff - where travellers are obliged to tramp looking for where buses terminate . all i can say for those who inhabit the new blocks is that one day you will be glad of a local bus station . for we all grow old and lose our mobility and that is when we will lament the loss of our bus station . iain colquhounkillay , swansea100 years since we were able to votewell , here we are in 2018 . and , of course we are already well aware it is the year we mark the end of the world war one .

        "not so many would know 2018 marks yet another significant centenary that deserves to be celebrated . it marks 100 years since women in britain were able to vote in democratic elections for the first time . that vote for women marked a watershed . yes , there were conditions . women had to be 30 years of age to men 's 21 and there were various qualifications . many women saw it as a betrayal . but the world would never be the same again . it was a watershed from which the rights to equal votes , equal education , equal careers , equal pay , began to flow in a process that still continues today . ",
        "the year 2018 also marks the 20th anniversary of a group determined the achievements of women should be recognised and recorded . as women were , traditionally , hidden in society , so were they , too , in history . the women who founded women 's archive wales were dedicated to changing that . the foundations lay back in the 1970s/80s , when various women historians began the major task of dredging out the part played by women in significant community events . in 2018 they came together to form the archive , a group that was instrumental in changing the face of history by securing the story of women , long a neglected , often despised , study , into the established academic discipline it is today . ",
        "the archive promotes the recognition of women welsh history . its aim is to collect , record and conserve evidence for the lives of women in wales , their history and their contributions to society . the evidence for the campaigners of greenham common , which started with a march from wales , is safely kept by the archive . recently the archive has had generous support from the heritage lottery fund to collect safeguard the memories of women who worked in welsh factories between 1945 and 1975 -- women who made a substantial contribution to the economy of the country during those dark years . ",
        "and in 2018 it will be celebrating the centenary of the first time women in britain could vote in a democratic election . to keep up with archive events , you can visit its website at not that the archive wo n't be happy to celebrate the end of world war one , too -- wonder what women were doing thenabouts ... jean silvan evanspeterston-super-ely , vale of glamorganthis could be the best of both worldsthe negotiations between angela merkle 's centre-right christian democrats and martin schulz 's social democratic party could lead to a german version of new labour , or the less successful 2010-15 coalition government . ",
        "such left-right coalitions can be the best of both worlds . putting left-wing politicians in charge of health and education and right-wing politicians in charge of defence and security , whilst keeping the budget balanced , is something the blair and brown administration mastered and has n't been accomplished since . the `` austerity '' of cameron and osborne has undone much of new labour 's good work , even though there was a lot achieved by consolidating the multiple pieces of legislation from 1997 to 2010 into single acts of parliament . it is unfortunate for theresa may that she had not had the chance to be the liberal that margaret thatcher was , and which angela merkle has had to become .

        "jonathan bishoppontypriddthe welsh language act is a bad lawdennis coughlin is mistaken with regard to what the 2011 welsh language act said about the relative status of welsh and english in wales . he says that he is : `` aware that the english and welsh language should have equal status ... '' what the act actually says is : `` the welsh language should not be treated less favourably than the english language in wales . '' the act also says : `` the measure does not affect the status of the english language in wales . '' in fact these two statements are contradictory . ",
        "a sign which puts english first is treating english more favourably than welsh and is unlawful . similarly english can not be in a larger font size nor more accessible in any way than the welsh version . effectively the 2011 welsh language act is `` bad law '' in that it has a contradiction within it , however , all the political parties of wales support it . if you lived where i live you would have a brand new surgery to visit with the word `` meddygfa '' in silver 18 inch high letters emblazoned down the side . ",
        "the word `` surgery '' is nowhere on the building . if you stepped inside you would see `` derbynfa '' in eight inch high letters with `` reception '' in much smaller letters beneath and , from a distance , you would not be able to read the small , grey , lettering of the english words directing you to treatment rooms but would find the clear white lettering above them in welsh perfectly legible . the law is the law , and although only 15 % of the adult population speak welsh to any level and although 58 % of those people are more comfortable using english , tesco must put welsh first . ",
        "as welsh speakers often like to say : `` get over it . '' j jonesbenllech , ynys monsurprised cannabis is n't on the agendapaul flynn mp is shortly to introduce a bill to enable cannabis to be available on the nhs in england . i am surprised this has n't been on the agenda of wag who are usually keen to be first with similar legislation . should this be passed there would be a knock on effect for the welsh nhs as , no doubt , there would be public demand for same . the only variation being that prescriptions are free in wales . ",
        "i have a feeling that implementation would be open to abuse and put further strain on gps to ensure safe and consistent prescribing . as it will only be a placebo not a cure , maybe in this instance a charge should be made , unless of course wag goes one step further and legalises it , probably beyond their brief at present . windsor daviesblandfordretail closure for peace and decorumremembrance sunday falls exactly on november 11 and exactly 100 years since the guns fell silent in the fields where the poppies grew . there is hence a prima facie case for legislation to provide for retail closure to enable a remembrance sunday of greater peace and dignity - and to enable more working people to be able to partake in the remembrance events in their respective communities . ",
        "mps and peers will gain many plaudits were they to put party divisions aside and come together in unity namely to pass legislation to enable a remembrance sunday of greater peace and decorum for all in 2018 . john barstowmember , usdaw executive council , pulborough , west sussex .   "
