        "in the drive to make test cricket more relevant , and by extension attractive , one word has been used more than any other : context . it is the factor that gives cricket meaning beyond merely playing for the sake of playing , and it is the basis on which all good decisions in any sphere of life are made . essentially , context really is everything . so it is refreshing to go into an encounter that is as context-rich as the first test between south africa and india . it is the beginning of a three-match series between the top two teams on the icc rankings , but there is more to it than that . ",
        "there is the backstory , in which south africa are out to `` settle a score '' against the team that ambushed them with `` extreme conditions '' on tour in 2015 , and subsequently relieved them of the no . 1 ranking . india can expect the pitch tactics of 2015 to be used against them this time around . but there is also the context of this indian team and its desire to step out of the common narrative that they can not succeed outside of the subcontinent . they have won nine straight test series now , equaling the world record , but none of those series was played in england , australia or south africa - the three places that india has historically struggled . ",
        "india is still to win a test series in south africa . yet this generation looks the best equipped to break that run . their batsmen have experienced south african conditions before , and have even experienced personal success . more importantly , they have a bowling attack to back them up - something that has been sorely lacking in years gone by . four years ago , india should have won a test at the wanderers , but their bowlers could not close the deal . this crop has the ability to claim 20 wickets in a match , particularly in conditions that will aid the seamers . ",
        "india also have the benefit of starting their tour on the least lively pitch and ending the series on the most lively . newlands has often been a good pitch for batting , while the wanderers - venue for the third test - has seen its last two matches finish inside three days . can the visiting batsmen adapt quickly enough to put the pressure back on the south africans ? the proteas have context of their own . although faf du plessis spoke of the desire to push hard `` for the next three years '' to recover and retain the top ranking , the truth is that south africa 's golden generation will pass on within the next 18 months . ",
        "the next three months , which include this series and then a four-test encounter against australia , present their final spell in which to make a big mark on the game . in some ways south africa has come full circle since the 2015 tour of india . in the past two years they have suffered a high number of injuries , while one of their best batsmen took a year-long sabbatical . not once since 2015 have they been able to put their strongest side on the field . now they have everyone fit , available and refreshed . ",
        "there is a new sense of purpose . on paper , a full-strength south africa should be too good for india in their own conditions . but there is not so much between the two teams as there has been at times in the past . there is not only context around both sides , but heaps of quality within them . the next few weeks , starting at newlands on friday , should be the sort of showcase for test cricket that the game too often yearns for . when : january 5-9 , 10:30 local time ; 14:00 istwhere : newlands , cape townwhat to expect : since encountering what faf du plessis termed `` extreme conditions '' in india in 2015 , south africa have been eager to exact some sort of revenge . ",
        "to that end they will prepare lively pitches for this series , but newlands is likely to be the most balanced of the three venues so far as bat and ball are concerned . there will be some movement at times , but generally a true surface expected with good bounce and carry . or , as du plessis put it , `` nothing extreme '' . day three could experience some light showers but otherwise the forecast is good . team news : south africasuch are south africa 's options that 14 of their 15-man squad have a real chance of selection . ",
        "either they will pick seven batsmen with three seamers and a spinner , or six batsmen , an allrounder , three seamers and a spinner . the latter looks the likeliest option , which means temba bavuma could miss out . dale steyn 's comeback may also have to wait with the selectors yet to be convinced by his ability to get through a whole test . probable xi : dean elgar , aiden markram , hashim amla , ab de villiers , faf du plessis , quinton de kock , vernon philander , chris morris/andile phehlukwayo , keshav maharaj , kagiso rabada , morne morkel . ",
        "indiaall the double sessions in the week gone by meant india decided to rest their collective heels on the day before the test . ravindra jadeja 's illness has virtually eased one selection decision for india . given his good recent form , the green-looking wicket and the fact that it 's the first test of the series , india will use the additional batting insurance that rohit sharma provides at no . 6 . the team management have a call to make on the opening and bowling combinations and on the evidence of wednesday 's training , it would appear that kl rahul and umesh yadav will likely sit the newlands test out . ",
        "probable xi : murali vijay , shikhar dhawan/kl rahul , cheteshwar pujara , virat kohli , ajinkya rahane , rohit sharma , wriddhiman saha , ravichandran ashwin , bhuvneshwar kumar , ishant sharma , mohammed shami . did you know ? - cheteshwar pujara , ajinkya rahane and virat kohli all scored over 200 runs and averaged between 68 and 70 in the two-test tour of south africa in 2013 . that was better than any of south africa 's main batsmen . - in 13 tests at newlands , dale steyn has taken 65 wickets at an average of a shade under 22 . ",
        "his overall record against india is remarkably similar - 13 tests , 63 wickets at 21.4 . in two tests against india at newlands he has 12 wickets at 17 . steyn needs just five wickets to become south africa 's leading wicket-taker in tests . - ishant sharma is india 's most experienced seamer in south african conditions , but his experiences have not been good ones - in five tests on the previous two tours , he claimed just 12 wickets at an average of 54 . what they said : `` i sent the ferrari into the panelbeaters , just to get fixed . ",
        "it was frustrating at times because everything happened slower than i thought it would . it 's 11 weeks now and i feel now like i 'm finally ready to play . '' - faf du plessis talks about his injury layoff , which has kept him out of action since october . `` as of now , the conditions that we found is , we are expecting that it will seam around a bit on day one . but days two and three are going to be very good batting conditions . we 'll take a call tomorrow morning about the extent of moisture in the surface and we 'll take it from there . '' ",
        "- sanjay bangar kept india 's potential ` combinations ' close to his chest , when asked to categorically state if this was a four - or five-bowler kind of wicket .   "
