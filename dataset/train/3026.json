        "detroit -- democratic rep. john conyers resigned from congress on tuesday after a nearly 53-year career , becoming the first capitol hill politician to lose his job in the torrent of sexual misconduct allegations sweeping through the nation 's workplaces . the 88-year-old civil rights leader and longest-serving member of the house announced what he referred to as his `` retirement '' on detroit talk radio , while continuing to deny allegations he groped or sexually harassed women who worked for him . `` my legacy ca n't be compromised or diminished in any way by what we 're going through now , '' said the congressman , who called into the radio show from the hospital where he was taken last week after complaining of lightheadedness . ",
        "`` this , too , shall pass . my legacy will continue through my children . '' he endorsed his son john conyers iii to succeed him . conyers , who was first elected in 1964 and went on to become a founding member in 1971 of the congressional black caucus , easily won re-election last year to his 27th term in the heavily democratic district in and around detroit . but after being publicly accused by one woman after another in recent weeks , he faced growing calls to resign from colleagues in the house , including democratic leader nancy pelosi . ",
        "as the furor grew , he stepped down as the ranking democrat on the house judiciary committee , and the ethics committee began investigating him . democratic rep. jerrold nadler of new york said he was saddened by the resignation of his `` friend and mentor '' but added : `` there can be no tolerance for behavior that subjects women to the kind of conduct that has been alleged . '' it will be up to republican gov. rick snyder to set a date for a special election to pick someone to serve out the remaining year in conyers ' two-year term . ",
        "state sen. ian conyers , a grandson of conyers ' brother , said he plans to run for the seat . on monday , yet another allegation was lodged against conyers , when a woman who said she worked for the congressman for more than a decade , elisa grubbs , said he slid his hand up her skirt and rubbed her thighs while she was sitting next to him in the front row of a church . grubbs also said she repeatedly saw conyers touching and stroking the legs and buttocks of other female staffers . such behavior `` was a regular part of life while working in the office of rep. conyers , '' she said . ",
        "grubbs is the cousin of another accuser , marion brown , who reached a confidential , taxpayer-funded settlement of more than $ 27,000 over allegations conyers sexually harassed her . that settlement came to light in mid-november , setting off the cascade of allegations against the congressman . at least two other women who worked for him have accused him of sexual misconduct . `` this is about much more than one congressman , '' grubbs ' attorney , lisa bloom , said in an email after conyers resigned . `` systemic change is urgently needed so no other women have to endure the retaliation , secrecy and delays my client marion brown and others experienced . '' ",
        "while hollywood and media titans accused of sexual misconduct have been swiftly fired in recent weeks , including studio boss harvey weinstein and tv news hosts matt lauer and charlie rose , that has not been the case in congress , where lawmakers have spoken of due process and have clung to the argument that the voters have the final say . democratic sen. al franken of minnesota , republican rep. blake farenthold of texas and democratic rep. ruben kihuen of nevada have all rebuffed calls for them to step down , though farenthold has said he wo n't seek re-election next year . ",
        "conyers said in a statement read tuesday on the floor of the house by texas democratic rep. sheila jackson lee that he was resigning `` to preserve my legacy and good name . '' he also complained that he was not being afforded due process to defend himself , and cited his health problems as another factor in his decision . he added that he hopes his retirement will be viewed in the `` larger perspective '' of his more than 50 years as a lawmaker . conyers regularly won elections with more than 80 percent of the vote . ",
        "he co-sponsored a 1972 resolution recommending president richard nixon 's impeachment for his conduct of the vietnam war and regularly introduced a bill from 1989 onward to study the harm caused by slavery and the possibility of reparations to the descendants of slaves . after a 15-year struggle , conyers succeeded in establishing the rev. martin luther king jr. 's birthday as a federal holiday in 1986 . he employed civil rights legend rosa parks at his detroit district office for more than two decades . word of conyers ' resignation was met with sadness among house democrats , even though many had called on him to step down . ",
        "the issue had divided members of his party , especially those in the congressional black caucus , and pelosi , too , had struggled , calling conyers an `` icon '' before pressing days later for him to go . the furor over conyers unfolded as the sexual misconduct allegations against franken and alabama senate candidate roy moore sent members of both parties rushing to choose sides . `` i think that we lose our moral authority if we also do n't call out those we love who have done things that are bad , '' said rep. pramila jayapal , d-wash . ",
        "`` i think we have to recognize and be able to hold the dueling possibilities that somebody can be a great man and have done great things for our country and for civil rights but also have done terrible things that require accountability . ''   "
