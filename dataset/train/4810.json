        "china has banned non-bank financial institutions from channelling funds into the property and infrastructure sectors via entrusted loans , closing an important loophole for non-traditional financing . verbal instructions from securities regulators stipulate that new collective asset management plans designed to invest in entrusted loans , trust loans and other credit assets can no longer register , separate sources confirmed with the south china morning post . in addition , the regulations stipulate that existing products wo n't be extended after maturity , while one-on-one amps have to report the specific source of their funds . the verbal instructions are issued by asset management association of china , a self-regulatory association of fund management companies in china , under china securities regulatory commission 's order , sources said . ",
        "the association did not reply to requests for comment . the guidance closely followed a new rule by the china banking regulatory commission designed to curb a popular form of shadow banking activity . entrusted loan , in which a bank acts as an intermediary to arrange and administer financing between a borrower and lender -- is the sole mean for amps to allocate funds to end borrowers , mainly local government financing vehicles and property firms that are restricted from accessing financing via bank loans and bonds . banks are the major investors of amps . but these investment vehicles can also raise funds from other channels , and then invest in what known in china as non-standardised credit assets . ",
        "`` the ban on using funds from the plans from brokers , fund management subsidiaries and private funds for entrusted loans will effectively put an end to the most popular structure for non-standardised credit assets , '' wrote richard xu , a china financial sector analyst with morgan stanley , in a research note . he estimated about 70 per cent of china 's 15 trillion to 20 trillion yuan entrusted loans and trust loans ultimately reached financing vehicles and property firms . china 's ban on entrusted loans to set to end a popular form of shadow financingan earlier rule in december banned trust firms acting as an intermediary to channel funds . ",
        "about 56 per cent of china 's 13.6 trillion yuan trust plans are intermediary business , according to the china trustee association . data from the asset management association of china showed by the end of november , the outstanding value of collective amps managed by securities firms totalled 4.35 trillion yuan , while the value of one-on-one amps exceeded 25 trillion yuan . one-on-one amps can still invest in entrusted loans and non-standardised credit , but they have to report to authorities and make sure the trustees use their own money , sources said . but under heightened pressure , some trust plans have taken pre-emptive compliance measures such as halting all intermediary businesses .
