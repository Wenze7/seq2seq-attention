        "i castrated my cat the other day . well , not me personally . i did n't slip while cutting up his salmon dinner or something grisly like that . no , i paid a vet . he actually came to my home and did it , which was convenient . another wonder of china 's growing online-to-offline industry Ôºç although i do n't think i 'll look at my coffee table in quite the same way again . i did n't have the stomach to stick around and watch the procedure , but i popped home from work to see how he was doing shortly after the op . ",
        "he was groggy , but when he heard my voice he lifted his tiny head and began crawling toward me . it was at this moment i realized i actually had affection for this troublesome ball of fur . billy , the cat , came to live with us the same way as all our pets : without my prior knowledge . i returned home one day to find him curled up on our couch , my wife grinning ear to ear . she 'd been after getting a cat for ages , but i 'd steadfastly refused . they say you 're either a cat person or a dog person . ",
        "my family had always had dogs , and growing up i 'd always hated cats with a passion . looking back , it probably had a lot to do with thomas , a tabby one of my uncles owned . i remember as a teenager him scratching and hissing at me , and generally just giving me the ol' stink eye whenever i was about . `` he was a bully , '' i said while discussing all this with my mother some years ago , long after thomas had gone to that great kitty litter in the sky . ",
        "`` he had it in for me . i could see it in his eyes . '' my mother simply shook her head . `` so you do n't remember swinging him around by his tail when you were about 5 years old then ? '' she asked . i did n't remember , no . ok , so obviously thomas was n't totally to blame for the breakdown in our relationship . still , i was determined not to like billy . my wife grew up in the countryside of eastern china and feels at home with having animals running around the place . ",
        "`` they 're cute , '' she protested after i expressed my ill-feelings for felines . but i 'd seen my friend 's two cats toying with half-dead birds and terrified mice too many times to see them as benign house pets . yet that morning , in his half-awake state , billy won me over . and i suppose it also does n't hurt that his black-and-white pattern makes it look like he 's got a mustache like the great groucho marx . now , the cat and i are inseparable , and most nights you 'll find him perched on my chest , purring away . ",
        "of course , this is not what my wife had had in mind when she agreed to take billy off a friend 's hands . `` how come he always comes to you ? he loves you more , but he 's supposed to be my pet , '' she 'd pout . that was , until the day i came home and was met once again by that familiar grin . `` here , '' she said holding up a new ball of fur . `` meet max .
