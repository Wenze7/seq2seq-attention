        "united nations - the un security council on wednesday gave parties to a peace deal in mali until the end of march to show progress or face sanctions for obstructing the 2015 agreement . the council unanimously adopted a french-drafted statement that `` expressed a shared sense of impatience regarding the persistent delays '' in making the agreement a reality on the ground . council members `` expressed their intention to follow the situation closely and to respond with appropriate steps should the parties not implement the commitments '' by the end of march , the statement warned . islamic extremists linked to al-qaeda took control of the desert north of mali in early 2012 , but were largely driven out in a french-led military operation launched in january 2013 . ",
        "mali 's government signed a peace agreement with coalitions of armed groups in june 2015 to end the fighting , but insurgents remain active , including in central mali . last week , the government and two other armed groups , the plateforme and coordination , agreed to appoint the carter center as an independent observer to push for more progress . the council said there was a `` pressing need to deliver tangible and visible peace dividends to the population in the north and other parts of mali '' ahead of elections scheduled for this year . the statement listed decentralization of authority , disarmament and demobilization , setting up better cooperation mechanisms in the northern towns of kidal and timbuktu and ensuring women 's participation as key areas of focus . ",
        "during a meeting in new york , us ambassador nikki haley on wednesday told malian foreign minister tieman hubert coulibaly that mali had reached `` a pivotal moment . `` implementing the 2015 peace deal and holding successful elections are `` critical to further mali 's political transition , '' said a statement from the us mission . the council in september set up a sanctions regime for mali as fears grew that the peace deal for the west african country was collapsing . large tracts of the country remain lawless as un peacekeepers continue to come under attack . ",
        "during a council meeting on tuesday , french ambassador francois delattre said any side that fails to live up to its commitments under the peace deal should face targeted sanctions . under the sanctions regime , the council has the power to slap a global visa ban and assets freeze on any malian national seen as a hindrance to peace .
