        "when the web was developed over 25 years ago , the technologies in place significantly lowered the cost of building a global company . thanks to the internet , it has become possible to reach a large part of the global population simply from behind your computer . those companies who first understood the power of the web , and managed to execute their vision correctly , are now the leading global monopolies we are so familiar with : we use google for finding information , facebook or wechat for social activities , amazon to shop and apple for our hardware , etc. . ",
        "for years , these companies have understood that data is a goldmine . since their beginning , these companies have rigorously been collecting and storing data , resulting in them not only becoming powerful monopolies but also contributing to a centralisation of the world wide web . this centralisation is in stark contrast to sir tim berners-lee 's vision of a decentralised web in which everybody participates and has full control over their data and the content that they create . content controlled by tech giantsas a result , these companies have become exceptionally influential . they have access to large amounts of data of their customers , which they use and misuse to track customers around the internet , thereby often ignore existing privacy practices . ",
        "these companies use customer data to their liking to earn big revenues through advertising , often without involving or informing the consumer in clear and understandable terms . in fact , 85 percent of online advertising spend goes to google and facebook , according to morgan stanley analyst brian nowak . in addition , in recent years there has been an increase in fake news , clickbait , spam and copyright infringements enabled by these platforms . although they say they are working on solutions , their actions speak differently ; this type of content brings in a lot of advertising revenue . ",
        "besides , having centralised commercial organisations determine what is fake news and what is not , what is good or what is bad , is a very dangerous situation . however , with media attention to these problems growing , people are increasingly becoming aware of the effects that emerging technologies have in the hands of such tech organisations ; there is an increase in low-quality content , but more importantly , genuine content creators are no longer in control regarding distribution and compensation of the content they create . instead , large publishers and distributors own all the rights and the original content creator only gets a small percentage . ",
        "this does not only count for user-generated content , but also large news publishers miss out ; 62 % of americansobtain their news through facebook while publishers on facebook only get paid $ 100 a day . the imagination agethe result is that being creative , whether it is in creating written content , videos , music or other forms of creativity , hardly brings any revenue to creators . apart from a very small niche of online superstars who have made millions . it is a winner takes all concept , leaving the large majority of content creators with empty hands and the revenue owned by said tech giants , distributors or other intermediaries . ",
        "and that is a problem . especially with various reports estimating that 30 -- 50 % of existing jobs will disappear in the coming years due to technology and all those people need a new source of income , which could be through content creation . it is time for change . it is time for the imagination age . the imagination age was first coined by designer and writer charlie magee in 1993 , and it is a theoretical period after the information age when creativity and imagination become the primary drivers of economic value . emerging technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence will play a key role in enabling the imagination age ; not only will they empower content creators and enable them to earn a fair reward instantly , they will also enable creators to develop better content and earn higher revenues . ",
        "artificial intelligence will result in better contentalthough artificial intelligence is increasingly becoming more creative itself and is getting better at creating content , i do n't believe ai will replace content creators anytime soon . instead , i believe artificial intelligence could bring significant benefits to content creators , ranging from creating and finding better content to making more revenue with that content . as such , ai can empower content creators to make them more creative . first of all , ai and machine learning can help content creators create content that better matches with what their audience is looking for , thereby increasing the odds that the content is discovered ; basically matching creativity with demand in the market and removing any guesswork . ",
        "content creators can use ai to understand topic opportunities , to understand what the audience is looking for , discover patterns to learn which topics are becoming trending and matching their content to changing demand . the company brightedge content helps creators understand the characteristics of top content and offers recommendations for improving that content . in addition , platforms such as grammarly help improve your grammar , which makes content more attractive to readers . also , ai can also help content creators get inspiration and help them kick-start the process of creating awesome content . this is especially relevant for written content as it can help writers with a writer 's block . ",
        "the startup articoolo does exactly that and their ai helps writers summarise articles , come up with titles and can even write a complete article based on a few input keywords . it works with ibm 's watson and is effectively an ideation tool , although it is not yet capable of writing articles on any topic that you want . finally , artificial intelligence can help content creators determine the right price for their content . the price elasticity of content depends on a variety of factors , ranging from the quality of the content , the market , the availability of other content , the expertise of the creator and many more variables . ",
        "therefore , determining the right price for content is difficult , but artificial intelligence can help as it incorporates a variety of data sources to determine the best price for the right type of content through the right channel . the right price can be the difference between making money with your content or not . all in all , i believe artificial intelligence can help us become more creative and assist us in creating better content , instead of replacing us when it comes to creativity . the better ai becomes at creating content , the better it will help content creators be creative . ",
        "however , being creative alone is not sufficient for content creators , it is also time that content creators can take control over their work , how and where it is distributed and for how much , which becomes possible when blockchain is brought into the equation . blockchain will give full control to creatorsan important frustration of content creators is the difficulty in protecting your copyright . even this article is likely to appear on other websites apart from linkedin , datafloq or my speaker website , without my permission and without me being able to do anything about it . ",
        "ripping videos off youtube is extremely easy and websites such as the pirate bay continue to exist , thereby damaging those who created the content . however , blockchain offers immutable , verifiable and traceable records . already , it can bring back data ownership to consumers and will do the same for content ownership . recording metadata and copyright information on a blockchain is the first step to put content creators more in control as it establishes undeniably who created what content when . this information can be used to take back control if someone violates your copyright , but it is not yet sufficient to bring back control completely . ",
        "to achieve that , we also need to establish a decentralised infrastructure where content creators know when their content is distributed across the web by whom . if that information is available in real-time , the next step should be to allow content creators to deny the content distribution through certain channels , for whatever reason . this would require an additional layer on the web . a difficult challenge and exactly what we are working on to achieve with my new venture dscvr . it . the final stage of giving back control to creators is real-time payment when content is consumed , directly from consumer to producer , without intermediaries confiscating the revenue . ",
        "multiple blockchain startups are working on this , including akasha , steem . it , decent , synereo and indeed , also we at dscvr . it . it requires a cryptocurrency and real-time payments and distribution of revenues using smart contracts . based on your input , you are rewarded accordingly , instantly . as such , blockchain offers content creators the possibility to take back control and be rewarded fairly and instantly . the convergence of ai and blockchainwhen artificial intelligence and blockchain are combined , it will truly help content creators to be more creative , create better content , take back control and make more revenue instantly . ",
        "a true paradigm shift that enables us to move into the imagination age and limit the powers of current monopolies . however , the convergence of artificial intelligence and blockchain offers an additional advantage . it offers us a chance to combat fake news , clickbait , spam and copyright infringements once and for all . using artificial intelligence and the community to determine the quality of content and detect clickbait , fake news and spam with a blockchain-based content licensing and reputation system will help detect and flag such content . detecting and flagging such content is important in the imagination age ; as raymon kurzweil states in the singularity is near ; when we live in a world where anything can be imagined , imagination only becomes more important . ",
        "however , the same goes for the quality of content . a world revolving around fake news , spam , clickbait and plagiarism is a poor world . if we allow content being controlled as well as monetary rewards being confiscated by a few tech giants , we have done something wrong . therefore , it is time to create a better system , be more creative and reward content creators fairly and instantly . after all , especially in the imagination age where content creation becomes an important driver of economic value , we have a moral obligation to do so .
