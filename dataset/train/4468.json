        "jason greenblatt meets pm netanyahu . jason greenblatt , president donald trump 's chief israeli-palestinian negotiator , has an office just around the corner from the white house . on his computer monitor is a post-it note , inscribed with a quote from former mossad chief tamir pardo : `` at the end of the day , a peace agreement derives its strength from an understanding between peoples , not an accord between governments . '' it 's an appropriate message for greenblatt , an affable orthodox jew who 's been tasked by trump with leading israel and the palestinians toward peaceful pastures . ",
        "given that the lawyer had no prior diplomatic experience , greenblatt was considered an odd choice for the task , according to observers . however , according to interlocutors and veteran israeli-arab negotiators , greenblatt , who is about 50 , has exceeded expectations . many on all sides praise him for his investment in the people affected by the conflict -- especially for his intensive , public engagement with populations largely overlooked by previous negotiators , such as settlers , the haredi orthodox and palestinian refugees . in interviews with more than a dozen people who have met the special representative for international negotiations , one compliment comes up again and again : greenblatt is a good listener . ",
        "and that 's a skill that may be essential to the job . `` greenblatt has made a universally positive impression among israelis and palestinians as serious , creative , empathetic and dedicated to the cause of peace , '' said daniel shapiro , who was the obama administration 's ambassador to israel . `` they see him as possessing goodwill and a sense of realism about what peace looks like . he deserves the praise he has received for building those relationships of trust in a situation when the parties do n't trust each other at all . '' ",
        "greenblatt is one member of a team led by trump 's top adviser , jared kushner , who is married to his daughter , ivanka . the team also includes david friedman , the ambassador to israel , and , until january , dina powell , a top national security council official who is stepping down . both friedman , who also is an orthodox jew , and greenblatt worked for years as lawyers for trump and the trump organization . yet despite all the goodwill toward greenblatt , his seemingly altruistic efforts may wither in absence of an overarching political solution . ",
        "after trump recognized jerusalem as israel 's capital earlier this month , the palestinians have walked away -- at least temporarily -- from an american-led peace push . in addition , while israel applauded the jerusalem recognition , its officials have expressed trepidation at others aspects of the trump administration 's emerging approach . for example , greenblatt has welcomed palestinian authority attempts to assume control of the gaza strip -- but israel 's government is concerned that such control will also increase hamas ' influence . shapiro , who is now a fellow at the institute for national security studies in israel , said that greenblatt `` can only operate within the constraints of the policy he or she is tasked to carry out . '' ",
        "but what the policy is -- and what constraints they come with -- are not very discernible under the current administration . `` all we know is that the us believes in peace , supports palestinian economic development , opposes terror and recognizes jerusalem as israel 's capital , '' shapiro said . `` each of those positions is correct , but without an overarching framework of a policy goal and initiative focused on achieving a two-state solution to end the conflict , nothing ties those threads together , and there is little any envoy can do to advance toward that goal . '' ",
        "a white house official said that trump 's critics were missing the point : whatever peace plan the administration advances should emerge organically from the people whom it would most affect . `` however the peace agreement shakes out at the end of the day will be in one in which the two societies are connected economically and otherwise , '' said the official , who requested anonymity in order to speak expansively about the trump administration 's peace efforts . `` we ca n't do this from afar , we have to go there to see interactions , how the economics can work out , how business is conducted on the two sides . '' ",
        "greenblatt 's office did not agree to an interview . in september , however , speaking at the ad hoc liaison committee , the grouping of nations that are invested in the palestinian-israeli peace process , greenblatt put it this way : `` instead of working to impose a solution from the outside , we are giving the parties space to make their own decisions about their future , '' he said . `` instead of laying blame for the conflict at the feet of one party or the other , we are focused on implementing existing agreements and unlocking new areas of cooperation which benefit both palestinians and israelis . '' ",
        "greenblatt already scored one success : a deal , signed in july , in which israel sells water to the palestinian authority at reduced rates . the water will reach parched areas of the west bank and the gaza strip , which is ruled by hamas . the agreement , forged at a time in which israeli and palestinian leadership barely speak to one another , earned greenblatt kudos -- from the israelis , at least -- for keeping away from hot-button issues that scuttled previous talks . `` when you focus on the issues -- and not about history or background or personal emotions or other disturbing elements -- the common denominator is much bigger than what separates us , '' tzachi hanegbi , the country 's minister for regional development , said at the time . ",
        "the evidence shows , though , that greenblatt does focus on emotional and personal elements -- but only as a means of advancing commonalities . greenblatt 's twitter feed is a constant flow of amity . he posts photos of kosher meals he 's received as the guest of the palestinian authority or the saudi kingdom . he ran a series of photos featuring kids from gaza who visited washington under a youth exchange program -- in one , he thanks the israeli government for facilitating the group 's travel . he wishes jews , muslims and christians happy holidays at the appropriate times . ",
        "it 's a friendly approach that has attracted investment in the peace process from actors who were wary of it in the past . `` overall , the sense is , we 're being spoken to , '' said elie pieprz , the director of external affairs for the yesha council , the umbrella body for west bank settlements . `` the expectation is that for there to be genuine peace , you need to be speaking to people on all sides , not just a couple of leaders you gather in a hotel in europe . '' the palestinian authority , at least until the jerusalem issue arose this month , also enthusiastically embraced trump 's approach , as expressed through greenblatt , their most frequent interlocutor from the trump administration . ",
        "zomlot , the plo envoy , turned down a request for an interview , but in previous briefings for reporters he expressed admiration for the intensity of greenblatt 's involvement . `` they have traveled to the region , they have met with all parties , especially mr. greenblatt , '' he said at an august briefing . `` what i 'm hearing is that he is primarily in listening mode , respectful of positions trying to understand where they 're coming from , but also preparing for what appears to be big moves , '' said jonathan schanzer , the vice president of the foundation for defense of democracies . ",
        "`` he understands the power of weakness of the palestinian side , '' said nimrod novik , a former top israeli negotiator under labor governments and now the israel policy forum 's israel fellow . `` which means once presented with a seemingly impossible position they can easily say no and become domestic heroes . '' greenblatt understands , novik said , that whatever formula emerges it must not be one that palestinians reflexively reject . oded revivi , the mayor of the settlement of efrat , which maintains relations with three neighboring palestinian villages , said greenblatt was able to extrapolate from the details of that relationship to possible bigger picture solutions . ",
        "`` he 's very interested in small details while remembering that he is representing the strongest country in the world , and he needs to think of the global matter and not just a small suburb of jerusalem , '' he said . still , despite greenblatt 's efforts , there remains considerable frustration -- if not anxiety -- at the trump administration 's reluctance to outline a deal . at the same august briefing with reporters , zomlot wondered `` where the hell they are going . '' around the same time that greenblatt was saying that hamas-palestinian authority would work , if hamas adheres to principles including the laying down of arms and recognizing israel , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu fretted that the reconciliation could come at `` the expense of our existence . '' ",
        "there may be obstacles closer to home as well . interlocutors who have spent time with the negotiation team say that friedman 's politics tend to veer to the far right on the israeli political spectrum . friedman , speaking this week of trump 's recognition of jerusalem , told the jerusalem post that the palestinian reaction to the recognition was `` ugly '' and `` anti-semitic . '' one figure who met with the team notes that greenblatt spent time at yeshivat har etzion , a west bank yeshiva noted for leaders who counseled engagement with the palestinians . ",
        "a source close to greenblatt described his year there as `` a very meaningful year of growth with great teachers , role models and friends . '' friedman , before becoming ambassador , was a backer of the more hardline bet el yeshiva . kushner is facing legal woes as a special prosecutor investigates the trump campaign 's alleged collusion with russia . he said in leaked remarks over the summer that he does n't know if a deal is even possible . but kushner , speaking earlier this month at the brookings institution annual saban forum , which convenes israeli and us influencers , described a team that works together smoothly . ",
        "`` as this process has gone through , my team in particular , being three orthodox jews and a coptic egyptian , has tried very hard to do a lot of listening , '' he said . a white house official said that the team is focused on reaching a deal -- but the official added that there is also value in greenblatt 's confidence-building measures , in and of themselves . the official added that trump , who has had about 10 meetings with the team , was very attentive to progress toward reaching a peace deal . `` he 's extremely engaged and interested and dedicated to making this a top priority , '' the official said .
