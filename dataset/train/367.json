        "at least 136 civilians have been killed in yemen over 11 days this month as a result of intensified air raids by the saudi-led military coalition , the united nations says . rupert colville , a spokesman for the office of the high commissioner for human rights , expressed deep concern on tuesday at a `` surge in civilian casualties '' in an air campaign launched by the saudi arabia-led coalition in response to the december 4 killing of yemen 's former president , ali abdullah saleh . saleh was killed in a grenade and gun attack by houthi rebels days after he broke off their fragile alliance and expressed an openness to talks with the saudi arabia-led coalition , which intervened in yemen in march 2015 to restore the government of president abd-rabbu mansour hadi .

        "the war in the arab world 's poorest country has now lasted 1,000 days . more than 10,000 civilians have been killed in the conflict and the un has warned about 8.4 million people are a `` step away from famine '' . the war-torn country is also battling the world 's worst cholera epidemic , which has killed thousands and infected about one million people . speaking to reporters in geneva on tuesday , colville said the un human rights office has `` verified that 136 civilians and non-combatants were killed and some 87 injured '' in the attacks on the capital , sanaa , and three other northern provinces .

        "the attacks took place between december 6-16 , and hit a houthi-run tv channel , a hospital , a prison , a wedding party and a farmhouse . victims included more than a dozen children . at least 45 people were killed in the prison bombing on december 13 . all victims were detainees loyal to hadi , colville said . seven civilians were killed in the hospital bombing on december 10 , while one woman and nine children who were returning home from a wedding party were killed when their vehicles were struck in the harib al-qaramish district of the marib governorate on saturday . ",
        "the farmhouse bombing on friday killed 20 people , including 14 children , colville said . he urged all parties to the conflict to `` take all feasible precautions to avoid , and in any event , to minimise the impact of violence on civilians '' . ` brokers of peace'meanwhile , more than 355 high-profile figures have urged the leaders of the us , uk and france to stop `` stoking the flames of a war that is strangling an entire population '' , and instead take on the role of `` brokers of peace '' . the signatories to tuesday 's appeal included eight nobel peace laureates , religious leaders , celebrities , and heads of aid agencies . ",
        "the us , uk and france - as permanent members of the un security council and major weapons suppliers to saudi arabia and the uae - bear `` a special responsibility to use the full extent of their leverage to press their partners in the region to end the crisis '' , the statement said . `` if you do n't want the burden of the lives of thousands more yemeni children on your hands , then the time to act is now . yemen ca n't wait any longer , '' it added . source : al jazeera news .
