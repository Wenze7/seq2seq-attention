        "at the beginning of 2017 i made three ambitious new year 's resolutions : read a book a weeksketch once a weekwork out three times a weekthe only resolution that made it through 2017 unscathed was numero uno , although i did manage to last a measly four months at the gym . my sketchbook , on the other hand , remains mostly blank and suffers from abandonment issues . one of the greatest byproducts of my incessant reading in 2017 has been discussing and recommending books to my friends and family . to spark more of these discussions in the upcoming year , i 've decided to create a `` top 10 '' list for both the fiction and non-fiction books that i 've read so far this year .
