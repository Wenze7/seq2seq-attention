        "by emanuella grinbergatlanta -- on the eve of former usa gymnastics team doctor larry nassar 's sentencing for sexually abusing girls in his care , american gymnast simone biles has come forward to say me , too . `` i , too , am one of the many survivors that was sexually abused by larry nassar , '' the olympian said monday afternoon in a twitter post with the hashtag #metoo . `` there are many reasons that i have been reluctant to share my story , but i know now that it is not my fault . '' biles is the latest member of the `` fierce five '' 2012 us gymnastics team to speak out against nassar . ",
        "aly raisman , gabby douglas and mckayla maroney have said he abused them . `` after hearing the brave stories of my friends and other survivors , i know that this horrific experience does not define me , '' she said . `` for far too long i 've asked myself ` was i too naive ? was it my fault ?
