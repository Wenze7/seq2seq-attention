        "the south african team celebrates a wicket . the much-awaited test series between india and south africa finally got underway amidst a lot of excitement amongst players and the fans . there was a lot of talk about the pitch heading into the first match at newlands in cape town . but the curator won the hearts by preparing a sporting track which kept both the teams interested in the game . though the rain on the third day turned the game in the favour of bowlers as the batsmen failed to come to the terms . in the end , the game which ebbed and flowed throughout the three days of action was won by the home side . ",
        "after winning the toss , faf du plessis decided to bat first much to everyone 's surprise and south africa lost 12/3 courtesy bhuvneshwar kumar . but then the sensational counter-attack from ab de villiers changed the game as the fourth wicket stand added 114 runs . but soon india came back to bowl the hosts out for 286 runs on the first day itself . in response , india stuttered in their response and were left reeling at 92/7 hopelessly out of the game . but hardik pandya came to the fore and changed the complexion of the game completely . ",
        "his knock caught south africa off the guard as india posted 209 runs . pandya scored 93 and unfortunately could n't score a century . the hosts , with a lead of 77 runs , started well in the second innings . but pandya again broke their back by taking a couple of wickets by the end of the second day . the third day was completely washed out but the clear and sunny skies welcomed the players on the fourth morning . data-ad-client = `` ca-pub-7785168419440214 `` data-ad-slot = `` 6042301080 '' > a lot of anticipation ended with indian bowlers staging a stunning fightback by skittling south africa out for just 130 runs in the first session . ",
        "the target of 208 was achievable but surely the pace trio of the hosts was not going to make it easy for india . as it panned out , the visitors crumbled in front of some sensational swing bowling from vernon philander who registered his career-best figures . he was well supported by kagiso rabada and morne morkel who looked like taking a wicket every ball . south africa now lead the series 1-0 and would want to seal the deal in centurion . philander said : it 's generally slow here . it caught us off-guard on the first morning . ",
        "but the boys stuck to their guns . to get 286 was a wonderful effort with the bat . what better setting can you ask for . one of the better grounds to play cricket at . just a great atmosphere . lot of the times you have one bowler get the praise , but the way the bowlers stuck to their guns after being a seamer down was superb . coming back after the break , i felt a bit stiff . just hope dale gets back as quickly as possible . he 's been hell of a champion , hell of a leader for us . ",
        "to see him go down is quite heartbreaking for the squad . faf du plessis was extremely happy with the way his team responded in the pressure situations . he also felt sorry for dale steyn who has been ruled out of the series due to the bruised heel . he said : every single time when we needed to stand up through tough periods , we responded beautifully . did n't plan to be 12/3 , but we responded . even today , after india got off to a decent start , we stuck to our plans and put great pressure on their batters . ",
        "the first morning , we expected it to move around for the first hour . that total we felt was just around par . we felt 270 was going to be par . even in the second innings , from 90/7 , ab played a great knock , he took some risks . plan was to get 200 runs , to get a lead of 350 and to have a crack at them tonight . but we were surprised how much it was doing this morning . when we came in today , the pitch was green again , almost like the day 1 pitch . ",
        "it was tough , they bowled really well . i think it was a fantastic cricket wicket . there was a good challenge between bat and ball . really important in a three-match series to put the opposition under pressure . if we had four seamers here today , dale would have been a handful . thoughts with him . feel sorry for the guy . he 's trained so hard and he 's injured again . thanks to the crowd , been a great crowd . virat kohli rued the chances they missed in the first innings . the lead which they conceded proved to be the deciding one according to him . ",
        "the skipper also hailed pandya for his brilliant all-round performance . he said : if we had taken our chances in the first innings , even after them counter-attacking , we could have kept them to 220 which would have been ideal . we 're not a team which thinks of what-ifs though . losing wickets in bunches is something we have to plug in . we were pretty much in the test match on all days . we were thinking 250-275 if they play well . to restrict them to 210 was an outstanding effort . we needed someone to get a 75-80 . ",
        "credit to them , they were a bowler short and still bowled their heart out . we need to rectify our mistakes also . mini collapses in both innings is something we have to think about , how to string in partnerships . this game is all about stringing in partnerships . they did that better than us . bowlers learned pretty quickly from the first innings , whatever mistakes needed to be corrected . we kept pulling things back against a side which is very strong at home . still feeling good about how we went about this test match . ",
        "the mindset matters when you 're travelling away from home on pitches which challenge you . need to be positive in defence and when you 're leaving also . you need to grab scoring opportunities . he 's a strong character . he backs himself and we believe in him . he 's performing for us now , even away from home . that knock was brilliant , showed a lot of character . the post south africa vs india 2018 , 1st test : who said what appeared first on crictracker .
