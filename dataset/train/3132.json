        "the gujarat high court on monday , 8 january , rejected a petition filed by news portal ` the wire ' seeking quashing of a criminal defamation case filed against it by bjp president amit shah 's son jay over an article related to his company . justice j b pardiwala rejected the petition on the grounds that the article , `` the golden touch of jay amit shah '' , is per say `` defamatory '' and the trial court should proceed with the case . the hc , which had earlier directed the trial court to complete the hearing in the case in six months , today withdrew that order . ",
        "this means there is no time-frame for the trial court to complete the hearing . s m vatsa , the lawyer for the author of the article and editors of the news portal , had maintained the news report was not `` defamatory , '' and the facts presented in it were based on public documents . the petitioners had maintained the article was a part of investigative journalism and filing a criminal defamation suit against it was against the freedom of the press . jay shah 's lawyer s v raju , on the other hand , had maintained the article was `` defamatory '' and the two witnesses examined by the lower court had established that the reputation of his client was tarnished due to its publication . ",
        "jay shah had moved the lower court alleging criminal defamation by the petitioners after the article published by the website claimed his company 's turnover grew exponentially after the bjp-led government came to power at the centre in 2014 . after the suit was filed on 9 october last year , the court initiated proceedings against them under the crpc section 202 . the suit has been filed against the author of the article rohini singh , founding editors of the news portal siddharth varadarajan , siddharth bhatia and m k venu , managing editor monobina gupta , public editor pamela philipose and the foundation for independent journalism . ",
        "the foundation publishes ` the wire ' . with the quashing of the plea , the matter is expected to come up for hearing in the lower court on tuesday , on 9 january . jay shah has separately filed a civil defamation suit of rs 100 crore against the website over the article . jay shah had rejected the charge made in the article , insisting the story was `` false , derogatory and defamatory '' .
