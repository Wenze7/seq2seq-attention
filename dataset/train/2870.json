        "residents and a historian in hoyt , n. b. , are angry that construction crews burned the remnants of a local historic bridge in a barrel . construction crews that tore down and replaced the flood-damaged bell bridge could be seen burning portions of the 87-year-old covered bridge after it was demolished last week . `` i think they 're making a joke of it , a mockery , '' said wayne kirkpatrick , a farmer who has lived in the community his entire life . `` there 's a lot of people in the community that would have liked to have a piece of that bridge just for a memento . '' ",
        "kirkpatrick said burning the iconic bridge was as disrespectful as `` spitting on the bible . '' bridge could n't be saved local residents had tried to save a portion of the historic bridge after was deemed unsalvageable by the department of transportation and infrastructure following severe flood damage two weeks ago . `` if we could have got something from it to re-erect it at our historical site ... we certainly would have liked to have it at our site to bring attractions in , '' said larry welton , president of the patterson settlement historical society . welton says he understands the bridge could n't be saved , especially because there are about a dozen people living on the other side in juvenile settlement whose travel is limited in the bridge 's absence . ",
        "but he 's not happy about construction crews burning the wood from the remains of the bridge . `` i heard that this morning that they were just burning some wood off it and that is kind of a shame , '' said welton . `` i really do n't want to see that for sure . '' currently the site of the bell bridge is guarded around the clock by a security firm hired to keep people away from the construction area . government apology last week an email from the department of transportation and infrastructure stated `` everything will be salvaged from the site . ",
        "once the parts have been removed , staff will determine what , if anything , can be re-used . '' construction crews could be seen burning bridge boards on jan. . 18 in temperatures of -- 5 and again on jan. . 22 , 2018 in temperatures of -- 9 . when asked about crews burning portions of the bridge , department spokesperson jeremy trevors said that it seems the crews were burning debris in order to stay warm . `` we will discourage that in the future and we apologize if it offended anyone in the community , '' he wrote via email . ",
        "`` in the case of the bell bridge , the department managed to save a variety of items from the bridge , including signs and wood . these will be placed at one of dti 's depots until we are able to work with the department of tourism heritage and culture on an approach for commemoration . '' repurposed value a local craftsman who uses repurposed wood from old structures says it 's the stories in the vintage material -- like the hundreds of names carved into the wood of the now-destroyed bell bridge -- that gives the material great value `` there 's a history behind it , there 's a story behind it , and there 's certainly value behind it , '' said tim cressman , owner of elwood 's wood lab in saint john . ",
        "`` so for sure , if it 's at all possible , it should n't be tossed . '' cressman says his company ca n't get their hands on enough old wood for their projects . he said wood that had been treated or has spent its lifetime in an outdoor structure can be more challenging to work with , but still hold a lot of value . `` i understand from a logistical perspective that it 's hard for somebody tearing down these buildings to consider those steps , '' said cressman . `` it 's easy just to bring a bulldozer in there , or a backhoe in , and gather it up and throw it in a dumpster . ",
        "i think if the logistics can be worked out where the government agencies that are tearing these down can take a ` separation step ' with this stuff and then let the community got to work and do the rest and sort it , it would be well worth it for the heritage in it . ''   "
