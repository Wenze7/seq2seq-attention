",

",
        "`` this has been bothering you since friday ? '' of the investigators asked mero . `` thursday , friday , when i first found out , '' mero told `` what day is today ? '' the investigator followed up . `` thursday , '' mero answered `` ok , '' martin replied . `` you know we only released who it was two days ago , right ? '' `` i could have sworn it was over the weekend , '' mero answered . `` no , it was tuesday , '' the investigator replied . moments later , martin told mero : `` you should have like two sleepless nights , not six sleepless nights . ",
        "`` mero said he was exhausted and , in a sudden shift , said he had been stressed out because he and his girlfriend were planning to build a new patio . martin told mero his time frame did not add up . martin and albert told mero to start over and come clean . mero had already told them on dec. . 3 , 2014 , the day countermine disappeared , he met the woman at his parents ' home in albany for a five-hour prostitution session . the parents were away in hawaii . mero said he kicked countermine out of the house when he exited a bathroom and saw countermine snorting drugs off a photo of his grandmother .

",
        "`` did you take the body down there and put it down there ? did something else happen ? '' martin pressed mero . mero sat frozen and silent for an extended period . `` did something else happen ? '' martin repeated . mero said he needed to talk to other people . martin , in a final effort , asked mero to `` give me something '' to `` get it off your chest . `` mero soon asked for an attorney and the interview ended . that portion of the video was not shown to the jury .
