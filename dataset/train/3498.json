        "flush off his victory on tax policy , president trump predicted friday that republicans and democrats will come together to rebuild the us -- suggesting infrastructure as a `` perfect place to start . '' `` at some point , and for the good of the country , i predict we will start working with the democrats in a bipartisan fashion . infrastructure would be a perfect place to start , '' trump said in an early morning tweet . `` after having foolishly spent $ 7 trillion in the middle east , it is time to start rebuilding our country ! '' ",
        "the president is expected to release an approximately 70-page infrastructure proposal in january , relying on a mix of federal , local and private spending . trump has used monday 's deadly train derailment in seattle to call for increased infrastructure spending . `` the train accident that just occurred in dupont , wa shows more than ever why our soon to be submitted infrastructure plan must be approved quickly , '' he tweeted after the accident . `` seven trillion dollars spent in the middle east while our roads , bridges , tunnels , railways crumble ! not for long ! '' ",
        "during the 2016 presidential campaign , trump first promised to deliver a $ 1 trillion infrastructure plan to improve the condition of roads , bridges , airports and other public works . trump administration officials have said they plan to release a plan before his state of the union address next month . president trump on wednesday touted his $ 1 trillion infrastructure plan ... early signs point to a wide gap between what the white house is expected to propose -- $ 200 billion in federal spending along with state and local funds , as well as private investment -- and the $ 1 trillion that democrats have suggested , according to politico . ",
        "unlike the tax bill that republicans passed through congress this week , any infrastructure package would require 60 votes to clear the senate , meaning the white house will need democratic support . democrats including house minority leader nancy pelosi and senate minority leader chuck schumer have expressed interest to work with team trump on an infrastructure package . but many liberals have pushed for a strategy of resistance to the administration , fearing that giving trump bipartisan legislative accomplishments would add more legitimacy to what they view as a tainted presidency , the washington examiner reported .
