        "having spent the last year or so digging deep into bitcoin , ethereum , and crypto in general , thought it would be a good time to put down my thoughts on the current hype . bitcoin is for real : as a store of value and non-correlated asset , btc is for real . most importantly , 2017 is the turning point for bitcoin -- as more and more family offices and high net worth individuals seek entry into this space -- the building blocks will be ready in 2018 to allow enormous inflows into the currency . within the next few weeks , both the cme and cboe will have launched btc futures -- which will substantially add to the liquidity of the market . ",
        "goldman sachs is exploring setting up a trading operation in btc . and at the consensus : invest conference last week i saw multiple custodial solutions that will finally enable broad based institutional investing in this asset class . talk to any financial advisor and they are fielding multiple calls a day from clients looking to get into this asset . there is a huge wave coming in 2018 . and as one of the conference speakers michael novogratz said , unlike oil , when if it goes to $ 150 all of a sudden you invest in fracking , with bitcoin , supply is limited and can not be increased without consensus . ",
        "further evidence of 2017 as a turning point is the plethora of hedge funds investing in crypto -- over 90 as of this writing . and many of the top vc funds in the country have also invested in these hedge funds -- as a way to get crypto exposure without needing to solve the custodial issues . and these hedge funds are trading in crypto in a world where there are no derivatives and most cryptocurrency is too nascent to truly value . so it 's hard to see how the btc price does n't continue to rise significantly based purely on supply and demand . ",
        "bitcoin risksthere continues to be significant risks in bitcoin that must be accounted for and in some cases are not discussed nearly enough in my opinion . first , is concentration risk . the top five miners of bitcoin are all based in china . one phone call from the government in china to these five miners could theoretically shut down the network for all intents and purposes . mitigating this risk is that although china has shut down btc trading many times it has allowed the miners to continue and this represents a vast source of wealth for the chinese government and it is in their best interests to keep it going . ",
        "a second risk is the development of new , alternative currencies and/or forks that incent miners to switch , which , when coupled with the concentration risk above , can results in significant network degradation in a very short period of time . on the heels of the segwit2x cancellation , with the launch of bitcoin cash , btc lost 80 % of it 's hash rate in one day , as miners shifted their setups to a higher paying reward that shared the same sha256 algorithm . until bitcoin algorithmically adjusted the proof of work algorithm for the new reduced hash rate , the bitcoin network was impacted . ",
        "the continued increase in value of btc mitigates this as it provides more value ultimately to support btc ; but in a declining market there is no such mitigation . a third risk is regulatory -- every payment a bank and financial institution in the us makes must be checked to ensure recipients are not in the terrorist and criminal database . it is naive to believe that this regulation wo n't also come to bitcoin transfers -- just last week a federal judge ruled coinbase must supply the irs with information on some users . that in and of itself should n't shut down btc ; but there is no question that much of btc 's early adoption was due to the anonymity of the network . ",
        "icos : do you understand what you 're actually buying ? so what 's really up with initial coin offerings ? while i remain bullish on bitcoin and several other more mature crytocurrencies that have existing strong networks and use cases -lrb- ethereum , xrp , zcash , litecoin , among others -rrb- , the vast majority in my opinion of these icos make zero sense as an investor . it makes sense why new types of decentralized companies would be built on the blockchain ; and it makes sense why these companies would want to issue cryptotokens early in order to get the decentralized network incentivized to participate as nodes . ",
        "and it makes sense why a vc who funded the original business wants to also own tokens in the network . but for an individual investor , one must work through exactly what has to happen for these tokens to have any real monetary value at all : the technology has to be built the technology has to be launched into the wild . nodes and network participants need to get onlineultimate end users need to adopt the product offering . often switching from existing incumbents who already enjoy network effects and moats . the holding company needs to have enough cash on hand or be profitable enough with user adoption to continue to operate as an ongoing concern . ",
        "if these items , 1 -- 5 , happen -- then , maybe , the cryptotokens underlying the network could conceivable attain real economic value as bitcoin did . but the risk is not commensurate with the reward . steps 1 -- 5 are the same risks that all seed stage investors and really series a or b venture investors take -- but they typically get governance , preferred equity , and a whole host of other economic and other protections . even then , the success rate of seed stage deals is very very low . if you believe 1 % of seed stage deals raise a series a , and 30 % of series a stage deals make money , than 0.3 % of seed deals make money for investors . ",
        "in the ico case , not only does the holder have zero governance or other rights , but the holder has zero claims to any future cash flows from the entity . the holder of an ico is betting that at some point in the future , after the very low probability of steps 1 -- 5 happen , the cryptotokens will have have enough usage and market participants to attain perceived economic value . this is a very very risky bet , to say the least . so what 's happening ? the ico market is dominated by speculators who have zero understanding of the economic underpinning of these tokens . ",
        "it 's all about the quick flips . but what about the blockchain -- is n't that for real as the greatest technological innovation of the past 10 years ? yes , and no . clearly solving the double-spend problem via advance crypto techniques is an amazing innovation . and the more you look into it , the more mind-blowing it can be . but as a pure technology -- blockchain does n't scale , yet . think about credit card payments . which is more efficient -- have one logical database to both validate and store transactions , or having tens of thousands of nodes making complete encrypted copies of every transaction that ever occurred on the network ? ",
        "now there is a lot of money and innovation working hard to scale the blockchain -- lightning network is one example -- but it 's not there today . for certain types of business formation -- think the mutuals or cooperatives of days past -- the use of a blockchain to validate and control the network that is owned by the network participants without the need to provide returns to capital -- can make sense . but it is a relatively small percentage of all businesses out there , in my opinion . and can the blockchain provide competition to force existing incumbents to lower prices ? ",
        "yes . but the vast majority of businesses both online and offline as we know it will not be affected .   "
