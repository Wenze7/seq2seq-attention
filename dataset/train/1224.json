        "despite the continued links between free agent j. d. martinez and the toronto blue jays , the 2015 all-star will not end up in southern ontario . it has become somewhat of a standing joke that the toronto blue jays will be linked to jay bruce at any opportunity . their connection to j. d. martinez seems to be reaching a similar level of frequency , thanks to jon heyman . during november , tip of the tower 's curtis panke referenced heyman 's speculation that martinez could end up in toronto . now the mlb network insider is at it again . ",
        "heyman notes that mark shapiro and company are indicating they will compete in 2018 . and one way the fanrag sports network columnist believes the toronto blue jays can convince fans they are focused on winning , is by signing martinez . on the surface at least you can understand this connection , especially with edwin encarnacion and now jose bautista no longer on the team . martinez is younger than both players and is coming off a season , where he had a career-high 45 homers and 104 rbi . regardless , let 's clear this up now by saying martinez is not going to end up in southern ontario . ",
        "and the first -- and main -- reason comes down to cost . as previously noted by usa today columnist bob nightengale , the 30-year-old is apparently looking for around seven years and $ 210 million . after all the issues over re-signing encarnacion , shapiro and company will not fork out this kind of money for one player . more from tip of the tower jays have two-time all-star on their radar3d ago roberto osuna is n't going anywhere4d ago blue jays remain unmotivated to move josh donaldson1 w ago marcus stroman garners interest from phillies2w ago blue jays under the gun with donaldson decision2w ago in fairness , even heyman notes shapiro does n't have a history of paying the big bucks . ",
        "and even though toronto has a bigger budget than cleveland , this is what makes the blue jays an outsider for martinez . another reason the 2015 all-star wo n't end up in toronto , comes down to his defence . while the blue jays are desperate for help in the outfield , he is poor in this area . it does n't matter how much martinez 's bat may offset this , at some point the toronto blue jays need to shore up their outfield . signing him is n't going to help with this . even asking the 2009 20th round draft pick to just play as a designated hitter , is off the table . ",
        "as recently reported by the boston globe 's michael silverman , his preference is to play in the outfielder rather than just serve as a dh . martinez is a man in demand , with the likes of the boston red sox , the san francisco giants and colorado rockies reportedly vying for his signature . however , next time you hear him linked with the blue jays , it 's best to dismiss it immediately . what 's your position on martinez ? what do you make of the links between him and the blue jays ? would you like to see him end up in toronto ?

        "share your thoughts in the comments section below . despite the continued links between free agent j. d. martinez and the toronto blue jays , the 2015 all-star will not end up in southern ontario . it has become somewhat of a standing joke that thetoronto blue jayswill be linked to jay bruce at any opportunity . their connection toj . d. martinezseems to ...
