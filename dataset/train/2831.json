        "struggling tech giant leeco suddenly launched ten new smart tv models in its home country of china , revealing them as part of product families called lean and new . as was the case with most of its previous tv offerings , the units were designed to target price-conscious consumers and provide them with a contemporary tv experience on a budget . the lineups start with several 40-inch models and go all the way up to 65-inch units , with the most affordable members of the new product range being priced at 1,899 yuan , or approximately $ 289 . ",
        "the chinese original equipment manufacturer said its latest offerings cater to families and are meant to be the center of one 's home entertainment experience , primarily due to an extensive portfolio of apps that come pre-installed on them . the mstar chip clocked at a maximum operating frequency of 1.5 ghz is powering all of the newly announced devices , with the quad-core silicon being backed by 16 gb of internal flash memory . the tvs run leeco-made eui 6.5 out of the box that promises to deliver an intuitive user experience . the 4k offerings support the regular hdr standard and are capable of processing sdr content in a manner that allows them to output an hdr image , though consumers should n't expect results comparable to native hdr quality . ",
        "all tvs are now available for purchase in the far eastern country , being sold by the firm 's lemall . holiday gift guide 2017 - 2018 : the ultimate smartphone & tech gift guidethe announcement of the new product range suggests leeco is slowly clawing its way back into the industry following months of financial troubles that still are n't over but has significantly downsized its operations . the decision to start its return with tvs was likely prompted by the fact that this product segment was traditionally one of the most lucrative ones for leeco . the oem 's smartphone division has also been performing relatively well in the years leading up to its financial turmoil but leeco has yet to show any indication of preparing for a release of new mobile devices . ",
        "the indebted firm 's founder was recently ordered to return to china and personally settle the group 's issues , though it 's unlikely he 'll respond to that request seeing how he has already been personally blacklisted as a debt defaulter in the country .   "
