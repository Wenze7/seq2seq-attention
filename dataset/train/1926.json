        "yangon - two reuters journalists have been arrested in myanmar for the possession of `` important security documents '' , the government said on wednesday . myanmar reporters wa lone , 31 , and kyaw soe oo , 27 , had been missing since tuesday evening , the news agency had earlier said . the pair were arrested under the official secrets act , for allegedly intending `` to send important security documents regarding security forces in rakhine state to foreign agencies abroad , '' the statement released by the information ministry said . rakhine has been in the international spotlight after a brutal , military-led crackdown forced more than 620,000 rohingya muslims to flee the state and cross the border to bangladesh since august . ",
        "a photo showed the handcuffed reporters with documents displayed before them . reuters global communications chief abbe serphos said : `` we are urgently seeking more information about the circumstances of their arrest and their current situation . '' before joining the agency , wa lone , 31 , worked at the english language newspaper the myanmar times . kyaw soe oo has worked for the company since september , the agency said . the government statement said that action will also be taken against two policemen who had recently returned from duty in northern rakhine . since nobel laureate aung san suu kyi came to power in 2016 after decades of junta rule , media advocates have pointed to little progress on freedom of expression , with online defamation cases skyrocketing compared to the previous military-backed administration . ",
        "in october a burmese journalist , two reporters from malaysia and singapore and their driver were arrested in the capital naypidaw for flying a drone over parliament and sentenced to two months in prison while awaiting additional charges . many areas of the country are out of bounds to journalists , including much of rakhine .
