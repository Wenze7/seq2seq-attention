        "the northern knights have defended a below par total to give the wellington firebirds their first loss of the super smash season . on a slowish track at the basin reserve , the knights could only muster 145 after a middle order collapse made the going difficult , but got home by one run . but a disciplined bowling effort pulled them back into the match and led them to victory . hamish marshall and stephen murdoch fell early , leaving debutante devon conway to build the wellington innings . he was measured in his approach , attacking in fits and starts including charging scott kuggeleijn and sending the ball flying over long-off and into the r. a. vance stand .

        "read more : * unwell gayle not fielding * big bash opener down to wire * best place to catch a six conway , who was only called into the team for a sick tom blundell two hours before the match , brought up 50 from 31 balls , but found batting partners hard to come by . by the time he eventually fell for 53 in the 14th over , caught by anton devcich on the boundary off daryl mitchell , wellington needed more than eight runs an over with just four wickets in hand . a calamitous run out two balls later made things even worse . ",
        "ish sodhi was his usual self for the knights , making batting a struggle with his crafty leg-spin , while former wellington quick brent arnel was as sharp as ever from the other end . luke woodcock pulled wellington incredibly close with 39 , but could n't muster three from the final ball to get the win . devcich fell in northern 's first over to samit patel , leaving tim seifert and dean brownlie to make a measured start to proceedings in the first innings . they started to find their range by the fifth over , sending balls over the close field and off to the boundary ropes . ",
        "but when samit patel was reintroduced , alongside namesake jeetan patel , the knights collapsed . english import samit patel ended with 3-28 from his four overs , while jeetan patel took 2-14 from four in a miserly display of spin bowling . only brownlie and daryl mitchell got past 30 as the knights struggled to compose a competitive total . it proved to be more than enough . at a glance northern knights 145-6 -lrb- d brownlie 34 , d mitchell 31 ; s patel 3-28/4 , j patel 2-14/4 -rrb- defeated the wellington firebirds 144-9 -lrb- d conway 53 , l woodcock 39 ; b arnel 2-36/4 , i sodhi 2-23/4 -rrb- by one run .
