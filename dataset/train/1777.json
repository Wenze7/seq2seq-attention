        "if paula deen taught the world anything about cooking , it 's that butter makes everything taste better . luckily , you can find all the flavor of real butter in a variety of vegan butter brands . this means even the most buttery of holiday classics and comfort foods can be made just as easily for people avoiding animal products or with dairy allergies . here 's a list of the six best vegan butters that taste like the real thing . 1 . earth balancewhen it comes to versatility and availability , earth balance is the best vegan butter overall . ",
        "not only does it have a taste and texture that 's nearly identical butter , but it 's also one of the most common and affordable vegan butters you can find in grocery stores . along with the original flavor , earth balance also comes in soy-free , organic whipped , olive oil , omega-3 , and organic coconut spread . earth balance is my go-to butter , and i use it for everything from saut√©ing veggies to baking chocolate chip cookies . 2 . i ca n't believe it 's not butterthe second best vegan butter on this list is actually one of the newer to hit stores . ",
        "although some vegans may prefer to shop from exclusively vegan companies , having an established national brand release a vegan product only makes it easier for more people to have access . this means you can find the i ca n't believe it 's not butter vegan spread in the dairy aisle next to their regular margarine . because it 's margarine-based , this vegan spread does n't bake as well as butter . however , it works great for sauces and soups like this vegan cream of potato soup . 3 . miyoko 's kitchenthe third best vegan butter goes to the european style cultured vegan butter from miyoko 's kitchen . ",
        "miyoko 's kitchen is a smaller company that specializes in vegan cheeses , so this is a product you will most likely only find in a whole foods or specialty grocers . it 's also pricier than the previous two butters . not only is their butter dairy-free , but it 's also organic and free of palm oil . instead , miyoko uses coconut oil and cashews to give it a rich , buttery texture that even bakes well . just look at how well it melts on waffles ! 4 . wayfare whippedwayfare whipped takes fourth since it 's another butter that can only be found in specialty grocery stores . ",
        "you 're likely to find them in jewish delis or grocery stores because their products are certified vegan and kosher pareve . wayfare was created by family of former dairy farmers who wanted to create a product that was better for the environment and their customers . what makes wayfare whipped worth the search is that its whipped texture makes it super spreadable , perfect for foods like corn on the cob . plus it comes in sweet and savory flavors like garlic and cinnamon . 5 . melt organicmelt organic is another butter like miyoko 's kitchen that uses only organic and fair trade coconut oils as the primary ingredient in their butter . ",
        "however , melt not only has vegan spreads , but also `` buttery sticks , '' which are easier to bake with than spooning out spread . melt butters are also slightly easier to find than miyoko 's butter . on the west coast , you can probably find them in grocery stores like safeway , whereas on the east coast you should check fresh market and whole foods . melt also has a few sweet flavors including chocolate and honey , but both are sweetened with honey so they 're not 100 % vegan . 6 . nutiva organic buttery coconut oillast on the list is nutiva 's organic buttery coconut oil , which is flavored coconut oil and not a vegan butter spread . ",
        "however , it can spread and bake just like a butter spread . along with being organic , it 's also non-gmo . since it 's primarily coconut oil , it works best on low heat , especially when cooking popcorn on the stove or sauteing vegetables . nutiva products can be found in most grocery stores , but you still may need to find a health-based grocery store to find the buttery coconut oil . hungry for more buttery , baked goods but are n't sure how to make them vegan ? finding the best ways to use vegan butter is just one step in learning how make rich vegan comfort food .
