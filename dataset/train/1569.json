        "live montreal more streams external links webcast of government 's promotion of diversity forum immigration minister david heurtel says he welcomes a citizen-led coalition 's initiative to shed light on the experience and consequences of racism and discrimination in quebec society . heurtel made the comments in quebec city during a one-day diversity and anti-discrimination forum , a watered-down version of the systemic racism inquiry the couillard government committed to earlier this year . heurtel said he will look at the coalition 's findings seriously . `` if these groups want to work on specific issues regarding racism , good for them . ",
        "good for us , actually . '' the coalition announced its intention to hold parallel consultations that will go further in exploring the problem of systemic racism at a news conference tuesday in montreal . reduced mandate of quebec 's racism inquiry ` very political ' and ` unacceptable , ' community groups say `` we want a process that 's organized by racialized communities for racialized communities and for people who have experienced racism and systemic discrimination to talk about their experiences , '' mei chu , representing a group called progressive chinese of quebec , told cbc montreal 's daybreak . ",
        "the fact that the consultations will be citizen-led means they will be focused on problems at hand , not on gaining votes or playing to the electorate , said haroun bouazzi , co-president of the association of muslims and arabs for a secular quebec , another group participating in the consultations . `` we do n't care if people are racist . what we care about is the fact that the today , if we talk about political institutions , is almost entirely white . what we care about is that public institutions or private institutions , the second that you go a bit higher in the hierarchy , everyone is white . '' ",
        "bowing to political pressure ? the province 's inquiry into systemic racism was to be wide-ranging , looking at issues of racism in the sectors of employment , health , education , social services and housing . the change in scope came in october , as some liberals , including couillard , began publicly musing that political backlash against the consultations contributed to the party 's dismal results in a byelection in the quebec city area . the parti québécois and coalition avenir québec both called for the work to be abandoned , saying it amounted to putting quebec society on trial . ",
        "heurtel announced the focus of the much-anticipated consultations would be shifting to improving economic opportunities for immigrants and visible minorities -- a move that was panned by some community organizations that were slated to participate in the inquiry . quebec 's controversial consultations into systemic racism get new mandate , name some of those groups have already gone on to hold their own consultations on systemic racism . reduced mandate of quebec 's racism inquiry ` very political , ' ` unacceptable , ' groups say `` we will put together a report . what the minister will do with that report , we do n't have control over , '' said the head of quebec 's lgbtq council , marie-pierre boisvert , whose group decided in late october to proceed with planned hearings with lgbtq people of colour . ",
        "few racialized participants at forum representatives from government , trade groups and work-placement organizations , as well as unions and cegeps , are taking part in today 's government-sponsored forum . when asked to comment on the fact that most of the forum 's participants are white , heurtel said : `` what we brought together are the key social economic players , including unions , chambers of commerce , specialists in francization . '' david heurtel , quebec 's immigration minister , is overseeing the new consultations , which will focus on creating economic opportunities for immigrants and visible minorities . ",
        "he said he has no problem with community group-led initiative to hold consultations that aim to go further in exploring the problem of systemic racism . in his opening remarks at the forum , premier philippe couillard did not mention the words discrimination or racism , speaking instead of problems businesses are having finding employees . `` quebec is short of workers everywhere , '' he said . `` there is a myth we have to abandon ... . no , immigrant workers are not stealing jobs .
