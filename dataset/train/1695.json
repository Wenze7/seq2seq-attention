        "the need to choose between two outstanding candidates is an interesting and a desirable dilemma for employers . however , as an employer , you need to act fast and decide which one to hire . if you do n't know how to decide between the two , below you can find some ideas . try to find out who is more eager to work for you : try to determine how badly they want to work for you . they can both seem eager but one might be already employed and looking to make a move just to get out of the status quo or be able to negotiate a higher salary and the other one might be unemployed for months and is eager to start a new job . ",
        "if you can hire the more eager candidate , chances are s/he will work harder and stay longer in your company . look at their past experiences carefully : examine their resumes carefully and see how often they stay in one job . if they hop jobs frequently , then , it means that they can also quit working for you easily . try to think long term . look also for their skills and see whose skills match more with your future plans . try to determine whether they are open to learn new skills and develop themselves . ",
        "moreover , businesses are changing rapidly and therefore , try to assess whether they are open to change . see who fits the culture : invite each candidate to lunch or coffee . in this way , you can talk with them in a more relaxed setting and outside of the formal office environment . you do n't need to be alone ; you can also take a few team members with you so you have a chance to see which candidate will get along better with your team . during this informal meeting , you can also see more of the personality of the candidates and decide easier which one will be a better fit for your company . ",
        "if you still can not decide who to hire , then hire both of them . think this way , good candidates are hard to find and you have already found two so why not push the limits to work with both of them . there may be budgeting issues or organizational problems to hire two candidates but do your best to convince your higher-ups . if you can hire both of them , make sure you differentiate their roles or at least make them work on different projects . in this way , you can get an advantage of their skills in the best possible manner .
