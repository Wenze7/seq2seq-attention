",
        "they 're pretty easy to spot with a trademark chain-tread bottom and the same handmade-in-maine quality that l. l. bean has built its reputation on . the spring batch , which will be introduce in march 2018 , includes four different moccasins . the brand is brightening up the colors more with a `` flint blue , '' `` green tea , '' and `` deep fuchsia '' on tap , along with a standard black edition . they 're essentially low-cut version of their bigger brothers and sisters with moc-style lacing and the essential chain-tread . both `` batches '' carry on a proud tradition of u. s. craftsmanship that 's seen a bit of a resurgence in recent years .
