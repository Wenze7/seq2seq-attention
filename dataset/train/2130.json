        "as my profile says , i am a crypto enthusiast . back in 2011 , my boss mentioned bitcoin to me and said that it was a very promising project . i was mildly interested as it was a new technology . he was trying to goad me to buy some . `` just buy $ 80 worth , you 'll see ! '' . being a cheapskate , i declined politely . first , i was about to get married the following year so we needed every penny we can get . second , being in a third world country , $ 80 was a huge amount for me back then . ",
        "fast forward a few years later and bitcoin is booming . my boss still talked about it and i knew he had stockpiled some when he mentioned it back to me in 2011 . we were a startup and he wanted to add incentives to us employees by giving us some profit sharing -- which he followed through by giving us bitcoins based on tenure and position . being the first employee , i got most of the payload : 1 btc , valued at about $ 500 at that time . it dropped value a couple of months later . ",
        "at this point , i did n't know what to do . i believed in the technology , but there were few use cases for me . then i discovered humble bundle . it was basically a site that featured bundles of games for a dollar or what you think the games were worth . some premium games were more expensive in the sense that to get them , you needed to pay the average of what everyone was paying . this was the first site i used that actually accepted bitcoins . i was overjoyed : i did n't have to use my credit card and this meant i did n't have to go through third party currency conversions like paypal . ",
        "a couple of years later , i discovered steam also accepted btc and that fuelled more of my gaming hunger . all was good . at some point though , we had a friend who needed some financial help and while i was also a bit of pressure , i offered my remaining btc . i did leave some for myself to play with -- $ 50 in btc at that time . this was in 2016 , when btc was worth $ 660 each . i held on to those btcs , and at some point in january 2017 , i heard about ethereum . ",
        "now at first , i thought the name was cool . then i researched about it and read about the `` hard fork '' and the difference between etc and eth . i split my remaining btc -- i bought 2 eth at $ 11 each . and this was the beginning of the my real journey . the rest was just preparing for the trip . i monitored the prices and started trading and here we are . bitcoin for me was like a money tree : it just kept growing and growing . i pruned it for sure , almost to death at some point , but here it is , still alive . ",
        "i do think cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology is the future . it may not replace fiat entirely , but it will surely stay . not everyone will have a use for it , but somewhere somehow people will have a reason to use it and that 's what will keep it going and growing . here 's to a world of digital currencies and ledgers !
