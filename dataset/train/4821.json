        "more than 300 major actresses and female writers , directors , agents and other entertainment executives unveiled an initiative monday to tackle pervasive sexual harassment in hollywood and working class jobs across the united states . time 's up includes a legal defense fund that has so far raised some $ 13.4 million of its $ 15 million goal to provide subsidized legal support to women and men who were sexually harassed , assaulted or abused in the workplace . the plan gives special focus to low-wage agriculture workers , housekeepers , janitors , factory workers and waitresses . `` harassment too often persists because perpetrators and employers never face any consequences , '' read a `` letter of solidarity '' on the group 's website . ",
        "the open letter , published as a full-page ad in the new york times and the spanish-language la opinion , opens with `` dear sisters '' and closes `` in solidarity . `` time 's up also calls for more women in positions of power and leadership , as well as equal benefits , opportunities , pay and representation for women , and urges the media to turn the spotlight on abuses in `` less glamorized and valorized trades . '' `` we remain committed to holding our own workplaces accountable , pushing for swift and effective change to make the entertainment industry a safe and equitable place for everyone , '' the letter reads . ",
        "it also vows to tell `` women 's stories through our eyes and voices with the goal of shifting our society 's perception and treatment of women . `` and it calls on women to wear black at sunday 's golden globes as a statement against gender and racial inequality , as well as raise awareness about the group 's efforts . the movement was formed after a deluge of allegations disrupted or ended the careers of powerful male leaders in entertainment but also in big business , politics and the media , sparked by the harvey weinstein sexual misconduct scandal . ",
        "time 's up members include actresses cate blanchett , ashley judd , natalie portman and meryl streep , universal pictures chair donna langley , feminist writer gloria steinem , lawyer and ex-michelle obama chief of staff tina tchen and nike foundation co-chair maria eitel .   "
