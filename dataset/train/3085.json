        "ithaca , n. y. - farmers in the northeast are adapting to longer growing seasons and warming climate conditions - but they may face spring-planting whiplash as they confront fields increasingly saturated with rain , according to a research paper published in the journal climatic change . `` climate change can easily intensify agricultural susceptibility , but also presents fresh , surprising opportunities , '' said david wolfe , professor of plant and soil ecology at cornell university and senior author of the paper . for the past two decades , the northeast has been getting warmer for longer periods of time . ",
        "it also has seen a 71 percent increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation events - more than any other region in the united states , according to the paper . heavy rainfall , for example , increases the likelihood of diseases such as potato and tomato late blight , along with plant-root fungal problems that stress carrots and other root vegetables . `` heavy rains not only cause disease problems , but can prevent farmers from having access to the fields to plant in spring or to harvest in fall , '' wolfe said . while warmer temperatures expand the agricultural production season , climate change warms oceans and creates a more energetic atmosphere . ",
        "this , in turn , brings more rainfall , said art degaetano , professor of climatology and director of the northeast regional climate center at cornell . such rainfall extremes are projected to continue through the current century , according to the paper . for several years , the researchers examined the rainfall three weeks prior to the last frost . `` the date of the last frost in the spring gets earlier and earlier . but that pushes you against the time when rainfall increases the most , '' said degaetano . fresh market vegetable grower profit is based on reaching markets early , when the crop 's value is greatest . ",
        "delayed planting due to wet spring soils can have negative financial effects . farmers can try planting a field even when it is wet , but using heavy farm equipment compacts soil and decreases its ability to hold water , diminishing yield potential . the paper , `` unique challenges and opportunities for northeastern u. s. crop production in a changing climate , '' is part of a special issue of the journal climatic change , titled `` vulnerability assessment of u. s. agriculture and forests developed by the u. s. department of agriculture climate hubs . '' cornell university has television , isdn and dedicated skype/google + hangout studios available for media interviews . ",
