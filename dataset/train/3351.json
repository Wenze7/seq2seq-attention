        "starting a business is hard ... . or is it ? the truth is doing anything for the first time is as hard as you believe it to be . when you first learned to ride a bike or drive a car , was it hard ? most likely yes , because it was your first time doing it . but after a few tries it became easier . here i 'll outline 3 things you can do to make starting business easierprep your mind -- this is at the top of the list and one of the most important things anyone can do , not only if you are going to start a business , but if you want a healthier life . ",
        "we can create so many things in our minds of why we should n't start the business , why it wo n't work etc. . but here 's the catch . the same way you can tell yourself all of the ways it 's not going to work , you can tell yourself all of the ways it will work . instead of telling yourself `` i wo n't find enough customers '' , `` no one is going to sign up '' , try telling yourself all the ways it can work . for example , `` if i work hard enough i can reach my customers '' , `` if i create a compelling ad targeting specific needs i know someone will sign up '' . ",
        "make a plan - i am not talking specifically about a business plan . i ` m talking about a plan that is going to outline the tasks you will take to build your business . think of it as being your map , you are at point a and want to get to point b. stop , look around and ask , `` how is my life right now ? do i want to change it ? what do i want to change ? '' if you do decide to embark on this journey , imagine of all the benefits starting your business will have in your life . ",
        "what does your schedule look like ? who are you working with ? what does your business look like ? what impact does it have on others ? most importantly how does it make your feel . now , hold this picture in mind . this is your destination . decide - i was considering putting this on top of the list but nonetheless , deciding you are going to stick with your idea until it works is vital . even before you embark on your journey remind yourself that this is the decision you have made and are going to stick by it until it succeeds . ",
        "deciding to commit to a goal is one of the traits that successful people have and you have decided you are going to be successful , so it just makes sense to stick with it . although there are a lot more to consider when starting a business , i hope this list inspires you to keep looking for the traits you need to succeed . be sure to subscribe and keep grinding . i started a podcast on anchor soon to be on itunes , stitcher , google play music and moresnapchat : jeff . louzadainstagram : jefflouzada .
