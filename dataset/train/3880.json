        "the events industry evolves and changes every year . new trends and technologies make planning a great event easier and more secure . here are some event industry trends and ideas that we think will take centre stage in 2018 , from new social media opportunities in event marketing to sustainable environmentally-friendly practices for event venues . event marketingthe way you market your event might change in 2018 , with plenty of new ideas and strategies emerging , but also new challenges . here are just some of them : digital marketing and social media campaigns have to form a seamless part of your event . ",
        "most importantly , they have to be something your guests can really engage with , either by sharing content or adding to it . make your event marketing really stand out in 2018 by harnessing the power of social media , particularly instagram and snapchat . if it 's appropriate , make sure your event has plenty of ` photo-worthy ' moments that your guests will want to capture and share . 2 . new marketing strategiespeople are talking about drip marketing this year . drip marketing involves gradually introducing new content , relationships , and information to ease your guests into the event . ",
        "it 's all about getting people invested in your event , rather than immediately shoving a call to action at them . this can be combined with other strategies , such as a focussed social media campaign , or integrating more technology to your marketing , perhaps by using a platform that helps you distribute tailored emails to your attendees based on their personal preferences . event techwe 're always excited about new tech trends , inside or outside the events industry . here are a few things to look out for this year : dronesdrones have become popular over the last year or two as both a toy and tool . ",
        "in 2018 , they will begin to have a useful role in events . drones are especially useful in large event venues , where they can be launched above the heads of your attendees to film the event or provide extra security . although , be careful of using drones in your events : aside from privacy concerns , an untrained pilot might even pose a danger to your guests ! artificial intelligenceai has been making inroads into the events industry for a while now , and even though the kinks are still being worked out , there are a few unique ways to implement it into your events in 2018 . ",
        "for instance , chatbots that automate customer service are getting better every day , so your future events can incorporate these to provide your guests with unique , tailored insights and answers . artificial intelligence can also help provide better personalised recommendations , perhaps by using data given by attendees to link them to the most appropriate seminars , sessions , and contacts . this will have consequences for attendee engagement , which is often boosted by personal touches . livestreaminglivestreaming is already fairly popular at events , but there 's still plenty of scope for introducing it to your conferences and meetings . ",
        "it 's a useful tool for allowing people to tune into major events remotely , and also makes sharing your content much easier . many social media channels have introduced a live streaming functionality , such as facebook live , which means guests can broadcast events themselves , adding more opportunities for sharing . event securitysomething else we 've already written about is event security , both physical and online . in 2018 , there could be some new methods in play to keep you safe . new technology and stricter security procedureswith the recent events in 2017 , there will be a stricter security procedure in place and new event technology will definitely play a part in making events safer . ",
        "aside from drones , there 's also the potential of using facial recognition system as a security measure . you can already find it in computers and mobile devices , but it could also be used to welcome guests to your events and improve the check-in process . facial recognition is still in development , but it 's worth watching this trend closely . it may soon be a common tool used to make sure the right people are given access to the right places . other potential technological solutions are heat mapping and automated people counters . cyber security and gdprsome things will help as well as hinder you . ",
        "the european union 's general data protection regulation , which comes into force in march will make it more difficult to collect and store your guests ' data , but protect yours . you 'll have to make certain adjustments to the way you interact with data about your clients and attendees , which might make it more difficult to provide personalised content . however , in doing so it will support your defences against cyber threats . if you do n't know how gdpr will affect you and your events , read our guide to gdpr and event data security to help you out . ",
        "event venuesthe way your attendees interact with your event venues will change in 2018 , from new unique event spaces to sustainability . here are some of the trends to look forward to : unique venuesin 2018 , people are always on the lookout for originality and authenticity . this can also apply to your event 's venue . even if you 're planning an event in a familiar city , you can find somewhere unique that leaves a lasting impression . think about the ways the local area can influence how you market an event , and make sure your venue has plenty of scope for customisation and interactivity . ",
        "if you can host your event in somewhere vibrant and interesting , even better . interactive venues and event spacesas mentioned above , interactive events will continue to grow in popularity in 2018 . but what 's the next step ? how can your event engage all the senses ? vr is already on its way , and can create new ways of involving your attendees in events . what better way to advertise dubai at a tourism conference , for example , than to transport a guest straight into the arabian desert through using a vr headset ? to create a 3d event that involves all the senses , you can add hands-on , interactive displays and nicely-textured audio . ",
        "there are even ways to stimulate guests ' sense of smell , perhaps by periodically spraying scent into the air , although we recognise that not every event needs to integrate this ! sustainabilityby now , we 're all aware of the environmental damage caused by ordinary , day-to-day activities . the events industry is not blameless , so we can all make a difference by making 2018 the year of sustainable events . there are some easy solutions , like forgoing the use of paper for invitations and itineraries in favour of technological solutions . you could also do something to encourage reusing and recycling , like handing out free reusable coffee cups to your attendees that they can use during and after your event as a keepsake . ",
        "the events industry changes at a rapid pace . the trends we 've mentioned will continue to evolve over the course of the year , but new , unexpected ones are likely to emerge -- we 've barely scratched the surface . it can be a challenge to keep up with the pace of change , but doing so will ensure you can deliver the very finest events of 2018 .
