        "germany 's acting interior minister has lent his support to the creation of an anti-semitism commissioner in the country 's next government . thomas de maiziere nailed his colors to the mast in an interview with german newspaper bild am sonntag , following demonstrations in berlin in which people protesting the us decision to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel were reportedly seen burning the israeli flag . the creation of the role was also recommended by germany 's central council of jews as well as an independent panel of experts . `` a single crime motivated by anti-semitism is one too many and shameful for our country , '' he told the paper . ",
        "`` hatred towards jews must never be allowed to take hold of germany again . '' de maziere also said that germany `` can not tolerate '' the burning of another country 's flag as it constitutes `` the symbolic annihilation of a country 's right to exist . '' us president donald trump 's decision to recognize jerusalem as the israeli capital sparked protests outside the us embassy in central berlin and in neukoelln , a borough of the german capital known for its high concentration of immigrants . last week german police took to twitter to advise against bringing us or israeli flags along to protest rallies against the jerusalem decision . ",
        "`` any dangerous objects as well as the us and israeli flags are not allowed at the demo , '' the berlin police wrote in a twitter post ahead of a pro-palestinian rally on friday . the police also warned potential rally participants that the officers would carry out personal searches and would be accompanied by interpreters to monitor for `` offensive utterances . '' `` burning a flag is not a crime , whether it be israeli or american or from any other nation '' berlin police spokesman thomas neuendorf explained to broadcaster deutsche welle . `` the only exception is , for instance , when a flag is taken from an official building such as an embassy and burned . '' ",
        "three months on from its election in september , germany is still without a functioning government . not having won a majority , chancellor angela merkel , the christian democratic union leader , has been frustrated in her attempts to enter into a coalition with the christian social union in bavaria . one of the main sticking points in negotiations is immigration , which the csu wants to limit to 200,000 people in the coming year .
