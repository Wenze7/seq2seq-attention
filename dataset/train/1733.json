        "rep. praymila jayapal , d-wash . , is boycotting president trump 's upcoming state-of-the-union speech , joining a list of four democratic house members that is sure to grow . `` i 'm here on martin luther king , jr. , day to say i will not be going to the state of the union , '' jayapal said in a video . `` i think it is absolutely unacceptable to see the racism and the hatred coming out of the white house in a way in which this president is fueling the flames of divisiveness across the country . ",
        "`` it 's not the first time jayapal has avoided trump 's company . she stayed away from last year 's inauguration , choosing instead to hold a seattle office roundtable with young undocumented immigrants , the so-called `` dreamers '' whose status in america is now threatened . jayapal cited trump 's remarks to a meeting with members of congress last week , in which he described african nations as `` shithole countries , '' said he did not want immigrants from haiti , and suggested that people from norway be welcomed . related : a day with rep. pramila jayapaltrump is `` demeaning entire countries calling them remarkably vulgar terms , '' jayapal charged . ",
        "on sunday , in tweets and a brief exchange with reporters , trump hit back , saying : `` i am the least racist person you have ever interviewed . `` members of congress staying away from state of the union include rep. john lewis , d-georgia , the famed civil rights leader , and rep. earl blumenauer of oregon , maxine waters of california , and frederica wilson of florida . related : connelly : will 2018 political ` wave ' crest in this washington ? they will find something better to do with their time , jayapal promised . ",
        "the boycotters will hold `` our own state of our union to talk about our opposition to these racist policies that are being put out of the white house and to make sure we put our own aggressive vision of what our america looks like as we take it back . `` jayapal is serving her first term in congress . she has already been identified as a house member to watch by both the politico website and cnn . she represents a seattle-based district that is one of the most liberal in the nation .
