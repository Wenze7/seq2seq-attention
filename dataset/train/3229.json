        "the latest gta 6 release date rumor suggests that the biggest video game of all time could arrive later than expected and hoped for . with gta online still doing excellent business for rockstar , it is anticipated that gta 6 may not appear for quite some time . but the latest gta 6 release date rumor will still be exciting for fans of the vastly popular series . indeed , with rockstar still able to populate the gta online universe with some exciting content , there is little need for the software house to rush out the gta sequel . ",
        "the recent release and popularity of the so-called doomsday heist underlines this , and recent revenue figures for gta online have also been outstanding . this is still an incredibly popular aspect of the gta 5 title , and one that has ensured that online play will be a central focus of gta 6 . gta 6 release date rumor . meanwhile , onto the gta 6 release date rumor . the notable michael pachter , a video game analyst for the wall street journal , suggests that we may have to wait several years until gta 6 arrives . ",
        "pachter suggests that the game will not be released until 2021 , with a variety of factors contributing to this conclusion . `` and rockstar , the only announcements they 've ever made more than a year before launch was because the launch itself was delayed . so best case , gta 6 gets announced in 2020 for a 2021 release , '' stated pachter . however , this gta 6 release date rumor can be considered somewhat positive for those eagerly awaiting this game , as some analysts had previously suggested that 2022 was a more realistic target . ",
        "rockstar is currently busy putting the finishing touches to red dead redemption 2 , meaning that gta 6 will be on the backburner for a little while longer at least . no need for gta 6 . and with rockstar in an extremely strong financial position , there is absolutely no need for the gta 6 title to emerge any sooner than 2021 . there is no doubt that red dead redemption 2 will receive a massive reception from gamers , and rockstar no doubt has significant plans up its sleeve in order to deliver ongoing online content for this game as well . ",
        "while rockstar is undoubtedly a developer with massive resources , it should also be noted that its talented staff are split very thinly at present . gta 6 will not be a major focus of the publisher for at least another 12 months , meaning that the gta 6 release date rumor unfortunately looks all too accurate . e3 whispers . however , another gta 6 release date rumor sees the game being unveiled for the first time at the e3 trade show later this year . of course , this will not necessarily impact on the actual release of the game , but some whispers have suggested that a teaser trailer of gta 6 could shockingly emerge . ",
        "this would undoubtedly be the headline grabbing news of the e3 event were it to come to fruition , but this does seem somewhat doubtful . it has also been suggested that red dead redemption 2 will be actually released at the e3 conference , with rockstar delivering a double whammy to blow away all of the competition at this major trade show . however , these do sound very much like internet rumors , as rockstar has no real need to generate publicity for games as massive and significant as red dead 2 and gta 6 . with the original gta 5 title having been released on the playstation 3 and xbox 360 back in 2013 , this means that there will be an approximate eight-year gap between gta games . ",
        "this is a significant departure from the days of vice city and san andreas , but it is the sort of developmental cycle that we can become accustomed to with aaa games in the contemporary climate . and there is massive pressure on rockstar to deliver with gta 6 , considering the critical success of the gta 5 release . while the gta 6 release date rumor will not be hugely popular considering the massive appetite for the release of this game , a shoddy sixth major iteration of the video game series would be unbelievably damaging to both the brand and rockstar itself . ",
        "raking in revenue . recent figures indicate that the gta online game banked over $ 415 million in net revenue during a single quarter . this indicates that the game is still generating over $ 1 billion annually , with income actually increasing recently , rather than decreasing as would probably be expected . the gta online universe remains rich , intriguing and challenging , and this is reflected in the number of active players still enjoying this title . the recent release of the doomsday heist has been particularly well-received , with many gaming publications suggesting that it effectively represents an extension of the main game . ",
        "for rockstar to be able to deliver single-player quality content in the multiplayer aspect of a major title is a superb technical and logistical achievement , and opens up huge possibilities for the gta 6 release . online focus . there is no doubt that online play will be a significant focus of this game when it emerges , and this has even led to some publications suggesting that gta 6 could be entirely online . this is highly unlikely , though , as rockstar has always prided itself on delivering compelling narratives , meaning that there will certainly be a massive single-player version of the gta 6 , regardless of how profitable and powerful the online gaming universe may become . ",
        "while any gta 6 release date rumor which suggests that the appearance of the title is some way away will be unpopular , at least fans of the gta series now have the opportunity to be realistic . gta 6 will be a multi-billion-dollar game , and one that will be simply critical to the future of rockstar . while the developer reportedly has many years of ideas left for the gta series , there is still a challenge for rockstar in providing new gta games that really move the series forward technically . to achieve this with gta 6 will undoubtedly take several years and a huge amount of manpower , and thus it is a sensible decision for rockstar to put off the release of this game for as long as is necessary .
