        "italy on wednesday launched a pioneering programme to identify people with the highest risk of developing alzheimer 's in the hopes of treating them early , as the country waits for a new wave of more effective drugs . the screening project known as `` interceptor '' aims to better determine who will most benefit from these future treatments , which are expected to be costly and have significant side effects . `` alzheimer 's is a global problem that needs to be , if not solved , at least managed with maximum urgency , '' italian health minister beatrice lorenzin said in presenting the programme . ",
        "according to lorenzin , one million people in italy suffer from dementia , with 600,000 having alzheimer 's . `` these numbers will rise in europe and in developed countries as the population ages , '' she added . with an average age of 44 years and nine months as of 2016 , italy has the oldest population in europe and the world 's second-oldest after japan . that prompted italy 's government to take the lead in preparing for more effective drugs expected in 2025 , the minister said . interceptor researchers will study patients with mild cognitive impairment , which can affect memory and language skills and is often a precursor to dementia or alzheimer 's . ",
        "project supervisor paolo maria rossini said that of the 735,000 italians who currently have mci , half will develop alzheimer 's . `` to give this medicine to more than 700,000 people would bankrupt the system in two years , '' rossini said . interceptor then aims to identify the 50 percent of italians with the highest risk of developing the disease . the eu country has committed 3.5 million euros to the 54-week project , which will follow 400 volunteer patients with mci aged between 50 and 85 . `` we will be the first country in the world to have such measures in place before the first drug is introduced , '' rossini said . ",
        "more than 50 drugs are being developed in the hopes of slowing down or stopping alzheimer 's , a syndrome in which cognitive ability , emotional control , and social behaviour deteriorate . the world health organization estimates that a new case of the incurable disease is diagnosed every four seconds .
