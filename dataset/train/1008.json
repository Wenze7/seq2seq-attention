        "` masaan ' director neeraj ghaywan slammed fellow filmmaker vivek agnihotri on twitter for bringing up caste equations into everyday life , urging people to separate caste from their achievements . in light of the unrest in maharashtra over clashes between dalits and maratha groups , agnihotri had tweeted an earlier experience where he narrated how the grandson of a dalit leader was enjoying a ` business class ' seat in an airlines . questioning the caste dynamics in society , agnihotri in an attachment to his tweet , had written that the ` pyramid is inverted ' . he also pointed out to the fact that despite being a brahmin , he had been relegated to a less comfortable space , while the dalit leader in question was seated in the business class . ",
        "responding to agnihotri 's tweet , ghaywan - a dalit himself - tweeted : . ghaywan said that while he was a dalit , he had achieved all that he had in life , without using his caste identity . he further took a jab at agnihotri , offering to give up his business class seat to the latter , the next time they were on the same plane . ghaywan 's shut-down response found him many admirers on twitterverse .
