        "or how to science the shit out of mediumi recently published a story in p. s. i love you , originally entitled how to be powerful in relationship , and was then surprised to discover that , even though it was getting a lot of views , it was being read much less than i expected . confused , i reached out to my friends on facebook for help : hey y ' all , does anybody want to help me out with something related to my writing ? / please could i have some help ? something strange is happening with the following article . ",
        "it 's had 3,410 views but only 174 reads . this represents an extremely low read-to-view ratio . my articles usually have read-to-view ratios of between 25 % and 78 % , most often around 40 % . i do n't know if people are clicking on the article and bookmarking it to read on the weekend . if this is true , then the ratio may increase later . it 's also possible that there is something really off-putting in the content of the article or in the relationship between the picture/title and the content . is there something about this article that would likely make someone view it , but then stop reading it part-way through ? ",
        "note that for the people who do read through it , 16 % clap , which is a normal clap-to-read ratio . i have been through this article many times , and i have thoroughly reviewed and revised it . it should be really high quality , informative , and a pleasure to read . however , all this work does not seem to have increased the read-to-view ratio . the request generated several observations . one that really stood out was from my friend robbie , an astute observer of human nature . he wrote : ... i noticed reading the first three paragraphs ... that the writing was masculine , the headline appealed to the feminine . ",
        "this is of course terribly subjective and , but i think in general your writing style is masculine : linear , rational , explanatory . and this headline seems more likely to draw in readers operating in their feminine . so i can imagine someone getting turned on by the headline , clicking through and then losing interest because of the tone . this is a guess , and it would be really interesting to see a gender breakdown of the analytics . the original version of this article had been written as response to a question from a reader of another one of my articles about relationship . ",
        "because the foundation of this article was to explain something -- rather than to tell a story or reveal my feelings -- it has a particularly masculine flavor . i quickly looked for , and found , some evidence to support this hypothesis : i just looked at the names of the people who have clapped for `` how to be powerful in relationship . '' there is a surprising number of male first names , assuming that the publication demographic is female . so that supports the hypothesis . i suddenly became aware of something that should have been obvious to me . ",
        "two of the main publications that i have been writing for are very different in this regard : p. s. i love you and hacker noon . the first appeals much more to the feminine perspective , while the latter appeals much more to the masculine . i realized that i had written a very masculine hacker noon style article about relationship , and published it in p. s. i love you , which appeals more to the feminine . at this point , i had two choices : i could either re-write the article from scratch to appeal to the feminine , or i could change the title to draw in more people who are more comfortable with a masculine perspective . ",
        "i chose the latter , and changed the title to the most important relationship skill . this title implies that the article is going to explain something and teach a skill , and not just any skill , but the most important relationship skill . rather than just changing the title , i decided to run an experiment . this was my first real experiment on medium . before making the change , i captured all of the stats for the article . then i made the changes , waited for some time , and compared the original stats with the change in stats following the change in title . ",
        "as with any good scientific experiment , i made sure to change only one parameter at a time , and this time i changed only the title . here are the results of the experiment : notice that the reads/view jumped from 6 % to 20 % , which is still relatively low , yet still much higher than 6 % . the way that the number of reads dropped after the change was normal and expected and was related to the article aging . even though the number of views naturally dropped by 38 % , the number of reads increased by 90 % . ",
        "i want to emphasize here that changing the title did not appear to have a significant effect on the number of views , yet the number of reads increased massively , even while the number of views dropped . this is as if the article was changed simply by changing the title . in fact , what i believe changed is the demographic that was drawn-in by the title . it seems that the changed demographic was more interested in reading about relationship from a masculine perspective . the number of fans/read did not change when the title was changed , but the claps/fan reduced a lot . ",
        "i hypothesize that this reflects a difference between masculine and feminine approaches to applause on medium . i have noticed that the claps/fan on my hacker noon articles is much lower than the claps/fan on my p. s. i love you articles . i imagine that readers of p. s. i love you are much more likely to be effusive with their praise than the measured appreciation of hacker noon readers . this article has now had 13k views and 2.7 k reads . despite its shaky start , it now has an overall average reads/view of 21 % , which is roughly the same as the reads/view that the article was experiencing in the experiment after changing the title . ",
        "and as i write this , the article has received 4,345 claps , which is more than any other article i currently have on medium . conclusionsyou can change how your story is received by readers just by changing its title . science the shit out of things every now and then . clap effusively for this article . go ahead and test the 50-clap limit . follow me here on medium , to get more goodies like this .
