        "our pop culture expert on the lessons she 's learned from one of america 's greatest living writersbim adewunmithe glamour of joan didion , 83 , lies not in the many incredible photographs of her during her long life . nor is it in that horrible quasi-sheen that we associate with surviving terrible loss . it 's not in the lifestyle choices she made -- living in new york one year , relocating to a home right on a california beach another -- and it 's not in the interactions she had with hollywood royalty , from warren beatty to harrison ford . ",
        "it does not lie in the era-defining work she published in the 1960s and 70s , solo or co-written with husband john gregory dunne . no , the glamour of joan didion is merely in her willingness to try things . truly , there is nothing more luxe than that : the decision to dip your toe , your foot , your leg and eventually your enitre body into a new endeavour , and just do it . related : why i 'm channelling blanche duboisin joan didion : the centre will not hold , a netflix documentary produced and directed by didion 's nephew , the actor griffin dunne -- the writer is endlessly watchable . ",
        "she is still a sure speaker , and her hands dance in front of her when she 's being emphatic . but it 's all the stories she pursued , the diversifying of her skill set , from magazines to screenplays , as well as the journey into motherhood : all those opportunities grabbed at , with both hands , that really seize you . it 's nice , and useful , when people believe in you , of course . but it helps if you 're already packed and waiting at the door when chances come knocking . as we move towards a new year , the urge to take stock grows ever stronger ; arbitrary end points will do that . ",
        "so i look to an 83-year-old and remind myself of my 2018 mantra : just try .   "
