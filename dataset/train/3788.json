        "there 's something about motorcycling that makes it just ... fun . even the rare occasions i get stuck in traffic , i 'm still grinning . sure , it 's kinda dangerous , mostly down to the lack of awareness of other drivers . and it takes your absolute focus . perfect control . but it is truly joyous . it makes getting places fun . it is more than just a method of transport . it is n't all about the adrenaline . it is n't all about dodging traffic . it is all about the feeling of alertness and connection . ",
        "of living . i apologise for the rambling and waxing lyrical , my bike is in the shop when i really want to be riding it ! i have n't given the day much of a chance for anything else to happen . now that i say that , it sounds wrong . should n't be letting the day happen to me . instead i ... and you ... should be happening to the day . kick its ass ! last night i remembered reading about 10x . i 'm certainly not the first to think on the idea , as a quick google of 10x will reveal .
