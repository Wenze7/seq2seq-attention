        "apple had to rush-release ios 11.2 to tackle a nasty date-sensitive bug , leaving hopeful apple pay cash users twiddling their thumbs . thankfully , you have n't had to wait too long -- apple 's money transfer service is rolling out in the us . as promised , you can add a virtual apple pay cash card to ios ' wallet app and send venmo-style payments through your imessage chats . if you owe a friend for pizza , you do n't have to download a separate app or hit the atm to settle your debt . the feature does n't appear to be immediately available to all ios 11.2 users , so do n't panic if it is n't available right away . ",
        "and there 's no word on apple pay cash availability outside the us , so you 'll have to settle for alternatives in the near future . it 's been a long road for apple pay cash : it was originally expected to launch alongside ios 11 in september , but was pushed to a fall debut -- and clearly a late fall debut at that . still , it 's potentially significant . it gives apple a counterpart to google wallet 's peer-to-peer incarnation , of course , but it also serves as a way to keep people in the company 's ecosystem . ",
        "if you know that you can easily send cash to your iphone-toting friends , both sides of the exchange may be more likely to stick with iphones going forward . applethis article originally appeared on engadget at .   "
