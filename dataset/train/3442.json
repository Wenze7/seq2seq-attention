        "how powerful is art ? local writer and columnist nickole kerner bobley believes art is many things to many people , but for her , art is a means of healing . it can heal both mentally and physically , she said . bobley , who was raised in the woodlands but moved away at the age of 18 , said she went through a rough patch in her life roughly a year ago upon returning to her hometown . she was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and sjogren 's syndrome , two autoimmune diseases that cause tremendous joint pain among other things . ",
        "as a stay-at-home-mother , bobley often felt bored during the day while her children were in school . to keep herself busy , she decided to re-familiarize herself with the town she grew up in , which has changed greatly over the past 20 years . `` i would spend a lot of time in my car because my car 's seat heater is what really helped my joint pain , '' bobley said . `` i would drive around and discover all of the new villages and i would enjoy my car 's set heater . i would park myself in front of these art sculptures . ",
        "and as a writer i thought ` ok , maybe i 'll write about this sculpture and how it makes me feel . ' i was just trying to keep my brain active . `` bobley said she kept a journal of her thoughts and feelings about public works of art . the act of writing and expressing herself slowly began to life her spirit . with some new medication and the encouragement of her doctor to be more active , bobley decided to go where her car could n't and walked along the woodlands waterway . `` the art in the woodlands healed me . ",
        "i know that sounds silly , but it 's actually quite profound , '' bobley said . `` had i not had that assignment of things to give myself , i do n't think i would have made it to my next step , which was i did n't need the car seat heater any more . i had a cane and i had to stay active to keep my joints loose so i chose to walk the waterway . i would use the benches as goal posts for myself . `` she would walk to two benches and then go home and be with her children . ",
        "the next day she would drop them off at school and then walk two more benches or sometimes even three is she could manage . `` it was like an art crawl for myself . and that was out of sheer love of art . what happened was i forged this relationship with all of these pieces . i became really familiar with the artists , their intention , the materials they were using , '' she said . `` by the time i reached the last bench i was n't even using the cane at all . i realized by that fourteenth bench how art in the woodlands helped me . ",
        "`` bobley wanted to share her experience and help others so she went to the woodlands arts council with the idea of a social media art page where people could express how art makes them feel . with the council 's partnership , bobley 's idea quickly evolved into what is now known as artfeel . the facebook page allows residents to interact and share their feelings about local artworks . bobley also hosts artfeel live , which focuses on one piece of art per meeting and meets at 7 p. m. on the last wednesday of each month at crush wine lounge on the woodlands waterway . ",
        "there is an open microphone where anyone is welcome to share their own experience and feelings about art . some tell how a particular bench recalls memories such as a first kiss while others will recite a poem or play a song they wrote that was inspired by the bench . `` what i found through this experience was that people want to talk about art . we do n't want art to be elitist or just for academics . public art is free and it 's for everybody . so let 's celebrate it , '' bobley said . ",
        "`` what i love about it more than anything else is that when people meet through art , if they find out later that someone is republican or democrat or libertarian , it does n't matter . they already met and there 's common ground . in this time of vitriol and venom on social media and in politics , artfeel is the antithesis for that . it is a unifier . artfeel showcases art in a healing way and a unification way . and it brings people together .
