        "charly musonda needed only eight minutes against brighton to put himself on a premier league scoresheet for the first time , with an assist to victor moses . his short appearance showed his progress developing into the swing player of chelsea 's midfield and front-line . charly musonda had 11 touches and eight passes as chelsea 's third substitute against brighton on saturday . even though most of his involvement with the first team so far as been as a winger , against brighton he took on a more fluid role . most of his musonda 's actions against brighton came from dropping deep into midfield to take the ball out from chelsea 's defenders and link play to the forwards . ",
        "musonda has played on both wings and as an attacking midfielder with chelsea 's academy . this combination sets him up well to expand upon the role willian and pedro currently hold , and to provide depth once ross barkley enters the squad . since the later stages of last season , antonio conte 's preferred variation of the 3-4-3 drops willian or pedro into the midfield line , particularly late in games . the blues would be in a 3-5-2 transitioning into defence , and would form into the 3-4-3 when firmly on offence . willian or pedro would normally drop closer to the wing-backs than the centre of the pitch , buttressing the flank . ",
        "this helped chelsea see out games by slowing down the opposition 's movement through midfield and giving the blues another route to move the ball out of danger . musonda took on a similar role , although he played a bit further inside than willian would on the right . this may be a matter of his short time on the pitch as much as tactical or personal preference . however , his most memorable moment -- the pass to victor moses -- came because he dashed across the pitch as the throw-in was inbound . his one touch on the left side turned into his assist . ",
        "must willy caballero 's controlled chaos vital in chelsea winchelsea have not been able to move as fluidly between the 3-4-3 and 3-5-2 as antonio conte would want , in part because they do not have a player who can play both sides of this swing role equally well . pedro and willian are serviceable dropping into midfield . but none of the current batch of midfielders are adept at coming into the front line and being a third forward . this short-coming was likely a major factor in chelsea buying ross barkley . barkley 's best times at everton came as a central attacking midfielder playing just behind the forward line in transition and then up front on the attack . ",
        "a similar role at chelsea would have him drop deep to collect the ball , power it up the field , lay it off to a wing-back or winger and then join the front line on the opposite side from eden hazard . given antonio conte 's preference to have two players at every position , musonda will be barkley 's depth in the hybrid central attacking midfielder / winger role . given musonda 's size and experience relative to barkley , the belgian will likely see only late substitutions for the remainder of the season . the blues are at the point in the fa cup where most remaining opponents will be from the premier league , and conte will have no appetite to start musonda in the premier league or champions league with barkley and the wingers available . ",
        "but musonda will be a worthwhile substitute to introduce fresh , agile legs to replace barkley or even eden hazard for the final 20 minutes of a game . in that latter case , either barkley or musonda would move up as the `` full-time '' winger alongside the striker , and would facilitate a 5-4-1 on defence . next : reliance on foreign transfers makes homegrown rule an issuethis `` chameleon '' of the 3-4-3 / 3-5-2 is also about transitioning chelsea into the post-willian and post-pedro era . both players are reaching the age where they will see fewer and fewer minutes until transferring out . ",
