        "china will donate ballot boxes and voting booths for cambodia 's 2018 election , an official said thursday , weeks after western democracies pulled their support in protest over a crackdown on opposition politicians . the us and the european union withdrew their backing after a phnom penh court dissolved the main opposition party in november -- a move they said stripped next year 's election of any legitimacy . the ruling all but guarantees a victory for premier hun sen , an authoritarian leader who has been methodically sweeping out rivals as he looks to extend his 32-year run in office . ",
        "western powers and rights groups have warned that the unprecedented crackdown could spell the death of democracy in the southeast asian nation . but beijing -- a top ally and benefactor -- has stuck by cambodia 's side , offering to provide an array of equipment for the july 2018 election . `` china pledged to give the equipment to serve the election in 2018 , '' dim sovannarum , a spokesman for cambodia 's national election committee , told afp . he could not confirm the total cost of the donated gear , which includes computers , ballot boxes and voting booths . ",
        "the official -- who denied beijing was filling the gap left by the eu and the us -- said the chinese assistance would help `` ensure transparency , accuracy and accountability '' in the poll . china is cambodia 's biggest source of foreign aid and regularly provides electoral support , including vehicles and other supplies worth $ 11 million for local polls held this year . beijing 's total investment in the country topped $ 11.2 billion in 2016 , according to official cambodian data . the flood of chinese cash has significantly cut hun sen 's reliance on western donors , whose aid often comes with pressure to safeguard human rights and democratic institutions . ",
        "analysts say beijing 's backing has emboldened the strongman 's attack on political rivals , civil society and the press .   "
