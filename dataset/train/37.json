        "lately a lot of young woman have reached out to me on social media , through email and have asked me in-person : was it worth it getting my mba ? due to the limited time we had to discuss the matter , i wanted to take this time to write a blog about my mba journey and what you need to factor in when considering getting yours ! to start , my initial thought was not to go back to school especially after undergrad . i was living in houston , texas with my best friend and looking for a marketing job in the city . ",
        "however , due to my lack of employment preparation ; meaning when i was in college i did n't take advantage of the internships in my field . i was the one who enjoyed my summer vacations . i focused a lot of my time while i was in school on my schoolwork and working on campus in human resources and off campus as a retail associate and personal shopper for bcbg clients . when i graduated i thought well i have good grades so it should be easy to find a job ... . boy was i wrong . ",
        "my first job interview had me walking up and down houston neighborhoods in the heat and humidity trying to sell at&t u-verse . i packed up and moved back to dallas after that . plus at that time a lot of marketing jobs were in the oil & gas industry . if i was a little bit wiser back then , i would have started in oil & gas . but i 'm back in dallas . i thought long and hard about my career advancement . i knew that if i wanted to move up the corporate/professional latter or start out making decent money , i needed my mba . ",
        "just a little about me , when i say i 'm going to do something i do . i graduated may 2010 from prairie view a&m university and entered into graduate school aug 2010 at texas woman 's university . i literally got all of my documents together in less than a month and applied for grad school ... i was not playing around . while in grad school , i was working in pr for the government and doing marketing and events under my own promotional company . it was my time to gain the experience that i missed out on during my 4 years in college . ",
        "getting my mba helped me to develop management and communication skills that i used religiously at my corporate job and as an entrepreneur . as one of the youngest in my class , my peers were senior managers and directors of companies throughout the dfw and being able to work alongside them helped grow my network . another great thing about my mba program was that my professor of managerial marketing & communications was also the vp of marketing at my job . i had the upper hand at school because i could talk to my professor about how to grow a business using marketing communication strategies and then turnaround and have the same discussion with him at work ! ",
        "! can we say boss moves ! !! for me , getting my mba helped me set myself a part from my professionals peers . a lot of them did not have their mba or were even considering going to school . twenty-three years old with an mba and bba looked hella good on my resume . when i applied for an international business position for jcpenney 's , i was able to start out making more money than the other employees in the same position and i was able to negotiate for more money when it was time for a promotion . ",
        "in all , getting my mba was the best decision i made for myself because i knew what i lacked but i also knew what i could gain from getting my mba . now for you considering going back to school , you have to ask yourself these following questions before you take a leap in higher education : .
