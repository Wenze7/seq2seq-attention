        "cnn anchor don lemon is blasting donald trump , saying the president and his words are responsible for a recent threat of violence against the network and its journalists . on tuesday news emerged that a 19-year-old michigan man , brandon griesemer , had made 22 phone calls to cnn between jan. . 9 and 10 , threatening to kill cnn journalists over `` fake news . '' `` there 's nothing random about this . nothing , '' said lemon . `` this is what happens when the president of the united states , donald trump , repeatedly attacks members of the press simply for reporting facts he does not like . '' ",
        "man arrested after threatening cnn employees over ` fake news ` at one point during the monologue , lemon addressed the president directly , saying that he knew he watched the show . `` heard from a number of very credible sources from within the white house that you watch this show , '' said lemon . `` so , mr. president , i 'm speaking directly to you . we are not the enemy . we are not trying to silence you . it is the job of the free press to report the facts , to ask questions , tough questions , ones you do n't like , even if you do n't like the facts or those questions . ",
        "no matter how many times you attack us as fake news , we will continue to do our jobs . '' lemon also played a montage of trump disparaging the press at public events . trump , who once made appearances on lemon 's show , has long since soured to the cnn host . in tweets and elsewhere he has often targeted lemon and his commentary . in the past he has called the host a `` lightweight '' and `` dumb as a rock . '' .@dbongino you were fantastic in defending both the second amendment and me last night on @cnn . ",
