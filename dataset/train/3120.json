        "french company netatmo is adding one more way to control your smart objects around your house . you can now talk and control with all your connected devices using a chatbot in messenger . the feature is now live in english , with more languages coming later this year . search for the netatmo smart home bot in messenger to start using it . netatmo has always tried to embrace as many ways as possible to control your devices . you can control your netatmo devices using siri and apple 's homekit , an amazon echo device and anything that comes with alexa , google home and now messenger . ",
        "you 'll be able to type straightforward queries , such as `` turn on the lights in the living room '' and `` adjust the temperature in the bedroom to 72 Â° . '' but the chatbot will also handle more complex queries , such as `` who 's at home right now '' and `` what 's the weather like right now . '' netatmo says that the chatbot is going to get better over time once you start using it . i 'm still not sure the connected home is going to happen . but i believe people will need many different ways to control their devices . ",
        "there wo n't be an amazon echo in every single room , and it 's also quite convenient to control your home while you 're already texting a friend . i hope netatmo is going to release its chatbot in more messaging apps though . the company first started with a sophisticated connected weather station but has since expanded to more product lines . netatmo now sells indoor and outdoor security cameras , connected thermostats and radiator valves , an air quality monitoring device . last year , the company announced a couple of partnerships with existing home appliance brands to connect everything in your home . ",
        "for instance , home makers can now buy connected switches from legrand and connected windows from velux . this program is called `` with netatmo '' . chances are you wo n't change your window just so that it closes automatically when it rains . that 's why netatmo targets construction companies that want to build and sell connected homes from day one . so far bnp paribas real estate and vinci immobilier have built around 140 apartments with netatmo solutions . so it 's not a huge market for now , but the company is going to roll out connected radiators with groupe muller called intuiv with netatmo . ",
        "it 's a smart heating device that automatically adjust the temperature based on user habits . netatmo has developed a connected module that is compatible with many different groupe muller radiators that have been sold since 2000 . slowly but surely , netatmo is expanding its product range to all sorts of appliances and use cases . netatmo _ intuitiv _ bellagio-anthracite-ambnetatmo _ intuitiv-dans-bellagio-horizontal-aplatnetatmo _ intuitiv-dans-bellagio-horizontal-zoomnetatmo _ mockup-iphone + module _ print view slideshowpreviousnextexitthis article originally appeared on techcrunch at = txtlnkusaolp00000595 .
