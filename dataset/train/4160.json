        "ottawa -- canada is shooting back at american criticism that it is being inflexible and unconstructive at the north american free trade renegotiation that has resumed this week in montreal . canadian officials are taking direct aim at the narrative that its negotiators are being inflexible -- or even obstinate -- when it comes to discussing the controversial u. s. proposals to raise continental content on automobiles , scrap the dispute resolution mechanism , and institute a five-year sunset clause . they say canada has tabled complete chapter proposals on more than half of nafta 's 30 sections , and has put forward substantive proposals and text on every part of the entire agreement already . ",
        "senior officials with direct knowledge of the negotiations discussed the canadian approach with the canadian press on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the ongoing negotiations . with written canadian proposals sitting on all tables , the sixth round in montreal is about returning in earnest to the bargaining to find a creative space that works for everyone , officials say . canada put most of its text on the tables by the end of the second round , and all of it by the third , officials said . the so-called american poison pills on autos , dispute resolution and the sunset clause were tabled after that . ",
        "that makes them counter-proposals as far as canada is concerned , they added . because of that , canadian officials are perplexed by reports the trump administration is annoyed at canada 's unwillingness to engage , as well as its insistence on including so-called progressive trade elements . all four tenets of canada 's progressive agenda -- gender , labour , environment and indigenous issues -- are on the agenda for talks this week , officials said . foreign affairs minister chrystia freeland hosted mexican economy minister ildefonso guajardo in toronto on monday in attempt to compare notes on the upcoming nafta round . ",
        "`` the two agreed that all parties must show goodwill and that negotiators must continue to focus on issues that will promote economic prosperity in north america . both ministers committed to achieving real progress during this round of nafta negotiations in montreal , '' freeland 's office said in a statement that appeared aimed directly at u. s. trade representative robert lighthizer . environment minister catherine mckenna was in mexico city on monday , meeting with mexican environment secretary rafael pacchiano alam√°n . nafta 's environment chapter was at the top of their agenda . mckenna said canada and mexico are on the same page about the issues , including the right to regulate the environment at home free from foreign trade challenges and the need to take action on climate change . ",
        "both countries want that reflected in the agreement but the united states , not so much so far . `` we are very aligned with mexico when it comes to the environment chapter and i think we 're making steady progress with the u. s. , '' said mckenna . it 's `` absurd '' to say something like an environment chapter is threatening the negotiations , she added , noting that the u. s. said at the outset they wanted nafta 's side chapter on the environment negotiated right into the agreement . lighthizer is to be in montreal next monday to close the sixth round with freeland and guajardo . ",
        "freeland and lighthizer are working on a meeting thursday or friday at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland . the montreal talks are unfolding under the ever-present threat that president donald trump will trigger nafta 's six-month withdrawal clause . freeland , prime minister justin trudeau and other cabinet ministers say they are prepared for anything but are emphasizing their hope for a deal . mexico has been pushing a vigorous plan b agenda , to compensate for a possible u. s. withdrawal and is communicating that to the trump administration , according to sources familiar with that country 's negotiating position , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of sensitivity of the talks . ",
        "mexico is finishing up its free trade agreement with the european union , which is happy to provide dairy products to replace american products . the eu `` is keen to get that part of the market , '' one source said . mexico has spent 10 months talking to argentina and brazil to find new sources of corn and wheat . `` we are already looking for places to buy -- in case -- and the americans know that . '' international trade minister francois-philippe champagne rejected the u. s. administration 's grumbling about canada 's recent sweeping complaint with the world trade organization about u. s. trade practices , as well as canada 's insistence on a progressive trade . ",
        "champagne told reporters in montreal on monday that from canada 's perspective , those are n't the toughest part of the talks . rather , it 's the same issues that `` were difficult at the time of brian mulroney , so we 're talking about chapter 19 . there are things about procurement , there are things about the sunset clause . '' as for the wto complaint overshadowing discussions , champagne brushed off its impact and said canadians expect their government to be firm in its response to punitive u. s. trade sanctions . `` canadians want us to be constructive ... canadians expect us to be creative , but at the same time , canadians expect us to be firm when it is about key sectors like supply management , '' he said . ",
        "`` i think it 's quite appropriate to be firm and to stand our position and to say that we can engage constructively . and between friends you can also be clear when things do n't work out . '' -- with files from sidhartha banerjee in montreal . mike blanchfield , the canadian press .   "
