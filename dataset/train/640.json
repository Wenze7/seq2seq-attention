        "nowadays , everybody knows how to take pictures . we can buy whatever camera we want . there are so many options we can choose from . even our smartphones makes it so easy to take pictures . i think photography was never so ` easy ' . so the question is , why would anybody want to shoot film ? what is so good about it ? shooting film may seem like a step back . many people may remember the times when their parents would carry big cameras , many rolls of film and spend lot of time developing the film or waiting to get the film developed . ",
        "it all seemed very complicated . when i tell someone i shoot film , they get very surprised , they start to ask me many questions and i feel like i am from another planet . shooting film todaywe can see film is gaining its popularity and fame again . people shoot film because they like the look , colors , grain . some shoot film because they love the process of developing . others may love the approach of shooting film , the way you feel when you shoot it or even think . the reason why i shoot film is , it helps me to be a better photographer . ",
        "it helps me to get more experienced . although , it may seem like a step back in the world of photography , shooting film will help you to think before you click the shutter . it will help you to understand what is important . so i would totally recommend it to anyone who wants to get better in photography . here are few steps you need to consider when starting to film photography . buy a manual film camerathe first thing you need is a camera of course . it has to be a film camera that is manual . ",
        "it means that you have to set everything to make a good photo . it is the right opposite of just pointing your camera and clicking the shutter . manual camera will slow you down . it will force you to stop , think , set the camera and then shoot . playing with exposure , shutter speed , iso is the right way to go . there are many manual cameras available . i started to shoot with canon ae-1 , which is a great camera for starters . you do n't have to buy the fanciest and most expensive camera , like leica or hasselblad . ",
        "the most important think is to buy a manual camera . also , consider the film you want to shoot . you can choose from 35 mm film or 120 film . i would recommend 35 mm because it is cheaper , more available and easy to `` play '' with , and also , you can get it developed almost everywhere . capture everythingnow , when you have your camera , it is time to get out and shoot . practice makes perfect . without going out , and actually shooting you wo n't get any experience . shoot whatever will seem interesting to you . ",
        "experiment and try new filmsevery film is made differently , and so if you do n't like the look of one film , you can choose another one , until you find the ` right ' one . you will be able to see how every film reacts . the beauty of shooting film is in the film so do n't feel that you can not switch between the films and shoot whatever you want . a good color film to start is kodak colorplus 200 , fuji c200 , kodak gold 200 , fuji superia x-tra 400 or kodak ultramax 400 . ",
        "try them all . do not be afraid to make mistakesone thing that prevents the beginner from getting better in any field is fear of making mistakes . fear of failure . actually this fear is the reason of failing . therefore , it is important to realize that everyone starting in photography is and will make mistakes . nobody is perfect and if a photo you 've taken does n't look good or an error was made , nothing terrible will happen . errors are the source of experience and they help us move forward ! so shoot shoot shoot !
