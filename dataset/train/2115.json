        "iran 's supreme leader has ordered the revolutionary guard to loosen its hold on the economy , the country 's defense minister says , raising the possibility that the paramilitary organization might privatize some of its vast holdings . the comments this weekend by defense minister gen. amir hatami appear to be a trial balloon to test the reaction of the idea , long pushed by iran 's president hassan rouhani , a relative moderate . protests over the country 's poor economy last month escalated into demonstrations directly challenging the government . but whether the guard would agree remains unclear , as the organization is estimated to hold around a third of the country 's entire economy . ",
        "hatami , the first non-guard-affiliated military officer to be made defense minister in nearly 25 years , made the comments in an interview published saturday by the state-run iran newspaper . he said supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei ordered both the country 's regular military and the guard to get out of businesses not directly affiliated to their work . `` our success depends on market conditions , '' the newspaper quoted hatami as saying . he did not name the companies that would be privatized . the guard did not immediately acknowledge the supreme leader 's orders in their own publications , nor did khamenei 's office . ",
        "the guard formed out of iran 's 1979 islamic revolution as a force meant to protect its political system , which is overseen by shiite clerics . it operated parallel to the country 's regular armed forces , growing in prominence and power during the country 's long and ruinous war with iraq in the 1980s . it runs iran 's ballistic missile program , as well its own intelligence operations and expeditionary force . in the aftermath of the 1980s war , authorities allowed the guard to expand into private enterprise . today , it runs a massive construction company called khatam al-anbia , with 135,000 employees handling civil development , the oil industry and defense issues . ",
        "guard firms build roads , man ports , run telecommunication networks and even conduct laser eye surgery . the exact scope of all its business holdings remains unclear , though analysts say they are sizeable . the washington-based foundation for defense of democracies , which long has been critical of iran and the nuclear deal it struck with world powers , suggests the guard controls `` between 20 and 40 percent of the economy '' of iran through significant influence in at least 229 companies . in his comments , hatami specifically mentioned khatam al-anbia , but did n't say whether that too would be considered by the supreme leader as necessary to privatize . ",
        "the guard and its supporters have criticized other business deals attempting to cut into their piece of the economy since the nuclear deal .   "
