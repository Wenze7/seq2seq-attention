        "prague -- far-right populists in europe vowed saturday to work together to create a new model of intercontinental cooperation that is far removed from the european union . leaders of parties from france , the netherlands , italy , austria , britain and other countries met in prague to discuss ideas for europe 's future under the headline `` for a europe of sovereign nations . `` they attacked the eu for its migrant policies , accused its leader of trying to create a super state run by brussels and praised u. s. president donald trump 's approach to migration . ",
        "marine le pen , leader of france 's far-right national front , blamed the eu for getting `` everything wrong . '' `` because we love europe , we accuse the eu of killing europe , '' le pen told reporters . she said parties like hers want to save europe `` by preserving nation-states . '' `` we are not xenophobes , we are opponents of the european union , '' le pen said . `` i think this is something we have in common , because the european union is a disastrous organization which is leading our continent to destruction through dilution by drowning it in migrants , by the negation of our respective countries , by the draining of our diversity . ",
        "`` geert wilders , founder of the dutch anti-islam party for freedom , followed suit . `` my party is convinced that the netherlands would be better off outside the european union , and it will be better for our economy , for our security , '' wilders said . wilders singled out immigration and `` islamization '' of europe as the most pressing issues . `` we must have the courage , to introduce travel bans as president trump has done in the united states , '' he said . `` we must have the courage to restrict legal immigration instead of expanding it . ",
        "we must have the courage to repatriate the illegal immigrants . `` parties with anti-immigration platforms have been making gains at the polls in europe , although wilders and le pen both ran unsuccessfully this year for the top political posts in their countries . more recently , austria 's far-right freedom party became a partner in a new coalition government after receiving more than a quarter of the vote in a parliamentary election . le pen called it `` very good news , excellent news for europe . `` the meeting was hosted by the most anti-migrant , anti-muslim , anti-eu party in the czech republic , freedom and direct democracy . ",
        "it finished fourth in october 's parliamentary election , winning 22 seats in the 200-seat lower house of parliament . the party wants to ban islam , which it calls an ideology of hate . its chairman , tomio okamura , is currently a deputy speaker of the house . hundreds protesters joined a peaceful rally against the far-right gathering in prague on saturday .
