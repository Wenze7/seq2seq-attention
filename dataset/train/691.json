        "the russian finance ministry plans to increase purchases of foreign currency for its reserves next year , reducing ruble volatility in a presidential election year , the finance minister said on tuesday . after two years of recession and a draining of reserves amid a sharp drop in the price of oil , russia 's key export , the finance ministry has decided to replenish coffers and insulate the ruble by setting a budget rule . according to the rule , the finance ministry will buy dollars and other foreign currency when russia 's crude blend urals url-e trades above $ 40 per barrel , the level factored into the budget . ",
        "the higher the oil price , the bigger the forex purchases would be . finance minister anton siluanov said the finance ministry could spend around 2 trillion rubles on foreign currency next year if urals prices are at $ 54-55 per barrel . urals crude last traded at $ 64.35 per barrel . `` this would more than offset the envisaged reserves spending next year , '' siluanov said , adding that his ministry would increase foreign exchange purchases next year to level of up to 70 percent of non-oil and gas budget revenues from around 30-40 percent at present . ",
        "speaking to reporters , siluanov said the increased foreign currency purchases would reduce the ruble 's vulnerability to volatility on capital markets in 2018 . president vladimir putin , who will seek re-election for another six years in march , said this year the ruble 's stability was more important than its actual exchange rate . if oil prices average $ 60 per barrel , the finance ministry would buy around 2.8 trillion rubles , siluanov said . analysts at ing had predicted the finance ministry would increase its foreign currency purchases to more than $ 27 billion in 2018 from around $ 15 billion in 2017 . ",
        "the central bank carries out these purchases for the finance ministry but does not consider them as interventions aimed at bringing the ruble to a certain level as the rouble has had a free-floating status since 2015 . siluanov said he expected the ruble , trading in a range between 57 and 59 versus the dollar for a few weeks , to stay at these levels in 2018 if oil prices hover near $ 55 per barrel . the ruble forecast is valid if `` there are no new additional sanctions and nuisances due to external restrictions , '' siluanov said . ",
        "russian authorities largely dismiss risks of new u. s. sanctions , which could be imposed in 2018 and could ban purchases of russian debt , but are still bracing themselves for possible shocks in 2018 . budget deficit . russia is likely to run a smaller-than-expected budget deficit this year as some of the planned spending has been postponed until next year , siluanov said . the 2017 deficit is now seen at 1.5 trillion rubles , which accounts for 1.6 percent of gross domestic product , siluanov said . the earlier approved budget plan envisaged a budget deficit of 2.1 percent of gdp . ",
        "the budget deficit target for 2018 stands at 1.3 percent of gdp . part of the budget shortfall next year will be covered by russia 's no. 1 state-owned lender sberbank that is expected to channel around 130 billion rubles worth of dividends to the budget , siluanov said .   "
