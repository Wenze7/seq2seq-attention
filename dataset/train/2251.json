        "we 've been talking about spacex 's new rocket , the falcon heavy , for years now , so it 's exciting to see that the launch vehicle inching closer to its maiden voyage . last week , the rocket was raised to a vertical position on pad 39a before being lowered to make way for the falcon 9 zuma mission , which launched on sunday evening . now , the falcon heavy has returned to the pad to prepare for the static fire test , which will take place this week . the test window is tomorrow , january 10th , between 1pm and 7 pm et . ",
        "#falconheavy static fire window confirmed to be 13:00-19:00 est tomorrow , wednesday 10 jan. . #spacex -- chris g - nsf january 9 , 2018the static fire test means that the heavy duty rocket is almost ready for its first launch , the payload of which will be one of musk 's tesla roadsters . during the test , all 27 of the falcon heavy 's merlin engines will fire at full thrust while the rocket remains on the launch pad . it 's a chance to test all the engines at once and monitor the startup process , pressure , temperature and flow of the propellant . ",
        "if the test is successful , a launch date could be scheduled very soon . it 's currently targeted for takeoff in late january . there were questions about whether falcon heavy would be delayed because of rumors surrounding the fate of zuma . while spacex maintains that the falcon 9 launch vehicle performed as expected , it appears that the satellite is n't functioning . the payload from northrop grumman was a secret , and therefore it 's hard to get any facts about its status . however , spacex made clear this morning that the rocket was n't at fault for any failures , and that the schedule of falcon heavy would not be affected .
