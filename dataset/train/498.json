        "happy holidays : one thing is as sure as me already being four large coffees in to start the day : despite what looks to be a solid holiday shopping season for the nation 's retailers , the front part of 2018 will bring dour news of more mass store closures and bankruptcies . consider this as your setup to the grim news that stands to crush the recent revival in retail stocks -- there have been 50 retail bankruptcies this year , more than all of 2016 and the highest number since 2011 , according to a new report from s&p global market intelligence . ",
        "the report calls out sun pacific holding , sears holdings and razer as three especially vulnerable retailers right now . keep in mind these bankruptcies have happened in the face of improved consumer spending . now get out there to support your local retailers this coming super saturday ... every buck matters in the battle with amazon . here comes the auto sales boom : there is more to the auto sector than discussing what gadget tesla 's elon musk is working on . for instance , how about finding companies -- unlike tesla -- actually making money that can be invested in ? ",
        "the auto research team at jefferies appears to get have gotten the memo . jefferies said tuesday that 2018 will be a decent one for the auto sector , fueled in large part by u. s. tax reform serving as a stimulus to car sales . in this environment , auto stocks should do well , notably tire plays such as goodyear , jefferies said . other bullish calls include fiat chrysler , which jefferies said could double over the long-term . given fiat ceo sergio marchionne being very focused on maximizing shareholder value through doing deals , it 's hard to argue that call . ",
        "it 's op-ed time : well , here goes any chance of talking with the management team at campbell soup . but this has to be said : if you are a campbell soup shareholder , you have to be fuming that the current management team is signing off on yet another massive acquisition in pretzel maker snyders-lance . look what has happened under the more than six-year tenure of ceo denise morrison . since morrison was appointed ceo on aug. . 1 , 2011 , shares have gained 53 % vs. a 137 % gain for the s&p 500 . ",
        "the stock has barely outperformed shares of general mills . pepsico 's stock is up 90 % during the same span despite its exposure to sluggish soda sales . campbell soup sales have fallen for three straight years , according to bloomberg data , despite several big acquisitions in plum organics and bolthouse farms . return on invested capital has gone from 19.64 % in the fiscal year ended july 31 , 2011 , to 12.67 % in the fiscal year ended july 30 , 2017 , bloomberg said . sure , you can say campbell has been dealt a bad hand in challenging conditions in center aisle supermarket categories like soup . ",
        "thanks , millennials . even still , with all these acquisitions should n't campbell soup be doing better ? since it 's not , and acquisitions ca n't seem to solve the core issues plaguing the business , should n't the business be put up for sale to benefit shareholders ? what 's hotcanada gooseshares of the outdoor apparel maker have basically gone up in a straight line since the march 16 , 2017 ipo . what a story . i am talking to canada goose ceo dani reiss later on today , so stay tuned for more . if you have questions in advance , fire them off on twitter to @briansozzi .
