        "lansing , michigan -- the former sports doctor who admitted molesting some of the nation 's top gymnasts for years was sentenced wednesday to 40 to 175 years in prison as the judge declared : `` i just signed your death warrant . '' the sentence capped a remarkable seven-day hearing in which scores of larry nassar 's victims were able to confront him face to face in a michigan courtroom . judge rosemarie aquilina said nassar 's `` decision to assault was precise , calculated , manipulative , devious , despicable . '' `` it is my honor and privilege to sentence you . ",
        "you do not deserve to walk outside a prison ever again . you have done nothing to control those urges and anywhere you walk , destruction will occur to those most vulnerable , '' aquilina said . former usa gymnastics doctor larry nassar during a sentencing hearing for sexual molestations on january 24 , 2018 . when the hearing ended , the courtroom broke into applause . a prosecutor said nassar found competitive gymnastics to be a `` perfect place '' for his crimes because victims saw him as a `` god '' in the sport . `` it takes some kind of sick perversion to not only assault a child but to do so with her parent in the room , '' prosecutor angela povilaitis said . ",
        "`` to do so while a lineup of eager young gymnasts waited . '' she described the `` breadth and ripple '' of nassar 's sexual abuse as `` nearly infinite . '' `` what does it say about our society that victims of sexual abuse have to hide their pain for years when they did nothing wrong ? what does it say about our society when victims do come forward ... and are treated as liars until proven true ? '' povilaitis said . nassar turned to the courtroom gallery to make a brief statement , saying that the accounts of more than 150 victims had `` shaken me to my core . '' ",
        "he said `` no words '' can describe how sorry he is for his crimes . `` i will carry your words with me for the rest of my days '' he said as many of his accusers wept . he faces a minimum prison term of 25 to 40 years . one of the first athletes to publicly accuse nassar of sexual assault was the last victim to offer statements at his sentencing hearing . rachael denhollander is a kentucky lawyer who stepped forward in 2016 after the sports ' governing body was accused of mishandling complaints of sexual assault . ",
        "she said nassar groped , fondled and penetrated her with his hands when she was a 15-year-old gymnast in michigan . denhollander 's statements to michigan state university police put the criminal investigation in high gear in 2016 . `` you have become a man ruled by selfish and perverted desires , '' she told nassar , who worked at the university and usa gymnastics , the governing body that also trains olympians . nassar , 54 , pleaded guilty to assaulting seven people in the lansing area , but the sentencing hearing has been open to anyone who said they were a victim . ",
        "his accusers said he would use his ungloved hands to penetrate them , often without explanation , while they were on a table seeking help for various injuries . the accusers , many of whom were children , said they trusted nassar to care for them properly , were in denial about what was happening or were afraid to speak up . he sometimes used a sheet or his body to block the view of any parent in the room . `` i 'd been told during my entire gymnastics career to not question authority , '' a former elite gymnast , isabell hutchins , said tuesday . ",
        "aquilina has praised the victims who have appeared in her court since jan. . 16 , calling them `` sister survivors , '' while also assuring them that their perpetrator will pay . the women have included olympians aly raisman , jordyn wieber and mckayla maroney . hutchins and mattie larson , a former national gymnast , talked about how nassar won their allegiance with candy , olympic trinkets and encouraging words while they were under constant scrutiny from demanding coaches . brooke hylek , a gymnast who plans to compete in college , heaped scorn on nassar . `` i can not believe i ever trusted you , and i will never forgive you , '' she said tuesday . ",
        "`` i 'm happy you will be spending the rest of your life in prison . enjoy hell by the way . '' emily morales had a softer message . `` i want you to apologize to me right here , '' the 18-year-old told nassar . `` i want to forgive you , but i also want to hear you tell me that you regret all the hurting you caused . '' he did . she replied with , `` thank you . '' nassar has already been sentenced to 60 years in federal prison for child pornography crimes . ",
