        "it 's not just the ecb that was humiliated for holding steinhoff bonds : so were all major us banks . as we have documented this earnings season , one after another major us bank , from jpm , to citi , to bank of america and goldman reported that they have suffered direct losses in the hundreds of millions on their exposure to the scandal-plagued company . according to a bloomberg summary , the 4 of the biggest us banks have revealed more than $ 1 billion in mark-to-market losses and charge-offs on margin loans and other debt tied to the embattled south african retailer in their q4 results . ",
        "citigroup was at the top , with $ 370 million in losses , followed by bank of america corp. 's $ 292 million , jpmorgan with $ 273 million and goldman with $ 130 million . `` once in a while , something does n't turn out the way we want because that 's what the definition of taking risk is , '' bank of america ceo brian moynihan told reporters wednesday , saying the incident would n't change the lender 's risk appetite . to an extent the losses and charge-offs were expected : one month ago we reported that global banks were on the hook for some $ 21 billion as part of the steinhoff implosion . ",
        "what is surprising , however , is seeing just how substantial the losses are when flowing through the p&l , and also how profound the artificial sense of security created among the banking community , in this case thanks to the ecb also being on the hook for losses due to its purchases . the bigger question is what happens if and when other fallen angels suffer the same fate as steinhoff , are downgraded from investment grade to junk , and are kicked out of the ecb 's balance sheet , forcing us banks to take losses as they did with steinhoff . ",
        "how much of a problem will this be for draghi , and us commercial banks ? as we showed last month , using s&p 's historical rating transition matrices , bofa estimates that â‚¬ 7bn of corporate bonds that the ecb own will end up as fallen angels prior to maturity . the chart below shows that over the last decade , the price drop severity of fallen angels has been declining . but if the ecb become a motivated seller of downgraded credits , we feel this dynamic could reverse . in conclusion , and in bank of america recently warned , credit investors should anticipate more pronounced price drops in names that migrate from ig to hy next year . ",
        "`` after all , there may now be a big buyer behind some of these credits that chooses to become a seller upon downgrade . `` the silver lining - if only for deep junk investors - is that falling knives , and further bank losses , may soon produce a source of technically cheap bbs for yield-starved investors to mull over . then again , if for whatever reason the rug is pulled out from under the junk bond market , suddenly everything else will be surprisingly cheap too ...
