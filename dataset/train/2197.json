        "good evening and welcome to sports mole 's live text coverage of the premier league clash between liverpool and west bromwich albion at anfield . the hosts come into this match having dropped out of the top four courtesy of results last night , but victory here would be enough to lift them back into the champions league places . west brom , meanwhile , will begin this match in the relegation zone following a 14-game winless run in the premier league , and should they fail to emerge victorious tonight then they would set an unwanted club record of 16 consecutive games without a win across all competitions . ",
        "make sure you do n't miss a moment of the action courtesy of our minute-by-minute updates below . 7.14 pmas for west brom , jurgen klopp suggested in the build-up to this match that he did n't expect the baggies to go with three strikers like they did against swansea , but the teamsheet suggests that alan pardew will stick with the 4-3-3 formation . jay rodriguez does drop out of the side to be replaced by the more defensively-minded james mcclean , but salomon rondon and hal robson-kanu retain their places in a lineup slightly more attacking than we were expecting to see from the visitors . ",
        "7.12 pmbefore tonight klopp had made 59 changes to his starting lineup this season - 20 more than any other club in the premier league and behind only manchester united 's class of 2002 for most at this stage of a season in premier league history . the german makes a further six changes tonight too , including a surprise start for loris karius in goal ahead of mignolet . alexander-arnold replaces gomez at right-back , while georginio wijnaldum and emre can also return to the side in place of oxlade-chamberlain and captain milner . 7.10 pmsalah has scored 13 goals in his last 12 games for liverpool and , fresh from being named the african footballer of the year , he will be looking to continue that remarkable form this evening . ",
        "west brom can not afford to focus solely on the egyptian , though , with firmino and mane both capable of hurting the visitors as well . the last time all four played together liverpool beat spartak moscow 7-0 , so this will be a huge test for west brom tonight . 7.08 pmcoutinho has been directly involved in 12 goals in his last 11 premier league games for liverpool , scoring seven and assisting five in that time , but the real star of the show so far this season has been mohamed salah . the winger 's stunning strike against everton in sunday 's derby was his 19th of the season from just 24 games in all competitions , already equalling his roma tally for 2016-17 which took him 41 matches to reach . ",
        "it is more goals than any liverpool player has managed in a season since luis suarez left the club , and also more than any other premier league player this season . Â© offside7 .06 pmwhat can we make of those two teams , then ? well , there is really only one place to start and that is with liverpool 's attackers as the front four are all present for the hosts tonight . klopp received some flak for the controversial decision to rest coutinho and firmino for the match against everton at the weekend , and there were reports that he would continue his rotation this afternoon with salah perhaps missing out , but the brazilian duo , salah and mane are all involved from the off here .
