        "the punisher star jon bernthal has a blunt message for his character 's alt-right fans , as well as some thoughts about gun ownership and gun control . the former walking dead actor graces the cover of esquire 's winter issue and confessed to being a bit difficult to work with on the set . `` ask people on set and they 'll say i 'm difficult , '' he said . `` but it 's not about my trailer or the food ; it 's always about making the role make sense . '' when asked about the punisher symbol being spotted on military helmets in iraq and biker jackets -- as well as seen on the shoulders of alt-right protesters at the white-supremacy rally in charlottesville , virginia , last year , the actor initially replied : `` i feel honored to play a guy who people putting their life on the line identify with . '' ",
        "and when asked about the alt-righters specifically ? `` f -- them . '' what 's perhaps more interesting is the actor 's take on gun control . the punisher is famously and controversially a gun-embracing character , especially when compared to other superheroes who never use guns . but bernthal advocated for at least some restrictions beyond what we have now , especially given events like last november 's texas church shooting where man with a history of mental health issues killed 26 people . `` sometimes when people write about me , it sounds like i 'm glorifying the violence ... '' the actor said . ",
        "`` i 'm a gun owner . i have a gun in my house to keep my family safe . i 'm trained in that gun 's use . i know how to keep it away from my kids , and i know how to use it if i need to . should there be a way that a guy with mental issues like the asshole in texas ca n't get guns ? absolutely . we have to have a dialogue , and that 's not happening . '' the punisher ` s first season debuted in november on netflix ; a second season has been ordered . "
