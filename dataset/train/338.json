        "theresa may 's new environment plan sets ambitious goals for plastic waste reduction . but there 's lots of room for slippage . one goal is to eradicate all `` avoidable '' plastic waste , though it 's not clear how `` avoidable '' will be defined . a few concrete measures are now in place , such as the 5p plastic bag charge being extended to cover all businesses in england . and , in order to tackle the spread of tiny plastic particles , the government recently announced a ban on microbeads in personal care products . but such measures , even if adopted worldwide , would n't actually wipe out these `` microplastics '' in the environment . ",
        "the problem is that all plastic ends up tiny . and it persists , no matter what its size . in the ocean , even the largest and most resilient bits of plastic are broken up and degraded by the waves and sunlight until eventually these chunks measure less than five millimetres across -- about the size of an ant -- and they are classed as `` secondary microplastics '' . this type of plastic , that started out as drinks bottles , fishing gear , disposable cutlery and so on , is much more abundant than `` primary microplastics '' that started out small , such as the microbeads found in toothpaste . ",
        "microbeads are among the most familiar sources of tiny plastic pollution , but this means there are other less obvious sources of microplastics in everyday use . we call them `` stealth microplastics '' , and they include : . 1 . tyres . tyres are made from rubber and around 60 % plastic . the friction , pressure and heat of driving wears tyres down so much they produce an estimated average of 63,000 tonnes per year of plastic dust in the uk alone . if blown into the atmosphere , that dust can contribute to the poor air quality identified by the world health organisation as a cause of premature deaths . ",
        "if it is washed into drains , rivers and oceans , it is likely to be eaten by filter feeders such as mussels , entering the human food chain . the industry could move back to natural latex , derived from rubber trees , but this too would have environmental costs : expanding rubber plantations are already `` catastrophic '' for endangered species in southeast asia . 2 . synthetic clothing . outdoor gear , leggings , fleeces and jumpers made from acrylic and polyester , polyamide , spandex and nylon shed up to 700,000 microfibres with each wash . ",
        "once in water , microfibres are difficult to filter out and studies have shown that these fibres are now being found in tap water in many countries . in the us , 94 % of samples tested contained fibres . airborne , from friction or dryer lint , they settle as dust that can be inhaled and it is thought that toxins from the fibres can be absorbed through the lungs . in the environment they are eaten by fish and other animals , often in preference to food . the solution ? fitting all washing machines with filters and choosing natural fibres . ",
        "3 . tennis balls . their fuzzy outer layer is made from pet , the same material that 's used to make plastic milk bottles . just like tyres , this plastic gets worn away with use , becoming dust . 4 . laundry and dishwasher pods/tablets . all kinds of detergents and disinfectants with scrubbing agents have microplastics such as polyethylene or polypropylene . these are the same beads banned in cosmetics . it would be better to use a natural material such as ground coconut shell . 5 . cigarette butts . filters are made from cellulose acetate , a non-biodegradeable plastic . ",
        "they can shed microfibers and , once used , give off high levels of toxins , including nicotine . cigarette butts are a serious pollutant in the oceans and are the most commonly recovered item in beach cleanups . 6 . glitter . beloved of kindergarten craft teachers , most glitter is made from pet or polyvinyl chloride film and is very hard to dispose of . you could instead get biodegradable cellulose film glitter , made from eucalyptus trees . 7 . wet wipes . baby wipes , hand wipes , make-up removing wipes , all of these products are typically made from polyester , polyethylene , and polypropylene -- or a mixture of those plastics and natural fibres . ",
        "not only do they block sewers and cause `` fatbergs '' , the plastic does n't break down . they are also a source of plastic fibres . a traditional all-cotton flannel is the eco-friendly choice . 8 . tea bags . not entirely biodegradable , many teabags actually contain a polypropylene `` skeleton '' . that skeleton then breaks into tiny pieces when the paper breaks down in the compost or soil . ask the manufacturer if your brew is plastic-free or switch to loose-leaf tea . 9 . paint . plastic dust from the thermoplastic paints used for road markings , ships and houses is found across the surface of the oceans . ",
        "but not all paints contain plastics . look for paints that use linseed oil or latex as binders . 10 . takeaway cups . paper takeaway cups are lined with a layer of polyethylene . like teabags , the paper element breaks down , but the plastic breaks up into tiny pieces if the cup is littered or composted . mixed materials need to be handled by a specialist recycling facility . or you could bring a refillable mug . if we want to have a real impact , we need to address all plastic waste : that which we see and a lot that we ca n't .
