        "paris -- france will abandon divisive plans to build a new airport in the west , the prime minister announced wednesday , ordering activists protesting the project for nearly a decade to leave their makeshift settlement . security forces began deploying extra forces to the area near nantes ahead of the announcement , among the most delicate since president emmanuel macron took office eight months ago . `` the notre-dame-des-landes project will be abandoned , '' prime minister edouard philippe said . `` this is a logical decision , considering the dead-end where this project has found itself . `` he noted that plans for the airport were first made 50 years ago and `` the debate should have ended long ago . ",
        "`` philippe said activists who have camped out for years to protest the airport in notre-dames-des-landes must start clearing roads they have blocked or police would step in . he gave the squatters until spring to pull up their stakes . the activists occupying the site quickly cried victory , raising their fists and popping open bottles of bubbly , while opponents railed . nantes mayor johanna rolland said the national government `` ceded to blackmail and threats . `` philippe said the decision was an `` impossible dilemma '' because of the passions for and against the airport , but that his decision aimed to calm the volatile situation . ",
        "earlier attempts to dislodged the squatters had ended in violent clashes with police . proponents argue the region needs a larger airport to boost its economic prospects . opponents say the airport is unnecessary and a symbol of exploitative globalization . philippe grosvalet , president of the loire-atlantique department , told bfm tv that the government had `` ceded to disorder . `` he also said the prime minister 's decision `` tramples democracy , '' a reference to a 2016 referendum in which the notre-dames-des-landes airport received the majority of votes . farmers who clung to their land had joined forces with the anarchists against the airport . ",
        "the prime minister said farmers whose land was expropriated can get their land back if they choose .   "
