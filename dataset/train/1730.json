        "rauner 's latest campaign commercial takes another shot at j. b. pritzker , claiming he used insider 's clout to cut his property taxes . chicago -- gov. bruce rauner 's latest digital campaign commercial takes another shot at democratic candidate j. b. pritzker , claiming he used insider 's clout to cut his property taxes . `` madigan , pritizker , berrios : insiders working the system at your expense , '' the commercial , titled `` nightmare for illinois , '' begins . `` now j. b. pritizker 's joining in , funneling cash to madigan and getting property tax breaks on his mason from berrios . '' ",
        "the madigan-pritzker-berrios insider triangle is bankrupting illinois . retweet/share if you agree . they have to be stopped ! #twill #ilgov pic . twitter . com/oxc09ffyjm -- bruce rauner december 12 , 2017 . `` he rips toilets out a mansion he buys , and he saves himself $ 230,000 , thanks to berrios , '' rauner said . they 're totally in bed with each other and it 's wrong . '' but , has rauner appealed his taxes , as well ? `` we have not ! '' the governor said . cbs 2 political reporter derrick blakley says rauner did not , but the condo association for his lakefront high-rise certainly did . ",
        "thus , rauner benefited from the same system he has been known to call `` corrupt , '' by receiving hefty assessment reductions on his downtown penthouse . in 2008 , his assessment of $ 244,833 was cut by $ 94,745 ; 38 percent in 2012 , his assessment of $ 300,791 was cut by $ 22,776 ; 7.5 percent in 2015 , his assessment of $ 350,409 was cut by $ 65,854 ; an almost 19 percent reduction rauner 's reductions did n't come from cook county assessor joe berrios ; instead , they came from the cook county board of review . ",
        "and although gov. rauner is calling for berrios to resign , mayor rahm emanuel is not . `` the voters decide whether somebody should stay or go -- that 's what elections are about , '' he said . often , taxes can increase even though as assessment is reduced . therefore , it is hard to determine whether rauner 's taxes actually went down . the point being -- some of the same candidates who are criticizing the property tax system , also took advantage of it when they had the opportunity .
