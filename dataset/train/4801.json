        "i 'm still in the process of getting to know myself better , explore new fields and finding that suitable place for me . one thing i do know about myself however is that i 'm a very emotional person . you can easily get at me even when you do n't mean too . by the way this is my first ever post on here , yeah ! it took a while for this step . i 've always tackled the fear of people spotting an error in my work . fear of people thinking i 'm not smart enough . ",
        "the funny thing is despite these emotional struggles , i was still keeping up a big smile and no one could tell i was battling with anything . for a 26 year old , i feel i 'm not where i should be and that 's enough to scare the shit outta me . each time i want to give something a shot , my brain just reflex back to that mistake i 've made in the paste and how people laughed at me , after which i conclude it 's best not to it anything a try . one time , i thought people gave me space and do n't talk to me cos they think i 'm not smart enough . ",
        "i know there 're a lot of people out there going through the same phase or even worse . you may not be as smart as people want you to be but you 're `` you '' , you just need to be the best version of yourself . strive to make things happen , do n't be limited or discouraged by the fear of mistakes you 've made in the past or what people have to say about you . it 's fine to make those spelling or grammatical errors , it 's ok to pronounce that word wrong . ",
        "it 's ok to think you 're stuck in a place for just too long . every expert was once a beginner , you 'll definitely get past this stage . do n't let your emotions be your limitations . your mental health is in your hands . take responsibility of your life and give that thought a try , chances are you 'll probably fail again but guess what you can give it a try again and again . do n't let fear limit you . be the master of your will . fear is a crippling emotion that can wreck you . ",
        "it does n't matter how many times you 've fallen down , how they 've looked down on you , look yourself in the mirror and say to yourself , i 'm not a failure , i 'll conquer you this limitation called fear . get a grip of yourself , try new things . it 's ok to make silly mistakes or even pronounce that word wrong in the presence of the person you intended to impress . you 'll get past this stage . fill your mind with positive thoughts at all time , convince yourself by saying positive things out loud to yourself . ",
        "read , learn and make cautious effort at improving yourself . do n't be against yourself by letting your mind be your limitation . take charge of your emotion and put them under control . you deserve the best only if you believe . your fears can surface into several emotional problems like depression , low self esteem and could ultimately lead to you contemplating suicide , if you 're not careful . it 's a dark dark road , trust me . way out of this . i had a total change when i was able to identify firstly , that fear was my problem , things became even more better when i realized that i was always scared of giving new thoughts or ideas a try cause i feared i would me mocked or viewed as `` not smart . '' ",
        "problem identification is the first step towards getting a hold of yourself only this time you just have to be specific and tackle your challenges from the root . identify that specific thing that 's truly stopping you from making that move . be cautious of your thoughts pattern , people or events that scares you . whenever you get scared of making same mistakes you made years ago , look yourself in the mirror and say positive things to your self . you need to feed your mind with all the positivity you can . when ever you have a trigger of fear , flip it over , think of the best thing that could happen . ",
        "say affirmative words to yourself till you 're able to convince yourself . taking deliberate steps and making efforts toward improving yourself . what 's that thing you fail at which has made you a scared person over time . do n't accept defeat just like that . if you fear public speaking , start by talking in a group of 5 , increase the number . it 's true when they say practice make perfect . when you take action and face your fears , they become weaker , because you realize that reality is n't nearly as bad as your imagination .
