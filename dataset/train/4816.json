        "live calgary more streams providing fire protection for the runways at the calgary international airport is a money-loser for the city of calgary . fire chief steve dongworth wo n't disclose how much the calgary airport authority annually pays the city for staffing its fire station . but he does say that the yearly payment falls $ 500,000 short of the city 's actual costs . for that reason , the city has given yyc until the end of september to negotiate a new contract or calgary firefighters will no longer provide runway incident protection at the airport . for his part , the chief would like to reach a new deal with the airport that ensures at least a break-even situation for his department . ",
        "`` we 'd like to still be there in 10 , 20 years time but we 're not going to do it on the back of the calgary taxpayer , '' said dongworth . city firefighters work 24/7 at airport fire station the fire department ensures there are four firefighters on duty at all times at the yyc fire station . dongworth said that requires a total of 20 firefighters to be assigned to the job to ensure round-the-clock coverage . however , he suggests there should be more than four firefighters on site given the need for an initial response to an incident involving a large aircraft . ",
        "that too -- not just the cost -- is part of the negotiations with yyc . `` we are going to make sure that if we do have staff there that they are well enough staffed to provide an adequate response for an emergency there . '' the chief said the area that his staff are responsible for has increased . a couple of years ago , yyc opened a new runway along with associated taxiways . a new international terminal also opened in 2016 , although any fire or medical calls inside that building are handled by calgary fire crews who do not work at the airport station . ",
        "budget cuts increase pressure on fire department the fire department is under financial pressure . city council voted in november to cut $ 4.5 million dollars from the department 's budget for 2018 . dongworth said he 's optimistic those cuts can be made without directly affecting front-line service to calgarians . yyc owns the airport fire station as well as the specialized firefighting trucks based there so it theoretically could hire its own firefighters for the facility . the airport authority declined to do an interview on the matter . however in a statement , yyc spokesman dean paddock said : `` we are doing our due diligence and reviewing the options available to us to ensure seamless and safe operations . ",
        "our guiding priority will continue to be the safety of our passengers , partners and employees .
