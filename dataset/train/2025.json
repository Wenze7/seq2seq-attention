        "a 42-year-old programmer threw himself out of the window of the 26th floor of an office building of a telecommunications company in shenzhen , south china 's guangdong province , last week . beijing news commented on monday : . it is said that the man committed suicide after he lost his job . it would not be that easy for a programmer of his age to secure another well-paid job when the industry is laying off employees . and with two children and two pairs of elder parents to care for , the man and his wife had a heavy financial burden . ",
        "the man 's death has drawn attention to the crisis of the middle-aged in big cities , many of whom are under great pressure from work , life and health , especially in rapidly changing industries such as information technology . many people in their late 30s and 40s pay high mortgage payments as they bought their homes when house prices were at their peak , and they can not afford any disturbance , let alone the rupture , in their income . in other words , although they are middle-income residents of big cities , their decent lives are precariously balanced . ",
        "despite this , they are reluctant to go back to their hometowns , where the job opportunities in their professions might be fewer and the pay would be lower than in the big cities . also , the fast changes in sectors such as information technology mean it is more difficult for individual programmers to start their own businesses from scratch . to found startups entails large sum of input in capital and human resources . it would be considerate for the companies to offer necessary psychological counseling for their employees before laying their cards on the table .
