        "rufc - warne ` win gives lads confidence for monday'rotherham united manager paul warne told radio sheffield that it was good to end the year with a win . speaking after the two-one win at walsall , the millers boss said , ` i do n't think today was a classic , it was a little bit too much end-to-end and i think both teams looked tired at times . ` the couple of times we came under pressure i thought the lads put their bodies on the line for me and there were a few good performances going forward . ",
        "` bally was excellent again , richie towell did really well in the middle of the park and i thought fordey was a constant threat . so there are a lot of positives to take . ` the millers opened the scoring in less than sixty seconds this afternoon , semi ajayi getting the goal with his manager saying , ` it 's always nice to score but i 'd rather not see eighty-nine minutes left on the clock when we 're one-nil up ! it was a good start but if we 'd have capitalised on that and got another i think we 'd have had an easier day at the office . ",
        "their goal saw a midfield runner get in-between our two centre-halves although he finished it well . apart from that i do n't think they were enough of a threat . ` we were getting good crosses into the box and i thought jerry was good for us but neither him or bally today looked like they were going to get on the end of the crosses coming into the box so i changed it at half-time and kieffer came on and does what he does very well and made the second goal . ` to win again today gives the lads massive confidence going into the game on monday . ",
        "` the millers are at home on monday when third place blackburn are the visitors .   "
