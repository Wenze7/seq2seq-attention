        "it 's that time of year fans . it 's my favorite time of the year what with the lights up everywhere and the crisp air and hockey going in full swing . time to break out into song . on the first day of bluesmas , my true blue gave to me , an adidas jersey under my tree ! and we 're off with a bang . at least i made the first day rhyme , unlike last year 's version . do n't expect that to continue though . anyway , the st. louis blues adidas jersey is very good . ",
        "most of that is because it is almost exactly like the reebok jersey . in fact , adidas did the smart thing and left the vast majority of their new nhl jerseys alone . that 's much better than what we originally expected . though i liked the world cup jerseys , i was afraid we would see what we have seen there and in some of the pregame warmup jerseys . many of those have the trademark adidas three stripes down the sides . st. louis , mo -- december 01 : st. louis blues goalie carter hutton wears a special hockey fights cancer warmup jersey with special mask in warmups before a nhl game between the los angeles kings and the st. louis blues on december 01 , 2017 , at scottrade center , st. louis , mo. . ",
        "it 's not a terrible look , but it is not that fitting of the nhl right now . we 've become accustomed to certain styles on nhl sweaters and the three stripes really stick out and not in a good way . as austin powers might say , those just ai n't my bag , baby . adidas did the smart thing , then , by barely tweaking the look of the existing style . for example , the blues jersey is almost exactly the same . some of the lines on the shoulders and cuffs are slightly more or less angled , but the overall look is the same . ",
        "the main difference is the flashy nhl logo on the collarbone and the lone adidas logo at the base of the neck , which looks perfectly fine . most of the other teams in the league did the same thing . you can check out a good comparison look here at coolhockey . com . the vast majority look the same , with the adidas ones often taking a lightly slicker edge to them . mainly just a couple differences with the neck and cuffs though . the main differing ones are colorado , who went more back to their look from the team 's inception , nashville , which got rid of some of the shoulder clutter , and new jersey . ",
        "oddly , the devils might be the strangest change , since they dropped the bottom stripping all together . i do n't care for their look much , but a lot of that is i grew up liking scott stevens and the devils of the mid-90 's , so i 'm used to them looking a certain way . thankfully , the blues hardly changed a thing . as mentioned , there is less drape to the shoulder striping , but that 's really about it . of course , you could go into technicalities and discuss the fabrics and lightness of the sweaters . ",
        "that does n't affect most fans because we do n't need to be extra speedy in these things . if anything , they need to not be tight like the reebok jerseys because , i 'm sorry , but many of you were wearing jerseys that were too small . overall , adidas gets a thumbs up for their first venture into the nhl . they still have plenty of time to mess up things when they come out with third and fourth and who knows how many secondary jerseys . for now , they 've done things right . ",
        "it 's perfectly fine for everyone to want a blues jersey under their tree and not just because they 're our team . they are good looking jerseys . more from bleedin ' blue st. louis blues are deceptively good , fooling their own fans8h ago st. louis blues : colton parayko showing he 's a top defenseman1 d ago st. louis blues : pros and cons from game 32 against tampa bay1 d ago st. louis blues : alex pietrangelo out as injury bug bites again1 d ago st. louis blues : two current/one former player make 3 stars of the week2d ago it 's that time of year fans .
