        "hi , i am alberto , and i am new in this awesome app . i am a full time student in madrid , and as you can guess from the title i want to start a new hobby . i believe everyone has a hobby , as simple as it may be , but they have it . also , in my opinion , everyone in their lifetime says or thinks : `` wow , how cool would it be to do this '' but they do n't even try it . i think this happens a lot because we want to be immediately good at something that it 's not our expertise . ",
        "for example , i read a lot , and i have always been thinking about writing , but i said to myself that i will never be a good writer , no one will find my writings interesting , so why even bother . now i am trying to start writing here , and there are two main reasons why that may also help some people to start their hobby 's : 1 . lose your fear . i think i have grown up enough to understand that you have to do whatever you want . it does n't matter that no one reads you , or like your photos , just start because you like it . ",
        "learning takes a lot of time , so it is better to start small , doing it for yourself and maybe posting it here in medium , or in a blog , but do it . this way you will practice and you will see that the first 5 to 10 post wo n't be very good ones , but from there on , you will start improving a lot . learning takes a lot of time , so it is better to start small , but do it . i have experienced this for example in instagram . i have always loved photography , and at the beginnings instagram was a very big inspiration for me , and i started talking pictures and posting them , but i cared a lot about the likes , until one day i realized that , my pictures had many likes , but i did n't like them . ",
        "not because they were n't good pictures , but because i did n't enjoyed making them . now i do n't use instagram , but i still have photography as one of my favourite hobbies . 2 . have several hobbies . i think the best thing to do in life , is to have hobbies , to be passionate about something , to give live a proper meaning . but it is also important to be realistic . for example , i love traveling , cars , photography , listening to music , reading and writing , but i as a student , i do n't have much of an income , so , to carry out properly my passion for traveling and cars it is difficult for me . ",
        "but on the other hand i have my other 4 hobbies that i can make almost free and which i enjoy a lot as well . but this is not the main reason why i think you should have different hobbies . for me at least the main reason is boredom , in the sense that it 's very difficult to be all the time 100 % commited and focused on only one thing , activity or hobby , so you need to have more than one so when you are tired for example , of taking photos , disconnect , read , write something and then you will get into doing photos again with better perspective and enthusiasm . ",
        "i hope i did n't made too much gramatical mistakes , but overall i hope you enjoyed my ever first article . thanks for reading it .   "
