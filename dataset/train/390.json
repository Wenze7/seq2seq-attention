        "a few months ago , a race promoter contacted me about a new proposed series with an aggressive marketing platform , a gt spec program , and a promise that all expenses would be paid . the catch ? the series was for women only , and i would n't be allowed to continue to compete in imsa continental tire sportscar challenge or any other unsegregated series . i respectfully rejected the offer . as word got out that an all-female series was gaining traction , almost every woman competing professionally in sportscar racing in north america spoke out publicly against it . ",
        "one significant outlier was carmen jorda , former development driver for the lotus and renault sport formula one teams . and last week , she was appointed to the fia women 's commission . jorda argues that women can never compete in racing on equal footing with men because of fundamental biological differences . she proposes a solution : a women only championship to `` achieve our dreams and compete on an equal footing -- as in other sports . `` advertisementwhile , along with most female drivers , i firmly disagree with jorda 's viewpoint , our natural reactions to her statements and recent appointment have been so visceral that we may have missed some rational points . ",
        "first , her argument that women are biologically disadvantaged compared to men when competing in certain sports is valid . it is why women-only leagues and divisions exist in certain sports , such as basketball or mma . however , this argument as applied to racing seems to be based narrowly on formula one , where cars exert 5 lateral g forces every turn . the neck strength required to withstand this thrashing for roughly two hours is remarkable , and physiological differences in muscle mass and strength would , in fact , disadvantage women -- but should not be written off as unachievable . ",
        "the important question is n't whether or not women are at a disadvantage . it 's whether or not we are capable . time and time again , we have proven that we are . racing is also not cut the same in every division , and each type of racing -- from formula racing to oval racing to sports car racing -- requires a different combination of strengths , figuratively and literally . compared to f1 , most sports cars exert about half the lateral g forces , and do n't usually require extreme physical strength to drive them well . ",
        "in the imsa continental tire sportscar challenge , a two - to four-hour endurance race with two drivers , other attributes come into play , like your tolerance for heat , decision making , and strategy . this past racing season , i worked with a sports nutrition brand to help them gather data on female racers . their data demonstrated that in most circumstances , women are slightly less affected by heat than male racers of similar age and fitness level , giving us an advantage on this dimension . in other attributes , men will have some biological advantages . ",
        "contrary to jorda 's blanket statement , it 's a level playing field , on balance , for men and women in sports car racing . second , i think jorda 's solution for a women 's only series does have some merits . it could be an attractive opportunity for many women who struggle to secure sponsorship . furthermore , the platform may encourage more women to get more involved in the sport , since entering a male-dominated sport can be extremely daunting . however , the sad reality of an all women 's series , aside from the fact that it invalidates us as equal racers , is that it would n't attract enough of a fan base . ",
        "to put it bluntly -- almost nobody would watch it . women 's teams in contact sports statistically get a small fraction of the viewership enjoyed by their male counterparts , and dollars follow viewers . establishing a female series may very well erase us from the racing world . in contrast to jorda 's approach , sports car racing will thrive if it continues to encourage more female racers . we bring fans , especially those interested in unique athletes who break stereotypes . countless girls have come up to me before a race , glanced nervously , and whispered `` i did n't know that girls were allowed to race . ",
        "`` the women in motorsports that i have the privilege of knowing -- from christina nielsen to pippa mann to sarah montgomery -- are , hands down , the strongest , most driven people i 've ever encountered . they 've each built a career in an environment where they are uncommon and sometimes unwelcome . as in sports car racing , women continue to increase their numbers at the highest levels of traditionally male-dominated fields such as politics , business , engineering , and biotech . by breaking stereotypes , we hope to accelerate this process by inspiring girls to chase their dreams and to eliminate imaginary barriers so we no longer hear , `` i did n't know girls were allowed to ... `` i 'm currently working on a project that will launch in 2018 to help support girls in male-dominated fields around the country . ",
        "and while i can understand jorda 's views , i do n't endorse or agree with them . for the sake of all future female racers and the fans we strive to inspire , i hope that she takes this opportunity to grow in her role and to support all girls with drive . aurora straus just completed her rookie season in imsa continental tire sportscar challenge , co-driving with connor bloum in the no . 18 modspace porsche cayman . at 19 years old , aurora works full time for zapprx , a biotech software startup in boston , and begins her freshman year at harvard university in september . ",
        "when she is n't working at zapprx or racing , she is an active musician . she will continue competing in professional sports car racing in 2018 .   "
