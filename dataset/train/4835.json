        "while byu football had a number of players sign national letters of intent last week , the cougars will also welcome back five returned missionaries . byu football is an interesting beast . most programs sign a kid , get him on campus , mold him and see him leave in four or five years . byu signs a kid , does n't see them for two years . gives him a redshirt . then he starts playing . in short , i do n't envy the position kalani sitake is in . balancing all those scholarships and roster spots is probably a nightmare . ",
        "however , when those kids return from their missions , it 's a bit like christmas morning . we finally get to see them make some sort of impact on the field . last week , byu football welcomed in five rms that will enroll during winter semester . here they are . jeremiah ieremia , 3-star linebacker ieremia signed with byu football in 2015 before departing on an lds mission . at 6-foot-1 , 235 lbs . , ieremia has great size and is a hard-hitting linebacker . ranked the 34th best linebacker prospect in the nation in 2015 , ieremia posted 101 tackles during his senior year at hurricane high school . ",
        "there 's no telling how long it will take for ieremia to get rid of his mission legs , but once he 's back in shape , he should be a very productive linebacker . devin kaufusi , 3-star defensive end kaufusi is a legacy kid for byu football . the younger brother of bronson and corbin , devin is a massive defensive end . at 6-foot-6 , 220 lbs . , he has a great frame to build on . kaufusi did n't get a ton of attention from other schools , but that 's because he committed to the cougars way back in 2013 . ",
        "make no mistake about it , he 's a solid defensive line prospect . hirkley latu , 3-star linebacker latu was a tad lanky in high school , but he projects to be an outside linebacker with the cougars . an explosive athlete , latu is a good blitzer and excels at getting through blockers . but , based on his high school film , he appears to be decent in pass coverage too . latu had decommitted from byu football in 2015 , but ended up coming back . he 's a player to be excited about . david lui , 3-star defensive tackle lui is a talented defensive lineman that got some pretty heavy interest from the likes of ucla , utah and cal . ",
        "at 6-foot-3 , 265 lbs . , lui is a big body in the middle of the field . his high school film shows a high-motor player with a knack for wreaking havoc up front . as a senior at pittsburg high school , lui amassed 62 tackles and four sacks . skyler southam , 3-star kicker you know how byu lines up for a field goal and you groan because you know how it 's going to end up ? you know that the odds are the cougars shank the kick . get ready , because that 's an era of the past . ",
        "southam is a big-time kicker that was ranked as the no . 3 kicking prospect in the nation in 2016 . while southam was at wasatch high school , he set records for both single season field goals and career field goals . there 's a chance he may even punt for the cougars . more from lawless republic byu basketball : previewing the texas southern tigers1 d ago byu basketball : cougars outlast idaho state in potential trap game1 d ago byu football : cougars flip three-star qb wilson from boise state1 d ago byu basketball : kyle collinsworth signs two-way deal with dallas mavericks3d ago byu football : cougars sign prospects on early signing day3d ago while byu football had a number of players sign national letters of intent last week , the cougars will also welcome back five returned missionaries .
