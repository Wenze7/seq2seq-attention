        "hyundai motor group vice chairman yoon yeo-chul speaks during the company 's new year ceremony in seoul , south korea , january 2 , 2018 . reuters/kim hong-jiby hyunjoo jin and joyce leeseoul - south korea 's hyundai motor and kia motors on tuesday flagged 4 percent sales growth in 2018 , suggesting a slow recovery from a slump linked to their lack of suvs in the united states and diplomatic tensions with china . hyundai and smaller affiliate kia said demand was expected to soften in the u. s. and chinese markets as they unveiled a combined sales target of 7.55 million vehicles this year , from 7.25 million vehicles last year . ",
        "`` the market environment is expected to be difficult due to a slowdown in major markets like the u. s. and china , prolonged low growth in the global economy and trade protectionism in major countries , '' hyundai motor said in a statement . sales slumped 7 percent last year from 2016 , falling well short of the firms ' target of 8.25 million vehicles and marking their third consecutive annual miss , as buyers in china and the united states increasingly shunned sedans for suvs . a diplomatic row between china and south korea over seoul 's deployment of a u. s. missile defense system also hit the carmakers ' sales in the world 's biggest auto market , although two countries recently agreed to normalize ties . ",
        "`` this year 's target for hyundai and kia is lower than expected . it seems to be a conservative target , reflecting a slow recovery in china and ongoing u. s difficulties , '' kim jin-woo , an analyst at korea investment & securities said . hyundai motor shares ended down 4.2 percent on tuesday , and kia motors stocks finished 2.1 percent lower . the broader market rose 0.5 percent . the grim outlook came as the korean won strengthened to a more than three-year high against the dollar on tuesday , threatening the competitiveness of south korean exporters as their japanese rivals benefit from the weakening yen . ",
        "the expiration of a tax cut on small-engine cars in china also would be a negative for hyundai 's sedan-heavy line-up , they said . while hyundai motor has plans to offer more suvs in the united states and china this year , analysts said new models such as the redesigned santa fe suv may come too late in the year to significantly impact sales . hyundai motor group chairman chung mong-koo said in a statement it would `` actively venture into '' new markets like southeast asia , as protectionism was expected to grow elsewhere . south korea and the united states will hold talks on a trade deal on jan. . ",
        "5 although u. s. president donald trump has threatened to withdraw from the pact . chung , 79 , skipped his annual new year speech to employees for a second year in a row . he has not made any public appearances since december , 2016 .   "
