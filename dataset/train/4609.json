        "the youtube channel jerryrigeverything has released a video showing how the nokia 2 , currently the cheapest device offering of the smartphone manufacturer hmd global , fared against a set of durability test . the first test involves scratching the device with a mohs hardness pick set , keys , and a razor blade in order to measure its resistance to scratches . zack noted that both display and the front-facing camera of the nokia 2 are protected by a sheet of corning gorilla glass 3 , which is uncommon for low-end devices . the corning gorilla glass 3 has a mohs hardness rating of six , making it resistant to scratches from coins and keys . ",
        "however , sand can still damage the display since its particles are made from harder materials . a sheet of glass also protects both the rear camera , which is an improvement over the sheet of plastic that protects the snapper of the nokia 3 . on the other hand , the earpiece is covered with a thin sheet of vinyl . meanwhile , the frame of the smartphone , the volume rocker , and the power button are all made of metal . a burn test was conducted after the scratch test . in that test , a lighter fire was held close to the display , and then the amount of time needed for the pixels to temporarily shut down is recorded . ",
        "it took five seconds before the pixels of the nokia 2 's ips lcd display started turning black , although it ultimately recovered after a few seconds . in comparison , amoled displays , which are currently found in a number of flagship smartphones , usually get permanently damaged when they undergo the same test . last but not the least , a bend test was performed in order to determine if the nokia 2 can withstand extreme force from either the back or the front . even though a permanent kink was formed as a result of the test , the handset remained intact and usable .
