        "timaru 's mayor has n't ruled out charging airbnb providers more than their current residential rate . infometrics data released in the past fortnight highlights a 116 per cent increase in airbnb usage in timaru in the year to september 2017 . the number of airbnb listings in timaru had also grown by 96 per cent year-on-year , to the current stock of 150 accommodation options . at the same time , guest nights in the commercial accommodation sector fell by 2.4 percent . read more : in the past year airbnb providers in queenstown and the mackenzie district had come under fire for paying only residential rates despite using their home for commercial purposes . ",
        "both queenstown lakes district council and mackenzie district council charged hundreds of airbnb providers flouting the rate rules . timaru district mayor damon odey did n't rule out charging airbnb providers in timaru in the future . `` it 's something we have n't looked at , the council would have to do some consultation on . `` it 's something to keep an eye on , as a council it 's not something we have discussed or entertained , but if those numbers continue to grow we will have to have a look at what needs to be done on that . '' ",
        "odey said in a district like timaru where there might be just one family in a house , the issue of rates to pay for infrastructure might be less significant , compared to more congested areas like tekapo and queenstown where there might be two or three families living in one house . `` it needs to be equitable , it needs to be done across the board . '' odey said given the rise of modern technology there was no doubt as to the impact airbnb would have on conventional accommodation providers . `` you just have to see what uber has done to the taxi industry , '' odey said . ",
        "`` but i believe there 's always going to be a place for our conventional hotels and motels , and backpackers . '' south canterbury chamber of commerce chief executive wendy smith said despite being the largest accommodation provider in the world , airbnb was `` unregulated '' . `` where there is a shortage of accommodation airbnb and book a bach and other similar providers can create a welcome and additional supply of accommodation . `` however , without the compliance , regulations and other costs that commercial operators have to meet , it does create an un-level playing field , and has brought with it a suite of challenges . '' ",
        "smith said the question of whether to charge airbnb providers who were not paying a commercial rate would be an `` issue that the council will need to consider '' . part of that process would be looking into the `` possible implications of an unregistered market place and the impact on the business sector '' . `` the chamber will certainly be interested in supporting business owners in these areas , '' smith said . `` one area of note is that home owners need to be aware of their responsibilities under current legislation when renting out their homes and need to have checked with their local councils and their insurance companies to ensure they have coverage at least in these areas .
