        "advanced glycation end products , which have been linked to many chronic diseases , including diabetes , cardiovascular disease and cancer , build up in the body from birth due to normal metabolism but are often higher in those eating the high-fat , high-sugar , highly processed foods characteristic of the western diet . age levels have been linked to lifestyle , such as diet and exercise , and lifestyle changes were shown in previous studies at the medical university of south carolina to drive a reduction in ages in breast cancer patients . ages may also yield insight into health care disparities . ",
        "for example , black men are three times more likely to develop prostate cancer than white men and may have higher age levels due to low income , poor diet and obesity . david turner , ph. d. , assistant professor in the department of pathology and laboratory medicine at musc , in collaboration with mahtabbuddin ahmed , ph. d. , at south carolina state university , are co-principal investigators for a clinical trial that opened in january 2018 to determine if lifestyle changes can reduce ages and disease recurrence in prostate cancer survivors . although ages have been studied in other chronic diseases , such as diabetes , this is among the first trials to look at ages in cancer survivors . ",
        "the trial aims to determine whether a decrease in ages through dietary and exercise intervention can improve quality of life and decrease tumor recurrence in both african american and european american patients . funding for the trial was recently awarded to dr. turner and dr. ahmed through an nih/nci u54 study led by judith salley-guydon , ph. d. at scsu and marvella ford , ph. d. at musc . each institution is recruiting 60 prostate cancer survivors for a 12-week dietary and physical activity intervention based on cardiovascular disease rehabilitation . the physical activity intervention will be supervised and individualized for 12 weeks , with unsupervised follow-ups that continue throughout the year . ",
        "fitness trackers will be given to each study participant to track exercises for the entirety of the trial . participants will complete dietary questionnaires to track diet and document how many ages are consumed . to determine whether these lifestyle changes have had an effect on the immune system , biomarkers such as interleukin-6 and c-reactive protein and age levels will be measured . preliminary data from the breast cancer patients studied earlier show a reduction in ages without a change in il-6 or crp , which indicates ages could be a better biomarker of lifestyle changes than previously used biomarkers . ",
        "the current trial in prostate cancer survivors will enable further analysis of ages as a biomarker of lifestyle . `` this could be a real landmark study , especially if it turns out that ages are a better biomarker than what is available , '' says turner . to learn more about this and other trials at musc hollings cancer center , call 843-792-9321 . about musc . founded in 1824 in charleston , the medical university of south carolina is the oldest medical school in the south . today , musc continues the tradition of excellence in education , research , and patient care .
