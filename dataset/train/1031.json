        "kilmarnock manager steve clarke has issued the club 's official response to ian mccall 's ridiculous and scandalous comments on their young winger jordan jones , who was the subject of an insulting bid from sevco earlier in the week . mccall , as regular readers will be aware , decided people needed to hear his opinion on that , and he duly gave it on bbc scotland , saying that far from being too low an offer sevco had gone overboard . their valuation -- said to be £ 300,000 -- was , he said , too high . ",
        "he went on to list some of the player 's negative traits and valued him at just £ 150,000 . mccall , as you all know , is the manager of ayr united . i have never heard of a club boss intervening in such a manner in a transfer saga involving two other clubs . i have never heard of a club boss talking down a player who was n't even his and who had been the subject of a bid . i thought those remarks were disgraceful . so did the kilmarnock boss . and today , appearing before the media , he said so . ",
        "reminding the hacks that mccall got his team relegated last season , he suggested that it might , perhaps , be better if he minded his own business and concentrated on `` repaying the faith '' that his board of directors had shown in him . he also turned on the media for their handling of the affair , pointing out that transfer bids are `` just another part of football '' . `` there 's been nothing apart from the initial bid , i do n't understand what all the furore was about , '' he said . `` made an offer for a player , we felt it was too low and so we turned it down . ",
        "that 's it in a nutshell . '' today the media narrative has moved on , and sevco is back to trying to unsettle hamilton midfielder greg docherty with a bid reported to be `` just hours away . '' hamilton 's manager earlier this week handed over that whole issue to the board , telling the hacks that there would only be a comment when an acceptable offer had been made and accepted . if you 're on facebook , and you 're not already a member , please come along and join the celticblog page , the best celtic fan group out there at this link .
