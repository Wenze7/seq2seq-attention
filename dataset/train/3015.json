        "jerusalem - israel will allow the opening of graves believed to hold remains of children who died in the 1950s , for dna tests to help determine whether they were stolen from their parents , officials said wednesday . activists and family members believe up to several thousand babies were taken in the years after israel gained statehood in 1948 , mainly from jewish yemenite families , but also from immigrants of other arab and balkan nations . they allege the babies were stolen and given to jewish families of western origin in israel and even abroad , mainly those who could not have children themselves . ",
        "official investigations have found that most of the missing babies had died , pointing out the poor conditions in reception camps for immigrants . many families have not been convinced and have pushed for the graves supposedly holding the remains to be opened . israeli prosecutors have now agreed to a request from 17 families hoping for dna tests on the remains to determine if there is a genetic link , the justice ministry said . since a wave of yemenite jewish emigration to the newly created state of israel in around 1950 , yemenite activists have charged that hundreds of babies declared dead by doctors were actually abducted for adoption by european jewish couples . ",
        "they say the babies went missing from camps set up to host yemenites and jews arriving from other arab countries in the early 1950s . doctors at the camps told them their children had died , but refused to hand over bodies or death certificates , according to the families . in 2016 , israel 's national archive announced the launch of an online database of 200,000 documents aimed at putting to rest the decades-old allegations . the amram ngo , which has worked on the case , was sceptical that the dna tests would reveal the truth . `` this is a very complicated case and we think that the government has to recognise that a crime was committed to make progress , '' amram 's naama katihi told israeli paper maariv .
