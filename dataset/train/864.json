        "texas rangers left-hander cole hamels and family were among the millions to experience the frightening hawaii missile false alarm firsthand . according to jori epstein of the dallas news , the hamels were vacationing near maui on the morning of saturday , jan. . 14 . when the state accidentally sent an emergency alert of a `` ballistic missile threat inbound to hawaii . '' the alert , which hamels says he initially ignored , was capped by the chilling words `` this is not a drill . `` while those around his family scrambled to seek shelter , hamels says he went about his business until finally noticing that the alert was something potentially life-threatening . ",
        "hamels says there was no place to go anyway , so they hunkered down in their hotel room until the state finally acknowledged that a mistake had been made . hawaii - this is a false alarm . there is no incoming missile to hawaii . i have confirmed with officials there is no incoming missile . pic . twitter . com/dxftxidoqs -- tulsi gabbard january 13 , 2018 `` i 'm like psht we 've got 20 minutes , we 're screwed , '' hamels told the dallas news on wednesday . `` you see that , i 'm going all right we 're screwed . ",
        "we were just like , ` ok . ' `` we would 've been dead in 3 seconds so i 'm like after 20 minutes ... that 's the whole thing . i ca n't do anything about it . `` for those who read the alert right away , 38 terrifying minutes passed before the all clear came . hamels and his wife were at least spared a few seconds of terror . as for his children , hamels says they never mentioned the alert to them , electing to save them from experiencing the same anxious feelings that led to a state of panic all around them . ",
        "that 's a commendable act that shows remarkable poise and compassion in the face of potential imminent danger . some might say hamels and his wife should have reacted more urgently , but at that point they realized there was nothing they could do to protect the children physically . that was out of their hands . all they could do was their best to protect them from feeling the same fear that was overwhelming others . that 's not to say anyone deserves criticism for how they handled the situation . it 's impossible for any of us to know how we would react under those circumstances . ",
        "only those who experienced this terrifying event firsthand know how they reacted . if we heard all of their stories , we would probably learn something different from all of them .   "
