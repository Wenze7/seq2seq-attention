        "almost everyone has faced this sort of dilemma -- searching for the healthiest thing on the menu while your loved ones with the high metabolism orders the biggest , juiciest steak that 's elegantly sitting on top of a pile of buttery carbs ! it 's just does n't seem fair . yet , here you are looking at the lighter fare menu trying to decide from their 4 bland options . eat ... in moderate proportions ! it is possible to order something that 's healthy , yet tasty when dining out . it 's just requires you to educate yourself on the types of food you should eat . ",
        "unless it 's just a pile of sugar , there really is n't one thing that 's bad for you if it 's eaten in moderation . if you 're not a vegan , grass-fed beef is n't necessary bad for you either . neither are carbs -- again , as long as it is all consumed in moderate proportions . here 's the thing , restaurants do not serve their dishes in moderate proportions , so exactly how can you eat healthy ? well , there are a few ways : customize your food order . you do n't have to have high blood sugar or heart disease to follow the eating proportion and food choices suggested by the american diabetes and american heart association . ",
        "the ada says , `` you need to choose the most nutritious foods over less nutritious foods and control the size of your portions . '' aha echoes this by stating , `` the suggested number of servings from each food group is based on a daily intake of 1,600 and 2,000 calories . '' based on these two statements alone , this pretty much frees up your food choices and does n't pigeonhole your menu options . 2 . order an array of sides . this option can really benefit the vegans and vegetarians . if you 're not especially fond of any of the entrée options due to the protein or starchy choices , many restaurant menus usually offer an array of sides . ",
        "while these options are usually considered a choice to accompany an entrée or as an add-on , you do have the option of just ordering your selection of vegetarian sides that will make up a fulfilling meal . granted , not all of the sides will be vegan and carb-free . however , the proportions are typically served in either 1/2 or 1-cup proportions , so there 's no fear of overeating here ! 3 . accept something from the lighter fare menu . many restaurants are offering a lighter fair selection on their menu . not every restaurant 's lighter portion menu is awful . ",
        "some are quite tasty and reasonably proportioned . with some of these dishes , starches like pasta and rice are served and it 's all less than 700 -- 800 calories ! you 'll be surprised at how satisfying and filling a lighter fare meal can be ! 4 . exercise self-control . well , let 's face it -- if we could do this , then we would n't be reading this article ! however , it 's still worth mentioning because that 's what all this is about -- self-control at certain levels . we start off by doing the small things like choices 1 -- 3 , then we graduate to doing what we were supposed to do in the first place and that 's just knowing when to stop eating ! ",
        "when we get to this point , we can eat anything we want because we 're not stuffing ourselves even we 're not hungry ! so , start small and take it one day at a time . try step 1 for a few months , then step 2 . if you find it 's not working , then go back to step 1 and start all over again . this is n't a race . do what works for you and always challenge yourself to do better !
