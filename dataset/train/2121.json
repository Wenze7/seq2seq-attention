        "business sales boomsmall businesses were a much sought-after commodity during 2017 , with the number of sales transactions rising more than 26 percent from the previous year . that report comes from bizbuysell . com , an online marketplace for small businesses that tracks the number of transactions reported by business brokers . the company counted 9,919 sales , up from 7,842 in 2016 . the median sales price for companies was up 14 percent at $ 227,880 . in the fourth quarter , sales rose 23 percent from a year earlier . nearly 30 percent of the businesses sold the last three months of the year were restaurants , bars or other eating and drinking places . ",
        "three percent were manufacturers , and 18 percent were retailers . forty percent were service providers , in a wide range of industries from hair salons to landscapers to dry cleaners . eighty percent of the brokers surveyed expect the sales momentum to continue this year . how cold was it ? the recent wave of arctic cold , snow and ice in the midwest , east and south hurt retailers -- unless they were selling things to keep people warm . during the first week of january , demand for blankets was up by nearly three-quarters from a year ago , according to planalytics , a company that tracks weather and retailing trends . ",
        "the company is estimating demand for heaters to be up by two-thirds . that 's not surprising given that it was the coldest first week of january since 1988 and the third-coldest in more than 55 years . in new york and washington , the average daily temperature was 17 degrees lower than in january 2016 . in detroit , it was 20 degrees lower . people were hunkering down inside their homes . restaurant visits across the country were down 1.3 percent . retailers -- except for those online -- generally had fewer customers , as did entertainment businesses like movie theaters . ",
        "some potential good news in planalytics ' forecast : the cold is expected to help retailers sell their winter merchandise . that may cut down on their need to discount cold weather wear . online learningselling to other companies is a different skill from catering to consumers . for example , networking is a key part of the process . you can learn more at an online seminar sponsored by score , the organization that offers free counseling to small businesses . it will be held wednesday , jan. . 17 at 1 p. m. eastern time . you can learn more and register at .
