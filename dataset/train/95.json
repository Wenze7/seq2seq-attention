        "tennis - edmund is currently ranked 50th in the worldtennis - british tennis star kyle edmund says his goal is to be ranked in the top 20 in the world in 2018 . edmund is currently ranked no . 50 in the world and has finished the last two seasons inside the top 50 but in an interview with espn , edmund says he wants to aim higher in 2018 . it was okay , i definitely would have liked to have done better . i finished the year in 2016 at 40 something , finished this year at 50 so i maintained my ranking . ",
        "ive got another year of experience on the tour so i learned a lot . it would be great to get top 20 , top 30 . ive had two years of the same end finish so in 2018 its a push up the rankings . ive been in three or four semifinals of tour events now so of course , you want to be winning the biggest tournaments in the world . the biggest thing for 2018 is getting up the rankings as much as possible and that is about turning those close situations in my favor . i havent changed too much in training ; nothing drastic has happened . ",
        "on and off the court its constantly making little adjustments and fine tinkering . the 22-year-old has had a good start to the season with an upset win over sixth-seeded denis shapovalov in the first round of the atp brisbane international .   "
