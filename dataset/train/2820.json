        "christopher bell knows he has tremendous talent when he wheels a sprint car . he knows the feel that he wants and knows what he needs to do to get up front and stay up front . it 's not that way yet when racing full-bodied stock vehicles . but his gradual improvement over the past two years in the nascar camping world truck series serves as a good sign that toyota has n't wasted its time grooming him as one of its next nascar cup stars . bell , 22 , won the truck title in 2017 , a year after advancing to the championship round at homestead . ",
        "he will leave the trucks and kyle busch motorsports behind for the nascar xfinity series next season as he heads to joe gibbs racing for a run at another nascar national series crown . bell , who already has an xfinity series win to his credit , celebrated his truck title by winning the prestigious turkey night midget race less than a week later at ventura raceway . capturing both the turkey night win and the chili bowl earlier this year , he remains one of the hottest drivers in any form of motorsports . he 's still learning , though , the whole stock-car thing . ",
        "so having confidence is a work in progress . `` i 'm getting there , '' bell said after winning the truck championship . `` i 'm not there completely . the pavement deal is very difficult , especially coming ... to a place like homestead where every lap your truck does something different or your car does something different . `` i think that 's just a product of me running on dirt for 16 , 17 years now and only being on pavement for four years and having maybe 100 races total under my belt . i 'm definitely gaining confidence as i go , but that 's going to take a lot of time . ",
        "`` bell , who was lauded on dec. . 9 along with the xfinity series champion william byron at the annual awards ceremony for both series , is following a path set by toyota-backed drivers erik jones and daniel suarez . but the difference is that both jones and suarez had stock car roots . bell is the first toyota driver with sprint-car roots to head to the xfinity series . `` one-hundred pavement starts is pretty phenomenal to grow that fast and that quick , '' team owner kyle busch said . `` obviously , kyle larson is probably one of the only others that 's been that quick , so it 's cool to see , especially coming through us with kbm . ",
        "`` busch , the 2015 nascar cup champion who had jones and suarez in his stable , said the biggest thing for bell is to learn how to go fast with a tight race car . `` that was a little bit of a learning experience for him , just knowing how fast and how good you could be , being able to have a little bit of tug on the steering wheel , '' busch said . `` but other than that , i think learning traffic is one of the biggest things . i think both had to learn traffic an awful lot over the course of the years that they 've been with us . ",
        "and trucks are probably the most difficult series to race aero dependently because they just punch such a big hole in the air with the truck in front of you . `` bell learned about racing in traffic for the win this year . he was side-by-side with kbm teammate noah gragson last month at phoenix , and gragson ended up spinning . in his xfinity win in october , at kansas he did a somewhat traditional dirt slide job in front of jones , who ended up hard on the brakes , with damage and frustrated . but the learning process is the whole point of racing in the developmental series . ",
        "`` him winning that xfinity race i believe probably gave him a big boost confidence-wise , '' said johnny sauter , the 2016 truck champion who was among the four finalists in 2017 . `` i was a little worried about that when he did that . ... he 's obviously driving a great truck . `` that truck has been very fast over the last four or five years no matter who 's driven it . but he did a good job and took care of his stuff , and obviously he was way too loose last year , ... and this year they said that he was too tight on the radio all night . ",
        "obviously , he learned . `` no matter how bell performs over the next couple of years , 2017 will be a memorable one . `` as a calendar year overall , i do n't think it gets much better than that , '' bell said about the chili bowl and truck titles before he even won at turkey night . `` you ca n't compare the two . `` one of them is a race , and one of them is a championship over a course of a year . so , hey , it 's really tough to compare them , but to be able to win both is definitely a dream come true . ",
        "`` sitting across from bell on stage at the awards banquet was william byron , a 20-year-old driver who won the xfinity title and will compete in cup next season . bell , who has a two-year deal to drive in the xfinity series for jgr , tried not to think about expectations and whether he would sit at the end of 2018 or 2019 where byron was sitting in 2017 . `` to win a championship , you have to have a good night at homestead , '' he said . `` obviously , we want to win a championship but our goal has to be to make that final four `` if you can make that final four , you 've had an exceptional year . ",
        "that is our no . 1 goal . `` elliott sadler , an xfinity series veteran who drives for jr motorsports , expects bell to be there and challenge for the title . `` he 's going to be very fast , '' sadler said . `` we 've already seen he can win in an xfinity car . the more he drives and the more he communicates with his team next year , he 's going to be one of the guys to beat . `` we all know how fast the gibbs cars are . he 's shown a lot of speed in everything he 's ever been in . ",
        "he 's going to be very good next year . ''   "
