        "alice is 6 years old . as a baby she was always cuddled and carried around . she was a fussy baby and her parents only get 5 hours a sleep a night . when she was 4-6 years old she hit them , kicked you and hid the car keys because she did n't want them leave . she was a shy , quiet child . she liked to do quiet things and only talked to adults around her when she needed something or something was bothering her . she rarely got in trouble , stays to herself . ",
        "she always made sure her room was clean , her body was clean , and she was never a messy kid . but she loves messy hair and crazy hair . she can be a little insensitive and shady sometimes but she still respects others . she also called her parents fat bitches when she was three . nelosn is 7 years old . as a baby he cried , but his parents got 8 hours of sleep a night . when nelson was a baby , he 'd pee in his parents face , bite them , pull their hair and giggle . ",
        "when he 'd crawl on the floor he 'd bite their toes , suck their toes , and every time his parents kissed his nose , nelson giggled and would try to bite them . potty training nelson was n't easy . he pooped on the floor and his pants 18 times and cried when his parents saw he pooped on the carpet . nelson would hold his urine until the point of agony and he 'd cry uncontrollably , including in public while touching his *** . nelson would also steal candy and small toys from stores . he 'll lie to his mother and take candy even after she told him to put it back . ",
        "in stores he 'd run away from his parents , giggle and when they ran after him , he just ran faster and would steal candy from shelves as they try to catch him . nelson tried to steal a puppy , and likes to stare at people eating and sleeping . nelson is a kind , friendly boy though and he often gives toys , treats and is friendly to others . he liked playing with dolls and when he gets too excited about food , he eats too fast , vomits and cries , sometimes in public .
