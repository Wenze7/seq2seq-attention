        "live halifax more streams sherri borden colleyreporter sherri borden colley has been a reporter for more than 20 years . many of the stories she writes are about social justice , race and culture , human rights and the courts . the maritime museum of the atlantic has fixed a halifax explosion exhibit that contained inaccurate information about africville . last week , troy adams , an african-nova scotian actor who was performing a play about the halifax explosion at the museum , publicly complained about the error . the day cbc news published the story , the museum 's curator , roger marsters , apologized to adams and took immediate steps to correct the information to better reflect the african-nova scotian experience of the explosion . ",
        "`` they thanked me for going forward with the story because this is a situation that they 're trying to rectify and they want to include all facets of halifax and the community and the racism -- make sure that they 're representing properly , '' adams said in an interview . erroneous panel replaced the original panel said that africville , which was located on the shore of bedford basin before the community was razed in the 1960s , was `` largely sheltered by high ground '' during the explosion and that only person died . the panel has since been replaced with a new one containing information about africville 's first black settlers and saying that the explosion `` sent a storm of wreckage '' through africville . ",
        "`` seaview baptist church , at the community 's centre , was heavily damaged , '' the new panel reads . `` no fewer than eight african-nova scotians were killed in the explosion ; at least four were from africville . '' marsters said the original panel was installed in 1994 when the museum first developed its permanent halifax explosion exhibit , halifax wrecked . `` it reflected the knowledge of those who were preparing the panel at the time , '' marsters said tuesday . `` subsequent research has shown that information to be inadequate and inaccurate . and so we felt it was incumbent upon us to replace it . '' ",
        "striving to be more inclusive when adams spoke to reporters last week , he was not aware that another temporary exhibit at the museum , collision of the narrows , and an interpretive banner at the museum 's entrance contained more accurate information that africville was heavily damaged . most recently , the museum worked with parks canada to develop interpretive signage on the halifax waterfront and made sure that one of those panels reflected the experience of africville and the explosion . halifax explosion at 100 : a devastating disaster that left a lasting mark the museum , marsters said , is committed to ensuring that its public institutions are more inclusive , particularly of the experiences of historically racialized and marginalized communities . ",
        "adams said he 's satisfied with the museum 's response to his concerns . `` where their apology was coming from was an honest place . '' mi ` kmaw playwright recounts family 's halifax explosion story from ` nearly forgotten ' turtle grove and adams has no regrets about pointing out the errors . `` black nova scotian history has been erased for as long as i can remember , '' he said . `` there 's many lessons with this . but first and foremost is , at least for me , what i realize is that no voice is too small .
