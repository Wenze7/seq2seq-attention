        "3 tips for planning i hate planning . i will be the first one to tell you that . why ? well , because i get excited about an idea and i have a lot of courage . if i decided one minute to start a business called heather 's hats . i will have a website set up in 24 hours and my llc . this can be a good quality because i think a lot of people hesitate too long on an idea and allow fear to paralyze them . however for big picture people it can also cost you a lot of extra time and money because you did not stop long enough to really think about what it is you are doing . ",
        "so from one person who hates to plan to another , here are a few things that i am working on to help me plan better . do it in dosesi have to set aside a small amount of time everyday to plan . whether its plan my day or revisit a big picture idea , i schedule a small `` dose '' of it . i make sure that i put in a lot of actionable things that i can do towards achieving my goal so i can get my `` fix '' . i can not sit down for hours and simply plan , i have to mix up action in there so i do n't go crazy . ",
        "it also helps because it gives me fresh energy and new ideas for when i actually do sit down and plan . set a planning deadline . so most people set a launching deadline to encourage themselves to move forward with an idea even if it scares them . for people like me , i have to set a planning deadline . `` okay heather , you will not move forward with this idea for at least two weeks so that you can think about it and plan better '' . this is actually really hard for me but i am learning to do it to make sure that i have all my ducks in a row . ",
        "also it gives me an end in sight because i know i wo n't have to wait forever and will be able to move forward . tell someone . have someone hold you accountable to not jump into something without planning . make sure this person will not just punch holes in all your ideas and keep you back , but make sure they are someone who is strong in the area of planning and will hold you accountable to do the best thing . finding the right tribe is essential to everything you do . if you need to connect with people who will push you towards becoming the best version of yourself i 've gathered some of them . ",
        "lastly i want to encourage you to never allow fear to paralyze you . do n't use the `` planning '' stage as an excuse to not pursue your goals , but make sure that you do take the necessary time to plan , weigh your options , and make the best decisions . for more on planning , check out this week 's podcast with business adviser and the host of the business made easy podcast jason skinner . again we would love to have you join our private facebook community . we are in your corner .
