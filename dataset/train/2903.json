",
        "`` my agent is looking after everything but i am here until the summer , '' he said . `` i have n't signed anything with anyone . i am talking with everyone . of course i am talking with liverpool . why not ? i still have a contract here . it is an amazing club . `` what can i say ? my agent does the rest . i just concentrate on the scene , on my performance and the football . i will give everything for this team .

",
        "the midfielder , who had to be withdrawn in the second half because of illness , insists it was one of the finest displays of jürgen klopp 's reign . he said : `` it was unbelievable . i think it was the best game in terms of how i saw it . look at how we pressed . we played against manchester city , you ca n't forget that . `` we were always on the front foot , everyone pressing and everyone did a brilliant job . we have played a lot of games that are very good but this one ? ",
        "i do n't know how many kilometres we ran . look at how we pressed . it was one of the best we have done , for sure . '' liverpool remain 15 points behind pep guardiola 's leaders in the premier league but can believes sunday 's performance can be a statement of intent towards their rivals in the champions league . klopp 's side face porto in the last 16 next month and are on an 18-game unbeaten run -- their last defeat was against tottenham , 4-1 at wembley on 22 october . `` against manchester city we played brilliant , '' can said .

' they will see we are a strong side . ",
        "but this is just one game , just three points and we have to keep going . '' can 's midfield colleague georginio wijnaldum believes liverpool can be genuine title rivals to city providing they acquire more ruthlessness and consistency . he said : `` there were some difficult games for city but they still scored and killed the game . that is something we did n't do . even in this game we gave them a chance to come back . that is the biggest thing we have to change if we want to compete with teams like city . ",
        "`` i do n't want to say the difference is not big because they show it every game , and even in the games they did not play very well they won . that is the step we have to make to compete for the title .
