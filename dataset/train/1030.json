        "so an `` almost relationship '' has come back into my life , but the mutual friend that was in the situation had caused us to fight and argue so bad that we cut ties with each other , and for a while i thought we would never speak to each other again . now this was an exceptionally lonely couple of months apart as i honestly felt i had the whole world and it was taken from me in 2.5 seconds . we were nuts about each other . and when we cut ties , even though i knew it had to happen for us to both heal , i lost my mind . ",
        "they honestly feel like my twin flame . . i reached out yesterday and apologised profusely and they completely took the blame for everything , and that they felt like they had to block me before they `` fucked up more than they had '' with the situation . but understandably , it does n't feel the same bc its just a little bit awkward . i asked them if we were better off not talking since it was awkward and they said that `` we should be able to get past the awkward moments '' . . but i was just wondering what can i do better ? ",
        "should i give them space since so i do n't overwhelm them ? should i make small talk ? or should i ask to talk about the situation ? . considering meeting up next weekend for brunch but im scared it will be awkward , knowing me i feel like i would cry seeing them .   "
