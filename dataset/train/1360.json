        "there 's no way around it . the 2017 season was a disaster for the giants . a team featuring a core of players that won world series titles in 2010 , 2012 and 2014 finished with the worst record in the national league . they nearly lost 100 games . veteran right fielder hunter pence understands what happened last season and he was vocal over the weekend in an interview with mlb network radio about turning things around in 2018 . `` we got hit with the humble pie . and i think it 's one of the best things that could have ever happened to you . ",
        "i love this quote nick hundley sent to me this offseason because we were talking different mindsets and plans and just getting back to the foundation and he said ` full lions do n't hunt . ' and i just love that analogy , '' pence said . i feel like we are some starving lions after last year and that 's my mindset through all these workouts , through this whole offseason process , i 'm a starving lion looking to hunt . `` pence addressed what he 's hoping to see from the team when they converge on scottsdale for spring training in february and march . ",
        "`` it 's just that mentality is kind of my goal . day 1 of spring training , we ca n't be too big for the littlest details , you just got ta get detail-oriented , got ta do the little things right . and if you get minds working with that hunger , you can build a beautiful energy and that 's going to be the focus , getting everyone focused on the details , getting our humble pie and starving to go hunt , '' pence said . rather than rebuild after a down season , the giants ' front office decided to reload this offseason . ",
        "they acquired all-star third baseman evan longoria from the rays for christian arroyo , denard span and two minor league pitchers . over the last few weeks , the giants have also reportedly connected to reds cf billy hamilton , pirates cf andrew mccutchen as well as free agent ofs jay bruce and carlos gonzalez .
