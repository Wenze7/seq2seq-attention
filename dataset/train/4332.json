        "even with a social media strategy in place , the right technology , policies and organisational buy-in , successful delivery of enterprise social media is not guaranteed . these elements are vital , but it is ultimately dependent on the capabilities of the people engaging in social media that will determine the success of your initiative . delivering the right programme of social media training is fundamental to giving employees the right tools and the confidence they need to succeed . what should be included in your social media training content ? how should that training be delivered ? how can a culture of sharing best practice be established so that employees continually develop and improve ? ",
        "a robust social media training programme outlines the training content , how the training will be delivered , the ability to support different people 's training needs , and the sharing of best practice . social media training contentwhen empowering employees to engage in social media on behalf of the organisation , it is important to take into consideration that some will not have a marketing or communications background . any social media training content therefore needs to be tailored appropriately to the varying experience of the employees . here are seven key elements to cover as part of any social media training programme : social media background / scene-setting : prior experience of social media amongst employees should not be taken for granted . ",
        "just because an individual uses social media in a personal capacity , does not mean that they can use it on behalf of the organisation . it is worth devoting some time in training to discuss the rise of social media and the impact this has had on how organisations and their audiences interact and communicate . strategic objectives : discussing the purpose of using social media within the organisation and the role that it plays in delivering against both the marketing and organisational strategy is vital to create buy-in . roles & responsibilities : every employee that is involved in delivering social media on behalf of the organisation needs to know what is expected in terms of targets , response times , content , reporting , sign-offs and any other responsibilities on the social media management platform . ",
        "risk management : it is extremely important for all those using social media to understand the risks to the organisation , introducing the rationale for the introduction of a social media management software like crowdcontrolhq and the role it plays in protecting both the organisation and its employees . policies & procedures : all employees need to be aware of and trained to follow the organisation 's social media policies and procedures . this needs to include key tasks such as responding to customers , delivering different types of content , and escalation routes . tone of voice : it is important to train employees on the desired communication style and tone of voice when posting via corporate social media accounts . ",
        "tone of voice is a key differentiator between many organisations and often part of the brand , and it is important in building relationships with customers . ensuring a level of consistency in the messages posted out by different members of the team is vital . technical training : technical training is essential and at a minimum should cover all day-to-day requirements such as how to log in , how to post out , how to reply to messages , and how to collaborate with other team members as well as how to handle a crisis . this will help to build the confidence of the employees and reduce the risk of mistakes through human error . ",
        "these points should not be addressed in isolation . the more information that organisations can provide within social media training , the more employees will understand and embrace the approach to enterprise social media . there is little value in training employees how to respond if they do n't understand what to say , what their role is , or the tone of voice they should use . a great way to support the training is to take real life examples where possible from the organisation 's existing social media accounts . for example , an organisation training a social customer service team could use real-world tweets from customers and task the employees to practice responding . ",
        "this exercise can encompass their role , company policy , tone of voice and technical training . by collaborating and working through examples in groups , employees can learn to use social media in a safe environment and start to collaborate . running scenarios of how to operate in a crisis is also critical to ensure that the teams know their role , stick to the plan , provide regular updates as well keep up business as usual . in enterprise environments , there is no single approach to delivering social media training that works for all organisations . as enterprise social media teams are often drawn from different departments or areas of the organisation , issues of geography , time and resources determines what type or medium of training works best . ",
        "when it comes to delivering social media training , there are a number of options available including : face-to-face , e. g. workshopse-learning / online coursestraining support documents , such as procedures , faqs and how-to guidestraining delivery methods need to be tailored to suit the organisation 's requirements . a blended training environment that utilises several different types of training is most likely to succeed rather than opting for a ` one size fits all ' approach . if an organisation is introducing social media to a large group of employees for the first time , then a workshop environment can be the most conducive as a starting point . ",
        "supporting different employee social media needswhen adopting enterprise social media , providing all relevant employees with the same initial social media training , regardless of confidence or ability , is a sensible approach to ensure consistency . it is also important to have training resources ready to support any new employees who join the organisation . the amount and type of on-going support available should be flexible depending on the team 's experience and confidence . experienced social media users are likely to need support primarily in terms of using the appropriate tone of voice and responding in a professional capacity . ",
        "this could therefore be a focus of their first month with appropriate targets assigned and activity monitored . those that are less experienced or nervous of using social media are more likely to need support with building confidence . using tools such as crowdcontrolhq 's validation feature can enable organisations to direct an employee 's posts to a more senior member of staff for approval , before they are published live . although this is undoubtedly a helpful tool for protecting the brand 's reputation , it is a great means of building confidence for employees as it enables them to go through the process but without the worry of the content being published immediately to the public , they are also able to receive feedback on their social media content . ",
        "after a suitable time and once both parties are happy , validation can be lifted . where possible , regular , scheduled catch-up calls and/or with social teams or individual employees can help to provide on-going support , encourage continued learning and development and encourage engagement in delivering social media . sharing social media best practiceenterprise social media is a complex environment , with many teams of employees delivering social media from multiple locations , it is easy for silos to form and collaboration to be neglected . ensuring regular communication between social media team members is key to sharing best practice . ",
        "not only does it help up-skill employees who need further support , but it also provides an opportunity to reward well-performing members of the team , making them feel valued . successfully sharing best practice examples helps to raise the entire team 's social media performance . there are several tools and techniques available to facilitate the sharing of social media best practices and examples , and it 's important to find something that aligns with the organisation 's corporate culture and style . for example : create a monthly email newsletter for all employees delivering enterprise social media . ",
        "this could contain regular features such as ` user of the month ' , ` best post ' , relevant news as well as tips for content for the upcoming month . give out awards or prizes for best practice related to social media and encourage recipients to share how they managed to perform so well . pair weaker / less confident users with star performers . this can help both users to grow in confidence and to share new ideas . originally published at blog . crowdcontrolhq . com .
