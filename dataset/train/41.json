        "credit : hoops et al. , eneuro . recreational drug use during adolescence may disrupt development of an understudied part of the prefrontal cortex , according to a study of male mice published in eneuro . brain cells that utilize the neurotransmitter dopamine are key players in the development of the prefrontal cortex , which continues to mature through early adulthood . during adolescence , the axons of these dopamine neurons extend from the nucleus accumbens to the medial prefrontal frontal cortex . cecilia flores and colleagues show that this delayed growth of dopamine axons also applies to the orbital prefrontal cortex , a brain region involved in complex functions such as decision-making , but the development of which is poorly understood . ",
        "mice exposed to the stimulant amphetamine at doses similar to those obtained when the drug is abused by humans had fewer synapses in the opfc , likely as a result of reduced axon growth , compared to control mice . the researchers did not observe ongoing adolescent dopamine axon growth nor similar effects of amphetamine in a neighboring brain region , the piriform cortex . this suggests that the ongoing extension of dopamine axons and their sensitivity to environmental influences like drugs may be unique to the prefrontal cortex . article : dopamine development in the mouse orbital prefrontal cortex is protracted and sensitive to amphetamine in adolescence .
