        "as 7 mile house owner vanessa garcia explains in a new history of her restaurant , even its name demarcates the past . opened in 1858 , 7 mile house was just one -- or , specifically , the seventh -- of many mile houses , stage coach pitstops positioned at one-mile intervals on the road out of san francisco . 7 mile house is just over the border into brisbane -- another , called 16-mile house , survives in millbrae . garcia 's new book , see you at the 7 , traces her restaurant 's winding history to the present day : as it 's always been , `` the 7 '' is known for beer and boisterous atmosphere , but since garcia took over in 2004 , it 's also made a name as a destination for sisig , lumpia , and other dishes from her native philippines . ",
        "`` the 7 mile adobo , it 's not traditional adobo exactly , but its something everyone likes , '' garcia says . free bowls of it will be available at a book release party on friday , january 26 , from 11:30 a. m. until they run out . garcia has brought plenty of other non-original elements to 7 mile house during her tenure . it 's no longer the only stagecoach stop for a mile , so she 's got to bring in customers somehow . innovations like a dog menu and `` yappy hour '' with `` dog beer , '' or beer with a bit of beef juice for patrons ' dogs , have been hits . ",
        "but garcia is also an eager archivist of her restaurant 's history , and has spent her free moments interviewing old-timer patrons for her book and scouring public library shelves for references to the bar . at first , `` all i had was a picture on the wall : the italian immigrant family in 1903 , '' garcia recalls . but with co-author and cousin regina abuyun , she can now account for 160 years of 7 mile history . with some time allegedly spent as an illegal gambling den , it 's always been a `` blue collar '' and `` teamster '' hangout , she maintains , with butchers , truckers , and railroad workers from the nearby southern pacific railroad yard typically mingling at the 7 . ",
        "`` the folks i interviewed and included in the book had really deep stories , '' says garcia . `` one of my favorites was ron moore , who i met two years ago because somebody called me and told me he had a 7 mile tattoo , in honor of his dad . '' moore 's father , it turns out , was a longtime bartender at 7 mile house . he and his brother fondly recall sitting at the bar to watch their father work , an experience to which garcia 's kids , 16 and 18 , can probably relate . ",
        "the oldest now works at the restaurant , too . `` stories like that , that come out from the interviews , were just beautiful , '' garcia says . that 's led garcia to `` her mission , '' as she sees it . `` tell everyone to cherish the places we have today , support the old classic restaurants . and also , i want to encourage restaurant owners to write their own books , because beautiful stories pop out from everywhere . '' 7 mile house celebrates its book release on friday , january 26 , starting at 11:30 am . ",
        ", with free bowls of their pork adobo and rice while supplies last . a book signing and $ 5 happy hour is from 3 to 6 pm , live djs are from 4 to 8 p. m. , and from 9 p. m. to 12:30 a. m , lp band performs .   "
