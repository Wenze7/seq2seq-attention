        "george : i ca n't get it out of my head . i just keep singing it over and over . it just comes out . i have no control over it . i 'm singing it on elevators , buses . i sing it in front of clients . it 's taking over my life . jerry : you know , schumann went mad from that . he went crazy from one note . he could n't get it out of his head . i think it was an a . he kept repeating it over and over again . ",
        "he had to be institutionalized . george : really ? what if it does n't stop ? jerry : that 's the breaks . -- seinfeld , `` the jacket '' i wo n't say that i present the picture of mental health or anything , but most people would be surprised to find out i harbor a habit that hints at deep insanity . i listen to the same song over and over again . alone in my office , or on my ipod , or on my phone , i play them on repeat over and over and over again . ",
        "loudly . in my itunes library there are certain songs of an embarrassing nature that i have played more than 300 or 400 times in a row . i 've gone through so many computers over the last few years that i do n't have an accurate tally , but if i were to add them up , the numbers and the songs would seem preposterous , even to me . they are my version of the backyard shed , covered in incomprehensible gibberish in a beautiful mind , or the wall in carrie mathison 's apartment after a manic fit . ",
        "and then i wake from my stupor and discard the songs like used condoms and pretend it never happened . as a result , i no longer enjoy `` music , '' a fact that the 16-year-old version of myself -- the one who was in a band and had hard drives full of rare music -- would have found unthinkable . god knows , i never thought i 'd find myself 142 listens in on a taylor swift song on a tuesday morning . but there is a method to the madness . i found that this secret habit has been the fuel for my creative output . ",
        "see , part of writing -- or really any creative endeavor from brainstorming to marketing -- requires tuning everything out . there are a couple ways to do this . you have your noise canceling headphones or ambient noise machines . you can put your phone on `` airplane mode '' or tell everyone to leave you alone . the problem with these reductive techniques is that they leave everything a little empty . in my experience , it 's not about quiet , it 's about finding your zone . i think melodic music , played on repeat , puts you in a heightened emotional state -- while simultaneously dulling your awareness to most of your surroundings . ",
        "it puts you in a creative zone . the important facilities are turned on , while all the others are turned off . sometimes `` good '' songs can help you with that . but bruce springstreen only has so many songs that work for this . you exhaust them soon enough and have to start listening to songs on the top 40 . and you stop caring who wrote them -- as long as it brings you closer to that state . michael lewis has spoken about this too . writing a book -- or really any major creative project -- puts you in an `` agitated mental state . '' ",
        "it 's hard to sleep , it 's hard to concentrate , it 's hard to be present in everyday . but you ca n't afford that when you 're actually working . he fixes that by doing the following : `` i pull down the blinds . i put my headset on and play the same soundtrack of twenty songs over and over and i do n't hear them . it shuts everything else out . so i do n't hear myself as i 'm writing and laughing and talking to myself . i 'm not even aware i 'm making noise . ",
        "i 'm having a physical reaction to a very engaging experience . it is not a detached process . '' you might ask , can you accomplish this by listening to music like a normal person ? i would have thought so too , but the answer is no . repeat on the same song or the same two or three songs allows the songs to fade into themselves -- to become a more or less a continuous stream . the reason i gravitate towards radio singles is that they normally have big , catchy choruses . the idea is that after enough listens to song becomes a perpetual chorus . ",
        "time stops . distractions stop . extraneous thinking stops . all that 's left is the work at hand . all that 's left is that little voice inside your head that you 're attempting to hear and translate onto the page . all that 's left is the book or the paper you 're reading . all that 's left is problem you 're trying to crack when you go for a walk . all that 's left is the workout you 're trying to complete . the bullshit -- well , it disappears for a fleeting second . ",
        "creative work is n't about pleasure . it 's not always fun . it 's about reaching something inside yourself -- something that society and everyday life make extraordinarily difficult . this is one way to do it . the fact that it basically ruined music for me is a cost i am willing to pay . i 'll take my fix from anyone -- and i 'm not ashamed to say that i have . even if that means i have to listen to the black eyed peas or some other god-awful group . every writer finds their own way . ",
        "this is mine . maybe it will work for you . or maybe you 'll try it and never look at me the same way again . ready to create a writing routine of your own ? learn from the routines of superstar authors stephen king , gertrude stein , john grisham , ernest hemingway , neil gaiman , and many more .
