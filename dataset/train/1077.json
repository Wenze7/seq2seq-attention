        "razer 's phone is n't a gaming phone per se , but it is a device built for gamers . as a result , it breaks unprecedented ground in a few areas but falters in others . here are the top five things you should know about the razer phone . the razer phone uses a 5.7 inch 2560x1440p display . this is the same resolution that many high-end gaming monitors use and it looks really sharp . what really makes it unique , though , is the fact that it features a variable refresh rate , that 's similar to g-sync or freesync , and can scale up to 120hz . ",
        "most other phones are locked to 60 . it 's really refreshing to see razer break into a mature market here and disrupt a bunch of leading phone manufacturers like apple , google and samsung . one downside here is that it does n't use an oled panel like many other flagships and opts to use an ips lcd instead . this means that it does n't feature true black levels that oled displays offer , which might be a deal breaker to some , but unfortunately they do n't make 120hz oled panels . specs : the razer phone uses top tier android parts . ",
        "it 's equipped with qualcomm 's leading snapdragon 835 soc coupled with a massive 8 gb of ram . to put things into perspective , that 's twice as much ram as google 's flagship pixel 2 xl . it also has a huge 4,000 milliamp hour battery that is more than capable of lasting a typical day . while it comes with 64 gb of built-in storage , it thankfully allows you to install a microsd card so you can expand it to 2 terabytes . camera : the razer phone has an 8 megapixel f2 .0 front-facing camera coupled with 2 cameras on the back . ",
        "one is a 12mp f. 175 wide angle and there 's another 12mp f. 26 zoom . the bad news is that the cameras are pretty bad . overall , they make images look much too soft and lack image clarity . in addition , the back cameras oddly shoot almost everything in a forced portrait mode , so that only a certain part of the image will be in focus . software updates could potentially address some of these issues , but if you 're looking for a great camera on your phone , i 'd focus elsewhere for now . ",
        "speakers : the razer phone has two large bezels at the top and bottom , but i do n't really mind them because the company has squeezed in some amazing speakers here . i 'd say they are the best phone speakers currently on the market . they 're good enough to replace small , cheap bluetooth speakers . operating system : the razer phone is rocking android nougat 7.1.1 with a clean nova launcher skin . it also comes with different razer themes you can download along with additional settings that allow you to optimize battery life over performance and vice versa . ",
        "razer tells me it plans to update the phone to android 8.0 oreo in q1 next year , but has n't laid out an update roadmap beyond that . got a news tip or want to contact us directly ? email news@gamespot . com .   "
