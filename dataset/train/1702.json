        "ideas around strategy and planning should be crucial to most organizations , but somehow over time these terms have become buzzwords . i guess this should n't entirely surprise us . other words that should mean something -- like innovation , entrepreneurship , engagement , etc. . -- have also morphed into buzzwords over time . then , of course , there 's my favorite : work-life balance . somehow a concept meant to mean `` organizations have expectations , but also realize human beings with real lives work for them '' became a buzzword over time . sad . ",
        "even more sad when you consider it should be a strategic advantage for companies . i do n't need to write a lot on strategy and planning . i 've done a few of these puppies before -- for example , this little ditty on why most strategic plans are n't that great . let 's start by discussing a few numbers , then go into reasons , then try to fix it . ready ? set ? hike . the sad strategy and planning numbershere 's an article from harvard business review entitled `` stop letting quarterly numbers dictate your strategy . '' ",
        "amen . hillary clinton was even discussing this during her campaign . she obviously did n't win , and not sure she would have actually been able to change anything , but ... quarterly returns murder strategy and preference myopia . we all know this , but it 's really hard to change it . wait . 95 percent of employees often do n't understand the strategy of the company ? not good . take those three data points . you can take them with a grain of salt , sure . but think about where they intersect . essentially , strategy and planning might be happening -- not even sure -- but if it is happening , no one seems to know where it ended up . ",
        "huh ? why did this happen ? easy answer № 1 : people get advanced at companies for two reasons . the first is execution , and the second is relationships with the existing power core . those things typically do n't require long-term thinking , which is what strategy and planning are . as a result , as people rise up a chain and need to own these topics , they do n't really know where to begin . they 'd rather focus on execution , because that got them here . easy answer № 2 : communication in the workplace is really bad at most companies . ",
        "so maybe a ceo or cfo set strategy and planning priorities , but forgot that crucial step whereby you tell other people what the hell is happening . more complex answer : a lot of guys that come to run companies think `` strategy '' means `` make a lot of money , '' which is actually quite flawed . strategy and planning are complex topics that involve people , psychology , personalities , products , services , margins , etc. . oftentimes , we reduce them to very simple documents hoarded by the executive levels . when you take a complex topic and try to simplify and control it , usually the end result is a lot of confusion and aimlessness and anger . ",
        "another example would be `` how many countries deal with abortion , '' etc. . what do most companies do about strategy and planning ? typically , they do what they usually do : nothing wrong with these two approaches , per se . projects need owners , and outcomes need to be recorded and analyzed . but a few points are perhaps being missed . what points are being missed ? off the top of my dome , here are a few : how exactly was this strategy set ? was it just from the senior levels or did other levels/silos have some voice ? ",
        "what is the plan for communicating this strategy down the chain ? where 's the alignment between this strategy and people 's day-to-day execution-level work ? if people 's responsibilities are going to change as a result of this new strategy and planning , who will tell them that ? how is this all tied to the mission and vision of the company ? where are the analysis points -- i. e. how will people know if this is successful ? who are the best contacts for someone with questions about the strategy and planning ? i could make that bulleted list go on for 15 -- 20 more points . ",
        "you see the drill . we often create strategy and planning in an executive-level vacuum , and in some ways , that 's rational and makes total sense . but often the execution of it leaves a lot of people in the dark about what 's going on or what they should be doing . that 's reflected in the numbers above . can we get better about strategy and planning ? yep . but it 's a little bit tough . here are a few things to initially consider . i try to think about work in different ways , and i also try to call out some managerial bs we 've all experienced . ",
        "if that kinda sorta interests you , i do a newsletter every thursday . feel free to join up . reduction in silos : silos have no place in modern business . functional skills are great , but teams need to work together . all silos do is slow down decision-making and increase frustration . it also allows everyone to re-contextualize priorities as `` this is what my team does , '' as opposed to `` this is good for the company , which will be good for me . '' only hire when there is a real reason to hire : one of the most pervasive myths in business is `` we are so understaffed . '' ",
        "this comes about because the manager of the team feels very busy , so they assume everyone else is busy . in reality , 4 of their 10 direct reports might surf facebook all day . they hire № 11 and now 5 in 11 do that . unclear job roles hit the bottom line hard and make legit execution of strategy and planning a big challenge . rein in the executives and the buzzwords : senior leaders should be out making deals and relationships and then updating people on priorities and developments . they should n't be ics and should n't just be seen at all-hands meetings where they say `` strategy '' 141 times with no real meaning . ",
        "just be real and say `` hey , this was a good quarter because ... '' or `` we got hit in the face this time around , so ... '' set priorities , align people , re-organize : at most places , once someone is in `` product marketing '' or `` hr , '' that 's it . they are there . that 's their thing . but that concept is static , and business is dynamic . you need to put people where they 'll hit the most targets for you , and sometimes that 's not where they were hired . ",
        "this stuff needs to be more fluid , which means it probably needs to leave process-laden hr . the strategy and planning bottom linethis is how you develop your business , your revenues , your people , and everything else . you set strategy . you plan around that strategy . there are pivots . all this happens . it 's business . at too many places , people have no clue what 's happening with strategy and planning . in too many situations , those are buzzwords executives can toss about at a meeting -- and really mean `` me and my lieutenants have a plan for fatter bonuses via releasing more products . '' ",
        "this stuff can not be meaningless . we 're at a time where so , so , so many people are feeling left behind or disengaged at work . and when you see stats around 95 % of employees having no idea re : strategy and planning , you ca n't help but understand why .   "
