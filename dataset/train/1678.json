        "u. k.-based cineworld is making a bid to become the second-largest movie theater operator by buying u. s. rival regal entertainment in a $ 5.8 billion deal that would give it 9,500 screens across the u. s. and europe . the merger is part of a larger wave of consolidation that is occurring in theaters , mostly driven by china 's dalian wanda group , which purchased amc entertainment in 2012 for $ 2.6 billion , and then had the division snap up europe 's odeon and uci chains in november of last year , followed by u. s. operator carmike cinema in december . ",
        "the buying spree ended up creating the world 's largest movie theater operator , with over 900 theaters and 10,500 screens in eight countries . a bet hollywood survives the test . cineworld 's deal for regal , which will see the u. k. operator pay regal shareholders $ 23 a share for their stock , is certainly an opportunistic move . the u. s. movie market was torched by a horrible hollywood summer for blockbusters , which was the worst period for the industry since 2006 . shares of regal were down about 20 % before the first news of a deal was heard , while amc has lost 56 % of its value this year . ",
        "cineworld is offering to pay $ 3.6 billion for regal , plus $ 2.2 billion worth of its debt , and will finance the deal through a rights offering to issue more shares . when cineworld announced it was in talks to buy regal , the theater operator 's stock plunged 20 % on the news . the merger looks like a bet not only on hollywood rebounding , but also being able to stave off the streaming threat posed by netflix and amazon . com . operators have been upgrading their theaters by adding new amenities , such as premium reclining seats and dine-in options . ",
        "a premium experience . regal , which has over 7,300 screens in 561 theatres , has installed recliners in 151 theaters and expects to have them installed in 45 % of screens by the end of next year . it 's also upgraded its menu to include more and better food and alcoholic beverage options , but in the third quarter concession sales fell 3 % even as per patron revenue rose almost 6 % due to price increases . getting people to pay more is important , as concession sales account for 30 % of regal 's total revenue . ",
        "it 's not much different at amc , where food and beverage sales represent 31 % of revenue . amc has 1,006 theaters and 11,046 screens , and has become the leader in creating a premium movie-going experience . over 2,400 of its screens have premium seating , 430 have dine-in amenities , and hundreds more offer imax 3-d or dolby cinema capabilities . yet the upgrading costs have taken a toll on the theater operators , particularly as hollywood bombed this year . while that 's seen as part of the ebb and flow of the industry -- 2016 was a record year for box office sales -- the bigger threat is streaming . ",
        "a different kind of competitor . for one , netflix has promised to upend how content is distributed . rather than going through theaters first before getting to the streaming services , netflix plans to produce its own feature-length films and stream them directly to its members . considering netflix 's original tv programming has caused people to cut the cord with cable , there 's good reason the movie industry is worried . doubling down on the theater business , as cineworld is essentially doing , just as netflix attempts to upend movie distribution , could be as risky as trying to produce a blockbuster by maxing out your credit cards . ",
        "sometimes it pays off , as it did for those who made the blair witch project , but more often than not it leads to failure and a mountain of debt . in the cineworld-regal entertainment merger , it could be investors end up only with heavily diluted shares .   "
