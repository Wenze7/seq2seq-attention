        "it 's easy to get off track with your new year 's resolutions when you 're the only one holding yourself accountable . if you 're in a relationship , though , you have a leg up : when you set goals as a couple , you 're far more likely to keep each other focused on achieving them . what are the best types of resolutions to make with your partner ? below , marriage therapists and counselors share seven resolutions that could make your relationship happier and healthier in 2018 . 1 . we 'll commit to small , measurable changes in our behavior . ",
        "`` ask your partner if they 'd be willing to test something out with you . say that you 'd like your partner to name something in everyday life they 'd like you to change . and you 'll do the same . start small . this is n't about asking him to get fit or deal with an addiction . it might be something as simple as , ` i 'd like you to text me at least once during the workday . ' keep it simple and specific . do n't say , ` i 'd like to hear from you more during the workday , ' because that 's too vague , leaving it open for interpretation and misunderstanding . ",
        "in all my years as a marriage coach , i can attest that it 's the small things that have the biggest impact . when you see the impact a small change can have , you 'll both feel empowered about tackling bigger ones together . '' -- abby rodman , a psychotherapist and the author of without this ring : a woman 's guide to successfully living through and beyond midlife divorce . 2 . we 'll break up with our iphones `` divorce your phones this year . when you 're spending quality time together , park your phones at the door . ",
        "better still , shut them off when you 're spending couple or family time . think you 're not addicted ? try spending a technology-free weekend . it may be harder than you think , but it will do great things for your relationship . '' -- winifred reilly , a marriage and family therapist in berkeley , california . 3 . we 'll commit to becoming better people for each other . `` often in a relationship , we focus on what we want from our partner and how we wish they 'd behave . when we talk about change , it 's often focused on ways our partner could get it right -- or what we 're not getting from them . ",
        "but when two people in a relationship are focused on what they can give their partner , the relationship becomes much stronger and more harmonious . this resolution has you both focus your attention on what you can give to your partner . '' -- isiah mckimmie , a couples therapist and sexologist in melbourne , australia . 4 . we 'll treat each other as kindly as we treat our friends -- or even our local barista . `` couples often treat their friends -- or even much more peripheral people in their lives -- with more kindness than they do their partners . ",
        "you may give your friend the benefit of the doubt without hesitation . do you extend that to your partner ? how often have you had a tense conversation with your partner in a restaurant , and when the server comes to your table , you switch gears , smile , and are pleasant to the server ? why not be that pleasant to your partner ? this resolution is about understanding that kindness goes a long way in dealing with the differences of opinion that all couples have . '' -- diane spear , a couples therapist in new york city . ",
        "5 . we 'll continue to share stories from our past . `` make a point to swap stories about your past : when you first dated , you were excited to share and hear stories about each other because it feels good to be known and to really understand one another . but then the focus likely turned to the day-to-day stressors and you stopped sharing stories . make it a game to come up with the most interesting question about the past , and both of you answer it . here 's a start : what was your favorite toy as a 5-year-old ? ",
        "what was your third grade teacher like ? who was your first crush ? they do n't need to be mind-blowing questions , but you 'd be surprised how much you learn about yourself and each other when you dive deep . '' -- ryan howes , a psychologist in pasadena , california . 6 . when we disagree , we 'll take turns talking and actually listening `` make this the year you 're smarter about arguments . when one of you states your viewpoint , the other will say what he or she heard , then ask if they got it right . ",
        "once the first speaker says ` yes , ' the other gets to state their own position and be heard . it can be tempting to compose our rebuttal instead of totally listening . listening does n't necessarily mean agreeing . the active listening technique is so worthwhile because it fosters emotional intimacy . when most spouses really want is not to win an argument , but to feel understood . '' -- marcia naomi berger , a couples therapist in san rafael , california . 7 . we 'll upgrade date night . `` commit to trying new things , and doing so often . ",
        "while having date nights at your favorite places can feel comfortable and nostalgic , getting stuck in monotonous loop can be death by a thousand cuts and lead to feelings of boredom and dissatisfaction in the relationship . sit down in early january and write a list of 20 new things you 'd like to try together in 2018 , then post the list on your fridge . the list can serves as both a visual reminder to keep you both accountable to your commitment , and a source of ideas when you inevitably look at each other and ask , ` so what should we do tonight ?
