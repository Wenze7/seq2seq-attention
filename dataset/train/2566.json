",
        "`` i told him ` i will not do a trial : either you take me or not , i 'm not here to waste time ' . `` i already had that kind of trust , because in my mind i was the strongest of all even when i was young . i met wenger because i expected him to tell me to start with them right away . but ibra does not test . `` when i was young , in my mind no one was better than me . i watched ronaldo , romario and baggio on tv and i had one goal : i wanted to show that i was the best . '' ",

",
        "`` so what did he do ? he left me this money and did not pay the rent for a month - he sent me to play these tournaments , because he did everything he could and gave me all the opportunities that were there . ''   "
