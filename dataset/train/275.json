        "us exports increased in november to their highest level on record , but imports rose faster , pushing the trade gap to its widest in nearly five years , according to data released friday . the monthly trade report was full of records that signal the recovery in the us and world economies , but the growing us deficit could still subtract from gdp growth in the final three months of the year . rising oil prices accounted for a big chunk of the increase in the trade deficit , which rose $ 1.6 billion to $ 50.5 billion compared to october , the commerce department reported . ",
        "the consensus forecast among economists was for the deficit to decline to $ 47.9 billion . exports of us goods and services jumped $ 4.4 billion to $ 200.2 billion , the most ever measured , pushed by a record $ 65.7 billion in services exports , according to the report . but imports surged $ 6 billion to $ 250.7 billion , also the highest ever . the gain was led by oil imports which jumped $ 1.4 billion to nearly $ 17 billion , as the average price for crude rose to $ 50.10 a barrel , the highest since july 2015 . ",
        "for the january-november period the us trade deficit increased by $ 53.4 billion or 11.6 percent over the same period of 2016 , to $ 513.6 billion . the deficit in goods with china rose to its highest level in two years to $ 35.4 billion , and for the year-to-date was $ 344.4 billion , $ 25 billion higher than in the comparable period of 2016 . the gap with canada and mexico also widened in the january-november period , to $ 15.3 billion and $ 65.7 billion , respectively .
