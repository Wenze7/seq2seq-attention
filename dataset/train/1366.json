        "tl ; dr : apple 's new iphone x is well worth it due to a variety of reasons . the iphone x is my favorite smartphone i 've owned . despite my age , i have owned quite a handful of smartphones , ranging from all iphones since the 3gs , the moto x pure edition , the oneplus two , samsung 's galaxy s7 , and many more . by far , the iphone x tops them all . ioswhile this is persistent in pretty much all apple devices , the iphone x makes it even better . ",
        "one of my favorite things is how smoothly ios runs . unlike in many android devices , you wo n't notice lag during transitions and animations while using an apple device , unless of course , the one you 're using is outdated and does n't perform well with the operating system . this is what has helped steer me away from pretty much every samsung device i 've ever owned , that stupid lag they ca n't seem to get rid of . i see it when presenting multitasking , swiping between pages , etc. . it 's always there , always has been , and has always annoyed me . ",
        "i do n't get that using ios , and it 's a blessing . swipe gestures/no home buttonhere 's the truth : the people who complain about the absence of a home button on the iphone x are the same people who do n't own one . i 've been using this device since launch day , and i stopped missing the home button less than ten minutes after regular use . the new swipe gestures are fast , and i love them . for example , the up-and-over motion when trying to present multitasking feels way more practical than lifting your finger , double-clicking the home button , and then return your finger to the screen . ",
        "just a stupid first world problem , right ? not really . these little details are what makes a phone that has them better than those that do not have them . i 've gotten so used to these new methods of getting around the device that i now refuse to live without them . battery lifei 've never used a `` plus '' type of device , so i have never truly experienced a phone with an excellent internal battery until i owned the x. i use to always rely on a case that would give my phone enough juice to last the rest of the day , and now i do n't even stress for a second . ",
        "as a matter of fact , after an eight hour day away from the house , i usually come home with about 45 -- 50 % charge left ; not bad if you ask me . the notchjust like with the whole `` no home button '' thing , those who complain about the notch on the iphone x are the same people who do n't own one . i like this part of the device , and i 'd bet that majority of iphone x owners would agree . it adds a sense of uniqueness to the device , and if i had to choose whether it is there or not , i 'd let it stay . ",
        "conclusionokay , you get the point , i like the iphone x , and maybe there 's a bit of bias in my argument , but what can i say , i love apple products . these reasons may not be enough to get you to buy one yourself , but at least understand that this is a great device , and i think the company is headed in the direction of a bright future if they continue to create products like this one . p.s. by the way , could we stop complaining about the price tag ? apple and other companies alike make products similar to the iphone se specifically for these kinds of people . ",
        "it 's inevitable that phones will continue to rise in price , and if you ca n't deal with that , you 're screwed ; you ca n't continue to try getting the best devices on the market without dropping some extra cash . via : apple .   "
