        "detroit pistons coach stan van gundy talks about his team 's play in loss to miami heat . video recorded jan. . 3 , 2018 . miami ' € '' wednesday night gave exhibit a on how much the nba has changed . in days of yore , interior defense and post scoring suffered when playing without an all-star center . heat guard goran dragic dribbles around pistons center boban marjanovic during the second half at american airlines arena on wednesday , jan. . 3 , 2018 . but in today ' € ™ s game of pick-and-roll offenses surrounded by shooting , detroit pistons center andre drummond ' € ™ s absence was felt on the perimeter in the miami heat ' € ™ s 111-104 victory at the american airlines arena . ",
        "the heat drained 17 three-pointers and the inability to contain the pick-and-roll was the culprit . with point guard goran dragic directing the attack , the heat was the beneficiary of the right rib contusion that sidelined drummond for the first time this season . more detroit pistons : afterward , bradley called drummond the best pick-and-roll defending big man in the nba . ' € i think he ' € ™ s a little underrated on the defensive end , ' € bradley said . ' € what andre ' € ™ s able to bring for us on the defensive end , he is the best big man in pick-and-rolls on defense in the nba . ' ",
        "€ missing him tonight was tough , but we still had chance to help each other and talk on the defensive end because that ' € ™ s what it ' € ™ s all about . ' € a major part of the pistons ' € ™ pick-and-roll defense is when drummond plays up against guards . he is able to hound ballhandlers with quick hands and with his light feet , he ' € ™ s able to keep them from the paint . once his teammate recovers , he ' € ™ s able to get back to protect the paint . ",
        "boban marjanovic , who got his first start for the pistons , hurt the heat with 15 points and nine rebounds . but the serbian behemoth is unable to perform the defensive maneuvers so the pistons had to guard the heat conventionally . dragic played the role of a quarterback with a clean pocket in picking the pistons apart . the heat shot 17-for-34 from 3-point range and 51.2 percent overall . ' € they had 17 three 's and that was a product of ball being in the paint all night long , ' € van gundy said . ' ",
        "€ we could not keep them out of the paint . ' € bradley out of rhythm bradley struggled in his return to the lineup after missing seven games with a groin issue . he was 6-for-19 from the field and was hair off defensively . ' € there ' € ™ s other ways i can affect the game and i understand that , ' € bradley said . ' € i just have to go out there with the mindset that the shots are eventually going to fall . ' € it is a rhythm thing . i ' € ™ m a little disappointed that i didn ' € ™ t play the way i wanted to , but it ' € ™ s part of the game . ",
        "heat shooting guard wayne ellington presents a unique challenge with his ability to come off screens and get up shots quickly . ellington was only 3-for-10 from downtown , but he made several timely shots ' € '' his last 3-pointer giving the heat a 97-94 lead with 6:39 remaining . ' € it ' € ™ s a little disappointing that we weren ' € ™ t able to come out with a win , ' € bradley said . ' € all we can do is move on to the next game . we ' € ™ ve got practice tomorrow and have a chance to get better and prepare . ' ",
        "€ tough sledding with drummond out , the pistons were missing four regular members of the rotation . stanley johnson , reggie jackson and jon leuer all missed the game as well . the lack of bodies creates lineups that we have seldom seen this season . and several players mentioned they are forced to play with unfamiliar teammates . ' € it ' € ™ s a little bug , but it ' € ™ s opportunities for players who haven ' € ™ t played to step up and we tried tonight and came up short . ' ",
