        "automated car technology is on a roll , and rather literally at that . but for all of the stunning advances we 've seen lately from the likes of waymo , all automated cars and self-driving taxis essentially remain firmly in the testing phase . but uber ceo dara khosrowshahi does n't think that will be the case for much longer . during an interview for bloomberg 's the year ahead event today , khosrowshahi expressed his belief that we 'll see uber automated cars on the road for use by the public outside of testing in as few as 18 months . ",
        "bloomberg editor-in-chief john micklethwait sits down with uber ceo dara khosrowshahi to discuss #theyearahead 23 , 2018but do n't expect that the ability to make a bit of extra cash as an uber driver is going to vanish quickly . khosrowshahi explains that in 95 % of cases during the first few months the feature is publicly available , uber may not have the roads fully mapped out in say , phoenix , where uber is currently doing some of its testing . in the vast majority of cases , uber will initially send out human drivers . still , there will be around 5 % of cases in which an automated uber car is perfectly suited to the task , and so the company will send one along rather than a human driver . ",
        "the rider will have the choice of having a human or an automated driver pick them up , though , and even if the car can handle the route , uber may still send a human driver if the weather is unfavorable . down the roadin time , though , uber hopes to bump that humble 5 % up to 10 % , 20 % and so forth . within five years , khosrowshahi says , `` we will have the perfect driver in phoenix . `` this is only for phoenix , though . uber will have to repeat this process for every city it operates out of , and khosrowshahi estimates that it will take around 10 to 15 years to get most of those cities compatible with its automated tech .
