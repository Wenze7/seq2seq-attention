        "twitterthere must have been something in the gatorade at nba arenas on monday based on the number of altercations that took place over the course of the day . ben simmons and kyle lowry kicked off the festivities when the raptor invited the 76er to meet him in the tunnel after the two were ejected from the game , and the houston rockets capped things off when former clipper chris paul used his inside knowledge of the staples center to lead a squadron of teammates into the los angeles locker room after an especially chippy matchup between the two teams . ",
        "a careful observer might have noticed there was one key similarity between the two incidents : a lack of actual fighting . despite the sheer amount of tough guy bravado on display , none of the players involved traded blows . orlando magic guard aaron afflalo threw an ill-advised punch at minnesota timberwolves forward nemanja bjelica the night after , but it seems like his willingness to actually throw down is the exception , not the rule -- which i guess you could argue is actually a good thing . with that said , san antonio spurs coach and ever-outspoken quote machine gregg popovich is clearly not a fan of nba players who are unwilling to back up their posturing with actual action . ",
        "during an interview with reporters on wednesday , he mocked the many athletes who spend way too much time waiting for their teammates to swoop in and hold them back instead of actually following through on their threats . the clip cuts off just as popovich starts to reminisce about `` the malice at the palace , '' and while i 'm sure he 's not a proponent of players jumping into the stands to fight fans , i can only imagine he looks back fondly at the early years of his career as a coach when the new york knicks adopted a hockey mentality by having an enforcer on hand at all times .
