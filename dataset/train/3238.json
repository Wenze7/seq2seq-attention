'' `` just a special moment , '' james said . ",
        "`` i just started thinking about everything that my journey from being a kid that first picked up a basketball when i was five years old to first starting playing organized basketball when i was nine and all the way up until this point . i give a lot of thanks to a lot of people . it 's just a special moment . `` it 's something i never set out to do . i 'm not even a score-first guy when it comes to playing basketball . i love getting my teammates involved and seeing my teammates be excited about scoring and me getting assists .
