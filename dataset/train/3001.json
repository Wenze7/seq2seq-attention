        "ac milan owner li yonghong has moved to reject all accusations of suspected money laundering over his takeover of the italian club . reports in the italian press on tuesday had alleged that former owner silvio berlusconi had been caught up in a fraud case relating to payments made by mr li after he completed his £ 650m takeover of i rossoneri in april 2017 . in a wordy statement published on the club 's official site on wednesday , mr li explained that the allegations ` did not reflect the reality of facts ' as he sought to defend his and his company 's name against the speculation . ",
        "li 's statement `` the articles recently published by the italian newspapers ` la stampa ' and ` il secolo xix ' , and then resumed by many other media , relating to an alleged money laundering investigation against the fininvest group require me to make clarifications as party involved . '' ac milan 's purchase process has always been carried out with the utmost transparency , compliance with regulations and correctness , with the support and advice of international financial and legal advisors . all procedures were followed in full compliance with the laws and practices in force . ",
        "`` all financial institutions , sports organizations and authorities involved received the documentation , either required or requested , to assess and approve both the ` closing ' process and the qualifications of the new property now managing the team . `` what i have read these days absolutely does not reflect the reality of facts . therefore , while considering the group that i chair , ac milan s. p.a. , and myself as injured party of this unfortunate and unacceptable media campaign based on speculations and misleading information , we reserve the right to take all necessary legal actions to protect at best the image , the reputation and the financial solidity of ac milan and of the reference group . ",
        "`` the italian tax office has received a 12-page document relating to a € 300m payment made to berlusconi via a series of countries with ` tax haven ' statuses after li 's acquisition of milan . no charges have been brought against li or the 81-year-old as the italian authorities continue to run a fine-toothed comb over all of the transactions .
