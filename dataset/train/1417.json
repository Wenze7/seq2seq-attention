        "being left on readi do n't care what the circumstances are -- it always hurts to be left on read . usually , i do n't mind being left on read . sure , i 'm upset . wish they would say something . but there are those times where i just feel so discouraged . i get you may be busy . i know you might not be able to respond . but do n't leave me on read for hours on end . at least say you ca n't talk right now , and that you will respond as soon as you can . ",
        "why ? because i told you something when i needed you and i just want you to show that you care . acknowledge my presence . realize that i 'm there . sometimes , i will just cry . question why they ca n't even say that they ca n't right now . if you ask me something , and i respond with a serious , honest answer , do n't leave me on read . you asked because you care . now show that . make that known . do n't let me question why . people tell me to not let it get to me . ",
        "but , did you know , that that 's hard ? because it is . but i 'm not sure you realize that . i am in the process of recovering -- i know that for a fact . but when the devil just wants to get to me , my mind mixes up , i get all of these confusing , weird emotions . that is when it hurts the most . and of course , he likes to take the smallest of things and make it seem huge to me . while you may just forget about it , it 's on my mind for a while . ",
        "i do n't want to have to question if you care . i do n't want to feel pain at the thought of it . and i 'm working on that .   "
