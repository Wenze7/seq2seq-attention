        "isla fabu has spun everything from muka to alpaca fur to grass - all of which you can see at the lysaght watt gallery 's latest exhibition . she calls herself a spin artist and is one of the eight taranaki fibre artists who currently have their work on display in fibre force at the gallery in hāwera . `` spinning is not just about jumpers and socks , '' fabu said . `` there 's a whole other world . '' read more : * five works come in as one whether it 's from the land , or an animal , fabu has probably experimented with spinning the fibre , or using local plants to dye the material , to eventually create one of her many different pieces . ",
        "she currently has christmas decorations - or egg cosies , depending on how you look at it - as well as decorations for the home and more on display . the fibre force exhibition is on until december 23 and showcases the use of natural fibre , using skills to create a range of both functional and art pieces . the exhibition holds examples of knitting , weaving , felting and more from six new plymouth artists , one from opunake and fabu from hāwera . fibre force is ` hands on ' which means visitors will be able to see and touch the pieces . ",
