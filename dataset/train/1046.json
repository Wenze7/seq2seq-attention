        "the boston celtics have high interest in big man anthony davis , but will the rumors eventually die or will the pelicans young star eventually become available ? boston celtics president of basketball operations danny ainge never shies away from making a blockbuster trade . just look at this past summer when dealer danny acquired four-time all star guard kyrie irving from the cleveland cavaliers in exchange for isaiah thomas , jae crowder , ante zizic and brooklyn 's 2018 first-round pick . despite the team 's 26-7 start , do n't think for one second ainge would n't swing another deal if one anthony davis suddenly became available . ",
        "reminiscent of his pursuit for kevin garnett prior to the 2008 season , if ainge wants a player badly enough , it usually happens ... eventually . given the fact that he has the assets in draft picks and a couple young talented players to bring to the dealing table , a davis-to-boston deal is not a matter of if , but when . new orleans , la -- december 13 : anthony davisof course , that `` when '' depends on how things go in new orleans , a place davis says he loves and is loyal to . ",
        "but , is new orleans loyal to anthony davis ? with recent trades that seen boston ship thomas to cleveland and the kings ship current teammate demarcus cousins to the pelicans , the kentucky wildcats alum is not ruling out anything when it comes to his future . `` he told me that was calling , but nothing was going to happen , '' davis told espn 's adrian wojnarowski . `` at the same time , though , you see how organizations treat players . isaiah thomas . demarcus told me that the told him that he was n't going to get traded , but they traded him . ",

",
        "he knows as long as the pelicans are winning , the rumors will die . but , if the team fails to make the playoffs and seem hopeless in doing so , the 24-year-old davis will become a valuable commodity in rebuilding the franchise . that 's where a team like the celtics come in . again , they have the draft picks and a player like jaylen brown or jayson tatum would be intriguing for the pelicans . and then , of course , davis would have to want to play in boston . signed through 20201 , ainge would take a major risk giving up such assets for a player who may not commit long term . ",
        "but , his desire to win could solve that problem . `` winning . that 's it . that 's how you 're judged , '' davis continued . `` you can score , you can dominate . you can do whatever . but they calculate everything off winning . you know what . i know that . everybody in the league knows that . i hear it all the time : ` anthony is a good player , but he has n't won anything . he 's not a winner . he has n't been to the playoffs in two years . '' ",
        "related story : anthony davis in a boston celtics uniform would be simply amazing a dream team scenariothe winning davis refers to would take care of itself if he inserted his 25 points and 10 rebounds to a team that has an all star with nba championship experience , another all star hungry to breakout and a young coach in brad stevens who would put him in the best position to get even better . in fact , a three-headed monster of irving , gordon hayward and davis would put the celtics on the level of the golden state warriors depending on their supporting cast . ",
        "in a scenario where either brown or tatum is included in the deal , the player who remains will play a key role in forming a four-headed monster . whether that player is tatum or brown remains to be debated , but any sign of a pelicans collapse this season , could further strengthen what ainge has already built in boston . like garnett , hayward and a lesser degree kyrie irving , danny ainge typically gets his man . it will be interesting to see when that is . the boston celtics have high interest in big man anthony davis , but will the rumors eventually die or will the pelicans young star eventually become available ?
