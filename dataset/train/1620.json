        "the minnesota timberwolves fanbase has been ranked as the eighth-best in the nba by fansided 's fandom 250 . where did they rank overall on the list of 250 fanbases ? a few weeks ago , it was announced that the timberwolves fanbase was one of just 12 nba fanbases selected to land in fansided 's fandom 250 , which is comprised of fanbases of all types , from tv shows to college teams to brands to fans of aaron judge . the wolves beat out the likes of toronto , oklahoma city , memphis , and chicago among the 12 nba fanbases that were included . ",
        "finishing ahead of minnesota included the spurs , knicks , cavaliers , celtics , 76ers , lakers , and warriors . of the teams listed ahead of the wolves , cleveland is the hardest one to stomach . if having the best player in the league for 10 out of the last 14 seasons qualifies a team 's fanbase to be the fifth-best overall ... then i guess this makes sense . but otherwise it 's a head-scratcher . the spurs have a great fanbase , although playing in a city with the nba as the only `` big four '' sport gives san antonio a built-in advantage , similar to okc at no . ",
        "11 and memphis at no . 10 . it 's hard to be too upset with them landing one spot ahead of the timberwolves . knicks and lakers fans are kind of in similar boats at this stage , although the 16 11 championships tallied by l. a. trump the two wins by new york by just a bit . it 's hard to argue with dedicated big market fan bases that seem to be generally knowledgeable . the sixers one is a little weird . philadelphia did rank just 18th in the nba in attendance last year , but it 's not like the wolves ' attendance numbers have been stellar of late , either . ",
        "the idea is certainly that tons of fans stuck around throughout #trusttheprocess and continue to do just that , so i 'll allow it . and as for the warriors , well ... they have won two out of the last three titles , but they 've also had a notoriously loyal fan base , dating all the way back to the rick barry days . any finals winner has to deal with some level of fair-weather clingers-ons , so it 's hard to hold this against the legions of true warriors fans . all in all , it hurts a little bit that the wolves and their fans were defeated by the likes of fixer upper , kesha , jenna marbles , and netflix .
