        "each situation i am in is a new flower . some are peonies , others roses , but my favorite are tulips . their cylindrical petals allow me to hide from the world , and keep to myself , while i enjoy the fruits of the flower . the hive is home for me , but the tulip , my second . although i love to fly flower-to-flower , there is a drive in me that makes me return to the hive . although i love the world i am in , with it 's boundless beauty , the protection and comforts of home bring me back , even if the beauty of the world causes me to linger . ",
        "i enjoy the sweet taste of the rose , with it 's labyrinth of petals leading to its ' center , but sometimes it is difficult to get there . the prize of the pollen is worth the effort , but easier flowers , such as dasies and tulips are my favorites . also , i feel exposed on the rose , and that is something that scares me . i am a very private being and exposing myself does not make for much comfort when enjoying the natural nectar of my world . peonies have the most intoxicating smell , they drive me to burrow into their clumps of petals , just for the chance that i will reach the center . ",
        "sometimes i get stuck so far inside that it takes the bloom of the flower for me to get out . their pollen is like a pheromone to me , and the fact that i am concealed from the world makes the burrowing worth the effort of climbing and retracting the delicate silk petals . my least favorite flower is a sunflower . when i am on the center of one , i feel that anyone can just come up and whack me dead . their pollen is not even worth the effort , and the increased risk makes it not even worth leaving the hive . ",
        "i live in a scary world , and my hive is the one place where i feel safe . i can feel temporarily safe in the protection of friends , such as tulips and peonies , but i will always return to the hive , even if the nectar of my flower friends calls me .   "
