        "the time has come for chinese soccer to embrace a style of play that is both technical and tactical in scope - we like to call it the t-t revolution . while strides have undoubtedly been made by the national side , a fourth straight world cup qualification failure tells its own story . with world-class coach marcello lippi at the helm , china finished fifth in its qualifying group , 10 points behind table-topping iran , three behind second-place qualifier south korea , and , agonizingly , just one adrift of third-place syria , which went on to lose its two-legged qualifying playoff against australia . ",
        "since reaching the 2002 finals , china 's 2006 , 2010 and 2014 qualifying campaigns have all ended early . so , this time around , keeping its hopes alive of booking a ticket to russia until the final qualifier against qatar can be considered progress . lippi 's attack-minded tactics should also be applauded . the italian dispensed with the five-man defense of predecessor gao hongbo in favor of an adventurous 4-3-3 formation , which yielded morale-boosting victories over south korea , uzbekistan and qatar . however , with a relatively old starting xi , lippi 's influence can only extend so far . ",
        "most of the players are over 28 and have reached the limits of their physical fitness , technical ability and tactical nous . as for the younger players , he chao , wei shihao and yang liyu showed potential when called up for east asian cup duty but still looked raw compared to their senior teammates . meanwhile , at club level , the foreign influx of bigname coaches and players to the chinese super league has not changed csl clubs ' fortunes on the continental stage . andre villas-boas ' shanghai sipg went furthest of all the csl teams in the asian champions league , but the portuguese coach 's over-reliance on brazilian hulk was ultimately found out in the semifinal loss to japan 's urawa red diamonds . ",
        "chinese soccer , therefore , needs to focus its attention on the new generations of kids coming through . outdated training methods , however , continue to be a stumbling block . these days , two major styles of play prevail on europe 's pitches . one is tiki-taka - the short-passing game championed by spain and barcelona , which stresses constant movement off the ball and , above all , maintaining possession . the other is the more pragmatic , counter-attacking style employed by teams like european champion portugal and diego simeone 's atletico madrid . requiring intense energy levels to soak up pressure , sides then hit the opposition on the break , ideally with pacey forwards to execute the plan to maximum effect . ",
        "for china , tika-taka looks the best option . coming up against more physically imposing european and south american opposition , chinese players need to let the ball do the work . neighbor japan has proved adept at adopting this style . guangzhou r&f has also enjoyed considerable success with such tactics in the csl . despite having a cheaply assembled squad , r&f punched above its weight and took the scalp of local rival and reigning csl champion guangzhou evergrande on its way to finishing fifth last term . the mastermind behind r&f 's rise is coach dragan stojkovic , and if china is looking for someone to steer a brave new t-t course then it needs look no further than the 52-year-old serb . ",
        "stojkovic , who was a classy midfielder during his playing days for yugoslavia and marseille , has compared his soccer philosophy to that of arsenal boss arsene wenger , who still steadfastly sticks to a pretty passing game , even in the rough and tumble of the premier league . implementing a similar swashbuckling style at youth level in china is imperative . if not , the country will remain a prisoner of the tired old techniques of the past . xinhua .
