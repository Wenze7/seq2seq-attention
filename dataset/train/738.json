        "dominion virginia power 's north anna power station in mineral , virginia . courtesy dominion power/via reutersby yashaswini swamynathan - dominion energy inc said on wednesday it would buy scana corp in an all-stock deal worth about $ 7.9 billion , offering the utility a way to appease customers and investors angered by the cost of a failed nuclear project . richmond , virginia-based dominion will pay scana 's customers $ 1.3 billion , averaging about $ 1,000 for each customer , and has promised to cut bills by 5 percent to appease users who have been overcharged for years as scana funded the nuclear project . ",
        "shares of dominion , which will also assume scana 's debt of $ 6.7 billion , were down 4 percent in after-market trading . dominion 's $ 55.35 per share offer represents a premium of 42.4 percent to scana 's tuesday close . south carolina-based scana 's shares were trading well below the offer price at $ 47.89 , suggesting some investors were skeptical of the deal . scana , which owns the south carolina electric & gas co , has been under pressure since it scrapped the v. c. summer nuclear project in july after spending about $ 9 billion on it with state-owned utility santee cooper . ",
        "the company received a subpoena in october from the securities and exchange commission related to an investigation of the nuclear project . scana was funding some of the project 's costs from sce&g , a move that angered customers and led to the utility rolling back electricity rates for residential users . the nuclear project became a lightning rod for criticism , with local politicians arguing over who should pay for the aborted project . south carolina governor henry mcmaster said while the deal is a step in the right direction , it will not resolve all problems for customers . ",
        "as part of the deal , dominion will also write off more than $ 1.7 billion in connection with the abandoned nuclear plant . guggenheim securities analyst shahriar pourreza said he expects regulators to approve the deal . `` scana does not have any other option and regulators will be aware of that , so the deal is likely to go through but it will be noisy , '' pourreza said . dominion is offering 0.6690 of its shares for each scana share , or about $ 55.35 , based on dominion 's average stock price of the last 30 trading days ended jan. . ",
        "2 . the deal is expected to immediately add to earnings after its closure in the third quarter , dominion said . credit suisse was the financial adviser for dominion . morgan stanley and rbc capital markets advised scana .   "
