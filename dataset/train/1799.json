        "britain 's energy giants seldom find they 're in favour , but investors gave them the thumbs up on friday as they helped lead the footsie 's surge . british gas-owner centrica and united utilities have been treated like political footballs in recent years with labour proposing to `` regain control of energy supply networks '' should jeremy corbyn win the next election . the tories have been equally hostile -- promising to cap energy bills . but despite the political criticism , analysts at credit suisse have spotted an opportunity . since the eu referendum centrica 's share price has fallen 40 % , whereas over the past 18 months the sector has dropped 25 % as whole . ",
        "credit suisse analyst mark freshney said : `` centrica and sse have underperformed to the extent that the uk domestic energy supply businesses come almost free , in our view . '' freshney was also keen to play down the political risks , adding : `` should there be a labour-led government then re-nationalisation would be difficult . the spread of the £ 147 billion of regulated assets across debt and equity investors would require compensation . '' credit suisse now expects centrica to outperform and shares rose 2.7 p to 144.5 p. sse , which is merging its uk domestic business with npower , was up 6.6 p to 1306p . ",
        "united utilities was upgraded to neutral and shares climbed 11.2 p to 811p . the rally in utilities helped the ftse 100 hit a fresh intra-day day , up 23.14 points at 7720.31 . broker upgrades were coming thick and fast , with anglo american shares climbing after jefferies handed the miner a buy recommendation . analyst christopher lafemina said : `` mining sector fundamentals are very strong because of serious supply constraints at existing mines , a lack of supply growth from new projects , stable chinese demand , and improving demand in the rest of the world . '' ",
        "investors were cheered and anglo 's stock rose 17.8 p to 1623p . in the airline sector , easyjet saw passenger numbers rise despite heavy snowfall forcing 500 cancellations in december . in total 5.9 million people flew on its planes in the month , a rise of 5.5 % on 2016 . this week rival airline ryanair reported a 3 % jump in traffic over the christmas period . shares in easyjet ticked up 7p to 1517p . outside the top flight , ultra electronics was the major loser after news of a delay to the uk defence review . ",
        "shares in the defence and aerospace technology provider fell 10.7 p to 1283p : bae , chemring and cobham also all saw falls . guitar seller gear4music shares were also down 22p at 750p , despite announcing sales jumped 42 % to £ 34.6 million in the four months to 31 december . but shares in engineering firm keller climbed 41p to 1000p thanks to president donald trump . us tax reform is expected to see the group 's tax rate drop to 29 % from 34 % and analysts at peel hunt slapped an upgrade on the stock .
