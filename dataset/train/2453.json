        "elon musk has tweeted out photos of spacex 's almost fully assembled falcon heavy rocket in cape canaveral , florida -- the biggest and best glimpse so far into what the final iteration will look like . the rocket 's launch date is set for sometime in january and has never gotten this far in development before , so the photos do show something that 's quite promising . from the pictures , the biggest missing pieces look to be the payload and nose cone at the top . the falcon heavy consists of three falcon 9 cores strapped together and will be mostly reusable , with all three cores intended to return to earth after launch so they can be used for other missions . ",
        "musk has said the rocket 's outer cores for this upcoming launch are previously flown falcon 9 boosters . falcon heavy at the cape pic . twitter . com/hizfdvsu7x -- elon musk december 20 , 2017 . as we 've previously reported , the falcon heavy will be one of the most powerful rockets ever made , capable of lofting around 140,000 pounds of cargo into lower earth orbit . but given all the delays and challenges endured by falcon heavy , musk has understandably set the bar low for success . `` i hope it makes it far enough away from the pad that it does not cause pad damage , '' said musk in july . ",
        "`` i would consider even that a win , to be honest . ''   "
