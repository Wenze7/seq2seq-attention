        "about the author debra w. soh debra w. soh writes about the science and politics of sex and holds a phd in sexual neuroscience from york university . she co-hosts the forthcoming podcast , wrongspeak , with jonathan kay . follow her on twitter at : @drdebrasoh last week , cbc was scheduled to air the controversial bbc documentary transgender kids : who knows best ? but scrapped the plan the day of , citing audience feedback and its own `` further review of the doc . '' activists had argued that the film was `` harmful '' and poised to `` feed transphobia . '' ",
        "in actuality , the documentary offers a rare and factual perspective on the politicization of gender therapy by featuring interviews with dr. kenneth zucker , a psychologist and international research expert on gender dysphoria in children . although his research and approach to therapy are scientifically sound , they counter transgender orthodoxy in ways on which i will elaborate below . zucker 's approach but first , some background : in december of 2015 , zucker was fired from his position at the centre for addiction and mental health , where he had served as head of the child , youth , and family gender identity clinic . ",
        "many activists who had petitioned for his removal claimed victory . what was so controversial about zucker 's approach ? in short , he did not blindly follow the current popular dogma of affirming young children who say they want to transition to the opposite sex . instead , zucker 's therapy was informed by research that shows that the majority of gender dysphoric children desist by puberty . indeed , across all 11 studies conducted on this topic , including research published in the last five years , about 60 to 90 per cent of gender dysphoric children grow up to be gay in adulthood , not transgender . ",
        "zucker 's approach was not about `` curing '' transgender kids or conducting `` reparative '' or `` conversion therapy , '' as some of his critics contend . rather , it was about recognizing that it simply does n't make sense for a child to undergo the challenges of a social or physical transition if they are likely to grow comfortable in the body they already have , on their own . that is the so-called `` harmful '' view the documentary explores . to be clear , zucker was n't against transitioning for transgender people ; he published academic studies supporting the use of hormonal blockers and cross-sex hormones for patients upon reaching puberty . ",
        "he simply challenged the notion that every single child who says he or she is of the wrong gender is actually transgender . the film also discusses the subject of detransitioning : a process whereby people who have transitioned end up regretting it and transition back to their birth sex . it also shed light on the theory that underlying conditions can be mistaken for gender dysphoria , including autism and borderline personality disorder . when transgender kids was released earlier this year , i sensed a feeling of relief among my colleagues in sexology that someone was finally willing to challenge the `` gender affirmative '' approach , especially in a way that was made for public consumption . ",
        "nowadays , clinicians face extreme pressure to endorse the early transitioning model for their young patients , even when it may not be the best way forward for them . that 's certainly the message that zucker 's firing sent , and it speaks all the more to why the film needed to be aired . controversy in the u. k . this is not the first time transgender kids has encountered controversy . upon first airing in the u. k. , the film was widely protested and has since been removed from the bbc 's website . that 's not altogether surprising : in extreme cases , transgender activists have harassed and intimidated sex researchers who produce work that counters their political agenda . ",
        "that 's a big reason why you 'll be hard-pressed to find many new studies countering the early transitioning approach . more recently , this activism has influenced canadian policy by way of ontario 's bill 77 -- the affirming sexual orientation and gender identity act of 2015 -- which incorrectly conflates therapeutic approaches like zucker 's with unethical attempts to change a person 's sexual orientation . and bill 89 earlier this year , which writes gender ideology into child welfare laws and justifies intervention on the part of the government if a parent does not affirm a child 's gender identity or expression . ",
        "now the activism has made its way to canada 's publicly funded national broadcaster , which has opted against airing dissenting views on this issue . this should have individuals on both sides of the debate feeling unsettled . supporting transgender people , including their right to dignity , support and medical intervention , is n't at odds with taking a scientifically guided approach to determining the best outcomes for children . but as is commonly the case with political movements , these nuances only complicate the narrative and cede opportunities for activists to gain further ground . those complicit in the silencing of legitimate science have lost sight of the forest for the trees . ",
        "the issue is no longer about what 's in the best interest of these children , but about winning , at any cost , the ideological war . this column is part of cbc 's opinion section . for more information about this section , please read this editor 's blog and our faq .   "
