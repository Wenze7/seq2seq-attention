        "if you were thinking the world needs more smart speakers in it , you 're in luck : lg just announced the lg thinq speaker , basically a google home made by lg instead of google . however , this might best google 's own speaker in terms of audio quality . lg says it 's going to offer a `` premium-sounding '' experience that works with high-quality lossless files and has meridian audio technology built in , the fruits of a new partnership between lg and hi-fi stalwarts meridian . think better sound than the google home , though maybe not at the level of the google home max . ",
        "we 'll have to wait to hear for ourselves just how good the audio is , because the thinq speaker is being launched at a ces event in january , when we 'll also get details on pricing and availability . lg has worked with google on the device , so the google assistant integration should be seamless . more to comelg has also announced a number of other audio products for 2018 ahead of ces next month , including the sk10y soundbar , offering up 5.1.2 channels of premium 550w audio , and support for dolby atmos and the chromecast standard so you can fling stuff to it from your phone . ",
        "we 're also going to be seeing some new bluetooth speakers from lg with the pk prefix in the very near future . again there 's some high-fidelity meridian audio technology on board and judging by the use of the words `` rugged '' and `` convenient '' we 'd say these are going to be designed to go anywhere with you . on top of that , lg has some `` all-in-one party machines '' in the pipeline , complete with karaoke options and light schemes to really get the crowd jumping . further details on all of this kit will be revealed at ces , and we 'll be in las vegas as the event gets underway to bring you all the news .
