        "frankfurt am main - german sausage makers went to court tuesday to fight back against a record anti-trust fine for years of alleged price fixing in a sizzling scandal involving the nation 's favourite food . the federal cartel office slapped a 338 million euro fine on a string of german sausage producers in 2014 , accusing them of colluding for decades to squeeze higher prices out of meat lovers . but the powerful industry hit back with many of the accused exploiting a legal loophole to escape the penalty , leaving just a small group of companies on the hook for a fraction of the bill . ",
        "of the 22 firms and 33 individuals initially fined -- including big name brands herta and boeklunder -- just four sausage producers appeared in the duesseldorf regional court to contest their share of the punishment -- some 22.6 million euros . they are heidemark maesterkreis , wiesenhof , franz wiltmann and ruegenwalder muehle as well as five company officials . they deny accusations of belonging to a so-called `` sausage cartel '' and refuse to pay up . eleven other firms have accepted penalties to the tune of some 70 million euros . but the remaining companies made use of a legal sleight of hand and simply restructured to make nearly 240 million euros of the total bill disappear . ",
        "under the loophole -- dubbed the `` sausage gap '' -- parent companies could not be held liable for the anti-trust fines of a subsidiary if that subsidiary ceased to exist . the legal trickery ended earlier this year with a change in german competition law . wolfgang ingold , the chief executive of franz wiltmann , told industry publication lebensmittel zeitung he had been advised to employ the same tactic . `` but we have nothing to hide and we want to see that confirmed by a court , '' he was quoted as saying . - wurst-case scenario - the legal action is not without risks . ",
        "in a worst-case scenario , the court could impose an even heftier fine if it believes the accused have been telling porkies . the duesseldorf court has scheduled hearings in the case until may . the `` sausage gap '' loophole is expected to loom large over the proceedings , according to rene grafunder , a berlin-based expert in competition law at dentons law firm . `` it seems odd that small and medium-sized companies have to pay millions in fines , while their larger competitors get away without any punishment at all , '' he told dpa news agency . ",
        "the `` wurstkartell '' claims stunned germans when they first came to light in a country known for its fondness of bratwurst . although consumption has fallen slightly in recent years , germans still eat on average 60 kilos of meat annually , with sausages and processed meats making up around half that figure -- equivalent to a hot dog a day . the cartel was nicknamed the `` atlantic group '' after the hamburg hotel where the first meeting was held to discuss pricing in the early 1980s , according to the fco anti-trust watchdog . acting on an anonymous tip-off , the fco found that the companies kept in regular touch and colluded to force german food retailers to pay higher prices for their pork and poultry products . ",
        "the `` wurst '' scandal capped a record year for the fco , coming hot on the heels of 280-million-euro fine imposed on three large sugar producers for anti-competitive behaviour . also in 2014 , more than 10 breweries were fined over 300 million euros for fixing beer prices .   "
