        "harrisburg , pa -- a bizarre exchange tuesday at a meeting of a pennsylvania house committee has the state democratic party calling on a republican member to resign . at issue . . `` andlocked easements and roads , '' or at least that 's what montgomery county democrat matt bradford was trying to raise . `` i hear you , '' he said . `` i understand there are some hard feelings with penndot . '' `` representative bradford , just -- look , '' said republican daryl metcalfe . but when bradford punctuated his point by touching metcalfe 's arm . ",
        "the republican , who was sitting next to him at the table , interrupted . `` i 'm a heterosexual , '' metcalfe said . `` i have a wife . i love my wife . i do n't like men , as you might . stop touching me all the time . keep your hands to yourself . if you want to touch somebody , you have people on your side of the aisle that might like it . i do n't . '' some chuckling in the room , then bradford moves to postpone . `` we 're officially off the rails , '' bradford said . ",
        "no laughing matter , says the pa democratic party , which wants metcalfe to step down for what a spokesman calls a `` random homophobic tirade . '' the republican party has n't responded to our request for comment .   "
