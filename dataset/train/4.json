        "when the gold apple watch edition launched in 2015 at a high-end price of $ 17,000 , it raised eyebrows . but that 's nothing compared to a diamond-plated tag heuer handset that was recently announced . tag heuer on monday announced the new connected modular smartwatch , featuring a white gold band and nearly two dozen carats of diamonds . it costs 190,000 swiss francs , or about $ 197,000 . tag heuer said in a statement that the device is the most expensive smartwatch ever released . in a listing on its website , tag heuer said that the smartwatch comes with a round 1.4-inch screen that doubles as a touch display for tapping around the device 's android wear operating system . ",
        "it also works with apple 's iphones , allowing users to see notifications , access app information , and more . it comes with 4 gb of storage and has a near-field communication chip so users can place it near a point-of-sale terminal and make mobile purchases . get data sheet , fortune 's technology newsletter tag heuer is one of many traditional watchmakers trying its luck in a smartwatch market dominated by apple and google . many of those traditional watchmakers are designing products that come with traditional watch designs but support apps , notifications , and other features users might want in a smartwatch . ",
        "still , apple watch has proven most popular in the fledgling market . whether anyone will actually want a nearly $ 200,000 smartwatch remains to be seen . while apple has n't ever released apple watch sales data , the company 's decision in 2016 to discontinue its gold apple watch edition suggested there was little demand for such an expensive smartwatch . and with a price tag that 's more than 10 times greater than that apple watch edition , tag heuer 's smartwatch might have some trouble finding buyers .
