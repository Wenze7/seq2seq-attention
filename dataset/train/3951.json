        "you do n't have to do all of this . here 's how to temper your daily routine and focus on what matters . credit : mit sloan school of managementrobert pozen is a very productive person : an mit sloan senior lecturer , he served as the former president of fidelity investments , executive chairman of mfs investment management , and as an associate general counsel of the u. s. securities and exchange commission . his latest book is `` extreme productivity : boost your results , reduce your hours , '' and he teaches the mit sloan executive education course maximizing your personal productivity : how to become an efficient and effective executive . ",
        "pozen shared productivity tips in a jan. . 16 webinar moderated by mit sloan associate dean of executive education peter hirst , part of the innovation@work series . `` i see so many people struggling with their daily routine . this is the application of systemized common sense , '' pozen said . here 's what he had to say : measure productivity in results , not hourshours are a traditional way of tracking employee productivity , said pozen , but this is outdated . instead , think about performance-based productivity . `` hours are n't a good proxy for what we produce , '' he said . ",
        "`` i 've asked journalists : ` have you ever spent three weeks on an article that was n't good ? and have you spent three days on one that was really great ? what was the more productive use of your time ? ' `` rank your goals and prioritize your timerank your key goals for the following week and the following year . `` so few people do this , and it 's so important , '' he said . divide them into supply and demand . on the supply side : do your goals reflect what you like and what you 're best at ? ",
        "what 's the purpose behind each activity and goal ? on the demand side : how much do your goals take into account your organization 's needs ? do n't sweat the small stuff `` we have so much small stuff that overwhelms us , and we wind up using our time on it , like email . most of us look at email every three to five minutes . instead , look every hour or two , and when you do look , look only at subject matter and sender , '' he said . pozen uses the `` ohio '' technique . ",
        "the `` only handle it once '' method means that when you do read an email , decide whether it warrants a response . if so , reply immediately . but 80 percent of emails do n't require a reply , he said . if you 're stuck with an essential but menial task you just ca n't complete , do n't procrastinate . `` break it into a few easy pieces , '' he said . `` start with the easiest one . once you get started and can do a piece , you 'll feel good enough to get on to the next one . ",
        "`` for high-priority projects : start at the end , not the beginningdo n't wait until the end of a project to write conclusions , pozen cautioned . instead , do one to two days of research and formulate tentative conclusions . perform a `` mid-flight '' check to revise , then draw final conclusions . `` most people spend six or seven weeks gathering data , speaking to people , and then in the last week or two they spend time trying to synthesize and come up with the key answers . that 's an inefficient way to handle research projects , '' he said . ",
        "`` if you wait , you will gather lots and lots of data that turned out to be irrelevant . `` take time to thinkbuild time for contemplation into your daily schedule . not every hour has to be scheduled . `` you need downtime to think -- it 's part of most people 's jobs , '' he said . this way you ensure your day is aligned with your goals instead of spent in meetings . be boringformer president barack obama would travel with a few blue suits , pozen said , so he would n't be bogged down with fashion choices . ",
        "take the variables out of your routine -- what to wear , what to eat for breakfast -- and make it predictable to reduce decision-making time . `` in the morning , try to be a boring person , '' he said . go home `` every day can not be an emergency , '' he said . there 's rarely a reason to stay at work beyond dinnertime . get home at a reasonable hour and have dinner with your family . unplug electronics . do n't take phone calls or emails , he said . `` stop at the door and go through your emails , so by the time you 're at dinner , you can focus for two or three hours , '' he said . ",
        "often , people are afraid to leave early because other employees might judge them . `` sometimes people are proud to have face time , and they think it makes them productive . sometimes people are afraid to leave at 5:30 even if they 're done because they 're looked at strangely , '' he said . `` but those people might have been playing video games or in meetings all day . `` provided by mit sloan school of managementthis story is republished courtesy and copyrighted by phys . org , a popular site that covers news about science research .
