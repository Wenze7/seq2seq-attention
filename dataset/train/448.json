        "a quote from the letter written to the israeli prime minister noted , ` our indian prime minister mr. narendra modi addressed a gathering of approximately 8000 indians in tel aviv . '' members of india 's tiny jewish community are disappointed that they will not be invited to meet with prime minister benjamin netanyahu during his upcoming visit to mumbai , according to an active member of the community . in a signature campaign addressed to netanyahu last week , solomon f. sopher , a prominent figure in the community , wrote on behalf of the jewish community of india that `` indian jewry is extremely pained to note with a heavy heart that you have taken a bitter decision not to meet the community during your visit to mumbai . ",
        "`` netanyahu is set to pay a visit to the chabad center in mumbai that was the target of a terror attack on november 2008 , as well as meeting with a few jewish community leaders . a signed letter from at least 208 people said that the community conveys `` our extreme pleasure and honor to welcome you to india . we do n't need to explain what the state of israel means to every jew and you as its prime minister visiting mumbai for the very first time is historic . '' the letter went on to say that the jewish community was eagerly looking forward to meeting with netanyahu and `` your decision to meet a handful of so called ` jewish leaders ' is being very unfair to the jews of india . ",
        "'' `` our indian prime minister mr. narendra modi addressed a gathering of approximately 8000 indians in tel aviv during his visit in july 2017 in israel , '' the letter noted . `` can you not , mr. prime minister address your 300-400 jewish brothers and sisters for just 15 minutes ? it will mean so much to them and make them so happy . `` over 4,000 jews live in india , the majority of them in mumbai . sopher is chairman and managing director of the jacob sassoon trust which runs a number of synagogues in mumbai and pune , including the knesset eliyahoo synagogue . ",
        "sopher wrote that the latter `` has always been considered safe and secure for dignitaries '' while he described the chabad house which netanyahu is scheduled to visit as `` vulnerable . `` sopher sent several letters to the office of the israeli embassy in new dehli and to the consulate general mumbai , but said he received no response . he told the jerusalem post that he was not sure if the letter ever reached the prime minister . the post did not receive a response on the matter from israeli ambassador to india daniel carmon or from the prime minister 's office . ",
        "netanyahu arrived in new dehli on sunday for a six day visit in india and is set to fly to mumbai on thursday for a short visit there before returning to israel before shabbat on friday . the trip will focus on economic and technological cooperation and development .   "
