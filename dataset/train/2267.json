        "sergio fajardo gesticula hoy 20 de febrero del 2013 en bogotá colombia durante una entrevista concedida a yamid amat . foto mauricio moreno el tiempo crédito : ceet fotógrafo : mauricio moreno as colombian presidential candidates try to outdo each other with pledges to slash taxes , sergio fajardo has stood aloof from what he calls the `` political bazaar . '' `` at the moment , i ca n't promise to cut any tax , '' fajardo , a former mathematics professor currently leading in polls , said in a tv interview last month . `` it would be irresponsible to tell colombia that we 'll cut taxes in the condition we 're in . ",
        "`` fajardo 's calls for prudence make him appear to be the only fiscal conservative with a decent chance of becoming colombia 's next president . yet , a look at his record tells another story . in four years as governor of antioquia , colombia 's most economically important province , fajardo more than doubled its debt burden and increased its dependence on loans in foreign currency . when he left office in 2015 , antioquia 's debt had ballooned to 1.4 trillion pesos , from 640 billion pesos when he took office , and its fiscal indicators were flashing red . ",
        "fitch ratings put the province on negative watch for the first time in its history a few months later , while the national planning department cut its `` fiscal sustainability '' ranking . fajardo 's closest rival in recent polls is former bogota mayor gustavo petro , a leftist feared by foreign investors , who suspect he might reproduce venezuela 's economic disaster in colombia . yet while fajardo was doubling antioquia 's debt , petro cut bogota 's . in response to emailed questions , fajardo 's press office said that his administration took on the debt to finance his plan `` antioquia the most educated '' , under which several hundred schools and colleges upgraded their infrastructure , new branches of antioquia university were opened , thousands of teachers received training and dozens of `` educational parks '' were inaugurated . ",
        "fajardo 's administration also built 20,000 homes , and brought electricity to 100,000 rural dwellings while taking on debt in a `` responsible '' manner , his office said . currency riskfiscal questions are playing a central role in debates ahead of the presidential election in may , after s&p global ratings downgraded the country 's rating for the first time in 15 years , to one notch above junk . to stay within the `` fiscal rule '' , or balanced budget act , the next government needs to cut the fiscal deficit to 1.1 percent of gross domestic product by 2022 , from an estimated 3.6 percent last year . ",
        "fajardo needed to borrow to fund a backlog of delayed investments in the region , according to fitch . in 2013 , when a dollar was worth less than 2,000 pesos , he took out a $ 77 million loan which , even though it was with a local lender , was denominated in u. s. currency . this took advantage of lower interest rates on dollar debt , but increased antioquia 's exposure to currency risk . he also borrowed $ 70 million from france 's development agency the following year , just as peso was beginning its big selloff . ",
        "those decisions came back to bite him when the currency lost more than a third of its value in the 2014-2015 oil price slump , causing the cost of servicing the debt to soar in local currency terms . `` he made some necessary investments in the province , in improving education and access to higher education , '' said carlos ramirez , an analyst at fitch ratings in bogota . `` the stains were to take on long-term debt in foreign currency , and the rapid growth in debt until it reached the upper limit '' allowed to provinces . ",
        "fitch cited the levels of dollar-denominated debt and `` absence of currency hedging mechanisms '' as the main weaknesses of the province 's finances , when it put antioquia on negative outlook in 2016 . the outlook was returned to stable last year , after it undertook a `` plan for restoring fiscal and financial health . `` other leading contenders to win the presidency include former vice president german vargas lleras and ivan duque , an ally of former president alvaro uribe . both are pledging a to slash corporate taxes , which they say are asphyxiating business , and betting on a crackdown on evasion to balance the books . ",
        "fajardo , who studied at the university of wisconsin-madison , says that a crackdown on evasion must come first , and be shown to have worked , before taxes can safely be reduced . colombia will hold the first round of presidential election in may , with a run-off vote in june , and the new president taking office in august . read math whiz who doubled debt is favorite to win colombian election on bloombergpolitics . com .
