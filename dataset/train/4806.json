        "story time : `` i value loyalty way too much to waste it on folks who do n't value me . '' - alex elleafter spending years of your life with someone you 're pretty invested . you 're emotional , mentally , physically invested in someone other than yourself . i did n't think i 'd be able to commit that type of investment into someone else , but there i was falling in love . your parents never tell you the ugly side of love , they just read us these fairy tales and some of us actually expect a happily ever after . ",
        "the reality is , there will be some blissful days and others that feel like utter shit . there will be those days where you ca n't see yourself without the other person , and others where you think you 'll be on snapped catching a charge . what makes love worth giving it another chance ? you never think you 'll experience cheating in your own relationship . `` girl ! not my man , he loves me ! '' we 've seen it played out in the media from some of our favorite celebrities . jay-z confirms that he stepped out on beyoncé in recent interviews . ",
        "i always wondered how people in the media dealt with such public scrutiny . do they have to put on this pleasant facade , when they 're actually barely getting by . how do you come back from that type of betrayal ? after he cheats , why are we left picking up the pieces ? once i realized social media women and randoms occupied my then boyfriends phone and time , i could n't comprehend why i was n't enough . the funny thing about getting cheated on is that the victim usually blames themselves . here i am , giving what i thought was enough to another human being , when they were n't ready to receive it . ",
        "i think that 's where most of us women fail . we give our all to those who are undeserving of it or who are n't willing to accept it in the same capacity as it was given . keep some for you ! if you give and give , there wo n't be much of yourself left . lesson learned . must we act like we 're fine , when we 're really not ? scene 1 was him taking my phone - questioning me about my male friends and who i 've been texting lately . it 's strange how the one doing the dirt , thinks you may be doing the same . ",
        "scene 2 is me seeing his phone - the women , the messages , the pictures , the dm 's . hearing the , `` i 'm sorry , it was one time , '' while i slam clothes in a overnight bag and get the hell out . scene 3 is me crying and cursing to myself on the way to no where , hoping a friend picks up their phone , so i can crash on somebodies couch . scene 4 is the wine , the tears , the snot , the venting . scene 5 is me wanting to know why . ",
        "a week goes by and i 'm saying i 'm fine to friends when they ask , when in reality , i do n't think i 've ever felt so alone . it 's taken me some time to realize it 's okay to not be okay . i 've given myself this freedom to do what i need to do in order to move on . he owes me no explanation , and i owe it to myself to not dwell on that . this quick story is my release , because i 'm still not okay and that 's fine .
