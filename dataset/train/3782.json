",
        "with shredded purple cabbage , grated carrot , thinly sliced snow or snap peas , chopped cilantro , and thinly sliced green onion , this salad totally delivers on that front . it does n't hurt that the sauce -- a mixture of smooth peanut butter , reduced-sodium tamari or soy sauce , maple syrup or honey , rice vinegar , toasted sesame oil , fresh ginger , lime juice , and red pepper flakes -- is so delicious you 'll want to just drink it straight-up . the author uses quinoa as the base for this salad , but you could also use millet if that 's what you have on hand .
