        "andrea southam for sky 1 . the new season of black mirror is every bit as surprising , gripping , bleak and blackly comic as the previous three . but something struck us when we watched the episode , ` black museum ' -- a surprising link between charlie brooker 's latest chiller and professional idiot karl pilkington . ` black museum ' tells us a series of interconnected short stories , one of which follows a loving couple -- carrie and jack -- and , be warned , there are spoilers from here on out . their bliss is interrupted when carrie is hit by a car and left in a coma . ",
        "devastated , jack is approached by an unsavoury scientist type who convinces him that , by way of extraordinary new technology , he can have carrie 's mind installed in his own brain . `` we only use 40 % of our brain capacity , '' says the scientist . `` there is this whole other 60 % of our noggin hanging around like an empty airbnb . we can fit another whole consciousness into that unused space . `` jack agrees to the procedure and has carrie 's consciousness implanted in the ` dormant ' part of his brain , allowing the two to communicate again . ",
        "now , here 's where things get interesting ... 10 years ago , ricky gervais , stephen merchant and karl pilkington were topping the podcast charts with the ricky gervais show , which saw gervais and merchant take pilkington to task for his confused but very funny take on the world . in a 2007 episode , pilkington reveals that he recently had a meeting with two film producers and pitched them a film . of course , it never got made , but karl 's idea is strikingly similar to the carrie / jack plot from ` black museum ' . ",
        "he picks `` clive warren '' and rebecca de mornay as the stars of his film , and says of the plot , `` they 're going out together ` an that . you 're thinking , ` oh , they 've got a nice life ... ' then he walks out the house , gets hit by a bus . `` so clive warren 's dead -- she 's devastated . `` jonathan prime / netflix . so far , so ` black museum ' . but the similarities do n't end there ... `` i 've read a thing about how ... you 've actually got a full brain , you can run it on half , '' karl tells ricky and steve . ",
        "`` chances are , he 's not going to come out of that coma , but his brain is still awake . say , 'd ` you want half of his brain in yer head ? what will happen is , he 's gone , but you 'll have his thoughts ' . `` sure enough , rebecca , like jack , has clive 's consciousness implanted in her brain . or as karl puts it , `` she 's rebecca de mornay , but now and again with him chipping in with a bit of voiceover . `` all this is pretty uncanny , right ? ",
        "but the similarities continue ! in ` black museum ' , the brain procedure ends up having negative consequences -- tensions flare between jack and carrie , as he finds it difficult having her inside his head 24/7 . in one sequence , jack checks out another woman and gets a tongue-lashing from carrie . eventually , he ends up pursuing a new romance . karl 's story goes down a similar route , with rebecca furious when her mental link with clive reveals he was having an affair . `` she hears voice go , ` lesley , where are ya ? ' ",
        "-- her name 's not lesley , '' karl explained . `` she 's thinking , ` who 's lesley ? ' `` of course , pilkington 's idea is utterly ridiculed and torn apart by gervais and merchant . `` what are you talking about ? ! '' gervais rages . `` why would i have someone 's brain in my head when they 're dead ? ! '' gervais goes on to call karl 's idea `` the most ludicrous idea for a film i 've ever heard '' , `` the ramblings of a mental case '' and , most biting of all , `` the worst idea i have ever heard , for any piece of art '' . ",
        "hmmm ... we wonder what ricky would make of ` black museum ' ? because the similarities really are startling . and that 's before we get into the episode 's final twist involved a toy monkey -- just the sort of thing karl might 've come up with ... black mirror is available to watch now on netflix . you can listen to karl pilkington 's movie idea in full over here .
