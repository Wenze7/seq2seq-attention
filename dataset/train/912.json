        "scunthorpe trailed to jamal lowe 's opener in a first half where they struggled , but they were a different side after the break as they dominated the second half . kevin van veen brought united level and they were unlucky that one of their other chances did n't go in . `` i think we more than held our own once we realised what we needed to do , '' alexander said . `` we had the best opportunity right at the start that we did n't manage to take and they scored from their first opportunity . `` the first half was scrappy and they had changed formation to combat ours and nullify us and i thought both teams cancelled each other out . ",
        "`` we changed a couple of things at half time , the players realised how good they were and we showed better composure in the second half . `` we were more aggressive and did the basics well . portsmouth 1 scunthorpe united 1 : kevin van veen goal helps iron force draw `` we dominated the second half and deservedly got the equaliser and were pushing for that winning goal , but we had to keep the door shut at the back . '' tom hopper and kevin van veen combined superbly for the iron 's equaliser and alexander reserved special praise for the strike partnership . ",
        "`` hops was a thorn in their side and kev was superb , '' he continued . `` as a front pair they gave portsmouth problems . `` it was a fantastic ball from hops and we know when kev gets in those areas and gets shots off they invariably hit the target and it was a fantastic finish . `` their keeper made a fantastic save off josh and funso 's header hit a defenders boot and if you get one of those you nick a 2-1 win . `` it is a difficult venue to come to and we showed we can compete in that arena and win points . ",
        "`` i was delighted with the way the second half went . we grew in confidence , realised we are a very good team and justified that in the second half . ''   "
