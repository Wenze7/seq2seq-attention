        "january is less than two days old and already we have a reminder of the bad side of youtube after it emerged that logan paul , a brash 22-year-old with over 15 million subscribers and a clothing line in his name , posted then removed a video that included footage of an apparent suicide victim . the video was taken at aokigahara , a forest in japan that is known for suicides . titled `` we found a dead body in the japanese suicide forest '' with a thumbnail image of paul standing in front of a blurred out body , the video got more than 1 million views before being removed within 24 hours . ",
        "in the video , paul , a number of other youtubers and a guide who accompanied them found the body of a man who had apparently hanged himself . paul zoomed his video camera to show the body and later took close-up footage with only the face blurred out while the guide phoned the police . the youtuber -- who stars in mgm 's valley girl film which is due out this year and is part of youtube 's paid-for red subscription service -- said in the video that he originally intended to focus on the haunted aspect of the forest . ",
        "when one of his group said he did n't feel good after seeing the hanging body , paul said `` you never stand next to a dead guy ? '' and laughed . paul responded to anger at the posting with an apology in which he claimed he was trying to raise awareness of suicide and suicide prevention . in his apology , paul claimed he has posted videos for more than 15 months which got him `` caught up in the moment without fully weighing up the possible ramifications . '' this was n't a live blog and , as many pointed out on twitter , paul and his team had ample time during editing or preparation to elect not to post the video . ",
        "there are no official figures for suicides in aokigahara , primarily because the japanese government does n't want to promote the forest as a suicide destination , but more than 500 people are said to have died there since the 1950s . japan 's suicide rate is the sixth highest in the world although figures have declined in recent years . the latest government report found that 21,897 people took their own life in 2016 -- while that represented the lowest number for 22 years , suicide remains the top cause of death for people aged 15-39 . disney cut ties with paul 's younger brother , jake , last year . ",
        "the younger paul had been in the media for causing havoc in the west hollywood neighborhood he moved into . the duo are not the only big name stars from google-owned youtube who ran into trouble . pewdiepie lost a contract with disney following anti-semitic content on his channel , while he apologized in september for using the n-word in a broadcast . last year saw youtube continue to cement its position as the internet 's go-to video portal , but a number of troubling incidents demonstrated the issues with unregulated content from new media creators and -- now -- bots that create content aimed at gaining clicks from children . ",
        "in response , youtube cut down on unsuitable content -- removing channels deemed exploitative such as toyfreaks -- while it introduced new moderation processes for kid-focused content , and pledged to increase its army of content checkers and moderators to 10,000 people . this article originally appeared on techcrunch at = txtlnkusaolp00000595 .
