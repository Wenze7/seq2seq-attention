        "warning : this story contains major spoilers from the fall finale of once upon a time . read at your own risk ! once upon a time not only dropped a shocking reveal when it comes to who cast the curse but also introduced an even greater foe in its fall finale . via flashback , viewers learned that drizella abducted henry , poisoning his heart in order to force regina to help her cast the curse . hence , if the curse is broken , henry will die . alas , if the curse is not broken , lucy will die , putting regina in the difficult position of deciding whether to sacrifice her son to save her granddaughter . ",
        "`` as drizella promised , she 's come up with what she believes is a foolproof plan , so there 's a conundrum , '' executive producer edward kitsis tells ew . `` regina is going to be looking for the help of zelena and whoever she can to find the third way that does n't kill lucy or henry , and that breaks the curse . '' but the threat runs deeper than that as drizella was not acting alone . the curse was n't actually cast by one particular witch , but the coven of 8 -- a group of mysterious origin whom mother gothel is trying to reunite in hyperion heights . ",
        "`` we understand that there is a coven and she 's gathering them for a purpose that will be revealed in the second half of the season , '' kitsis says of the new threat coming in 2018 . `` the witches are all in hyperion heights , so we 'll be meeting them in the second half of the season . '' for now , the coven 's true motives are somewhat shrouded in mystery . `` the coven is going to be different because it 's led by mother gothel , '' kitsis says . `` what she wants is going to directly affect one of our characters and yet the audience does n't know which one yet . ",
        "they would assume it is based on what they 've seen , because we 've seen her be locked up , but as lady tremaine warned us , ` do n't let her out , ' she is out and we 're going to be realizing they 're gunning after one of our characters for a very specific reason . '' alas , the ouat bosses are coy to reveal any of the coven member 's identities , only teasing there will be a pretty major new face among them . `` i think there 's going to be some surprises , '' kitsis says . ",
        "`` what happens with the witch story line hopefully will also be surprising . we will be seeing someone in episode 11 , which is a reference we 've never done before , which is from the haunted mansion . '' one character who 's definitely not part of the coven is drizella , whom mother gothel had been manipulating for the express purpose of transferring her magic to anastasia . `` drizella was warned not to let gothel out , and she did and now she finds herself in a pit with her mother , who she hates , so their family has only grown more dysfunctional , '' kitsis says . ",
        "`` drizella 's desire for revenge only grows stronger . we 've seen moments of kindness from drizella , so we 'll have to see whether or not she is fully an evil stepsister , or if she can be redeemed , but right now , she 's out for revenge . '' once upon a time will return in 2018 on abc .   "
