        "anyone who drove the previous generation bmw m5 knew that it was only truly happy if it was converting expensive rubber into smoke . in a bid to show enthusiasts that adding all-wheel-drive has n't changed the m5 's inner idiot , bmw went out once again on dec. . 11 , 2017 , to set two guinness world records for greatest distance vehicle drift in 8 hours and longest twin vehicle drift . if this sounds familiar , it should . bmw set an absurd drift distance record back in 2013 when johan schwarz , a bmw performance driving instructor slid around the bavarian brand 's spartanburg facility for 51.278 miles . ",
        "this time , schwartz crushed his record by mercilessly shredding tires for a total of 232.5 miles . that distance required some serious technology to make it possible , most notably a custom-developed mid-drift refueling device because , as you might imagine , roasting tires with a twin-turbo v8 is going to sip more than a little gas . bmw enlisted the services of mooresville , nc-based automotive performance engineering wizards detroit speed to create a dry break fuel filler which works a bit like the midair refueling system on a fighter jet . `` we knew going in that if we were going to recapture the world record for longest sustained drift and set the bar as high as possible , we would need to find a way to keep the m5 going without stopping to refuel , '' said johan schwartz , performance driving instructor at bmw 's spartanburg , sc performance driving center . ",
        "`` in the end , the refueling system worked flawlessly , and the m5 performed as expected . it was a big win all around . `` the system required a second m5 , this one a previous-generation f10 m5 to drift with schwartz 's car in parallel to maintain a set distance so that the excellently-named matt butts of detroit speed could straddle both vehicles at speed and complete the refueling . `` although we practiced the refueling several times before the guinness world records title attempt , there was very little margin for error , '' said matt butts , the head development driver for detroit speed . ",
        "`` we 're excited to have played a part in johan and bmw recapturing this record . `` once the first record was set , bmw figured that it should try and snag another one while everyone was there , you know , german efficiency and all that . schwartz hopped back into his m5 and was joined by bmw performance driving center chief instructor matt mullins in another m5 , and they executed a one-hour water-assisted tandem drift over a length of 49.25 miles . schwartz and mullins will be sharing all of their dorifto madness with the folks at ces with drift demonstrations at the top of every hour .
