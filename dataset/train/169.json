        "camden , n. j. -- the camden city school district will move out of its headquarters near the delaware river waterfront in february . the building is being sold . the eight-story building at front and cooper used to be headquarters for rca victor back in its heyday . the school district purchased the building in 2006 for $ 2 million . camden-based developer millennial partners is buying the building for $ 5.2 million with plans to turn it into commercial office space . `` it 's been a priority of ours for awhile now to sell the building , '' district superintendent paymon rouhanifard told kyw newsradio , `` and really the main reason is that it 's really old , dilapidated , falling apart and too big for our needs . ",
        "so it 's a no-brainer in terms of our cost saving measures to sell the building . '' so where is the school district going ? `` we 're moving into one of our old school buildings which has been vacant for about a year now , '' rouhanifard added , `` and so we can go back into or move closer to the community , i should say , and utilize one of our old school buildings , save a lot of money and take a vacant building off the block . '' another benefit of moving into the old washington school a couple miles away ? ",
        "there 's actually parking available for some 150 staffers and those needing to do business at district headquarters . parking 's been a problem down near the river . the new offices are also accessible to public transit .   "
