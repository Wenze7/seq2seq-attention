        "opec 's strategy to end a worldwide crude glut is causing havoc for a vital link in the oil industry 's supply chain : the fleet of supertankers that shuttle fuel between continents . the ships ' average earnings plunged last year by more than half to levels not seen since 2009 and far below what shipping analysts had been predicting . now , the producer group 's extension of output cuts throughout 2018 is adding to the downturn . `` these cuts reduced the number of cargoes from the middle east to asia significantly at a time when a large amount of newly-built vessels are being delivered , '' olivier jakob , managing director at petromatrix gmbh in zug , switzerland , said in a phone interview . ",
        "related : mideast oil exports falloil supertankers , known in the industry as very large crude carriers , or vlccs , can measure a quarter of a mile in length and haul about 2 million barrels of crude . since the beginning of 2017 , the organization of petroleum exporting countries and its allies have sought to reduce oil production by almost 1.8 million barrels a day , curbing exports and business for tankers on key trade routes . the group in june plans to revisit the cuts , which currently run through the end of the year . crude exports from opec 's persian gulf members last month dropped below 18 million barrels a day for the first time since august , tanker-tracking data compiled by bloomberg show . ",
        "in particular , observed shipments declined to china and japan from saudi arabia , iran and the united arab emirates . related : venezuela oil production falls to lowest since 2002meanwhile , the global supertanker fleet is expected to expand by 4 percent this year , after growing 5.3 percent last year and 7.4 percent in 2016 , clarkson research services ltd. . estimates . shipping rates have tumbled in recent months , a time of year when they often strengthen . `` if opec lifts the output cut in its revision in june , the rates would improve as more oil will be pumped to the market , '' said jakob . ",
        "`` but if it does n't then the rates would suffer the whole year . `` rate routearnings for the vessels slumped by 57 percent to $ 17,794 a day on average last year , the lowest since at least 2009 , clarkson data show . analysts surveyed by bloomberg had anticipated an average of $ 25,000 a day for 2017 . oil prices and tanker earnings often move in opposite directions . in 2013 , a year when brent crude reached almost $ 120 a barrel , supertankers earned an average $ 18,621 a day , according to clarkson . ",
        "two years later , amid the oil-price slump , daily returns jumped to an average $ 64,846 . since june , brent futures have soared more than 50 percent to the highest level in more than three years . they traded at $ 67.92 a barrel as of 1:53 p. m. in london . earnings on a key supertanker route from the persian gulf to asia plummeted 69 percent in 2017 to end the year at about $ 16,000 a day , well below the december seasonal average , baltic exchange data show . the rate rout has affected some of the world 's largest tanker companies . ",
        "shares of bermuda-based dht holdings inc. . declined to a 2017-low of $ 3.55 on dec. . 20 , though they have risen slightly in recent days . frontline ltd. 's shares dropped 39 percent last year . fleet growth and inventory drawdowns , which reduce the amount of fuel for export , are `` the dominant reason for the weak tanker market we have experienced during the last 12 months , '' robert hvide macleod , chief executive officer of frontline 's management business , said by email . the opec cuts have been offset by an increase in trade flows elsewhere , including the atlantic basin and from the u. s. to asia , he said . ",
        "amid the market turbulence , antwerp-based euronav nv on dec. . 21 said it would acquire gener8 maritime inc. . of new york , creating an independent tanker operator with a fleet of 75 crude tankers , including 44 vlccs . euronav declined to comment because the transaction has n't been completed yet . a gener8 maritime spokesman did n't respond to a request for comment . ` double whammy ' `` the crude tanker market has a double whammy : reduced opec exports and too many new ships , '' said burak cetinok , head of research at arrow shipbroking group in london . ",
        "`` we expect volatility in the rates this year but overall a challenging market . `` in addition , crude is now trading in a structure called backwardation , when near-term contracts are at a premium to later-dated ones , an indication that the market is re-balancing and the attraction of storing oil -- particularly at sea -- is diminishing . `` that frees the ships tied-up for storing oil , adding to the vessel glut , '' petromatrix 's jakob said . the second half of this year may provide a turning point for supertankers as demand for opec crude increases and fleet growth slows , according to shipping analyst eirik haavaldsen at investment bank pareto securities as . ",
        "`` the first half will be weak though , and probably weaker than the first half of 2017 , '' he said .   "
