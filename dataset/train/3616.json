        "british airways chief executive officer alex cruz defended his decision to start charging for food on short-haul routes , saying the measure was necessary in order to compete in an environment of falling ticket prices . `` given some of the fares in the marketplace , we make no apology for making ourselves more efficient in various ways so we can consistently compete effectively , '' cruz said wednesday in london . he added that ba remains , `` and always will be , '' a premium airline . the unit of iag sa scrapped free meals on european flights in january , inviting passengers to buy onboard snacks and sandwiches from marks & spencer group plc. . ",
        "cruz , who moved from discount unit vueling in 2016 , has also overhauled ba 's loyalty program and come under fire for planning to board passengers in the same class according to how much they paid . the carrier is seeking to compete with network peers air france-klm group and deutsche lufthansa ag and fend off discount specialists including ryanair holdings plc. . questioned at the london aviation club by former ba concorde pilot john hutchinson , who labeled the change of food policy a `` complete disaster , '' cruz insisted that the switch provides customers with more choice and significantly better quality . ",
        "the ceo , who reports to iag chief willie walsh , has also instituted a redundancy program and restructured ba 's pension plans . at the same time he is overhauling the club world business-class offering and spending $ 4.5 billion on 72 new aircraft due in the next five years .   "
