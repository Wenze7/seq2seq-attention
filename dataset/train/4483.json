        "cabinet office single departmental plan also reveals plans for new shared services strategy as part of moves to boost commercial capabilitythe cabinet office has revealed that a revised government estates strategy will be published in the spring of 2018 detailing proposals for a `` redistribution of public servants '' around the country . in its single departmental plan published yesterday , the department said that an `` ambitious '' revision to the cross-government property plan would focus on `` further improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the government 's estate , including hubs and a redistribution of public servants '' . ",
        "this would represent an expansion of the current development of cross-departmental office hubs , which is being led by hmrc , with contracts for nine of the 13 regional centres having been signed so far . such a move would also fulfil a conservative manifesto pledge to move more government functions and arm 's - length bodies out to the regions . `` we will start moving significant numbers of uk government civil servants and other public servants out of london and the south-east to cities around the uk , '' it stated `` we will ensure that senior posts move too , so that operational headquarters as well as administrative functions are centred not in london but around britain . ",
        "and we will do so in a way that encourages the development of new clusters of public services , private businesses and , where appropriate , universities . `` the cabinet office plan also confirmed the launch of the government property agency is set for april 2018 , and it would look to `` secure agreement to the progressive transfer of non-specialist assets from government departments '' . the gpa is intended to provide asset management services across the government 's portfolio in order to cut operating costs as more departments move into the planned hubs . however , hmrc chief executive jon thompson told mps on the public accounts committee last month the business plan for the gpa was `` maturing but had not yet been approved '' by the treasury . ",
        "thompson indicated that if the agency was not approved then hmrc would run the 13 regional hubs that it is creating as part of a controversial office closures programme itself , rather than transfer them centrally . elsewhere , the cabinet office plan pledged to increase civil service commercial capability by setting out `` a future shared services strategy and roadmap for government that takes into account existing contractual arrangements , future needs , potential savings to be achieved and suitable technical solutions for shared services '' . it also committed to building the capability of the commercial function by centrally recruiting , training and integrating accredited departmental specialists in the cabinet office sponsored central government commercial organisation and to work more with arm 's - length bodies to develop and accredit their commercial teams . ",
        "the strategy also highlighted the need to `` improve the capability of the civil service to understand devolution and sustain and strengthen the union '' and pledged to drive policy innovation across government by delivering `` a range of innovative projects that have a demonstrable impact both on policy outcomes and the capability of civil servants in new policy-making methods '' . moves to create a `` brilliant civil service '' would be supported by attracting a more diverse pool of talent and the implementation of a more streamlined and transparent recruitment process that improves the candidate experience . this includes overhauling the competency based approach in recruitment and promotion , and launching a new career website , according to the plan . ",
        "last month 's civil service people survey have revealed that less than half of those polled were aware of the flagship vision to create a ` brilliant civil service ' . publishing the single departmental plans for all of government yesterday , cabinet office minister chris skidmore said they `` show how departments are working to deliver the government 's programme '' . he added : `` single departmental plans are important tools for transparency and accountability . they allow the public to track the government 's progress and performance against a number of indicators . they also indicate which ministers and senior officials are responsible for delivering each objective . ",
        "`` responding to the publication of the plans , gavin freeguard , the associate director and head of data and transparency at the institute for government , said they represented `` a huge improvement on their predecessors '' . he added : `` they offer a much better sense of prioritisation and consistent planning across government . `` there is still some way to go - the plans should link spending to priorities and give a sense of whether the government has enough people with the right skills and experience to deliver .
