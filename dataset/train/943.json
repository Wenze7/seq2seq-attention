        "sadid khan has compared donald trump 's twitter attacks against islam to the tactics used by isis . the mayor of london , who has been on the receiving end of much criticism from mr trump , said the president 's language was `` very similar to the rhetoric used by so-called isis/daesh '' . in an interview with the intercept , mr khan said one of the things isis wants is to see `` an increase of islamophobic attacks ; they want a backlash against proud muslims , proud westerners . '' in november , mr trump controversially retweeted a series of islamophobic posts from jayda fransen , the deputy leader of the far-right group britain first who has been convicted of hate speech . ",
        "pointing out that the phrase `` britain first '' was shouted out repeatedly by thomas mair , the man who murdered his friend and fellow labour politician jo cox , mr khan said : `` one of the reasons i spoke out against his retweets was that he was amplifying a message of division and hatred , and he should be condemned for that . '' he added that it `` beggared belief '' that the invitation for a state visit to the president from the prime minister had not been withdrawn following the retweets of ms fransen 's posts . ",
        "mr khan stopped short of calling the president a racist in the interview , saying instead that he should not be granted a state visit because `` there are too many things that he believes that we disagree with '' . speaking before the planned visit to the uk by the president was cancelled , the mayor said he would wait and see what form the planned trip took before deciding whether or not to join the expected protest marches against it . the war of words between the president and the mayor began during the us election campaign when mr khan -- the capital 's first muslim mayor -- described mr trump 's proposal to ban all muslims from america as `` ignorant '' . ",
        "mr khan spoke out when the president brought in his highly controversial travel ban on citizens of seven muslim-majority countries , calling the policy `` cruel and shameful '' . mr trump later criticised mr khan for telling londoners there was `` no reason to be alarmed '' at the sight of more armed police on the street following the london bridge attack . a planned working visit to open the new us embassy in london , where mr trump was expected to be greeted by huge protests , was cancelled earlier this month . the us president was ridiculed for blaming barack obama for selling the embassy 's current home for `` peanuts '' , when the decision was in fact made by george w bush 's administration . ",
        "boris johnson claimed the uk should welcome mr trump today , calling for his administration to be shown `` respect and recognition '' . it comes as mr khan spoke to the independent on labour 's chances in the upcoming local elections , with the party hoping to make further gains in london at the expense of the conservatives .
