        "ahead of next week 's fcc vote on a rollback of net neutrality protections , activist groups have planned protests at verizon stores tomorrow . the groups are relying on locals to organize those protests , which means there are plans to hold them at retail stores around the country . for potential attendees , the groups have released an interactive , searchable map , which also includes events at lawmakers ' offices . protestors can look up their zip codes to find the planned events closest to them . `` these protests will be quick , fun , and 100 % legal , '' the activists say . ",
        "while the turnout will largely depend on the area -- one new york city protest has more than 700 rsvps , while most have just a handful -- the groups are attempting to give the protests some uniformity by releasing a guide for local planners and asking organizers to `` try to undertake the activities , '' like calling lawmakers and making short speeches about net neutrality . protestors will also rally online with the hashtag #stopthefcc .
