        "along with the first trailer , netflix has finally released the guest list for david letterman 's new interview series , my next guest needs no introduction , and the thing is completely stacked . way back in august , the streaming service announced that it was bringing letterman and his glorious , santa-like beard out of retirement for six hour-long episodes , but it would n't give specifics about what kind of `` extraordinary '' guests would be dropping by -- until now . in a new trailer , netflix revealed that the debut episode of my next guest needs no introduction lands on the streaming service next week and features someone who definitely lives up to the show 's title : president barack obama , in his first talk-show appearance since handing the country over to trump . ",
        "the rest of the season will be rounded out by interviews with everyone from george clooney to jay-z to malala yousafzai to tina fey . even howard stern will drop by for a chat . while the show will center on a single in-depth interview per episode , do n't expect one continuous , 60-minute chat . along with the interviews , each episode will reportedly feature `` field segments '' where letterman digs deeper `` on a specific topic related to the iconic guest , '' according to a press release . hopefully that means he 'll get the scoop on clooney 's suitcases full of money or whatever . ",
        "episodes of my next guest will roll out monthly on netflix over the next six months , so do n't expect to binge the whole thing all at once . give the trailer a watch above before obama 's episode drops on january 12 .   "
