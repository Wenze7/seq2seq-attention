        "technology and student attention spanit is now the year 2017 , and it seems like the average attention span has fallen . why is that ? this is due to the rising amount of technology usage . in a study done by the microsoft corporation , they saw that the average attention span of a regular civilian living in the modern world is now eight seconds , falling from what used to be twelve seconds . to put that into perspective , that is below the attention span of a goldfish ! what turns heads about that study is the fact that the research was done mostly on young adults either in school , or fresh out of school . ",
        "karen wilson and james h. korn are two psychologists who did a study on student 's attention span within a classroom environment . what they found was that `` attention lapses during the initial minutes of `` settling-in , '' again at 10 -- 18 minutes into the lecture , and then as often as every 3 -- 4 minutes toward the end of class . of course , these numbers are not as accurate as we would like them to be , because the exact length of disengagement is unable to be calculated , only an estimation based on whenever the student notices that they were no longer paying attention . ",
        "when asked about if whether or not she notices a change in the ability for her students to be able to stay focus in a classroom setting , irena lopez , english teacher for north collegiate institute stated that , yes over the years she have noticed that her students have difficulty paying attention to even the simplest of things . that it feels like the teachers are almost forced to `` entertain the students '' in order to keep their attention at bay . also , it seems like with the increased use of technology , we so more and more people being diagnosed with conditions such as adhd , which directly changes the way she teaches her class , to the point where the school board is actively making it a priority to accommodate for all students with adding more group work , physical elements to her teachings , and even to go as far as having the teachers purposely use up to date technology in the classrooms in order to grasp the attention of the student . ",
        "technology does allow the students to me more flexible in how they learn , with the amount of information that the internet provides , it is inevitable that the student will retain some of that information . ryan bhopaul , a student of the university of ontario stated that `` the reason why some students ca n't hold their attention is due to a multitude of reasons . firstly , interest has a lot to do worth it , if you 're interested in what you 're doing then keeping attention is easy , if not then it becomes hard . '' ",
        "when it comes to the topic of the part that technology plays in the shortened attention span , ryan then goes on to saying that technology is in fact a major reason as to why some students are unable to stay focused , due to the variety of distractions that it comes with , he also states that it is an example of how a student learns . for example , if a student is able to sit down for three hours and copy down notes , then he/she would . but if a student is unable to , regardless of the technology in front of them , they will not be able to retain any information . ",
        "what technology is to them is an escape tool that they can use , if not a phone , then a laptop , if not a laptop , then they 'll be drawing on desks . ryan 's perspective matches well with that of kristen purcell , who is the associate director of research at pew . she argues that the use of technology is not all bad . she goes on to say that `` what we 're labeling as distraction ; some see as a failure of adults to see how these kids process information '' . in conclusion , we do see a drop in the attention span of students and a big reason for that is because the increased use of technology , but it is not all bad because it does provide students with the ability to be open minded , and a more updated state of mind .
