        "we 've been anticipating for the galaxy a5 but it 's already been replaced by the galaxy a8 . we 've seen the protective cases before and we know it has an infinity display . the galaxy a5 is still available and it will continue to sell until stocks run out . together with the galaxy a7 , these galaxy a phones have received some new camera features via the latest software update . the galaxy a devices have received the new selfie focus mode for the selfie camera . this is similar to the selective focus mode on the new galaxy s phones but there 's no dual rear camera setup . ",
        "the 2017 galaxy a5 has gotten an upgrade , bringing it to almost the same level as the new a8 and a8 + . once you receive the update , simply enable the selfie focus and then capture a photo . results are best when there is sufficient lighting . color correction is also included as part of beauty effects so you can look more flawless . those augmented reality stickers are fun to use so expect more designs to be added . the update should include the security patch but you may receive the november or december security patch . ",
        "feel free to check the availability of the update manually on your phone 's settings > download updates .   "
