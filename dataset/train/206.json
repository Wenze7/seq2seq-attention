        "an anglo-spanish team of fossil hunters has found several perfectly preserved ticks amongst the remains of a feathered dinosaur nestian sample science editoras if the dinosaurs did n't have enough to look out for with volcanic eruptions , fearsome predators stalking the land and a huge , unstoppable asteroid hurtling across space to ruin their day . now scientists have found that the prehistoric beasts also had blood-sucking ticks to contend with , having spotted carcasses of the parasites lodged in 99million-year-old lumps of burmese amber along with material left over from dinosaurs and their nests . two deinocroton draculi ticks preserved together , both adult males . ",
        "photograph : nature communications ; penalver et alresearchers at oxford university 's museum of natural history teamed up with spanish experts to examine pieces of ancient amber from myanmar which contained ticks , bits of beetles that fed on animal tissues , and at least one feather from a dinosaur . as in the movie jurassic park , the organisms were immaculately preserved in the amber , itself a fossilised form of tree resin , though scientists ruled out any hope of extracting their dna because the molecules are considered too fragile to survive for tens of millions of years . ",
        "a half centimetre-long hard tick preserved in amber was found clinging to a dinosaur feather , while others were found with the remains of beetles that are thought to have infested the nests where dinosaurs laid their eggs . among the grim haul of parasites was a new , but now extinct , species , named deinocroton draculi or `` dracula 's terrible tick '' by the british and spanish team , after one was found to be bloated with blood . the material is the most compelling evidence to date that ticks sucked the blood of feathered dinosaurs , some of which evolved into modern day birds . ",
        "fossilised remains of two-legged dinosaurs called theropods show that many were covered with rich feather plumages , for warmth and display . the latest research suggests that ticks found a home in the dinosaur feathers , and feasted on the animals ' blood , at least as far back as the cretaceous period , 100 million years ago . `` although we ca n't be sure what type of dinosaur the tick was feeding on , the mid-cretaceous age of the burmese amber confirms that the feather certainly did not belong to a modern bird , as these appeared much later , '' said ricardo p√©rez-de la fuente who worked on the specimens . ",
        "details of the work are published in the journal nature communications . the tick entangled in the dinosaur feather is the first direct evidence scientists have that the parasites fed on the blood of the prehistoric creatures . the other ticks provide more circumstantial evidence . some were found with bits of beetle known to live in nests , making it likely that the ticks did too . but it is impossible to know if all of the ticks were dinosaur parasites , because the blood inside the ticks can not be analysed to identify their last blood meal . ",
        "taken together , the finding shows that while the birds are the only descendants of feathered dinosaurs to survive the mass extinction 66 million years ago , the ticks clung on and thrive to this day , still feeding on the blood of modern birds .   "
