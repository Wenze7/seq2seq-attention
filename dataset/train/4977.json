        "we live in a day and age where we are finally coming to the realisation that our oversights in the past ; when it comes to dealing with childhood sexual abuse , have been incredibly damaging for our society and those trying to live within it . sexual abuse of children is a form of oppression that has been an ongoing part of human civilisation that has survived largely on people being ashamed and secretive . since growth of the information age , more and more minority groups are finding voices like their own and as a result are banding together , collating information and informing the rest of society . ",
        "myself being one of those people . therefore , what is done with what we know now about childhood sexual abuse and its outcomes , is more important than ever . beware of stranger danger : stranger danger was a word we used to use to describe the possibility that someone you do n't know will likely cause harm to your children . these days we do n't use stranger danger but now use words such as ` tricky people ' and we have started to use ` safety networks ' to explain who the safe people are . we often use ` stranger danger ' to keep our children close to us , or to scare them from running away in crowded situations . ",
        "often before my 12 year old son leaves the house , i tell him `` do n't speak to any strangers , unless its a stranger trying to steal you then please talk to a stranger '' , its ironic to me because in my experience strangers are not part of the problem . while i , 100 % believe it is important to educate your children of stranger danger or to implement some kind of ` tricky people ' education , its also incredibly important to look at thevery real statistics ; 85 % -90 % of childhood sexual abuse cases occur within the family , friend and acquaintance circles . ",
        "parent education and our current schooling curriculum on the topic has improved dramatically . but if its not being taught within the home and within the education system , this gap in their education on these important topics could lead to confusion . children in turn are potentially second guessing or playing down their situations due to the teachings or lack there of - on one or both sides . i was one of the cases , that fell into the gap . i was not being taught at home and was taught very minimally within school and eventually it had detrimental effects on my life . ",
        "where did it fail me ? as an adorable faced five year old i knew exactly where all the safe houses were in our local areas , as mum would point them out on our travels . i 'd seek out the yellow house stickers in the windows , imagining how lovely the people within those walls must be . we saw a lot of the local scenery on shopping trips , or trips to pay bills because mum did n't have a car . so when we 're on foot , mum was diligent when it came to teaching us about how scary people we do n't know can be and where to find the safe ones . ",
        "little did she or i know that the only danger i would encounter was the danger lurking within my own safe house . my mother was not educated on how important it was teach us about our bodies , and how important it was to keep that body safe because she , herself was not educated on the topic . as many parents were n't , nor did it occur to her that she should n't trust someone , that she thought could be trusted in her own home . many people in that era held the saying `` oh , that 'd never happen in my home '' mentality much to close to heart . ",
        "you never think it 'll happen to you , until it does . i recall at around age 7 a safety educational bus coming to our school . it had a giraffe involved somehow and there was a lady with puppets trying to educate us on all things body safety , stranger danger and about our bodies . we all each had to take part in an activity where we would lie down on a body sized piece of paper and trace around our bodies and label all the parts . this terrified me , my heart raced , my nervous cough came back and i watched on as my time to lie on this paper dawned closer . ",
        "i knew that in only a few turns i would have to lie down on this piece of paper while someone i did n't know drew around my arms , my hands , my hips and then to finish the drawing off ; between my legs . the rest of the visit with the body safety bus , was completely lost on me , i checked out and i ca n't recall what happened from that point onward . the whole ordeal traumatised me because it was the first time anyone had talked about something , anything , like i was already experiencing in my own safety house . ",
        "i honestly believe if i was being educated on this really difficult topic at home and more frequently and in depth at school , the chances of me speaking out about what was happening to me would have been much more likely , perhaps causing the abuse to stop completely . but instead it lasted 6 years and then changing and complicating the entire outcome of my life . despite my schools efforts in trying to educate me on an important topic , the lack of home education on the same topic failed me , and sadly i can only assume my story is not an isolated one . ",
        "this is why it 's so important not for only parents to be working with the teachers on educating our children on the topic of body safety and protective behaviours . schooling is an entire debate of its own , but more likely than not ; if it 's not math , reading , writing , science and some computing skills , relying on just the education system to help with much more than that consistently , then it falls on you and i , mums and dads ! consistency . is . key .
