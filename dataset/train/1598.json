        "i 'm talking physical articles . i recently met someone who revealed to me that he had never lost a thing . in his whole entire life , he had apparently only ever lost a copy of his visa -- once . which he eventually got back . let 's collectively take a moment to really let that sink in mostly because , losing shit has been a hallmark theme in my life . a lot of emotions surface when i think about the many items i 've lost . earliest memory is third grade when i got a new pencil case with a new pen and it went missing that very afternoon and wow just realizing that i 'm still a little sad that i never got to write with that new pen . ",
        "it was a winnie the pooh pouch : -lrb- i spent a whole hour tearfully scanning the corridors looking for it . cut to 2007 -- 08 , when i first left home to study and live solo in bangalore , india : i had a few months that stand out vivid as ever even today because they were full of losses . i 'm talking keys , money , wallet , debit card , phone , patience , . my poor day scholar friends just watched this trainwreck unable to really say anything to lift my spirits . what do you say to someone who 's actually quite responsible but seems to have a mysterious losing streak ? ",
        "and mind you , she is already beating herself up about it . the start of new beginnings is usually marked by loss of some kindi 'm not a ` careless ' person but i have had more than my fair share of mysterious disappearances and now that i think about it , it almost always usually happens when i 'm in a new environment or starting a new ` phase of life ' . i lost my ipad just i left la and landed in dubai . had my bag ransacked and lost my one month old orange sony ericsson phone at the iit entrance exam no less when i had just moved to chennai . ",
        "ok you 've been tricked into reading my hypothesis of the deeper meaning of material loss and this an attempt at drawing a pattern out of a situation that brings with it a great deal of frustration but hear me out : this probably has something to do with mental overload . when you have a lot on your mind , things get misplaced . moving to a new city is an obvious example but having a lot on your mind emotionally can also be a culprit . mental overload in whatever form is going to lead to loss and in my experience , it 's rarely so straightforward -- that connect . ",
        "i thought i was being a normal college kid but also those were the days when my mind was always on 7 tracks at a time and sometime or the other there will be a crash . loss of things have also taken on the meaning of a ` warning ' for me . a sign that you need to be vigilant . it 's like a message from the universe that life is about to take some turns . a heads up that should hopefully result in you being doubly careful about things , at least for the next few weeks . ",
        "material loss is a powerful reminder that you are not in controlwhen attachment runs too deep , this is life 's way of telling you to take a step back . it 's almost an aggressive move by the universe to remind us perfectionists that we are not running the show . where control is getting out of hand , loss seems to be just around the corner . to put it in perspective , what happens when you lose something ? it is a kind of death and there is a degree of mourning . first comes the stinging feeling of ` how could this happen ' that lasts moments to hours to weeks depending on the kind of person you are . ",
        "there 's people who brush it off , there 's others who will dwell and rationalize , which usually involves one of two things : blaming yourself or the fates . the inherent drive here is the need for reason . and oh , that gets you trapped in this life . the jump from needing a reason for everything to being able to live without ; that kind of wisdom takes a lifetime to learn . there 's nothing like losing precious articles that repeatedly invites this learning . like one 's relationship with money , how you deal with the loss of things is meant to be derived solely from personal experience . ",
        "advice on this matter will mostly be a list of suggestions on how to be more organized . it does n't help at all to tell someone how ` to be more careful next time ' immediately after they 've lost something , side note . trust me , they 've reviewed it all in their head 10 times before you spoke up . how you deal with loss has a lot to do with the kind of relationship you have with yourself . to get over the paralysis and self disappointment , what helps me nowadays -- after more than decade of emotional upheavals & self abandonment -- is a humble acknowledgment that i am a spec in the bigger scheme of things . ",
        "loss is one of the earliest hints thrown our way that systems of logic -- the foundation of life as we currently know it -- come with severe limitations . to understand the world we live in , is to acknowledge that a lot of it is a beautiful mystery . if you 've lost something , here 's a hug . just a cosmic nudge that there 's more to this life than what meets the eye ‚ù§ .
