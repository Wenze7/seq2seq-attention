        "adrian molina , co-director and writer on pixar 's `` coco , '' is weighing in on the `` frozen '' short that 's making some people un poco loco . in theory , the two films seem like a good pairing . `` coco '' is a story about a mexican boy learning about his family during día de los muertos , while `` olaf 's frozen adventure '' shows the animated snowman trying to find family traditions for anna and elsa to celebrate . `` we 've always , even at the conception , liked this idea that these are two stories about family traditions , and understanding what your family traditions are , '' molina said in a conversation with huffpost thursday . ",
        "unfortunately , the 20-plus-minute disney short , which was originally set to be a tv special , has been controversial with audiences accustomed to much briefer pre-film entertainment from pixar . critics have posted harsh think pieces about the short , and some theaters have reportedly stopped showing it after customer complaints . now , there are even rumors that disney may be removing the short from showings all together . `` it is longer than , i think , any other short that has ever been attached to one of these films , so i 've heard that that has taken people by surprise , '' molina said , addressing the mixed reactions . ",
        "molina said that the longer format was `` a little bit of an experiment . '' part of the reason the `` frozen '' short was paired with `` coco , '' he explained , was that they just needed a short . `` this year was a particular situation where we had two films out from pixar in the same year , '' he said . the short that was already in the works -- `` lou '' -- aired ahead of `` cars 3 ″ in june , he noted , so `` coco '' was in need . ",
        "`` i think it was early on in 2017 we had heard that disney was working on this ` frozen ' short and made the decision to pair the two at that point , '' molina said . despite the short 's negative feedback , it does still have its fans , and `` coco '' has already gone on to become a massive financial success regardless . the film has become mexico 's highest-grossing movie ever . in its opening weekend in the u. s. , the film shot to the top of the box office , where it 's expected to hang for a while . ",
        "plus , `` coco '' has earned near universal praise from critics and fans . in addition to overcoming the challenges of co-directing and writing , molina said he 's proudest of `` the fact that the audience has responded to all the themes of the film and the journey of the family . '' '' you always have to look at your own work with an eye of being very critical and seeing it for how it could be better , but hopefully by the time you put it out there people receive it for all the good things you hope for , '' he added . ",
        "`` that is completely what i 've experienced in the last week . '' `` coco '' is in theaters now .   "
