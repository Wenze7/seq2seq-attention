        "twenty-first century fox 's games and virtual reality division foxnext used the global stage of the consumer electronics show to offer a sneak preview of isle of dogs behind the scenes , a short film to screened in full at the new frontier at sundance . the short film takes audiences inside the miniature world of wes anderson 's upcoming stop-motion animated film . viewers come face-to-face with members of the cast who are interviewed , in canine character , on set . `` we kind of liked the idea of the actors looking like the characters they 're playing , almost as if they 're in between takes , talking about their roles , '' said ryan horrigan , chief content officer of felix & paul studios . ",
        "`` we thought that was really fun -- i do n't know that `` meta '' is the right word -- but innovative . '' the seemingly breezy , casual conversation with actors bryan cranston , as chief , scarlett johannsson as nutmeg , and jeff goldblum as duke , took three months animating across five different sets to complete . the technical hurdles were considerable . isle of dogs was shot as almost a stage performance -- on a two-dimensional , rectangular stage . but virtual reality demands an immersive , 360 degree experience . felix & paul did n't want to deviate form the film production , so it created a `` back stage '' scenario to play out behind the scenes . ",
        "as the stop-motion animation plays out in real time for the viewer , the human animators are depicted in hyper speed behind the camera , manipulating the puppets . anderson can even be seen acting out character movements in pantomime . `` we thought that was really unique and interesting to put you more in the context of these characters , these puppets , and the humans behind you are the foreigners , or the aliens , who are giants , kind of doing their work , '' said horrigan . `` for wes , i think it was a subtle nod to all of the animators and people who were working on the film , to acknowledge them and their craft . '' ",
        "the short film will be released through the google spotlight stories app for android and apple devices and on google 's pixel phones . google funded the short film project , as it has for other film shorts that showcase storytelling in virtual reality . `` at the end of the day an audience is going to look at this and go , ` this is a great story , it has great characters , and i loved it . ' and that 's what you want , '' said karen dufilho , executive producer at google spotlight stories . ",
        "`` we are always going to say ` yes ' to a project that 's going to push the technology . '' google has released a dozen short films , including the vr short the pearl , which last year received a creative arts emmy and an oscar nomination . related storiesliontree 's aryeh bourkoff predicts `` golden age '' of mergers , acquisitionspower being restored at ces after outagewould discovery let oprah out of her contract to run for president ?
