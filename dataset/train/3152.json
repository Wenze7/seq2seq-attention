        "dr. steven armus is a longtime franksville , wisconsin , dermatologist with extensive experience guiding comprehensive skin cancer treatments . the owner of native prairie restoration , dr. steven armus also provides clients with remediation solutions spanning prairies and ponds . one of the distinctive indigenous ecosystems of north america is tallgrass prairie , which encompasses indian grass , prairie dropseed , switch grass , and big and little bluestem . these grasses can reach heights of 6 feet when soils are productive . the prairie plants sink deep roots and are anchored such that they can find moisture far under the earth . ",
        "their decomposition adds layers of organic matter that over the millennia created the rich black soils common throughout illinois , iowa , minnesota , and nebraska . fire is a vital aspect of the ecosystem , with lightning-caused blazes facilitating the replacement of the soil 's essential nutrients and minerals . traditionally , fires were also set by native americans as a way of both creating fire breaks around settlements and attracting grazing animals such as bison . in recent centuries , this balance has been lost in many cases . with much tallgrass prairie converted to cattle grazing , a major issue is overgrazing , which has enabled species invasion and decreased overall biodiversity while amplifying soil erosion .
