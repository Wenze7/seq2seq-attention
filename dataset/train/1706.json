        "these eu rules will upend trading far from being an existential threat , the big shakeup in the money management industry has emerged as an opportunity for the investment arm of swiss bank efg international ag to snap up analysts on the cheap . the company has taken advantage of cutbacks at brokers to almost double its equity-research team to about 18 before new european regulations known as mifid ii take hold in january . the rise of exchange-traded funds , which track indexes rather than involve people selecting stocks , also has increased the supply of analysts in the job market . ",
        "`` the knock-on effect of etfs , passive investments , as well as mifid ii means that there are many research analysts out there available at cheaper prices than they were before , '' moz afzal , the london-based chief investment officer at efg asset management , said in an interview . expanding the research team so significantly was `` probably something we could n't do 10 years ago , '' he said . the overall cost of hiring analysts has dropped about 10 percent over the past three years , but may fall more once the revised markets in financial instruments directive kicks in , afzal said . ",
        "the regulations aim to foster transparency and drive down costs . they require investment firms to pay separately for research from banks and brokerages . a report in june by mckinsey & co. . said it may lead to hundreds of analysts losing their jobs as lenders cut about $ 1.2 billion of spending on research . while prospects for the majority of smaller investment companies might be gloomy , the ones that survive will benefit as research and data costs drop , said afzal , whose company snapped up the new equity analysts over the past 18 months . ",
        "the company oversees about $ 20 billion . `` in the end , having a bigger research team should ultimately lead to a better performance -- you hope , '' afzal said . `` mifid ii will cause the industry to re-evaluate research and how it is used . the effect of that will mean that the data and research provision will be cheaper , and we 've already started to see evidence of that .
