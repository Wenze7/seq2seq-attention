        "polygon is kicking off its best of entertainment series , which will run through the end of december and beginning of january , coming to a close just before the 2017 golden globes . these personal essays will examine the best , most important and weirdest moments that occurred in television , film , streaming and youtube/twitch in 2017 . each will examine why the author believes that moment to be one of 2017 's most extraordinary . the series will end with polygon 's best of tv and best of movies pieces . the confidence with which marvel studios embraced spider-man : homecoming promised a good , wholesome peter parker story , but i did n't expect homecoming to so completely reenergize the franchise , finding a new hope for spider-man 's future in a fresh-faced , young actor . ",
        "spider-man : homecoming reintroduced an excitement to a character who lost his pizazz a decade ago , and in doing so , reminded us why we loved watching spider-man on the big screen in the first place . spider-man : homecoming was funny , touching , promising and , with the help of tony stark , further connected the webslinger to the marvel cinematic universe . much like how avengers : infinity war promises to be the amalgamation of everything marvel fans have been waiting for , homecoming gave us the marvel spider-man story that we 've been waiting for since 2002 . ",
        "perhaps less noticeable , but certainly just as important , homecoming was also one of 2017 's funnest movies , and that 's why i 'm naming it my favorite superhero film of the year . unlike decades past , superhero movies are a dime a dozen these days . wonder woman , guardians of the galaxy vol . 2 , logan , thor : ragnarok , the lego batman movie and even captain underpants were all superhero movies released this year that we fell in love with . arguments could be made that ragnarok , which turned the thor franchise on its head and breathed life into a rapidly decaying body , was the best superhero movie of the year . ",
        "wonder woman saved the dc universe from the grim death creeping up on the horizon , reiterating that women can star -- and kick ass -- in their own superhero movies without the presence of another , male hero . both movies helped redefine the aesthetic of their genre and were entertaining to boot . but homecoming is still my favorite superhero movie released this year . when homecoming first came out , we wrote that `` homecoming finally gives us a superhero movie where the lead is n't trying to live up to a personal ideal of heroism -- but a very specific , fictional cultural one . '' ",
        "homecoming was released a decade after the birth of the marvel cinematic universe , when the fictional world dominated by superheroes became universally understood and spider-man did n't have to try and explain why the world existed in a state of chaos . homecoming combined two qualities that only a spider-man movie produced in-house at marvel today could : the reemergence of a dorky , teenage peter parker and a universe where he 's ready to join the avengers because they already exist . trying to make spider-man out to be the sole hero of new york city and turning him into a sweet-talking charmer -- like the version of peter parker portrayed by andrew garfield in the amazing spider-man -- did n't work . ",
        "it was boring , and homecoming learned from that . peter parker in homecoming is struggling with high school crushes , bullies , math tests -- everything that comes with being a teenager . his character is easy to identify with , and that 's what the marvel cinematic universe was missing . when we 're watching peter parker , he 's the most relatable character in the world ; when we 're watching spider-man , we get to watch him co-exist in a world with iron man , captain america and the rest of the avengers . since homecoming operates under the notion that everyone knows what 's going on in the marvel cinematic universe , the movie take some leaps . ",
        "homecoming opens with a shot of a crew trying to clean up the mess left after the battle for new york in the avengers -- and introduces us to another important part of homecoming 's success , michael keaton 's vulture . keaton 's villain is n't a typical , run-of-the-mill baddie we 've seen before , but has a personal connection to peter parker that makes for one of the best plot twists this year . it 's a genuinely shocking moment that elicited a gasp from my co-worker , allegra frank , when we went to go watch it . ",
        "that twist helps homecoming stick out from marvel movies before it , and the other superhero movies this year . while wonder woman and thor : ragnarok were good , they were also predictable and safe from a plot perspective . homecoming took a major risk and the payoff was well worth it . homecoming is great for so many reasons , but what i value most is how i felt while watching the movie . it was like the first time i saw iron man or read a spider-man comic -- there was a childlike joy that flowed through me while watching homecoming for the first time ; and the second ; and the third . ",
        "when homecoming first came out , i wrote about how happy i was to have a spider-man franchise that i believed in again , and said : for the longest time , spider-man felt stale and the stand-alone movies did n't feel like they were doing any justice to his character . but for the first time in over a decade , i am excited for another spider-man movie . perhaps even better , though , is that i 've rekindled my love for spider-man as a character on screen . spider-man : homecoming is n't one of the more daring superhero movies of the year , and it 's not one of the more avant-garde . ",
        "but it felt like after 10 years of building up the potential of the marvel cinematic universe , homecoming delivered on the promise of a fictional world where heroes can co-exist . homecoming managed to find the extraordinary in peter parker 's ordinary , the unimaginative but relatable day-to-day in a world ruled by superheroes . for the first time since superhero movies started becoming a cultural phenomenon , homecoming ushered in a refreshing age of normalcy within a genre where normalcy is the enemy . spider-man : homecoming felt more like a teen movie at times than it did a superhero romp , and that 's what makes it the best superhero movie of 2017 .
