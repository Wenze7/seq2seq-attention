        "the first legally compliant digital currency based on a physical asset , oilcoin , was announced last month . each token will reportedly represent the value of one barrel of oil . a team of banking and technology managers , and us regulatory commissioners who launched the digital currency claim it would provide users with a safe haven from cryptocurrency volatility . rt talked to alexandre kateb , president of competence finance sas , to understand if the new digital currency could one day become a real safe haven like gold . `` oilcoin will try to replicate the movement of oil prices , very much like a financial instrument called an oil future , '' said kateb , who explained that this contrasted with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies , the value of which is determined by supply and demand for the tokens in circulation , and the cost of issuing new tokens . ",
        "he added that oilcoin would have to be backed by physical oil inventories , unlike oil futures , which have to be rolled over periodically and is purely a financial instrument . kateb said that `` very much like a traditional currency , it is possible to back a cryptocurrency by a physical asset '' but expressed doubts that oilcoin could become a real safe haven . he believes `` commodity-backed currencies are a thing of the past , because in the modern world it is technological innovation that drives the economy , not the supply of physical commodities . '' ",
        "talking about the possibility of a new cryptocurrency affecting oil prices , kateb said gigantic quantities of physical oil and other oil-related assets would have to be bought in order to have any such impact . `` it has been said that oil futures can affect oil prices , but according to the studies conducted by the imf and other financial watchdogs , financial instruments backed by oil may affect the volatility of oil prices but not their level which is determined by the traditional supply and demand for the physical commodity , '' he explained . the economist said that oilcoin would be as volatile as oil itself , adding that it would also have the same kind of cost as oil , namely the `` carry cost '' incurred by storing physical oil . ",
        "`` therefore , the real value of an oilcoin could be subject to a continuous depreciation as time goes by . this is akin to the so-called `` contango '' effect , which is normally observed with oil futures , '' said kateb . for more stories on economy & finance visit rt 's business section .
