        "arsenal fans have been blaming our lack of money for our club 's downfall for ages , but there are problems that run up the chain of command . arsenal have not been overachieving . the club has been incredibly regressive in the way it handles transfer business , coaching , and contracts . catch the latest episode of the pain in the arsenal podcast herein the modern game , clubs have pockets . really deep pockets . so you 'd expect arsenal , a top-four side in the premier league , to have one of the deepest pockets in europe .

        "however , it is a well-established fact that they do not actually have a `` war chest '' hiding somewhere in stan kroenke 's cupboard . but they do have one of the largest fanbases in the world , alongside one of , if not the , highest ticket prices in the world . it is clear that arsenal have deeper problems that extend past the matter of pitch performance . no matter how much you want to blame it on arsene wenger , there is no doubting the ineptitude of kroenke and his board of directors . the lack of change , the overwhelming stench of mediocrity behind other clubs -- it 's almost if they did n't watch the games .

        "is arsenal a business ? from a fans perspective , it 's very hard to see a silver lining . but from an owner 's , and , subsequently , an investor 's point of view , arsenal has been a lucrative business . its self-sustaining business model reinvests what the club has made back into the club , which garners more fans . this makes investing in arsenal profitable as a form of passive and steadily growing income . so yes , it has become a business . what about the players ? it should n't be a surprise , then , that they have spent almost £ 274 million in player acquisitions since the start of the 2014/15 season , the most that has been spent in the club 's history . ",
        "are there any players in this current squad that are ` complete garbage ' ? xhaka , iwobi , bellerin ? these are all players that have been criticised for poor performances recently . but are they ` garbage ' ? we know that they have some quality because they have proven it in the past . they have talent . it just frustrates me to see that , while they may be good or okay for the club , their performances for their country far outweigh their domestic displays . knowing this , why are the gunners not competing for a champions league spot ?

        "his job seems simple but is actually quite difficult - introduce tactics , assess players ' strengths and weaknesses , motivate the team , take care of their needs . he is a parent , a teacher , and an examiner all rolled into one . he is one of the longest-serving managers in the premier league for a reason , but he is not managing as effectively as he was early in his tenure . perusing the recent results tells you everything you need to know . and yet , there could be a whole raft of problems that cause even more damage once he departs .

        "is it over ? one could draw a comparison to sir alex ferguson 's departure at manchester united and their capitulation . arsenal would do well to avoid being in the same situation . it seems , though , that they have taken some steps that would suggest this . over this season , we have seen some steady appointments of staff at arsenal , most notably sven mislintat , and raul sanllehi to either assist wenger or prepare for life after him . alongside the lack of his trademark top-four finish , there is a case starting to amass for his departure .

        "next : arsenal vs chelsea : 5 things we learnedthere 's something wrong with one of the links in arsenal 's football business chain . unfortunately , this is also one of the downsides of a business -- absolutely no transparency , either in the dressing room or in the boardroom . it is difficult to pin blame on one or two cogs in the machine . they are all , at some point in the process , guilty . but what can not be doubted is that change must come in a healthy wave for this club to ever challenge for the major honours again .
