        "hello , world ! it 's been a while since i wrote my last blog . to be more specific , it was more than 6 months ago ! long enough that i could n't remember where i was blogging . i had to check what i put in my instagram bio to find out . there has been some ups and downs during the 6 months that i was n't blogging . for some of them , i handled quite well while for some of them not so much . one of the reasons that i 'm back to blogging again is because of the session with my counselor today . ",
        "the last meeting i had with her was back in april , when we both felt comfortable about my improvement and decided to leave my next appointment open . now after 7 months , i felt it would be a good time to have a checkpoint . towards the end of the session , i mentioned because of the struggles i had last year , i 'm trying to be more emotionally available and supportive to people around me . my counselor asked me if the reason could be i 've become kinder to myself . the question really made me ponder . ",
        "i have always thought i 've become emotionally more available to others since i know we could get so overwhelmed by things happening in our lives . i was silent for a few seconds , sitting there and trying to process her question . then i realized the change is indeed more than `` i 've experienced something similar so i feel your pain '' . in my past sessions with my counselor , one of the advice she gave was to be more mindful and tender towards myself because i was so harsh to myself . interestingly , i was n't actively thinking about being kind to myself in the past 7 months . ",
        "it happened without me noticing the change , like sunshine sneaking through the cracks on the wall . i no longer try to suppress my negative emotions and try to label them as `` bad '' emotions . i no longer feel guilty and shameful about my struggles but instead see them as an integrated part of my life . more importantly , i no longer try to toughen up all the time knowing feeling vulnerable is absolutely ok . being softer and kinder , while sounds a little bit counter-intuitive , has strengthened me from within . the strength through tenderness has empowered me with the ability to be softer and kinder to others as well . ",
        "i used to be shooting bullets at myself and turning around to the world with a detached face . this reminds me of a few people in my life , who have been so harsh to themselves that they could hardly relax . of course , i would n't know what 's really going on in their minds but i 've observed their struggles with others . it seems because their lack of tenderness to themselves , they could n't connect with others ' feelings either . heard of the cliche `` love yourself to love others '' ? hey , be kind to yourself to be kind to the world .
