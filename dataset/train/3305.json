        "pope francis just said that he is looking for a hymn that fucking slaps . his comments have the potential to reshape the church 's public stance on real fucking slappers . wow . looks like this pope is n't messing around . `` it must be strongly stated that hymns need to fucking slap , '' the pope said monday . he went on to say that traditional hymns `` hardly even bang . '' pope francis has expressed his stance on slappers in the past , but this is the first time he has suggested changing church doctrine . ",
        "the catholic church currently has two , maybe three hymns that are hella good , but none that slap . pope francis hopes to rectify this religious omission . both john paul ii and benedict xvi spoke about the absence of hymn bangers , but francis is the first pope to suggest changing the church 's official stance on hymns that do n't have that real thick bass and some nasty fucking drums . francis ' move has implications beyond just slappers . in his talk , francis also laid out his idea that church hymns can and should be `` dope as shit '' and have to `` come at you , haaaaard '' .
