        "a us heating and air conditioning company laid off more than 200 factory workers thursday despite a deal with donald trump intended to keep the plant from moving to mexico . trump had hailed the late 2016 deal with the carrier factory in indiana , which he made shortly before becoming president , as keeping his campaign promise to save us manufacturing jobs . the $ 7 million tax incentive deal kept the plant from moving to mexico and saved approximately 1,100 jobs . but carrier 's parent company united technologies said the deal still allowed it to trim its workforce at the indiana plant , and it engaged in two rounds of layoffs -- approximately 300 workers in july and another 215 on thursday . ",
        "`` we continue to actively engage with our workers and the community to provide impacted employees with resources to make a smooth transition , '' the company said in a statement . carrier factory worker renee elliott , who voted for trump in the hopes that he would save her job , told a news conference wednesday night that the president should have done more . `` i now feel betrayed . i feel angry . and i feel forgotten , '' said the 44-year-old who had worked at the plant as a press operator for five years . the layoffs underscored the challenge of fulfilling trump 's campaign promise to save blue-collar american manufacturing jobs and prevent factories from relocating to other countries . ",
        "`` the president does n't have much of a role in private sector job creation -- certainly not in the short term , '' michael hicks , economics professor at ball state university in indiana , told afp . the us added 196,000 manufacturing jobs in 2017 , but analysts say much of those gains are in positions requiring highly-skilled labor , such as operating robotics in automated factories . `` if you have a high school degree or less , and you have been putting together ball bearings ... those jobs are being automated very quickly , '' hicks said . ",
        "united technologies has announced the closure of another plant in indiana , as well , and an industrial bearings plant last year also shuttered in the state to move to mexico , laying off 350 workers .   "
