        "an unprecedented inheritance boom is heading the way of today 's younger generation . but it will result in higher wealth inequality and will arrive too late for most people currently excluded from the property ladder , according to a leading thinktank . the resolution foundation said inheritances would more than double over the next two decades . it expects the peak year to be 2035 , as the baby boomer generation -- who have benefited most from the huge increase in house prices -- progress through old age . `` the large sums of wealth accumulated by older generations will provide a major boost to younger generations ' wealth accumulation and living standards in years to come , '' said the foundation . ",
        "but the heirs to the property boom will not be struggling first-time buyers . the resolution foundation said the average age that someone will inherit would be 61 years old . about £ 6tn is currently locked up in the value of britain 's homes , according to the halifax building society . but the thinktank said wealth inequality would increase as it was passed on to children . millennials who have yet to get on the housing ladder are much less likely to have property passed on to them . nearly half of non-home owning millennials have parents who do n't own either . ",
        "in contrast , 83 % of millennial homeowners have a parent who also owns their own home . the foundation said that among young adults there was a strong relationship between their property wealth and that of their parents . millennials with their own property wealth of £ 200,000 or more have parental property wealth of £ 195,000 per sibling , while millennials who do not own their own home have parental property wealth of £ 85,000 per sibling . `` the role of inheritance in driving up already large absolute asset gaps between richer and poorer members of younger generations is an issue deserving of much more attention , '' said the foundation . ",
        "the treasury is also likely to benefit as inheritance tax receipts rise . the office for budget responsibility predicts iht will raise £ 5.3 bn in the 2017/18 tax year , which will eventually increase to £ 6.5 bn by 2022/23 . iht is charged at 40 % on estates above £ 325,000 , but a phased increase in allowances , first announced by george osborne in the summer 2015 budget , effectively allows parents to leave homes worth up to £ 850,000 to their children free of tax . this will rise to £ 1m by 2020 . this article originally appeared on the guardian .
