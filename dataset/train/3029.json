        "virgil van dijk witnessed first-hand why liverpool opted to spend Â£ 75m to bring him to the club on saturday . the dutchman was in attendance as an avoidable defensive error allowed leicester 's jamie vardy to give the visitors the lead at anfield . a brace from prolific summer signing mohamed salah saw liverpool complete a turnaround , although concerns over repeated mistakes at the back remain . the arrival of van dijk in the new year will undoubtedly quell some of those concerns , but he might not have been inspired by what he saw on saturday . ",
        "his potential future centre-back partner , joel matip , played a weak pass in the direction of emre can which was intercepted and fed to riyad mahrez . the algerian - who had escaped the attention of left-back andrew robertson - picked out vardy , who tapped home unattended with matip out of position . the cameras cut to the watching van dijk after the goal , and he was clearly unimpressed by the catalogue of defensive errors . there will be certainly be a considerable level of expectation on the shoulders of the 26-year-old ; the size of the fee and his reputation as one of the premier league 's best defenders will guarantee that . ",
        "and van dijk might have a job on his hands to inspire some confidence in a back four that has so far conceded 24 goals in 21 league games . the former celtic man was part of one of the division 's strongest defences with southampton last season , and those of a liverpool persuasion will be hopeful he can introduce similar solidity .
