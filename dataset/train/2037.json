        "us attorney general jeff sessions said tuesday that national security is being undermined by an immigration system that has allowed hundreds of terrorists to enter , as the white house pressed for a sweeping changes to who can enter the country . days after president donald trump sparked an uproar reportedly complaining about immigrants from haiti , el salvador and africa as coming from `` shithole '' countries , the adminstration moved to refocus the debate on the links between open immigration and terror threats . a new report from the justice and homeland security departments said that nearly three-fourths of the 549 international terror-related convictions in us courts since the september 11 , 2001 al qaeda attack involved foreign-born individuals , including 148 granted citizenship after arriving in the united states . ",
        "`` this report reveals an indisputable sobering reality -- our immigration system has undermined our national security and public safety , '' attorney general jeff sessions said . `` and the information in this report is only the tip of the iceberg : we currently have terrorism-related investigations against thousands of people in the united states , including hundreds of people who came here as refugees . `` the report , the white house said , supports the need to end two key immigration programs : the 28-year-old `` green card '' lottery system open to immigration hopefuls from around the world , and so-called chain migration , which allows the extended families of immigrants to also come to the untied states . ",
        "- want ` people who assimilate ' - the white house says the current system brings too many people to the country who can not assimilate and lack skills and education to contribute to society . `` our properly functioning immigration system promotes assimilation in all its forms , through whatever mechanism by which those individuals come to the united states , '' a senior administration official told journalists in a background briefing on the report . `` it does n't promote the admission of individuals who are not likely to succeed , who are not likely to assimilate , who could potentially radicalize or may already be radicalized to pose a threat to our national security . ",
        "`` white house officials say they want a system like canada 's or australia 's , where hopeful immigrants are evaluated on what kinds of skills or knowledge they can bring to the country . they continued to deny that trump is racist after democratic lawmakers said he had called several countries `` shitholes '' in a heated immigration policy debate . the problems , they said , are the green card lottery and chain migration . `` every nation continually evaluates its needs , '' the senior official said . the government wants to ensure that the immigration system `` serves the national interest '' , including by looking at `` the likelihood of an individual 's success '' after immigrating , '' he said .
