        "striker joel ambalu is on trial at tamworth fctamworth could do a lot worse than take a punt on trialist joel ambalu according to his former heather st johns manager stephen rigby . the former west bromwich albion youth striker featured in tuesday night 's 3-0 friendly defeat to the raf at cosford . rigby , who has also worked with tamworth 's under-21s , had ambalu under his wing at heather . and he said : `` joel 's got talent . `` the fact he started at west brom and has been at torquay speaks for itself . ",
        "`` he 's the kind of player who just needs a bit of confidence . `` he needs a manager who will believe in him and let him go out and play and then he will do his thing . `` tamworth fc 's ricketts is looking to be a regular `` tamworth would be a great move for him if it did work out . andy morrell is a good man manager and the kind of boss who would get the best out of joel in my opinion . '' rigby says ambalu has all the traits to kick on and play at a high level . ",
        "`` he 's got some experience already and a good mentality , '' rigby said . `` i do think he could excel if given a chance . `` he is quick , he can move through the gears . `` he is tricky and has electric feet . i have seen him put defenders flat on their backside ! `` when he 's on his game he can be two steps ahead of the game and he is also good at hold up play . i 'm sure wherever he ends up he will do well .
