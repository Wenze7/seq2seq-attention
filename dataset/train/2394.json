        "rodale inc. . the tech-based brand is revolutionizing yet another cardio machine : the treadmillwhen you walk the floor of ces , the massive consumer electronics show in las vegas , you 're simultaneously in awe of the breadth of innovation , and also constantly questioning , `` do we really need this ? will it actually make our lives better ? '' in a lot of cases -- such as the gamified toothbrush or the custom mixed shampoo -- the answer seems to be no . but in the case of peloton 's new launch , the tread , the answer could very well be yes . ",
        "peloton disrupted the indoor cycling space with a fully immersive , at-home bike that streams live and on-demand classes . now , the tech-based brand is expanding into the running market with the tread , and if it 's anything like the peloton bike , a cult following could be in its future . this tricked-out treadmill might motivate you to actually enjoy indoor training . related : how much should you use the treadmill for race training ? some of the unique features include a large , 32-inch high definition screen , a front-facing speaker or `` sound bar '' with high-quality projection so you 'll hear instruction loud and clear during off-the-tread floor work , speed and incline knobs placed conveniently where your hands pass while running , and slat belt technology , which lessens the impact and makes your run feel smooth and comfortable . ",
        "next comes the connected cardio part . just like its bike sibling , the treadmill allows you to stream live and on-demand classes from top trainers in four categories : run , walk , total-body and floor . of course , this wo n't replace outdoor runs for you , but it takes all the guesswork out of strength training , can offer specified workouts and programs for distance goals , and would be a great supplement to your overall routine -- especially if you live in a four-seasons or cold-weather climate . related : treadmill workouts to increase speed , build strength , and torch fatbut honestly , the coolest part of all this -- the part that can make the difference between sustained commitment and falling off the wagon -- is the stuff you ca n't see on the tread . ",
        "it 's the social aspect of peloton training . through this platform , you can virtually run with your friends , check out your benchmark on the leaderboard , and connect with a larger community of like-minded runners beyond the walls of your living room or home gym . and that 's the part that starts to spark excitement and makes you say , `` ah , i might actually need this . this might actually make my life better ! '' the bike retails for $ 3,995 , with a finance option for $ 149 per month for 39 months with 0 percent apr . ",
        "the monthly subscription fee for classes is $ 39 per month . the tread will be available for purchase this fall , but you can preorder it at onepeloton . com .   "
