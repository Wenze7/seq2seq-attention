        "chapter three come on trooperalexi : `` alexi here , drink this , '' sky says , nudging me up . `` wha , what is it ? '' i struggle to reply while rolling my head into the corner pocket of the tub . `` it 's your favorite , '' sky says before putting a paper cup to my lips , `` here , take a sip . '' ahh . the codeine and sprite instantly soothes my blistering throat and instigates my return from the shadow realm . `` it 's bitter , is there a bar in here ? '' ",
        "i ask , `` everything is slowly being coaxed away . '' `` yeah , i told you it was your favorite , '' sky replies while closing the bathtub drapes and changing out of his soaking wet balaclava and jet black rain gear . `` how did you get this ? '' i ask while wolfing down the thick drink that sparks warmth in my morbidly cold soul . `` a story for another time , we need to focus on getting you back up and running . '' sky replies while pulling the curtains back after he 's changed into blue striped pajamas and a black hoodie . ",
        "`` we 're leaving in two days . `` ok , sounds like a plan i can probably get behind , '' i reply as i struggle to pick my self up from the tub . `` i 'm going to have a shower and try to get some sleep . '' `` want some dinner first ? '' `` ahh ... '' i reply while paying attention to the needs of my stomach for the first time in a minute . a grumble shakes my internals , finalizing my decision . `` yeah , i 'm actually famished . ",
        "'' `` ok , i 'll go downstairs and order while you 're showering . want the turkey sandwich again ? '' `` no , ask george for the most savage , big ass burger , with the most extravagant side of fries possible . '' `` aight , '' sky says before leaving for the tavern . after a lovely shower that tingles me with life , i change into grey sweatpants , a hoodie , and thick wool socks . swinging by the living room table to grab a couple of joints for our late night dinner , i spot a mountain of pill bottles spilling from sky 's fanny pack . ",
        "`` that was pretty quick . '' sky says as i join him in our booth . `` n you 're lookin more human and less like the living dead . '' `` it 's funny how that works eh . how long till food 's ready ? '' `` about seven . '' `` perfect , gives us enough time to smoke this joint . '' we 're on the second last rotation as our young server bring out two mouthwateringly massive burgers . two patties each , topped with four stripes of bacon , cheese , pickles and onion rings . ",
        "we each have an impressive plate of poutine drenched in aggressive , yet tender pulled pork . for the next twenty-five minutes , sky and i fall into absolute heaven as we make our way through the glutenous amount of food surrounding us . `` jesus , i 'm going to fall into a food coma , '' i say as my digestive system starts working overtime to processes the hefty meal . `` same , i 'm going to pass out after another joint . '' sky replies as he stretches out and yawns . `` yeah , i 've just got ta re medicate and i 'll be out like a baby . '' ",
        "waking at 8:30 , i loaf in bed and roll a blunt while sky showers . taking my morning medication in the shower , i join sky in the tavern for breakfast . the weather 's gloomy , verging on threatening . the stuffiness and warmth of the tavern , accompanied by the blunt forces us to remove our coats and settle into the atmosphere . the drugs are now trickling through me and i know i 'll be ok today . i 'm at my baseline and not really high . altered just enough to keep the cravings and shakes away . ",
        "the edges of the world are rounded out and i feel hopeful for what 's to come , although i 'm still in the dark . `` where are we going to start looking for the course ? '' i ask after finishing my meal . '' `` we do n't , it 'll come to us . '' `` the fuck are you talking about ? `` it 'll come to us . we 'll follow the birds , we 'll follow the fish , it 'll work out . have you not read ` the alchymist ' or ` the tao of pooh ' ? ",
        "'' `` yes , but that 's fiction , this is real fucking life . we ca n't just do this willy-nilly , we 'll die . '' `` we 'll follow the fish if we have to , it 'll work out . '' `` fuck , i 'm holding you to this , we might as well get a go on er , '' i reply while limbering up . the wind has lapsed but is alert , ready to rattle the town at any moment . marching through the nippy and dreary grey morning , towards the open highway . ",
        "nearing the wall of the ocean , the wind starts flowing again and helps us get into our groove as it cools down our overheating systems . rusty matchbox cars occasionally putter past us , but no one reacts to our outreaching thumbs . two-thirds of the way there , sky and i are both covered in a translucent film of sweat while the chilly air starts to gradually warm . `` fuck , i guess we 'd better get used to a whole lotta walking , '' i say while looking up at the tormented grey sky and pop a 1/4 bar . ",
        "shortly after we take a quick breather , a dented but steady cab pulls up to the side of the road and rescues us . the same nerdy cabby who 's probably on a gap year and has driven us around most of the city asks . `` jesus , where are you two going now ? i heard what you did to chad by the way . i ca n't charge you any fare for that . '' `` thanks , '' i reply while sky and i pile into the back . `` take us to the parking lot of the port ? ",
