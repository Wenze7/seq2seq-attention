        "buy now : le creuset cast iron skillet , $ 164.95 , amazon . com . we 're kind of on an egg roll kick here at delish . we 've done sweet , savory , and a combination of the two . they could n't be less traditional , but the crispy light exterior of a fried egg roll wrapper is too delicious to be used for one dish alone ! why should ground pork and cabbage have all the fun ? jon boultonin our second attempt at dessert egg rolls , we tried our hand at cheesecake . ",
        "why cheesecake ? besides being one of the most beloved desserts in the delish office , the thick cream cheese filling seemed the perfect consistency for loading into an egg roll wrapper . we sweetened the deal with a simple but super delicious strawberry sauce , made by mixing strawberries with water and sugar . once heated , the sauce begins to thicken and you 've got a fragrant wonder-sauce that would be good on just about everything . when your sauce is made and your egg rolls are fried , dust those babies generously in powdered sugar ! the result is crazy good , though it might confuse your taste buds . ",
        "these taste like a cross between cheesecake , beignets , and in a surprisingly delicious way , egg rolls ! pin it for later : .   "
