        "cylindrical lens can be used in a single axial convergence or divergence of the beam and found in optical measurement , laser scanning , spectroscopy , laser diode output beam shaping , the x-ray light microscopic imaging , and many other industries and fields have a wide range of applications . turn the quasi-direct light source into the line light sourcel = 2it is the most extensive application of cylindrical lens . as shown in the figure below , the quasi-direct light source with radius r0 is irradiated into a concave cylindrical lens with a focal length of - f . ",
        "the beam will diverge in half theta . at this point , it can also be approximated as the divergence of the point source at the focal point - f . the distance to the back of the lens is z . the width of the line beam is 2r0 , but the length of the line beam is changedl = 2 when z is greater than f , the expansion ratio approaches z/f , and the length of the line is proportional to z . if need in the z produces width is very narrow line light source , can be in the plane concave cylindrical lens front end or back end of a flat convex cylindrical lens focal length for z , with the orthogonal plane concave cylindrical lens place , to compress the beam width . ",
        "quick start he focus and alignment of lightthe diode outputs beam of collimationthe laser diode output beam diverges in an asymmetric form , and its quasi-direct work is more challenging . for example , to divergence angle theta . theta 1 x 2 = 10 掳 x 40 掳 diode light source , if only use the standard聽spherical lens , and only in a single direction on collimating , another direction divergence or convergence will happen . using a cylindrical lens that the problem is decomposed into two one-dimensional directions , through the combination of two orthogonal cylinder lens , two directions can be collimated at the same time . ",
        "the selection of the cylindrical lens and the installation of the light road should follow the below rules : 1 / 2 = 10 / 40 = f1/f21 -rrb- to make the spot symmetrical after the adjustment , the focal length ratio of the two cylindrical lenses is equivalent to the divergence angle . theta 1 / theta 2 = 10 / 40 = f1 / f22 he laser diode can be approximated as a point source , to get the collimating output , the spacing between the two cylinders and the light source is equal to the focal length of the two . ",
        "3 he spacing between the main planes of the two cylinders should be equal to the difference between the focal length of the f2-f1 , and the actual spacing between the two lenses is equal to bfl2 -- bfl1 . like the spherical lens , the convex side of a cylindrical mirror should be directed toward a quasi-direct beam to minimize as much as possible . d1 = 2f1 -lrb- tan -rrb- d2 = 2f2 -lrb- tan -rrb- 4 ecause the laser diode output beam diverges faster , we need to be careful to confirm that the spot size on each cylinder is no longer than the effective light aperture of the lens . ",
        "because the distance of the cylinder is equal to its focal length , the maximum spot width of each cylinder should be followedd1 = 2f1 d2 is equal to 2f2 , the tangent of theta one half . for example , newport ckx012 and ckx050 the combination of cylinder lens , the spacing between the two lens on the plane for bfl2 -- bfl1 = 38.54 mm . the diameter of the spot in the first cylindrical lens isd1 = 2 tan = 9.2 mmthe diameter of the light spot in the second cylinder isd2 = 2 tan = 8.8 mmalthough there is still a little asymmetry , the simple combinations of these two cylindrical lenses have greatly improved the quality of the beams .
