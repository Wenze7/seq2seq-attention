        "what must you do to complete a successful assessment ? laurence knell gives us the lowdown ... whether you love it or loathe it , assessment is one of those things that anyone studying will have to cope with at some point . and let 's face it ... not many people `` love '' assessment ! so what are the various forms of assessment ? depending on your course you might encounter some or all of the following types : a quizan assignmentan exama demonstrationa reporta presentationapart from these more standard approaches it is also possible that you will be assessed on your level of participation throughout the course . ",
        "so how should you prepare for assessment ? on a certain level it depends on the type of assessment and how you will be expected to complete it . so , for example , preparing for a written exam would be quite different to preparing a research presentation . nonetheless , when it comes to assessments of any form there are key things you must always think about . first , you must be clear on the format of the assessment . a 30-minute long multiple choice quiz completed online will require a different approach to a formal , written exam completed over three hours at an exam centre . ",
        "multiple choice quizzes can often be much easier for non-native speakers of english as the focus is more on reading and comprehension than on writing and expression while for written exams it is the other way around . you will also need to prepare differently for each type of assessment , depending on the format . so , if in doubt ask be sure to ask exactly how you will be assessed . second , you must be clear on the criteria of the assessment . are you being assessed purely on your knowledge of facts or are you being assessed on your ability to apply theories or frameworks ? ",
        "learning facts is actually surprisingly easy , but thinking about how to apply them is much harder and even harder still to discuss and describe in a language other than your own . third , where possible you should review previous assessments . by having past exam papers , for example , you can practice and become comfortable with the language of the questions and instructions , and understand what will be required of you on the day . fourth , you must prepare . as the saying goes , `` if you fail to prepare , you should prepare to fail '' . ",
        "in other words , if you do noot take the time to get ready for the exam then chances are you will not do as well as you otherwise could have . in practical terms what this means is that you must do a number of basic things : revise the course material ... and then revise again , and again , and againuse active approaches to revision -- reading is ok up to a point , but you should also take thorough notes and ensure to also test yourself with questions or maybe even ask a friend to do sopractice under `` exam conditions '' . ",
        "if you know that you will need to write answers to two questions by hand over the course of an hour , then that is exactly what you should practice . last , but not least , enjoy the assessment ! whether it is an exam , a quiz or a presentation assessments are just a way for you to demonstrate all the knowledge that you have gained during your studies . if you are relaxed and enjoy the process your brain will function more effectively and it is more likely that you will succeed ! ultimately , success in assessment of any kind is up to you . ",
        "while your teachers can help and guide , unless you put in the hard work yourself chances are you will never succeed . good luck , enjoy your studies and have fun with the assessments ! laurence knell is an associate lecturer with the open university business school 's mba programme . this article was previously published in november 2017 on openlearn . you should subscribe to our newsletter for more free courses , articles , games and videos .
