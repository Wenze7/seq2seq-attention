        "cdc headquarters in atlanta banning specific words in federal budget requests is invariably a bad look . but it 's especially alarming when a public-health agency , such as the centers for disease control and prevention , shies away from using terms as fundamental to its mission as `` science-based '' and `` evidence-based . '' cdc officials reportedly were directed to avoid those terms in next year 's budget materials , along with the words : `` transgender , '' `` fetus , '' `` diversity , '' `` entitlement '' and `` vulnerable . '' cdc officials have denied the existence of an agencywide word ban , saying the guidance extended solely to budget documents . ",
        "the gag order may not have been handed down from on high but appears to have been self-imposed by cdc officials themselves worried that certain words could `` trigger '' members of congress , thereby endangering the agency 's funding requests . either way , it 's a problem . both scenarios reflect poorly on the state of politics in our country . one version suggests officials in president donald trump 's administration are indifferent about evidence and scientific data when deciding where to direct public spending -- a scary proposition for an informed citizenry . in an alternative scenario , cdc researchers are responding to members of congress ' demonstrated pattern of disdain for quantitative data and science by pre-emptively stripping any mention of such concepts from their budget requests . ",
        "scientists ' fear of reprisal would not be unfounded . after researchers with the national oceanic and atmospheric administration published a 2015 paper saying the earth 's temperatures have risen steadily over the past 20 years -- countering the notion of a global warming hiatus -- u. s. rep. lamar smith , the republican chairman of the house science , space and technology committee , accused the scientists of fabricating data and subpoenaed their emails . this year , scott pruitt , administrator of trump 's environmental protection agency , unseated scientists receiving epa grants from some of the agency 's science advisory boards , replacing them with industry representatives and others who disdain environmental regulations . ",
        "meanwhile , trump continues to tweet and repeat proven falsehoods -- inflating republicans ' winning record in congressional races , exaggerating crowd sizes and wrongly labeling the united states as one of the world 's highest-taxed nations . it all adds up to a political culture that regards reality as malleable and fluid , where ideological stances rule over facts . in this version of the world , pesky things like evidence or science can only interfere . whatever the origin of the cdc 's list of words that must not be named , it is a symptom of a much larger problem that must be rectified . ",
        "scientific evidence is something our elected officials should search out and value , rather than scorn and fear .   "
