        "president donald trump urged alabama voters to `` get out and vote for roy moore '' in tuesday 's senate special election . `` do it . do it , '' he said friday night at a campaign-style rally in pensacola , florida -- 25 miles from the alabama state line . `` we can not afford -- this country , the future of this country -- can not afford to lose a seat in the very , very close united states senate . we ca n't afford it , folks . we ca n't , '' trump said . ",
        "`` we ca n't afford to have a liberal democrat who is completely controlled by nancy pelosi and chuck schumer . we ca n't do it . '' he also mocked one of the women who has accused moore of pursuing a sexual relationship with her when she was a teenager and he was in his 30s . the woman , beverly young nelson , said friday she 'd added `` notes '' under moore 's note and signature in her high school yearbook , which she 'd previously offered as evidence of their relationship . moore 's campaign has alleged that the entire entry was a forgery . ",
        "trump chided the woman 's lawyer , gloria allred . `` so did you see what happened today , you know , the yearbook ? did you see that ? '' trump said . `` there was a little mistake made , she started writing things in the yearbook . ah , what are we gon na do -- gloria allred , anytime you see her , you know something 's going wrong . `` trump did n't bring up moore until late in his speech . and the first time he made reference to the republican senate hopeful , it was in response to an audience member . ",
        "`` this guy 's screaming , we want roy moore . he 's right , '' trump said . pensacola is a florida panhandle city in the mobile , alabama , media market and an easy drive for voters in a crucial portion of the state . the rally comes after trump spent part of the week touting moore on twitter , despite the accusations that the 70-year-old , twice-ousted former state supreme court chief justice had pursued sexual relationships with teenage girls while in his 30s . the president has cast democratic candidate doug jones as too liberal for alabama , and warned that republicans ca n't afford to lose a vote in the senate , where they hold a 52-48 majority . ",
        "`` last thing the make america great again agenda needs is a liberal democrat in senate where we have so little margin for victory already . the pelosi/schumer puppet jones would vote against us 100 % of the time . he 's bad on crime , life , border , vets , guns & military . vote roy moore ! '' trump tweeted friday . mocking the ` resistance'trump bragged about his 2016 election victory , mocking hillary clinton for failing to pay enough attention to the states of michigan and wisconsin , crucial parts of trump 's victory . ",
        "`` i 'm guessing the russians advised her not to go , '' he said . of washington , he said , `` they will lie and leak and smear , because they do n't want to accept the results of an election where we won by a landslide . '' he called himself the leader of `` proud deplorables , '' a reference to how clinton described half of trump 's supporters during a private fundraiser last year . `` your voice will never , ever be ignored again , '' he said . he also mocked the democratic `` resistance '' to his presidency friday night , chiding clinton as the crowd chanted `` lock her up ! '' ",
        "`` they 're resisting the will of the american people -- that 's what they 're resisting , '' trump said . clinton resisted , he said , and `` she lost the election in a landslide . '' trump also derided a `` rigged system '' at the rally , even though he won the 2016 presidential election . `` this is a rigged system . this is a sick system from the inside . and , you know , there 's no country like our country , but we have a lot of sickness in some of our institutions , and we 're working very hard . ",
        "we 've got a lot of them straightened out , but we do have -- we really do -- a rigged system in this country , and we have to change it . terrible . terrible , '' trump said . touting his agendaduring his speech , trump bragged about economic gains during his tenure and said he 'd rolled back more government regulations than abraham lincoln -- who , he said , had also repealed regulations . `` honest abe lincoln , he was a regulation guy , '' trump said . `` can you believe it ? he was a regulation guy . ",
        "`` he also bragged about his administration 's efforts against isis and his travel restrictions . trump said the united states has `` thousands of people right now under surveillance , '' without offering more details . `` surveillance ? that sounds familiar , '' trump said . `` turns out i was right about that one , was n't i ? `` trump also reiterated his promise to build a us-mexico border wall . `` any hispanics here , any hispanics ? '' trump said near the beginning of his speech . `` remember they were n't going to vote for me , because i 'm going to build the wall ? ",
        "but they want the wall , too , because they want security . '' he also pointed out supporters with `` blacks for trump '' signs . `` look at these guys , blacks for trump , '' he said . `` i love you . i love you . i love you . by the way , now that you bring it up , black home ownership just hit the highest level it 's ever been in the history of our country . congratulations . '' trump touted his record and promised to soon deliver tax cuts and a repeal of obamacare 's individual mandate to buy health insurance . ",
        "he also touted the nation 's economic performance since he took office . `` it 's all psychological to a large extent , and that 's what creates greatness , '' trump said of the economy , saying that `` consumer confidence is at a 17-year high '' and `` economic growth last quarter surged to 3.3 % . '' ` who knows ' about north koreaon north korea , trump said he does n't know if sanctions are going to work with kim jong un , but `` we got ta give it a shot . you know , we 'll see . ",
        "who knows ? '' `` i 'll just tell you folks , you are in good hands . that 's all i can say , '' he said . he has a history of raucous , news-making friday night rallies . this summer in arizona , he tore into both of the state 's senators , republicans jeff flake and john mccain . trump even huddled with key allies during the trip to try to recruit a primary challenger for flake , who ultimately decided to retire rather than face daunting re-election prospects . the president also touted his own accomplishments at the rally . ",
        "`` big crowd expected today in pensacola , florida , for a make america great again speech . we have done so much in so short a period of time ... and yet are planning to do so much more ! see you there ! '' trump tweeted .   "
