        "the importance of this chinese proverb不怕慢 ， 就怕停 。 . in life , there will be many times when one will feel inadequate as compared to others . this could stem from learning at a slower speed as compared to one 's friend in school . this could stem from it taking a long time to get promoted when a colleague gets promoted much faster in the workforce . this could stem from the bitterness of watching a friend achieve a dream that you , too , wish to achieve . it all stems in believing that one is progressing too slowly in life . ",
        "however , what is so bad about moving slowly ? i am a firm believer in moving at one 's own pace . there is no point in forcing yourself to move fast when in the end , you will end up at the same point . it 's like climbing a mountain . one has to go at a pace that is comfortable to them . it does not matter what speed other climbers are going to . the climber will focus on his own progress to ensure that they have enough stamina and willpower to last through the whole climb . ",
        "they are focused on their goal : the summit . it does not matter to them how long it takes to reach the top as long as they do , indeed , reach the top . they will not risk their goal by trying to reach the top at a speed that is impossible for them . they could risk injury , loss of stamina and even loss of willpower . that 's why it does not matter to the climber how long they take to reach the summit . it does not matter to them whether they take ages to climb the mountain as long as they do not stop halfway and give up . ",
        "this same theory can be applied throughout life . you want to study for that test ? do n't be pressured at the speed others ' are finishing their revision . you want a promotion but your friend is getting promoted faster than you ? breathe and remember that there is always a chance of promotion for you as long as you keep climbing . feeling bitter about your friend 's accomplishments ? have they published a book already but you have not ? if you keep working hard , you will be able to attain them as well . ",
        "there is no shame in going slow ; as long as you never stop . 不怕慢 ， 就怕停 。 . if you are a medium member , do consider checking out some of my locked posts : hello lovevarious conversations with lovemedium . comi miss you the way i need youi miss youthe way a drowningperson needsair . medium . com .
