        "buried deep within the pages of funding for the department of the interior for fiscal year 2018 is an all-out attack on gray wolves of the great lakes . both the house and senate bills undermine the endangered species act and sabotage the checks and balances of our democracy . the language would overturn a unanimous d. c. circuit court of appeals decision issued on august 1 , 2017 and delist wolves in minnesota , wisconsin and michigan . it would also block citizens from going to court to challenge this legislative delisting or a court-ordered wolf delisting in wyoming . ",
        "this `` war on wolves '' legislation is something we 've seen many times this congress , both as a stand-alone bill and also as a rider tucked into . until now , its sponsors have failed to pass it into law . that could all change if top decision-makers allow the rider to become a bargaining chip in negotiations on federal government funding for the remainder of fy 18 . if enacted , this damaging rider would let congress delist an imperiled species through legislation for only the second time in the esa 's history . in 2011 , congress delisted wolves in the northern rockies through a very similar rider in an omnibus spending bill . ",
        "that kicked off a chain reaction of attempts by politicians to throw species after species off the ark . this year 's `` war on wolves '' rider would continue and heighten that dangerous precedent of allowing politicians to intervene in what should be a science-based listing and delisting process -lrb- run by expert biologists and scientists at the u. s. fish and wildlife service and the national marine fisheries service -rrb- and overturn court decisions made under the esa . in 2011 , fws published a final rule to remove esa protections for wolves in michigan , minnesota and wisconsin . ",
        "that rule was challenged in court by a coalition of groups led by the humane society of the united states . in august 2017 , the d. c. circuit court threw out the fws 's delisting rule for great lakes wolves because the agency `` failed to reasonably analyze or consider two significant aspects of the rule -- the impacts of partial delisting and of historical range loss on the already-listed species . '' if the fws is determined to delist the great lakes population of wolves , it is free to go back to the drawing board and draft a new delisting rule that properly examines those factors . ",
        "that course of action would be in line with the process set out under the esa . in contrast , jamming a wolf delisting rider into a huge bill to fund the government is a rash action that will cause long-term damage to the esa and potentially endanger every species that is deserving of its protections . the esa and its process is symbolic of principles enshrined in our democracy . its powerful citizen lawsuit provision enables the general public to challenge a federal agency 's actions if they violate the esa . this hallmark component of the law reflects the democratic principle of public participation in our laws and courts . ",
        "the `` war on wolves '' rider 's removal of judicial review continues a concerning trend of congress undermining the ability of americans to seek out justice and defend our civil rights , our public health and our environment . the esa 's process also embraces our nation 's system of checks and balances by enabling the judiciary branch to provide a check on decisions made by executive branch agencies . the drafters of the esa did not envision a role for the legislative branch with respect to making substantive decisions about which species receive protections and which do not . ",
        "letting unqualified politicians make decisions that concern the biological status of imperiled species is just about the last thing the architects of this visionary law could have intended . this rider on the interior appropriations bills turns this democratic process on its head by allowing congress to have the final say if it does not like the outcome of esa decisions . the good news is that time is on our side . it now looks like congress may wait until january 2018 to determine whether this and other anti-wildlife riders are included in fy 18 funding legislation . now is the time to use your voice to speak up for wolves and other endangered species -- early and often !
