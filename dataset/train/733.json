        "berlin 's new year 's eve celebrations planned for the brandenburg gate party will include a safe zone created for women amid concerns of sexual assault , bbc reported . event organizers want to avoid repeating cologne 's new year 's eve celebrations two years ago , during which hundreds of women were assaulted and robbed by gangs of men identified as being from immigrant backgrounds . the reports sent shockwaves across germany and fueled anti-migrant sentiment at a time when the country was welcoming over 1.1 million refugees , the sun reported . following this , city officials embarked upon a campaign to set up safe zones for women vulnerable to such attacks . ",
        "`` we are aware these carnival days are a challenge for us to show that we have learned from the terrible events of new year 's eve , '' guido kahlen , a city council member , said at the time , according to the telegraph . thousands are expected to attend the new year 's eve party , metro noted , but strict security measures will be in place . police have urged any woman that has been assaulted , or who feels that she is being harassed , to go to the safety zone , where members of the german red cross will be on standby to provide support . ",
        "women have also been advised to avoid bringing valuable items along to the celebrations and , should they feel threatened in any way , are urged to seek help . as additional safety measures , authorities are not permitting partygoers to bring along large bags , backpacks or alcohol . bbc noted that critics of special safe zones set up for women at large public events said it was discriminatory and that avoided tackling the real issue .
