        "amal problem solving challenge from the very first day at amal , i could see that they were really passionate about eidhi sb and his works . when they said that we had to do fundraising for eidhi foundation , it came as no surprise to me . and so it happened , we were given two weeks time and were supposed to raise funds for eidhi foundation which had come under attack from influential people . there were no limits what so ever , even the tiniest amount would be welcomed . i have to be honest here ; i tried again and again but to no avail . ",
        "i roamed my college , went to the hostel but nobody took it seriously , people laughed at me , made fun of me , called me a beggar . that was it ! it was highly disrespectful , not to me but to the person on whose behalf i was asking for that money . that is why ; we do n't get more people like eidhi sb , because we do n't know how to respect them . then after the in person drop , i got the position of a volunteer at wwf and now it was n't possible for me to raise funds . ",
        "so , i made an arrangement with my partners fida hussain bhanbhro and fatima naeem that they could raise the funds and i 'd write a blog about it and to my luck , they agreed . in continuity of the fundraising task , came the amal problem solving challenge . and it came at the right time , since we were not going anywhere with the fundraising . so we had to brainstorm and get as many ideas as possible and then apply them in our fundraising task . so we had a discussion , our previous strategy had failed , miserably . ",
        "we went to the university of the punjab and tried to raise funds there but no one cooperated . so we listed out as many ideas as we could and picked the top three . so the best bet was to ask for money from our relatives -lrb- here again it was difficult for me because as stated in my in person session , i 'm not at very good terms with my paternal relatives . the other option was reaching out to friends via whatsapp . and the last idea was not to raise fund but to give a part of our pocket money . ",
        "and we applied the first idea ... and it worked , fida and fatima reported that they had managed to get some funds and i begged before them to let me write the blog . they allowed me and here it is . in the end it was a healthy experience and we sincerely hope that it makes a difference for eidhi foundation .
