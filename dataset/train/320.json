        "senator chuck schumer was targeted by an elaborate hoax this week , centered on a bogus legal document that claimed he sexually harassed a former staffer , axios reports . according to the daily beast , an official-looking complaint was sent to a handful of major news outlets on tuesday , appearing to come from a former staffer accusing the senate minority leader of repeated sexual harassment . but along with a few factual errors , the document appeared to copy word-for-word language from a complaint made against former house representative john conyers , who recently stepped down amid allegations of sexual harassment . ",
        "the document also included a signature from a former schumer staffer , who told axios it had been forged . `` the claims in this document are completely false , my signature is forged , and even basic facts about me are wrong , '' the unnamed former staffer said in a statement . `` i parted with senator schumer 's office on good terms and have nothing but the fondest memories of my time there . `` schumer called the document `` false from start to finish , '' and said he turned it over to capitol police for an investigation , adding that he planned to pursue `` every legal path '' against whoever was responsible . ",
        "according to the daily beast , filing a forged document to a public office can land someone in jail for ten years , or with a $ 25,000 fine . while it 's not yet clear who forged the document , right-wing blogger mike cernovich and activist charles johnson also received it and ran with it as definitive proof of schumer 's alleged misconduct , despite its red flags . on monday , johnson posted on facebook that the two were `` going to end the career of a us senator . '' but cernovich stepped away from the story once schumer went to the cops , telling the daily beast he was targeted by a `` sophisticated forgery . ",
        "`` rather than actually trying to take down schumer , it looks like whoever was behind the document just wanted a reputable outlet to publish it , axios reports -- potentially hoping to discredit the mainstream media in an era when reports of sexual misconduct among politicians drop increasingly frequently , lead to resignations , and affect the outcome of elections . `` it is clear the law has been broken , '' matt house , schumer 's spokesman , told axios in a statement . `` we believe the individual responsible for forging the document should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law to prevent other malicious actors from doing the same .
