        "after the 19th national congress of the communist party of china , yang miaomiao returned to her position as a bus driver in bengbu , anhui province . since then , apart from carrying out her duties as a driver , the 41-year-old has been invited by several provincial and city governments and local communities to share her work experiences during the past 23 years , as well as her understanding of the spirit of the 19th cpc national congress in october . `` bus drivers are often considered as a window through which people see a city , and yang is the best representative of bengbu 's 1,653 bus drivers , '' said sa ning , president of bengbu bus group . ",
        "since starting as a bus driver in 1994 , yang has driven more than 1 million kilometers without an accident and has not received one complaint from a passenger , which is something most of bus drivers could not achieve , sa said . her colleagues said yang 's best quality is not her scrupulous adherence to security but how considerate she is of the passengers . she even goes to great efforts to keep her bus clean . `` the bus is like my home , and i want the passengers to enjoy riding in a clean bus rather than a messy one , '' she said . ",
        "yang took the initiative to start providing umbrellas and first-aid kits on her bus a long time ago . the bus company followed her example and made such items available on all its buses . one disappointing experience was when yang told a female passenger she had failed to pay her fare using her bus card , but the passenger did not believe her . yang suggested the woman try the card again , `` if the payment had succeeded , it would n't have been possible to use the card again within five minutes '' , yang said . ",
        "she was proved right , and the woman flew into a rage and hit yang . when the other passengers suggested calling the police , yang calmed them down and the woman got off the bus . `` when justice is on your side , just give the person in the wrong the chance to regret their behavior and correct it , '' she said . using yang as an example , bengbu bus group formulated its `` miaomiao '' service standards in 2009 , to improve the service offered by all its drivers . sa said the company needed a real example for the other drivers to show the areas they can improve and how they can do it . ",
        "`` general secretary xi jinping said in his report to the 19th cpc national congress , ` never forget why you started , and you can accomplish your mission ' , '' yang said in a speech at the anhui federation of trade unions on nov 3 . zhulixin@chinadaily . com . cn .   "
