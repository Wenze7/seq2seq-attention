        "julia wimmerlin / caters newsthis looks like a purr-fect savannah stroll -- with this tour group accompanied by cheetahs . big male cats hunter and floppy and female ntombi are no strangers to hanging around humans having been rescued as cubs . julia wimmerlin / caters newsthey still range and hunt from the lodge they share with their carers and guests , but they also happily take a stroll with excited tourists . the friendly cats also enjoy the odd stroke before taking off when the people become too boring . julia wimmerlin visited the tshukudu game lodge in greater kruger , south africa , which is run by the sussens family . ",
        "the lodge owners rescued the three cheetahs after their mother was killed by a lioness . however , instead of taking them to a sanctuary , they allowed them to grow up in the wild while using the lodge as a safe home . julia wimmerlin / caters news -lrb- julia said : `` there are three cheetahs , two brothers and their sister , that live on the cast territory of this lodge . `` the owners saved them when their mother was killed and they raised them , keeping in mind they should stay wild . `` contrary to many rescued cheetahs that live in enclosures , these three live as wild as any other animals around . ",
        "`` they hunt to feed themselves but they see their human parents as a safe place so they often come to the lodge when they need rest . `` when the guests leave for a bush walk in the morning it 's not uncommon to have their the two brothers or the sister walking with them . julia wimmerlin / caters news -lrb- `` they allow themselves to be petted but quickly run out of patience and disappear into the bush . `` they are very attached to the lodge owners and the man ranger and they come to see him if he whistles . '' ",
        "julia went to visit the lodge with the hope of being able to walk with the cheetahs , having been around the animals before in namibia . their collars are tracking devices to allow the lodge owners to check if they are ok and to protect them from poachers . she said : `` the amazing thing is that they are still wild . v `` there was this double thrill of walking in the bush and on top of that wild cheetahs are your escort . `` i felt excitement , amazement and a bit of fear . `` the animals did not seem to mind me coming close with the camera so i was getting right up to them . ",
        "`` that was ok in the bush but when they wanted to sleep back in the lodge and i still continued taking pictures one of them did what my cats usually do and kicked me with his paw . `` needless to say his paw is bigger and much more powerful so i got the message .
