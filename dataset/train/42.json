        "by tamara lush , associated presstampa , fla. . -- when is a penny worth $ 300,000 ? when it 's one of the first copper coins struck at the u. s. mint in philadelphia , in 1793 . the annual florida united numismatists convention was held in tampa this week . it 's considered one of the five largest coin and currency collectors ' shows in the nation , experts say , and three historic coins , including the pricey penny , went up for auction thursday evening . in all , the auction drew $ 24.9 million in sales . ",
        "mark borckardt , a senior numismatist with heritage auctions in dallas , said the george washington-era penny is one of about 500 in existence . other high-value u. s. coins sold at auction included a half-dollar minted in new orleans in 1838 . it was one of the first 20 produced there . a $ 4 gold piece called a `` flowing hair stella , '' sold for $ 750,000 . `` it was an experimental piece that the government produced , hoping to create an international coinage , '' borckardt said . `` it 's literally the forerunner of today 's euro . ",
        "the government finally decided no , that 's not going to work . '' there are only about 15 to 20 of those quarter-sized gold coins in existence . the coins had high value due to their rarity and excellent condition . `` collectors interested in these have a very strong sense of history , both american history and financial history , '' said borckardt .
