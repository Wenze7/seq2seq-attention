        "tokyo -- toshiba corp. . and its joint venture partner western digital have made peace over the embattled japanese electronics giant 's plan to sell its flash memory unit to raise cash to stay afloat . the agreement allows western digital to participate in future investments in their joint venture , clearing the way for a consortium led by bain capital to buy toshiba memory corp. , the companies said wednesday . the deal also addresses concerns over protection of valuable patents and other intellectual property in the highly competitive field of flash memory products used in many high-tech products . ",
        "the two companies said it settles all disputes in litigation and arbitration over western digital 's objections to the planned sale of the companies ' nand flash-memory sandisk joint venture . `` the settlement represents the best possible outcome for all parties , clearing the way for the bain capital-led consortium to complete its acquisition of tmc as planned , '' yuji sugimoto , managing director in japan of bain capital , said in a statement . the two companies said they will jointly invest in a new computer chip fabrication unit at their joint venture in central japan and in another facility in northeastern japan 's iwate prefecture . ",
        "the plan calls for toshiba memory corp. . to eventually sell shares through an initial public offering . `` with the concerns about litigation and arbitration removed , we look forward to renewing our collaboration with western digital , and accelerating tmc 's growth to meet growing global demand for flash memory , '' said yasuo naruke , a toshiba senior executive vice president and president and ceo of toshiba memory . he said the plan will ensure toshiba memory has the resources it needs to compete in the flash memory market , which is growing quickly with advances in artificial intelligence and networks for products that have internet connections , known broadly as the `` internet of things . ",
        "`` western digital 's ceo steve milligan said the arrangement with toshiba adequately protects its own interests . toshiba has said it hopes the sale , estimated at 2 trillion yen , will close by the end of march . it may have to clear further hurdles , such as possible anti-trust concerns . toshiba is inundated with losses related to its u. s. nuclear operations at westinghouse electric co. , which filed for bankruptcy earlier this year . its decline , worsened earlier scandals over bookkeeping and corporate governance , is one of the most dramatic downfalls of a modern japanese company . ",
        "but the company has said it expects to return to the black by the end of this fiscal year , in march . in the meantime , it has struggled to avoid being delisted . last week it raised 600 billion yen by issuing new shares with 60 overseas investment funds . bain capital private equity , based in boston , is one of the world 's leading investment firms . the consortium it is leading includes the government-backed development bank of japan and the innovation network corp. . of japan , which is made up of 26 big-name japanese corporate investors , including sony corp. , canon inc. , toyota motor corp. .
