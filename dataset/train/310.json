        "liam fox , britain 's secretary of state for international trade , says prime minister theresa may is `` desperate to get a visit to china '' . fox made the comment during his visit to china , which was aimed at boosting sino-uk business links , telling chinese media that may will be heading to beijing . `` the prime minister is desperate to get a visit to china and , of course , that is something we 're discussing at the present time , '' fox said during an interview with shenzhen tv news . `` she will come after president macron , but we like to keep the best till last . '' ",
        "a downing street spokesperson said there will be a trip but did n't give further details . according to reuters , may is expected to visit later this month , accompanied by a business delegation , having delayed the trip , first because of the visit of united states president donald trump , and then because of the visit of macron . fox told shenzen tv news that the china-proposed belt and road initiative offers great potential to british businesses , and opportunities for cooperation . the department for international trade recently announced that up 25 billion pounds of financial support , including loan guarantees , will be available for british businesses operating in countries covered by the belt and road initiative . ",
        "the initiative aims to maintain economic growth in china and increase economic cooperation with countries around the world along key land and sea transport routes . `` i 've been around a lot countries in asia , many of them have said that they would like to have a british partner that would give them a better chance of getting business in the belt and road initiative , '' fox said . the trade minister said it will be important for britain to continue to be seen as a global trading nation after it leaves the european union in 2019 . ",
        "`` we want to take a more global view , we want to lift our horizons and see the opportunities that exist , '' fox said . `` the imf has estimated that 90 percent of global growth in the next 10 to 15 years will be outside continental europe . now , for economies like the uk , we need to be part of that growth , so we need to start to develop our own business opportunities but to also work in partnership . '' fox added that he hopes the trade and investment relationship will `` move freely in both directions '' . ",
        "last year , bilateral trade in goods totaled $ 74.34 billion , making britain china 's second-largest trading partner in the european union , and china britain 's third-biggest trading partner , its third-largest source of imports , and the seventh-largest market for british goods , according to china 's foreign ministry . statistics from the international trade department show that , in the same period , britain exported 16.8 billion pounds of goods and services , making china the uk 's eighth-largest export market .
