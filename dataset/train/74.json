        "thames water has hired former police detectives to patrol its network after `` skyrocketing '' thefts from pipes . the squad aims to quell a `` dramatic crime spike '' caused by thieves connecting to and stealing from britain 's biggest water company . thames has faced criticism for its poor performance on reducing leakage . today it reported that over the past six years there has been a 20-fold increase in `` unauthorised connections '' , from 33 in 2011 to 734 last year . the investigators are led by former surrey police detective stuart orchard , who said : `` we 're not out to get people , but it 's against the law to connect to our network and steal our drinking water . ",
        "thousands of litres are lost every day . to help protect supplies for future generations it 's vitally important we stop the people doing this . '' thames water said there had been `` a spike in illegal connections . it is a growing problem . like any crime , you need evidence to take it to court . reducing leakage is a top priority and we have significantly increased investment this year . this is just one of the ways . '' currently , any unaccounted-for water is classed as leakage in end-of-year performance tables , which thames water is desperately trying to improve . ",
        "last month , company hydro cleansing admitted 18 offences in croydon and reading under the water industry act 1991 and was to told to pay fines and costs of almost £ 15,000 . in september the team took kilgannon street care to court after it was repeatedly seen connecting an unlicensed standpipe to a fire hydrant in battersea and using thousands of litres to clean the streets . its director admitted 12 offences and was ordered to pay more than £ 5,000 in fines and costs . investigator claire rumens , formerly of kent cid , said : `` people are stealing water . ",
        "if we 're notified of an illegal connection we will disconnect the supply where possible and work with them to put things right . however , if they continue to abuse the network we have power to prosecute , and we will . '' the team , which began as one person in 2014 , is now eight-strong . thames currently loses 26 per cent of the water it produces . last summer ofwat fined it a record £ 8.55 million after it lost 677 million litres a day in 2016/17 , up five per cent on the year before . ",
        "enough was wasted each day to fill 270 olympic swimming pools . in its annual report last year thames said that over the next decade it expects to save 23.5 million litres of stolen water -- though that is just 3.5 per cent of its total daily loss .   "
