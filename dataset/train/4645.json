        "my recent experience with a darn telephone box is a perfect embodiment of what don norman wrote in his book the design of everyday things . i work in a startup company purchased by much larger and older startup company , and yes , we have swings and bean bags in our common room . so , as the millenial co-working space design standard dictates , we have pretty many cool things in our office . pop-up colored furniture , grass-like plush carpet , and british/londoners telephone boxes are present in the communal space . people can sit on the bean bags while having their meeting , because ideas are what important . ",
        "let 's just say goodbye to old co-working spaces with cold steely cubicles the generation x are working at . anyway , there are two iconic red telephone boxes on the 4th floor where i sit , and they are intended as a closed space people can use for privacy and not disturbing other colleagues during call . last week , i wanted to use this space for a call . i inched closer to the telephone box , hoping to get inside and call in peace , but ... bam ! i could n't find where the door was . ",
        "the door , people ! where was it ? i ended up like a dog encircling a space before sitting down just to find a door handle or some `` open '' door tag , but there was none . my waiting tone was still on the phone , so while splitting my attention between when the receiving end picking up the phone so i had to say `` hello '' and where the door handle was , i was taking a step back in my mind . perhaps , it 's not a door handle or a sign . ",
        "i do n't know , i 've never been to a britain before and i do n't know how this stuff works . i saw some red telephone boxes in coffee shops or museum but never tried to open it and get inside . next to this telephone box spot sat some guys in the small meeting space . one of them called me out to point where the door was . a little bit embarrassed , i saw a small hinge on one side of the telephone box . still , the side did n't have any handle . ",
        "how was i supposed to open it ? from the bulbous side of the side , it ca n't be pushing inside . hmm , i thought , it should be outward pulling . so , yeah , 2 layers of guessing of just opening a door . my receiving end did not pick up anyway , so i got back to my desk . okay , i might be exaggerating , and it 's just an anecdotal example , and people can just assume my mind was somewhere else or i was n't just myself for a moment of time . ",
        "but , there is a reason why don norman wrote pages of door which made me want to write the similar article . it might happen to any random users , anywayin this age when people talk about ui/ux standard of designing web and applications , this anecdotal example of door can serve as an inspiration on your manifesto as a designer : do n't make me think . i read the 2nd edition when the author did not specifically mention ui/ux as the term was coined later , but got the point . not everyone has all the time in the world during their online session , hence designing user journey and interface that helps them completing the task without sidetracking is our aim . ",
        "you can bridge this experience to any ui/ux design and think that : where is the door is similar to where is the < insert url , button , or whatever here > how to open the door is similar to how to treat this < insert url , button , or whatever here > . is this colored text even a link ? is this button clickable ? oh , apparently it 's just a box . does this field need to be typed in ? does this tag appear automatically below ? and any other guesswork here . ",
        "people who heard my story and then saw the aforementioned telephone box might laugh at my experience of failing to see a hinge . well , a hinge , a url , a button , or whatever your product has in plain sight to redirect user might not be perceived as clear enough for a user . this is n't even addressing the special accessibility needs from differently able people . as a designer , it 's best to keep in mind that while you know the inside out of your product , a lot of users will just see it for the very first time and they need assistance to do it right . ",
        "it was just a 5 min midweek experience for me , but it motivated me to improve and learn more in my product design , so a user does not have to rely on other user on using a product . like this post ? you can read more stories on my blog here . do n't forget to follow ; pthe telephone box in my office looks like thisoriginally published at griyatawang . wordpress . com on january 14 , 2018 .
