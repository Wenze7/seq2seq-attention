        "first it was the chinese , now it 's the europeans , as the rest of the world is suddenly very unhappy with the prospect of us tax reform . as we discussed yesterday , with the historic trump tax reforms on the verge of passage and the fed 's dot plot signalling another 7-8 rate hikes , china is nervous that the capital outflows , which it thought it had bottled up , might be about to return . china is preparing a contingency plan which includes `` higher interest rates , tighter capital controls and more-frequent currency intervention to keep money at home and support the yuan '' . ",
        "amusingly , the wall street journal quoted a chinese official who described washington 's tax plan as a `` gray rhino '' . the latter is a combination of an `` elephant in the room '' and a `` black swan '' , i. e. a high probability threat which people should see coming , but do n't . the focal point of china 's fears is the yuan , which the authorities have spent so much time and effort stabilising during the last two years . speaking to the wsj , the chinese official sounded a warning : `` we 'll likely have some tough battles in the first quarter . '' ",
        "switching to europe and five european finance ministers have sent a letter criticising the us for undermining the `` rules of the game '' and international trade . notwithstanding brexit , the signatories included the uk chancellor , philip hammond , as well as his counterparts in germany , france , italy and spain . essentially , the european nations are warning the us that it risks starting a trade dispute . according to the financial times , `` the finance ministers from europe 's five largest economies have warned the trump administration that republican tax cut plans would flout international agreements and undermine trade , threatening to turn a washington policy battle into a transatlantic row . ",
        "`` in a letter to the white house and us treasury department , the ministers - including philip hammond of the uk , peter altmaier of germany and bruno le maire of france - raised the possibility of retaliating if the legislation becomes law . the letter highlights concerns in europe that the trump administration will use tax reform as a route to promote `` america first '' trade discrimination , escalating tensions that have already risen in other policy areas like the environment and middle east peace . the ministers insisted they were not seeking to intervene in a domestic tax debate , which they called one of `` the essential pillars of a state 's sovereignty '' . ",
        "nevertheless , the letter warned steven mnuchin , us treasury secretary , that washington should not start a trade dispute under the guise of anti-avoidance measures in taxation . `` we have strong concerns if is done via measures that are not targeted on abusive arrangements as this would impact on genuine business activities , '' they wrote . the letter was sent to treasury secretary , steven mnuchin , white house economic adviser , gary cohn and the heads of congressional committees who are currently embroiled in merging the different versions of the tax reforms passed by the senate and the house of representatives . ",
        "from the european perspective , the sources of contention are three measures which favour domestic us businesses , as the ft explains . all of the measures that have angered european governments would treat us operations differently than those from overseas groups , provisions that the finance ministers said violate international tax norms . for example , an `` excise tax '' in the house bill would impose a 20 per cent levy on us company purchases from their foreign subsidiaries which would not apply to similar domestic transactions . the letter said this `` could discriminate in a manner that would be at odds with international rules embodied '' in the world trade organization . ",
        "the other two elements are the senate bill , including a provision that would tax us exporters more favourably when they make profits from brands and other intangible assets . the letter argues the measure could `` face challenges as an illegal export subsidy '' , a thinly-veiled threat of european retaliation . other senate measures would tax transfers within international banks and insurance companies on the total amount sent between us and european operations regardless of the balance between transatlantic flows . some of the european criticisms have been shared by a group of us tax academics , who published a recent analysis that said both the excise tax and financial flows measure `` likely violates wto obligations and presents tax treaty concerns '' . ",
        "in a swipe at the poor lines of communication between the trump administration and european nations , a french finance ministry official noted that using `` more informal '' methods of communication had n't worked , consequently , they had resorted to a formal letter as a `` way to weigh into the debate '' . germany 's finance minister , peter altmaier , acknowledged that the us has the right to change its tax regime as it sees fit '' but it must be in compliance with the international rules '' . a spokesperson in mnuchin 's treasury department said that `` we appreciate the views of the finance ministers . '' ",
        "however , with the tax reform being a centrepiece of trump 's policy and us lawmakers rushing to finalise the legislation by the end of the year , we see little prospect of major changes to satisfy european concerns at such a late hour . this latest dispute re-opens the wound of arguments between europe and the us and over tax , as the ft notes . '' the european letter is only the latest in a series of disputes between europe and the us over tax issues that date back to the obama administration . then-president barack obama publicly complained about european commission actions targeting american tech groups for `` sweetheart '' tax agreements with several low-tax eu countries . ",
        "the most high-profile case has come against apple , which has been ordered by brussels to pay â‚¬ 13bn in back taxes to ireland , but the commission has also opened similar cases against amazon in luxembourg and starbucks in the netherlands . one difference between the current dispute and previous ones is that this time , the relationship between the incumbent us administration and major european nations is considerably worse . even the so-called `` special relationship '' between the us and uk has been damaged by a spat over trump re-tweeting anti-islam video from the deputy leader of a british far-right group . ",
        "meanwhile , both the us and european union are engaged in a dispute with china about the latter 's status as a market economy within the wto . granting it market economy status would make it more difficult for other nations to penalise china with duties . for dumping products , e. g. steel , at unfair prices . as we discussed , there is speculation that a chinese victory in the dispute with europe -- and a decision is expected in 2019 -- could lead to the demise of the wto . it 's becoming increasingly clear that the risk that a dispute between the triumvirate of the us , europe and china escalating is significantly higher now than it has been in recent memory , which in itself should naturally be sufficient to send the s&p to new all time highs this morning .
