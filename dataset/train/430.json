        "for a short time , the cars are the stars in los angeles as the city 's auto show gears up for the first two weeks of december . it 's an event full of shiny metal ... but which cars are truly the newest ? here are eight straight out of the box . bmw i8 roadster it 's been much talked-about and a really long time coming , but bmw rolled out the roadster version of its i8 plug-in hybrid sports car at laas . read more : * which makers had most fun at tokyo show ? ",
        "it 's pretty much as you 'd expect : an i8 with the centre roof section missing . and still very dramatic-looking . most features from the coupe are retained , including the distinctive dihedral door openings . bmw is all about ev-power : by 2025 it plans to have 25 plug-in vehicles in its lineup . mercedes-benz cls the third-generation cls made its global debut at laas . the concept is still the same as the 2004 original : a four-door coupe . if anything , this new model steps back a little closer to that first-gen model , with fewer sharp lines and an extremely small glasshouse in profile . ",
        "but the front is lower and more aggressive , and the cls is now a five-seater . there 's a new engine lineup , with m-b 's latest four and six-cylinder units . no doubt with the obligatory amg-v8 version to follow . lexus rx350l the boom in seven-seat suvs has caught lexus by surprise ... apparently . it has three-row seating in off-road models like the monster lx , but it 's something never offered in its core-crossover rx model . the solution has been to stretch the rx by 110 mm to create the seven-seat rx350l and rx450hl hybrid models . ",
        "the wheelbase has remained the same - all the extra is hanging out the back . the third row can be power-folded and the l has steeper tailgate and rear-screen angles to maximise rear headroom . mazda6 turbo the most important features of the updated mazda6 can not been seen from outside . behind the mild frontal makeover there 's the 2.5-litre turbocharged engine from the cx-9 suv and a completely new interior , with only the steering wheel and some minor trim elements carried over . the turbo-model will be launched in nz mid-2018 , exclusively in a flagship luxury specification that will sit above the current limited model . ",
        "the name of the new version is yet to be decided : mazda nz gets to pick its own . porsche 911 t each new generation of porsche 911 seems to get larger and more luxurious . porsche is attempting to take the model back towards basics with the new carrera t version . the `` t '' stands for touring and dates back to 1968 . the carrera t has pared-back equipment but ups the ante on driver appeal , with shorter-ratio transmission and 20mm-lower pasm suspension . jeep wrangler another model extensively teased but not officially launched until laas , the all-new wrangler has greater powertrain options , including a turbocharged four-cylinder and eight-speed automatic , superior turning circle and brings a claim of even better off-road ability . ",
        "the jl wrangler is slightly larger than the outgoing jk , but approach and departure angles have both improved by two degrees . the bonnet and doors are aluminium , the interior is vastly more modern and roof options include a power soft-top . range rover svautobiography laas was a bit of a special vehicle operations - fest for jaguar land rover . there were cars from svr , svx and the latest from svo 's super-luxury division , svautobiography . the range rover svautobiography long-wheelbase suv has a redesigned cabin with rear seats offering 1.2 m of legroom , hot-stone massage function and business class-style reclining . ",
        "it 's also now available with an even more refined powertrain : a plug-in hybrid offering 50 km of near-silent ev running . the svautobiography will be launched in nz mid-2018 . infiniti qx50 the qx50 mid-sized suv has been teased a lot by infiniti in the past year . but what 's special about the production version launched in la is what 's under the bonnet : a variable-compression engine . it 's a world-first technology . the qx50 's 2.0-litre turbo engine can instantly adjust its piston stroke to modify compression ratio to suit the driving situation . ",
        "infiniti claims it offers the performance of a petrol with the torque and fuel efficiency of a diesel - much like mazda 's forthcoming skyactiv-x engine .   "
