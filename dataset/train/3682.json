        "marvel is combatting x-men and avengers fatigue some you probably already feel by launching a new ragtag band of superheroes in 2018 . the new franchise called marvel rising will start with six , four-minute digital shorts that will be followed by marvel rising : secret warriors , a feature-length animated film , later that year . it focuses on gwen stacy , who 's more than just spider-man 's lady love in this iteration : she 's the one who got bitten by a radioactive arachnid and transformed into ghost-spider after gaining superpowers . the other superhuman teens joining ghost-spider are familiar names , as well : ms. marvel , squirrel girl , quake , patriot , america chavez and inferno . ",
        "their backstories might be a bit different , but they 're still the same superheroes at the core . marvel is tapping some pretty well-known celebrities to voice the characters , including dove cameron as ghost-spider and tyler posey as inferno , but it 's unclear where you 'll be able to watch the shorts . the comics giant says it will announce distribution partners at a later date . netflix could still be on that list , since its partnership with disney wo n't end until late 2019 . after that , however , disney will stop giving netflix the right to stream its properties and will instead make them available through its own streaming service .
