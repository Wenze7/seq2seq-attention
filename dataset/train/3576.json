        "syrian troops have recaptured dozens of towns and villages from jihadist fighters , a monitor said sunday , bringing them closer to a key military airport in the country 's northwest . syrian troops have recaptured dozens of towns and villages from jihadist fighters , a monitor said sunday , bringing them closer to a key military airport in the country 's northwest . `` in the past 24 hours , regime forces have taken at least 79 villages in the southern parts of aleppo province , an area near the abu duhur military airport , '' said rami abdel rahman , the head of the britain-based syrian observatory for human rights monitor . ",
        "russia-backed regime troops are aiming to reach the abu duhur base as part of a weeks-long assault against hayat tahrir al-sham , which is dominated by al-qaeda 's former syria affiliate . the offensive has seen syrian forces seize surrounding territory in the provinces of aleppo and hama as they close in on abu duhur , which lies just inside the idlib province . they briefly broke into the air base this week from the south but were ousted in a ferocious counter-offensive by jihadists and rebels . with the latest push in aleppo province , abdel rahman said , army troops were seeking to open a new front on the airport 's northern and eastern flanks . ",
        "`` regime troops lost control of those villages in southern aleppo province in 2012 , '' he said . `` they are advancing quickly now because of hts 's collapse , and the withdrawal of its fighters and those of other groups from the area , '' abdel rahman added . syrian daily al-watan , which is close to the government , also reported that the army was `` encircling '' the airport . the airport straddles the border between aleppo and idlib , the last province in the country outside the government 's control . in addition to the base , the regime hopes to secure a key patch of highway running through idlib that links the northern city of aleppo with the capital damascus further south . ",
        "rebels and jihadists overran idlib province over the course of several months in 2015 , capturing abu duhur in september of that year . since then , the jihadist forces behind hts have expanded their control in the province , with the influence of mainstream rebels shrinking drastically . the fighting in idlib has displaced nearly 100,000 people since early december , the united nations has said .
