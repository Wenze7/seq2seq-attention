        "she has already defied the odds in a country fixated on cricket rather than the slopes to win india 's first international skiing medal -- but aanchal thakur insists she is just getting started . the 21-year-old dreams of following her older brother himanshu to compete in the winter olympics , a feat so improbable only one indian woman has ever done it . she credits himanshu with inspiring her to dedicate herself to what remains a highly niche sport , despite her family 's best efforts , in a country where cricketers are idolised and skiing is sidelined . ",
        "aanchal made indian sporting history when she won a bronze medal last week at the ejder 3200 cup slalom in turkey , but did not amass enough points to qualify for next month 's pyeongchang games in south korea . but she is determined to make the cut for the 2022 edition in china . himanshu , 24 , india 's top male skier , made his olympic debut at the 2014 sochi games and races on saturday in iran as he bids to compete in pyeongchang . `` now he is so close to the olympic games . he was pushing me also . ",
        "i will make sure that i will be there with him in 2022 , '' said aanchal , who was india 's national ski champion in 2014 and 2017 . `` there is no rivalry , i must say , because he is always helping me technique , always supporting me , motivating me . `` her success in turkey promises to dramatically raise the profile of skiing in india . prime minister narendra modi was quick to congratulate her after she clinched the historic medal , tweeting that the whole country was `` ecstatic '' . aanchal 's name went viral on social media , with many hailing her achievement as a leap forward for indian sportswomen . ",
        "skiing badly needs greater recognition to take off in india . neha ahuja , who competed in turin in 2006 , remains the only woman ever to have represented the vast country at a winter olympics . `` this medal will be a turning point for ski and winter sports in india . i can see a bright future skiing in india , '' aanchal told afp . `` now i think the government will support us . there can be nothing bigger than getting praised by pm modi ji . so i think that everybody is aware of skiing now . '' ",
        "- india : not just cricket - aanchal comes from a ski-crazy family in the northern indian hill town of manali and her father roshan thakur is secretary of the winter games federation of india . but in a brutal reminder of the second-class status of skiing in india , wgfi is not even recognised by india 's sports ministry and must fend for itself in a sport that requires expensive equipment . the sport also is also cramped by a relatively short season in india . aanchal started skiing at six and with her father 's encouragement made great strides nationally . ",
        "but even to make it to international competitions was a huge achievement . funding trips to europe for training has been difficult with the family forced to seek help from the international ski federation . `` apart from my dad , we got some sponsors from the sports ' international body so we could train in switzerland and in austria for races , '' aanchal said . aanchal sometimes trains in the solang valley in the himalayas but long struggled to gain enough daily runs to be competitive in international skiing . she only goes to india 's main ski centres of auli and gulmarg for national championships . ",
        "but she insists if she can climb to the summit , then others can follow . `` cricket is not the only sport in india and i want to say that if you like skiing , please come over manali or gulmarg or auli , '' said aanchal .   "
