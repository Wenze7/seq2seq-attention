        "wilmington , del. . - the u. s. securities and exchange commission urged a federal judge on wednesday to appoint a trustee to manage the woodbridge group of companies , a bankrupt property developer the regulator accused of being a $ 1.2 billion ponzi scheme . woodbridge filed for bankruptcy in december and weeks later the sec sued to freeze its assets , accusing it of selling unregistered securities to raise funds to repay earlier investors . the regulator has said investors are owed more than $ 961 million , and has alleged the company 's owner , robert shapiro , used at least $ 21 million for private jets , luxury cars , wine and political donations . ",
        "shapiro has denied the allegations . larry perkins , who was hired as a chief restructuring officer in october , said the company is investigating the allegations . more than 40 lawyers attended the u. s. bankruptcy court hearing in wilmington , delaware , on wednesday as creditors , investors and authorities sought to protect their interest in the company assets , including the owlwood estate in los angeles once owned by singer cher . the sec and an official creditors committee wants an independent trustee , while the company and lawyers for some investors argued for sticking with perkins . ",
        "the judge , kevin carey , said in similar situations he has benefited from having an independent examiner . `` my concern was if there were improprieties i want to hear about them publicly rather than have them buried in settlements , '' he said . carey continued the hearings until jan. . 18 . perkins was grilled on wednesday about deals worth millions of dollars to shapiro that perkins said were necessary to convince shapiro to cede management of woodbridge prior to the bankruptcy . shapiro also contributed property to the company . beginning in 2012 , woodbridge raised about $ 1.2 billion from 8,400 investors , many of them senior citizens , through the sale of securities that promised interest of up to 8 percent , according to a federal complaint by sec . ",
        "woodbridge told investors the funds would be loaned to commercial property developers for up to 15 percent interest , according to the sec . the company also said it was investing in high-end property . in reality , the developers that were borrowing from woodbridge were actually entities controlled by shapiro , according to the sec . woodbridge skirted scrutiny by avoiding licensed broker-dealers and instead distributing its securities through insurance agents and unregistered investment advisers , incentivized with large commissions , according to the sec . the company also sold securities through seminars and television advertising , the sec said .
