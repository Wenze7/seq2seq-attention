        "what a difference a year makes . twelve months ago , theresa may appeared unassailable . yougov 's first poll of 2017 put support for the conservatives on 42 % , with labour barely visible in the tories ' rear view mirror on 25 % . the good news for the prime minister is that backing for her party is virtually unchanged on 40 % . but against all the odds , and defying the predictions of just about every political commentator , labour now stands at 41 % . of course , in the intervening year we have had a snap general election in which the prime minister contrived to lose her commons majority , and jeremy corbyn inspired a generation of young people and the previously apathetic to rally to his red flag . ",
        "nevertheless , theresa may remains the resident of 10 downing street and is likely to stay there at least until britain leaves the eu in spring next year . less than two weeks into 2018 , however , and she continues to look as if she is in office without really being in power . last weekend , she responded to the furore surrounding toby young 's historic tweets by insisting that if he transgressed one more time , he would lose his place on the board of the new office for students . a day later , young took matters into his own hands and resigned . ",
        "on monday , may 's big new year reshuffle was thrown off course when not one , but two cabinet ministers simply refused to do what she wanted them to . that resulted in jeremy hunt remaining health secretary , and justine greening quitting the government entirely rather than be put in charge of the department of work and pensions . capping it all off , boris johnson went into freelance mode this morning after donald trump announced he would no longer be visiting britain to open the new us embassy building in south london . the official downing street line was that the trip - during which he was due to visit number 10 - had never been officially confirmed , so there was nothing to see here . ",
        "without informing downing street - and slap bang in the middle of the daily briefing of political journalists by the prime minister 's spokesman - the foreign secretary took to twitter to denounce jeremy corbyn and `` puffed-up pompous popinjay '' sadiq khan for whipping up an anti-trump mob . having initially been caught off guard , a source close to may finally confirmed that johnson had indeed been speaking for hm government `` in his own inimitable way '' . contrast those tribulations with the actions of jeremy corbyn , who yesterday presented his close ally chris williamson with a mafia-style offer he could not refuse after he suggested council tax be doubled on high-value homes : quit as shadow fire minister , go to the backbenches and behave yourself . ",
        "no fuss , no drama . it was clinical , decisive and effective leadership . so much so , that williamson appeared on tv today to declare that corbyn is the best leader his party has ever had . it will be a long time before you hear boris johnson say that about theresa may . all this matters because it feeds into the narrative that the prime minister is effectively a hostage to her cabinet - and saps the morale of tory mps . much of their ire is currently being directed at gavin barwell , the former minister who lost his seat at the election only to be thrown a lifeline days later when he was appointed may 's new chief of staff . ",
        "one mp told politicshome : `` he 's a boy in a man 's world . mps are fed up with him and think he 's become arrogant and aloof . some of us are really unhappy . `` another senior figure in the conservative ranks said : `` the problem is she knows no one and becomes utterly dependent on these courtiers - who are not very good . `` to steal a slogan from another prime minister in another political era , for theresa may things can only get better .
