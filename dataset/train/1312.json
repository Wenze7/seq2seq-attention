        "actor timothée chalamet will be donating the salary he received for his upcoming role in a woody allen movie to sexual abuse charities -- including time 's up -- as a proactive gesture , saying he does n't want to profit from his work with the director , who has been accused of sexually molesting his daughter dylan farrow when she was seven . `` i want to be worthy of standing shoulder to shoulder with the brave artists who are fighting for all people to be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve , '' chalamet wrote in a post on his instagram . ",
        "amid the ever-evolving conversation about sexual abuse and misconduct in hollywood , one persistent conversation has been what to do about woody allen . specifically , how to reconcile the fact that dozens of the industry 's top actors had flocked and continue to flock to star in his movies despite the fact that accusations about him sexually abusing dylan farrow have been around for 25 years . even after that controversy flared up again in february of 2014 , a-listers and others have continued to take roles in allen 's films , including kate winslet and justin timberlake , who have faced criticism for their roles in this year 's wonder wheel . ",
        "chalamet had n't exactly been in the crosshairs yet , but a backlash was surely imminent . the 22-year-old call me by your name star and oscar hopeful filmed a lead role in allen 's a rainy day in new york last year . it 's set to be released by amazon studios later in 2018 , co-starring selena gomez and elle fanning . past allen cast members have spoken out recently . rebecca hall , who starred in 2008 's vicky cristina barcelona and also appears in a rainy day in new york , made a public apology last week and announced her own plan to donate her salary to time 's up . ",
        "other actors , such as to rome with love star greta gerwig , have made public statements of regret for working with allen . mira sorvino , who won an oscar for her performance in allen 's 1995 film mighty aphrodite , wrote an open letter to dylan farrow where she apologized for working with dylan 's alleged abuser .
