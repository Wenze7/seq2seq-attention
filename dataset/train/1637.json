        "do you have £ 50,000 lurking in your loft ? an antique book expert has shared his list of the 20 most valuable titles , and they include a host of well-known children 's classics such as harry potter , peter rabbit and winnie the pooh . sourced . matthew haley , director and head of books and manuscripts at auction house bonhams , revealed a first edition of jk rowling 's harry potter and the philosopher 's stone could have an estimated value of £ 50,000 . but it must be a hardback and have the numbers 10 to one printed on the title page . ",
        "the second most valuable book on the list is a first edition of the hobbit by j. r.r. tolkien , which can fetch up to £ 40,000 . it must be in a perfect condition and have a typo on the back , which has been corrected by hand . alamy . the list , which was conducted by loveantiques . com , also features work by beatrix potter , agatha christie and charles dickens , plus poetry collections . matthew said first editions , or a full set of volumes , can command the highest prices , as well as those that were manufactured as a one-off . ",
        "if the book is damaged in any way , such as a battered spine or missing title page , the value will decrease . matthew says it 's a good idea to keep books in dust jackets -- and most 20th century books need to have their original dust-jacket to be of collectable value . he commented : `` searching your bookshelves for treasures can feel like looking for a needle in a haystack , but in every auction , we have sellers who are stunned by how much their old books make . `` if you have an extremely old , rare or a book similar to the ones on this list , which is in good condition , you really could be looking at a small fortune .
