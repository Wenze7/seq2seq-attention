        "paul carey has been a pleasant surprise for the new york rangers this season . for someone who 's played inconsistent minutes he has played some decent hockey , especially as of late . paul carey has been part of an outstanding fourth line for the past month or so . along with jesper fast and boo nieves , this group has been incredibly important to the rangers ' recent success . to be a successful team in this league , it is absolutely imperative to be able to roll four lines deep . the rangers know this well , as the 2014 run to the stanley cup final , featured a fourth line of dominic moore , brian boyle , and derek dorsett . ",
        "this line made the difference late in games and was incredibly successful . most teams do n't have a dependable line that can be deployed for defensive zone face offs . this season 's edition of the fourth line may be their best since 2014 . over the past five games , the line of carey-nieves-fast has combined for 11 points . paul carey 's play has been a big part of this recent success . early season strugglespaul carey was signed in the offseason and expected to compete for a spot in camp but ultimately play in the ahl . ",
        "carey , to this point in his career , had been a career ahl player . he surprised a lot of people by earning a spot on the opening night roster . he played sparingly on the fourth line , or sat in the press box as the 13th forward . carey looked out of his element and outright lost on the ice . it was n't that he was bad , it was just that he did n't really provide anything . there were times that he was scratched and in a suit , so naturally fans clamored for him to be sent down to hartford . ",
        "once boo nieves was called up to center the fourth line , everything started to fit . carey looked much better on the ice , and recorded his first goal on november 22nd , against the carolina hurricanes . he has been a mainstay in the lineup ever since . recent successcarey began to experience some more success on december 1st , once again against the hurricanes . the rangers had a comfortable lead late , and alain vigneault opted to give carey some power play time . carey wound up scoring on that power play , and it was the start of a four game point streak . ",
        "he wound up recording an assist in three straight games after that goal , december 5th against the penguins , december 8th against the capitals , and december 9th against the devils . to date this season , he has two goals and three assists through 18 games . over an 82 game season , this would be 10 goals and 14 assists . the rangers fourth line has needed production like that for years . these stats wo n't come to fruition , because he wo n't be playing every game once mika zibanejad comes back from his concussion . ",
        "it 's a bonus to have a 13th forward that can be called upon in an emergency and not just fill in , but be a positive contributor . carey 's possession metrics have n't been great . he is currently posting an even strength corsi for percentage of 46.6 % . his zone starts explain why these numbers are n't eye-popping , or even especially good . carey is currently starting 55.9 % of his shifts in the defensive zone , which would explain why he faces more shot attempts against than shot attempts for . all things considered , paul carey has been a serviceable forward for the rangers for an extended period of time . ",
        "with paul carey , boo nieves and jesper fast , the rangers are putting out a fourth line that is strong on the forecheck , good in their own end , and has the potential to provide some offense . even though he will most likely sit once zibanejad comes back , paul carey has been a decent fourth liner who has exceeded expectations . more from blue line station new york rangers ' fourth line is starting to shine3h ago new york rangers : why kevin shattenkirk is a number one defenseman19h ago new york rangers : michael grabner chasing history23h ago new york rangers : 5 all-star snubs1 d ago new york rangers analysis : rangers get crushed 2-1 vs. stars1 d ago paul carey has been a pleasant surprise for the new york rangers this season .
