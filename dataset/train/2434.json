        "moscow - russia 's defence ministry on thursday said it was concerned about the threat of drones used `` for terrorist purposes '' following recent attacks on moscow 's bases in syria . ten drones equipped with explosives attacked russia 's airbase in hmeimim in the early hours of january 6 , while three others targeted its naval base in the port of tartus , according to the military . the defence ministry said there were no casualties or damage in the incidents , but warned that similar technology could be used to wage terror anywhere in the world . ",
        "`` there is a real threat linked to using drones for terrorist purposes anywhere in the world , '' said russian general alexander novikov at a press conference in moscow . `` until now , fighters have used drones primarily for aerial examination . there were only isolated incidents when they were used for attacks , '' novikov said . he said both the drones that attacked the russian bases had 10 explosive devices each weighing 400 grammes and were filled with what he called `` small metal balls '' . `` creating this sort of weapon is impossible in home-made conditions , '' novikov said , adding that they could have been made `` with the participation of specialists educated in countries that make and use this sort of drone '' . ",
        "he added that the russian military is investigating which country created the drones . defence ministry spokesman igor konashenkov said that creating such devices `` requires specialised knowledge '' . `` the fact that the terrorists received the method to assemble the pilotless drones from abroad shows that the threat is not only in syria . this can happen in other countries and not only against military targets , '' konashenkov said . `` serious attention and organisation on the international level is needed to neutralise such threats , '' he added . on wednesday , the defence ministry said the drones were sent from syria 's idlib province , a `` de-escalation '' zone controlled by anti-damascus fighters . ",
        "idlib has been a source of tension between regime-backer russia and rebel-supporter turkey , with ankara accusing the syrian regime of stepping up its offensive on key rebel-held areas there . after two years of russian military support for the regime of syrian leader bashar al-assad , president vladimir putin announced in mid-december a partial withdrawal of forces from the country , saying their task had been largely completed . more than 330,000 people are estimated to have been killed in the syrian war , which began in 2011 as the regime crushed anti-government protests . millions have been displaced .
