        "shares dive after the antibiotic drug developer announces the pricing details of a secondary common stock offering . what happenedin response to sharing the pricing details of a secondary common stock offering , shares of paratek pharmaceuticals , a clinical-stage biotech focused on next-generation antibiotics , fell 10 % as of 3:15 p. m. est on thursday . so whatparatek announced on wednesday that it wanted to raise $ 50 million through a common stock offering . investors learned on thursday that the company succeeded in hitting that number by selling 3.2 million shares to the public . however , some quick math tells us that the company sold those shares for $ 15.63 each . ",
        "that 's not a great price for a company that closed wednesday 's trading session at $ 17.68 . given the disappointing pricing , it is n't hard to figure out why traders are knocking down the company 's share price on thursday . image source : getty images . now whatshort-term price movements aside , this company 's future is in the hands of the success or failure of a compound called omadacycline . this next-generation antibiotic is currently undergoing a rolling submission to the fda as a hopeful treatment for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia . ",
        "the company said that this process should be completed by the end of the first quarter . since the fda has already granted the drug with qualified infectious disease product designation and fast track designation , the review time should be only six months or so . the odds of success are tough to say , but data from a phase 3 study should give investors hope . what 's more , the fda is keenly aware of the on-going antibiotic-resistant bacteria crisis , so you can bet that they are hoping to be able to give this drug the green light . ",
        "if that happens , the upside could be huge for investors . management likes to point out that this is a $ 9 billion addressable market for the drug . if omadacycline can capture even a small fraction of that opportunity , then it could turn into a financial windfall for investors . since paratek is still a sub - $ 500 million business , there 's no doubt that the company 's stock would soar if the drug gets the green light . the good news is that investors should have a go/no-go decision in hand before the end of the year . ",
        "that makes paratek a great stock for risk-loving biotech investors to keep tabs on .   "
