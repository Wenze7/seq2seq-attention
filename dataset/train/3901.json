        "attorney general of nevada adam laxalt testifies duringf the house judiciary committee hearing on `` the unconstitutionality of obama 's executive actions on immigration '' on wednesday , feb. . 25 , 2015 . carson city , nv -- on monday , nevada attorney general adam laxalt announced that the state of nevada , along with 12 other states , is suing the state of california in the u. s. supreme court because of its attempt to impose unreasonable agricultural regulations on other states , including the silver state . the multi state coalition is challenging a california law requiring egg producers for all eggs sold in california , even if their production facilities are located outside of california , to comply with california 's idiosyncratic farming regulations . ",
        "the suit argues that california 's unique regulations violate a federal law prohibiting states from imposing their own standards on eggs produced in other states , as well as the commerce clause of the u. s. constitution , which prohibits states from enacting regulations that unreasonably interfere with commerce among and between states . the filing explains the economic impact of these burdensome regulations . `` this is yet another example of california 's unreasonable and over burdensome regulations affecting everyday nevadans , '' said laxalt . `` by forcing out-of-state egg producers to modify their production facilities to comply with one state 's eccentric preferences , california has inflated egg prices for every consumer in the nation , including nevada . ",
        "we are asking the supreme court to limit california 's ability to set unreasonable and unique agricultural standards that affect other states like nevada , while doing little to help further any tangible concerns in california , '' laxalt said . nevada is joined by the following states in this challenge : alabama , arkansas , indiana , iowa , louisiana , missouri , nebraska , north dakota , oklahoma , texas , utah and wisconsin .
