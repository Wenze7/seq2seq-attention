        "lincoln city extended their unbeaten league run to four games following a feisty goal-less draw at newport county , who ended the match with 10 men . home stopper joe day was the busier of the two keepers , producing good saves to deny nathan arnold in the first half and luke waterfall in the second . county were reduced to 10 men early in the second half when mark o'brien was shown a straight red card for heavy challenge on matt green . despite that , the imps could not find a winner , although this should still be regarded as a good point against a strong newport side .

        "the game got off to a feisty start with hefty tackles flying in from both sides . newport had the first clear-cut chance on 15 minutes when a ball in from the left was met by shawn mccoulsky , whose half-volley flew inches wide of the post with josh vickers beaten . ten minutes before the break , after matt green had been fouled right on the edge of the box , the imps had a free-kick in a very promising position . sam habergham took it but his low was held by keeper joe day , diving to his right . ",
        "just before half-time , mccoulsky fired over from a similar position to his earlier chance , but it was city who had the best chance of the half on 45 minutes . a tremendous ball from neal eardley found nathan arnold , who broke into the box , only to be denied by the legs of day . kevin barnes/camerasportthe imps made a bright start to the second half and day pulled off a fantastic save to keep out a downward header from waterfall , who had got on the end of a corner . the rebound dropped togreen but he hooked ball over from a tight angle . ",
        "city were given a lift when county were reduced to 10 men on 53 minutes . o'brien was sent off for lunging in on green , with referee brett huxtable immediately brandishing a red card to the fury of the home players , coaching team and fans . the referee then had to separate the respective coaching teams as tempers threatened to boil over on the touchline . however , the imps failed to make their man advantage tell in the remainder of the match as newport , urged on by a passionate up home crowd , coped well with 10 men .
