        "only the browns could somehow take an 0-16 season and make it infinitely worse . after the embarrassment that was this year , cleveland fans decided to hold a little protest/parade to find something to celebrate after this months-long car wreck . thousands of fans gathered with their most creative signs , and raised some money for the cleveland food bank as well , in jeering their own ineptitude . however , in typical browns fashion , the parade did not please everyone . while many fans and analysts were all aboard , the players themselves took serious offense to the fan base `` mocking them '' for such a season , and took to twitter to let their frustration be known . ",
        "it all started with an emmanuel ogbah tweet saturday , and spiraled out of control from there , as numerous browns players joined in on the pile . let 's think about this though , guys . you were n't able to run with a single nfl team for two consecutive seasons and begged fans to stick with you as you completed a winless season and set the nfl record for the worst two-year record in nfl history at 1-31 . then , when they try to speak out on it , you get offended by that ? that 's not how it works , no matter how many times you tell fans that they `` deserve more '' . ",
        "browns fans know what they deserve . they 've stuck by this franchise through decades of utter disappointment and mismanagement . they have every right to make fun of themselves and try to have some fun after an abysmal season like this .   "
