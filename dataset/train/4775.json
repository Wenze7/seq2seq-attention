        "an exhibition by the four finalists in this year 's hugo boss asia art award is underway at the city 's rockbund art museum until february next year . li ming , a post-1980s artist based in hangzhou , zhejiang province , was selected as a winner for his multi-channel video installation `` rendering the mind . '' the winning work was shot in shanghai mansion , a five-star hotel with a history of over 80 years . inspired by the shape of the building , li produced a series of stories from the mansion 's old archives and brought it to life , making the hotel appear like an individual with memories , feelings and demeanors . ",
        "besides li 's project , works from the other three finalists -- tao hui and yu ji from china and robert zhao renhui from singapore -- are also on display . like li , tao also chooses video as his primary artistic medium . the material he uses is connected to his personal experiences . in this exhibition , he presents a new multi-channel video installation called `` hello , finale , '' which was shot during his stay in kyoto , japan , earlier this year . composed of nine people making phone calls , the work discusses the relationships among finitude , end , death and other topics . ",
        "yu deals mainly with sculpture and installation along with performance and video . in the exhibition , she presents the newly made environment installation `` etudes -- lento iv . '' unlike her previous pieces in the `` etudes -- lento '' series , this one is hung in the room , making the dropping colophony and resin clearly visible under the support of the iron-chain structure ; the solidified gossamer of colophony dangles above the floor . singaporean zhao integrates photographic creations with forms such as installation , specimen , text and performance through a narration of history and natural history . ",
        "in the exhibition , he builds up an environment relevant to a malayan island of nature , history and society . the space is transformed into an independent hall of a natural history museum , where there will be installations covering the objects , materials , antiques and books that he collected during his visits to various zoos over the past 10 years . the archives also present the personal artifacts and files of a japanese military officer , who brought species such as the tilapia into singapore during world war ii , together with the contradictory personal space of a nature lover . ",
        "additionally , a series of educational activities including talks , seminars , forums and workshops will be held for the public . date : through february 11 , 10am-6pmvenue : rockbund art museumaddress : 20 huqiu rdxu qin .   "
