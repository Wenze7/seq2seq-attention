        "charli xcx has teased a new star-studded mixtape . the 25-year-old pop beauty - whose real name is charlotte emma aitchison - only released her third compilation ` number 1 angel ' in march , but already has plans to get the likes of carly rae jepsen , alma , brooke candy , tove lo , mykki blanco and tommy cash to collaborate with her for the new project . writing on twitter on sunday , charli hinted : `` imagine if i did another mixtape with @carlyraejepsen @tovelo @almacyber @cupcakke_rapper @brookecandy @pabllovittar @carolineplz @jaybumaom @kimpetras @dorianelectra @mykkiblanco tommy cash @momomoyouth and @agcook404 ... that would be pretty cool right . ",
        ". ? ? `` it would come as no surprise to charli 's fans as in 2012 , the ` boys ' hitmaker dropped two mixtapes in the form of ` super ultra ' and ` heartbreaks and earthquakes ' . meanwhile , the ` boom clap ' singer recently revealed her desire to form a female super-group called the tampon girls , which would conquer the global pop charts . although she did n't specify exactly who she would like in the line-up , charli listed the artists she admires who could be potential candidates , including her recent tour mate halsey . ",
        "the british star said : `` i have a dream of starting a band called the tampon girls . `` people i admire are like taylor swift , amazing songwriter . katy perry , amazing songwriter . lady gaga , amazing songwriter . only rihanna has no regrets . she 's perfect . `` charli also spilled that she had been having recording sessions with former fifth harmony star camila cabello and admitted she was blown away by her vocal talents and writing ability . she said : `` i was recently doing sessions with camila cabello , and she 's amazing . ",
        "i had known her as part of fifth harmony , which was put together on a tv show , so i was wrongly sceptical about how much she would write . she just blew me away . `` fans are also waiting for charli 's long-awaited third studio lp - the follow-up to 2014 's ` sucker ' - but it could take a while as she has been forced to rewrite her whole record after she fell victim to an album leak . however , charli insists it has n't set her back too much , as she is a speedy songwriter . ",
        "she said recently : `` my email got hacked and people leaked most of it , so i think i 'm just going to start again . `` but that 's fun for me , anyway i write fast so i 'm not really worried about anything . ''   "
