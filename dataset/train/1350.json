        "to cut the long story short , i broke up from my ex about 8 months ago , and he was my first love , anyway he used to call me fat ext , as i gained weight due to being happy for a while in the relationship . . anyway , i carried on comfort eating , and gained about 7 pounds more . i 'm now a size 20 . i believe he broke up with me because of my weight and i wo n't think different . anyway other than my ex , i 've had guys `` interested '' in me . ",
        ". well they make me think they 're interested for a while , then i get ignored , and honestly its making me feel so upset , rejected , fat , ugly , stupid and god knows what else . i just feel horrible , and wonder why they ignore me as i think i 've done something wrong . i 'm now on a diet , and strict exercise routine to get myself to a size 10-12 . . and i 'm worried in case these guys , or my ex come crawling back . tbh , i will reject them , but my question is this . ",
        ". why do they ignore me after they seem interested ? am i thinking too much ? guys i need your opinion . . and do guys prefer girls who are a size 10-12 ? -lrb- : .   "
