        "geneva -- the u. n. envoy for syria said the latest round of geneva talks ended without progress on thursday after two fruitless weeks -- a `` golden opportunity missed '' -- and acknowledged that he needs to come up with new ideas to make headway toward ending syria 's nearly seven-year war . staffan de mistura 's dire assessment -- and a rare admission of failure -- came at the end of the eighth round of the largely ineffective , u. n.-sponsored talks in switzerland . the u. n. envoy said he was `` disappointed , '' after going in with ambitions to get the two sides to talk to each other . ",
        "de mistura also offered some of his harshest criticism yet of the syrian government delegation , accusing it of setting preconditions that he had warned against , and said its team refused to discuss anything other than `` terrorism '' -- a term the government uses to refer to all armed opposition against president bashar assad . the damascus delegation also insisted the opposition team fell short of being an adequate representative of all of the opposition in syria -- a reference to groups that assad 's government has tolerated and that have not called for his ouster . de mistura said the opposition was engaged on other subjects , such as governance , the constitution and elections . ",
        "`` despite a lot of effort by my whole team , day and night with all sorts of creative formula , we did not have real negotiations , '' he said in frustration . `` it is a big missed opportunity , a golden opportunity missed at the end of this year , '' he said . however , de mistura , who has mediated the talks since early 2016 , said he was still planning to reconvene the two sides next month -- but will need to consult with u. n. secretary-general antonio guterres first . asked whether there was any point in returning to geneva , de mistura said the alternative would be abandoning syria and a return to war . ",
        "`` our motto is never give up , '' he said . the head of syria 's government team in geneva , bashar ja'afari , extinguished any hopes of a last-minute breakthrough when he emerged earlier thursday from a meeting with de mistura to say his team would not talk to the opposition as long as it insists on assad 's removal from power . in comments to reporters , he slammed the syrian opposition for its so-called riyadh communique , issued in saudi arabia before the latest round got underway in geneva . the communique stated that the opposition 's ultimate goal was to see assad step down at the start of a political process . ",
        "the damascus official described the statement as `` blackmail of the geneva process '' and said its withdrawal was a precondition for talks . he also told reporters in geneva that `` those who drew up the riyadh communique are the ones who sabotaged this round '' of talks . earlier thursday , de mistura called on russian president vladimir putin to `` have the courage '' to push his syrian government allies to accept new elections and a new constitution . in an unusual public appeal directly to a key power broker in the region , de mistura told a tv interviewer the russian leader , vladimir putin , should `` convince the government that there is no time to lose '' in efforts to reach peace after nearly seven years of war . ",
        "russia has provided crucial military and diplomatic backing to assad 's forces , though putin announced a drawdown of his forces in syria during a surprise visit to the mideast country on monday . the russian president touched down at a russian military base in syria in the wake of battlefield successes to laud the troops ' achievements and tell them that a significant number would be going home . asked what signal putin could provide now , de mistura said territorial gains are `` temporary . '' `` peace must be won -- and for the peace to be won , it 's necessary to have the courage to push the government also to accept that there must be a new constitution and new elections , '' the u. n. envoy added in comments late wednesday to swiss broadcaster rts . ",
        "ja'afari also blasted de mistura for his comments on russia , saying such positions `` derail his mandate as a facilitator of the talks , which will have an impact on the geneva process all together . in the interview , de mistura said it was `` regrettable '' that assad 's delegation had refused to meet face-to-face with the opposition . at the start of the latest round , the delegations at one point were just meters away from one another in separate rooms . with russia pushing a separate peace talks track , de mistura emphasized the importance of a u. n. role in any peace process . ",
        "hinting at his repeated concerns about a de facto partition of syria , the u. n. envoy held up a color-coded map showing the divisions of territorial control in syria . the war is estimated to have killed at least 400,000 people and driven over 12 million from their homes . de mistura 's two predecessors stepped down in frustration after failing to jumpstart peace talks . ___ karam reported from beirut . un special envoy for syria staffan de mistura , left , attends a round of negotiations with the delegation of the syrian negotiation commission during the intra syria talks , at the european headquarters of the united nations in geneva , switzerland , dec. .
