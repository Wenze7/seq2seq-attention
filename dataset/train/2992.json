        "lower hutt ratepayers could take a $ 2 million hit on an earthquake-prone commercial building purchased by the council for strategic purposes . and local real estate agent and council critic murray rodgers wants heads to roll . in mid 2015 , the council bought the former bnz site in high st for $ 2.8 million from developer raman sarin , who had resource consent to build a $ 25 million hotel and apartments . initially , the council did not disclose its intentions , however , in august 2017 council ceo tony stallinger confirmed it was to facilitate a development involving a government department . ",
        "read more : * design changes delay hotel * mystery over bnz purchase the council believed that a government department with 1000 staff planned to relocate to lower hutt . however there was nothing in writing and the deal had fallen over . `` we realised that it was not a done deal but it was pitched to us very positively , '' he said . the earthquake-prone building is now on the market with the council calling for expressions of interest . developers and real estate agents spoken to by stuff predicted its selling range would be between $ 500,000 and $ 1.3 m. council general manager kim kelly described the suggestion the site was worth as little as $ 500,000 as `` absurd '' and inaccurate . ",
        "`` council 's recent valuation of the property is almost four times this amount , taking into account that it is earthquake prone . `` the council had already rejected an offer of `` well over $ 1 million '' , she said one developer , who did not want to be identified , said the site 's only value was in the land . the high cost of demolition or strengthening the building meant the risk was high for developers . tim julian who is marketing the building would not comment on how much it might sell for . ",
        "the building 's history was well known , as was its earthquake prone status and his aim was to get the best possible result for council . although initial interest had not been as high as he hoped , he was in discussions with a number of potential buyers . rodgers said he was angry the council had gambled with ratepayers ' money and he supported the view that its only value was in the land . if it did sell for a big loss , he wanted the politicians who voted for it to accept responsibility . `` i will be turning up to the council meeting with resignation letters for them to sign . '' ",
        "that is a sentiment shared by peter norrie who owns the angus inn . it annoyed him that the council , was spending ratepayers ' money on projects that competed with established businesses like his . norrie `` absolutely '' backed the call for councillors who supported the original purchase to fall on their sword . his frustration with the council stems from the council 's support for a hotel in high st being built by sarin , with council funding of $ 3.5 million . deputy mayor david bassett has been the driving force behind the council 's plan to rejuvenate the struggling cbd with a hotel , building a $ 24 million events centre and a range of other developments to get people into the centre of the city . ",
        "he would not comment on the call for resignations and did not accept the council could lose a lot of money on the deal . `` i think it is early days to say that . '' the council was looking for ideas for the site that fitted into its `` vision '' for the central city and he believed the bnz site could return a positive result for council . `` there is the potential to sell it but we want to see what innovations developers can come up with . '' once work on the hotel began and the events centre opened there would be a flow-on effect to the rest of the cbd , including the bnz site , he said . "
