        "i 've done a lot of research on this topic and i finally found what the real difference of intelligence is between men and women . let 's look at the following bell curve : the average iq score is between 90 and 110 . as you can see , most of the females fall under the average iq category . whereas , males seem to have more of a variety of intelligence test scores . what does this all mean ? this means that there are more men who have low iq scores than women , but this also means there are more men with higher iq scores than women . ",
        "some people believe either gender is inherently smarter , but that is a mistake . none of the sexes is `` smarter '' than the other , because even if we argued that there are more genius iq 'd men than women , the counterargument would be that there are also more idiot men than idiot women ! this in turn goes to my next point ... why are most notable people in history men ? there are many reasons behind this question . one of them is that most genius people tend to be men , but the other main reason has nothing to do with intelligence or mental strength . ",
        "it more has to do with socialized roles that females have adopted , as well as males , and this is what prevented females from being `` notable '' throughout history . these women include : cleopatracleopatra sought to defend egypt from the expanding roman empire . she was a strong female amongst oppressive males . she took this power to improve her society . elizabeth iqueen of england during a time of great economic and social change , she saw england cemented as a protestant country . during her reign , she witnessed the defeat of the spanish armada leaving britain to later become one of the world 's dominant superpowers .

        "florence nightingaleby serving in the crimean war , florence nightingale was instrumental in changing the role and perception of the nursing profession . her dedicated service won widespread admiration and led to a significant improvement in the treatment of wounded soldiers . susan b. anthonysusan b. anthony began campaigning within the temperance movement and this convinced her of the necessity for women to have the vote . she toured the us giving countless speeches on the subjects of human rights . she must have had a lot of strength and mental prowess to convince people to agree for women to vote , in a society full of oppression and patriarchy . ",
        "and many more ! in my opinion , i think that the fact that there were even any females who were notable throughout history is very impressive , with all the oppression and sexism going on during the past centuries . summarythroughout history we 've learned that men and women have acquired different roles , each of them with their own importance and definition . intelligence scores that are nowadays seen as iq scores have also been made to compare different social groups , including men and women . 0 | 0 .
