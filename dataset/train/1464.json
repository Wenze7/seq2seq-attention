        "anytime you set out to build a business , design a product or create a service you need to be constantly thinking -- -- how can i make this un-killable by amazon ? because one day , whether you like it or not , amazon or someone like amazon will float into your industry and make whatever you 're creating better , cheaper and more convenient . the same can be said for jobs . a decade ago , when the idea of self-driving semi-trucks were first being talked about , semi-truck drivers were rolling their eyes . now , semi-truck drivers are starting to worry . ",
        "a decade from now , semi-truck drivers will be out of a job . it 's cold , it 's harsh , but it 's the reality of the world we live in . it 's not enough anymore to just build a business . today , we have to outrun innovation ; and that 's going to put a lot of businesses out of business . while one strategy to consider when working to build a timeless business is constantly staying ahead of the curve , another strategy is simply doubling down on things like customer service , experience and focus -- -- all of which i outline in the anti-amazon business model below . ",
        "the anti-amazon business model : extremely focused . we do n't sell running shoes , handkerchiefs and pasta strainers . we just sell running shoes and we sell them really well . when you do one thing really well , it makes it much harder for a giant like amazon to compete with you . which , brings us to our next point ... zappos . customer centered . zappos is a customer service business first , shoe company second . they obliterated amazon when it came to shoes because they offered better customer service than amazon could ever provide . ",
        "that 's probably why amazon ended up acquiring them in 2009 for $ 800 million . stellar experience . while consumers enjoy convenience and affordability , they are willing to sacrifice both if it means they will get a stellar experience . for example , top golf is a golfing and entertainment company that is currently taking the united states by storm . while it 's certainly cheaper and more convenient for someone to stay at home on a friday night and watch netflix , many are instead going to top golf because it provides a stellar experience . there is only so much experience you can get out of clicking the buy button on amazon . ",
        "seek to create an incredible experience that amazon ca n't replicate . by cole schafer . cole is the copy chief at honey copy , where he helps startups make more money through emails and landing pages that read like poetry and sell like ogilvy . when he is n't slinging copy , he is right here on medium sharing ideas about life , business and marketing . or riding alpacas .
