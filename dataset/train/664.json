        "buccaneers ' rookie wide receiver chris godwin had a pretty strong ending to a pretty strong first season in the nfl . what 's he going to do in between now and the time his next one starts ? catching a game winning touchdown against a key divisional opponent on the last offensive play of the buccaneers ' year is a pretty solid way to ride into the sunset . if fans of the team did n't know who he was when the bucs selected him in the third-round of the 2017 nfl draft , they certainly do now . ",
        "he 's developed a small , but growing constituency of fans who see him as the future of tampa 's wide receiver group . images of he and mike evans running through defensive coverages to catch passes from jameis winston are keeping many bucs fans cozy during these cold , playoff-less days . while we watch other teams , and fans of those teams , try and will their ways to a super bowl title what are players like godwin doing ? well , when he made an appearance on the locked on bucs podcast , we asked him about his off-season plans . ",
        "here 's what he said , `` right now i 'm just trying to recover , and get my body right , but when i start working out again i have a good plan in place .

",
        "so , rest is important , but so is a plan for the future . godwin 's plan does n't just focus on physical improvements , it also hinges on professional ones , `` i have the little things i want to work on , as a receiver . make sure i 'm getting in and out of my routes better . just understanding how to play receiver at the nfl level and be successful . taking those little things i 've learned throughout the season , and really honing on those skills throughout the off-season . `` while nothing is set in stone just yet , godwin also hopes to be able to get together with teammates for private workouts , and even mentioned texas a&m as a possible location to get together with evans and winston who now both have ties to the campus . ",
        "life is n't all about work however . when i asked him who he would single out as the biggest contributor to his rookie success , godwin pointed to someone we all got to know a little bit during hbo 's `` hard knocks '' series , `` i would probably say , mariah . just mainly because , we go through so much as football players , as professional athletes . day in and day out , it 's a grind throughout the seventeen week season ... . any time you can get a chance to step away from the game to just relax and take your mind off of it a bit , i think that 's very beneficial . ",
        "for me , that 's what mariah provides for me . `` while fans of the team anxiously await the beginning for free-agency and the nfl draft season , players like godwin are planning their recovery and plan to come back stronger . the almost 22-year old receiver mentioned he and mariah would be taking a mini-vacation before he gets back into his full workout routine . i for one , wish him all the best in recovering and hope he and mariah enjoy their time together . he better . because we all expect to see him playing this time in 2019 .
