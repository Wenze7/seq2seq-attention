        "social media is a double-edged sword that could make britain 's loneliness epidemic worse , the sister of the murdered mp jo cox has said in response to research which found that 9 million people in the uk feel permanently isolated . speaking at the launch of a report commissioned by the labour mp before her death , kim leadbeater said technology was a force for good , but that it had reduced people 's time for `` proper human connections '' . `` our lives nowadays are so busy . we 're constantly dashing around , we spend the vast majority of our time on our phones , on our laptops . ",
        "we need to press pause on that and actually sit down and speak to human beings , '' she said at the event in cox 's former constituency of batley and spen , near leeds . the jo cox commission on loneliness , a cross-party initiative which published its findings on friday , said there was a `` gap in national leadership on loneliness '' and urged the government to appoint a minister to lead action on the issue . it said loneliness was as harmful to health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day . the report calls on the government to launch an annual loneliness survey of the whole population to measure the problem -- which charities have described as an epidemic -- more accurately . ",
        "it also calls for the government 's family test , which assesses the effect of policies on stable families , to become a family and relationships test . cox established the commission , which is chaired by the labour mp rachel reeves and the tory mp seema kennedy , before a far-right fanatic murdered her outside her constituency office in june 2016 . unveiling the report at jo cox house on friday , leadbeater said both she and her late sister suffered loneliness when cox left home to go to cambridge university , and that it was encouraging that people were opening up about it . ",
        "`` it 's refreshing that more people are prepared to acknowledge . i do n't think it 's that surprising ... what we 're lacking is proper human connections , where we actually sit down with somebody , we have eye contact , we might even touch them , '' she said . `` i 'm guilty as anybody . i spend loads of time on my phone , far more than i ever did before , and i used to go mad with jo because jo would be constantly on her phone , but that is the nature of our lives nowadays . ",
        "`` it 's a double-edged sword . i think technology is brilliant in that it can help to connect people , but it is not a substitute for human contact . it 's fantastic in many ways but it does n't replace sitting down with a human being . '' leadbeater said everyone in society had a role to play in combating loneliness , and urged people to devote just an hour of their time a week to sit down with a neighbour . she also said , however , that the government needed to change policy and provide money to tackle the issue . ",
        "`` i would encourage them to do so and we need to hold them to account if they do n't do that , '' she said . the report stresses that loneliness affects people of all ages , not just older generations . it found that 43 % of 17 - to 25-year-olds using the charity action for children , which helps vulnerable and neglected young people , reported feeling isolated . research by the same charity found that that more than 50 % of parents had faced problems with loneliness , and one in five had felt lonely in the past week . ",
        "the commission praised volunteer projects , such as writing back , in which students from leeds university become penpals with older yorkshire residents . heather wilson , a semi-retired former social worker , said she decided to become penpals with three students after she began to feel lonely at home . `` i 've always been socially minded , but i 've felt incredibly lonely at different times in life , '' she said at the launch event . `` i felt i just did n't want to sit in my house by myself , and it just keeps your mind alive . ",
        "the young people you meet are really wonderful people and sometimes they get a bad press . '' in her latest letter , wilson , 65 , explained british christmas traditions to her chinese student penpal kun li , who said he had signed up to the project because he had no friends in leeds , having arrived in the city two months earlier to study for a phd . `` i 'm a stranger to the uk and i know nothing about the uk . i sat at home , i had nothing to do , i had no friends , '' he said . ",
        "`` for our international students , we want to know more about england 's culture and local culture but we do n't know where we can get this information so i write to older people who know a lot about the culture of england . '' this article originally appeared on the guardian .   "
