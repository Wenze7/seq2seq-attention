        "israeli agricultural minister uri ariel wants more injured and dead palestinians in gaza . `` what is this special weapon we have that we fire and see pillars of smoke and fire , but nobody gets hurt ? '' he said on local radio . `` it is time for there to be injuries and deaths as well . '' this was reported by haaretz . ariel 's comments come at a time when , bolstered and emboldened by us support over jerusalem , israel is seeking to increase ways in which palestinians are restricted even further in terms of politics , freedom of movement and resistance to its military occupation . ",
        "the increasingly threatening rhetoric , combined with its often resultant violence , is a clear message that israel wants palestinian existence to be determined according to its own colonial needs . indeed the minister 's remarks are indicative of israel 's need for violence and conflict to sustain its existence . framing his penchant for more deaths against the narrative of the purported `` palestinian terrorist '' , he also amalgamated his demands with defence minister avigdor lieberman 's comments from 2016 . at that time , far-right extremist lieberman recommended the further fragmentation of palestinians by suggesting that the homes of those involved in resistance should be demolished , and that those who `` desire coexistence '' should be rewarded . ",
        "lieberman 's differentiation of palestinians , particularly the latter group , is a simplistic approach which negates many of the reasons why not all palestinians are visibly involved in resistance . one obvious reason which israel has perpetrated is the juxtaposition of survival due to extreme poverty and lack of basic necessities , and the struggle against several forms of state violence . it also refutes the fact that most palestinians , unlike the leadership of the palestinian authority , do not want to live under colonial rule . whether ariel 's statement suggests yet another military offensive against the palestinians in the besieged gaza strip remains to be seen . ",
        "however , there is no doubt that demands for state violence against civilians will become more brazen , as israel basks in the impunity which is sustained on two levels : that generated by its own actions and absence of accountability under the pretext of `` security concerns '' ; and the international community 's endorsement of this false narrative . another ramification of ariel 's words is the separation of the visible injuries and killings in the occupied west bank and the silent forms of slow extermination in gaza as a result of israeli-imposed deprivation . clearly , he prefers the macabre spectacle of multitudes of injured and dead palestinian civilians in gaza and , what is more , he is allowed to express himself in such a manner without censure of any kind , safe in the knowledge that killing palestinians has not only become normalised , but also expected . ",
        "the dehumanisation of palestinians in the israeli minister 's words is also reflective of how statistics contribute to the absence of palestinians in terms of collective memory . for israel , the numbers serve to boost the false claims of self-defence . conversely , statistics for palestinians depict the cycles of murder by israeli institutions . the international community , on the other hand , is partial to the anonymity of numbers , particularly when there is no requirement other than for it to turn a blind eye until israel decides upon the next phase of gaza 's destruction , whereupon the un will exhort the colonial entity 's `` right '' to defend itself against the colonised . ",
        "in doing so , it will also affirm its contempt for human rights and resolutions by refusing to uphold the palestinian people 's right to self-determination and , indeed , their right to resist military occupation by any means available .   "
