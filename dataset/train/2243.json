        "los angeles -- firefighters kept a wall of flames from descending mountains into coastal neighborhoods after a huge and destructive southern california wildfire exploded in size , becoming the fifth largest in state history . tens of thousands remained under evacuation orders monday as the fire churned west through foothill areas of carpinteria and montecito , seaside santa barbara county towns about 75 miles northwest of los angeles . much of the fire 's rapid new growth occurred on the eastern and northern fronts into unoccupied areas of los padres national forest , where the state 's fourth largest fire burned a decade ago . ",
        "the blaze , which had already destroyed more than 750 buildings , gutted six more in carpinteria on sunday , officials said . it 's just 15 percent contained after charring nearly 360 square miles of dry brush and timber . `` we 're still anxious . i 'm not frightened yet , '' carpinteria resident roberta lehtinen told kabc-tv . `` i do n't think it 's going to come roaring down unless the winds kick up . `` forecasters predicted that dry winds that fanned several fires across the region for a week would begin to lose their power monday . ",
        "light gusts were pushing onshore , driving the flames back up hillsides and away from communities , santa barbara county fire spokesman mike eliason said . but the possibility of `` unpredictable '' gusts would keep firefighters on edge for days , he said . santa ana winds have long contributed to some of the region 's most disastrous wildfires . they blow from the inland toward the pacific ocean , speeding up as they squeeze through mountain passes and canyons . with the air thick with acrid smoke , even residents of areas not under evacuation orders took the opportunity to leave , fearing another shutdown of u. s. 101 , a key coastal highway that was closed intermittently last week . ",
        "officials handed out masks to residents who stayed behind in montecito , the wealthy hillside enclave that 's home to celebrities such as oprah winfrey , jeff bridges and drew barrymore . smoke shrouded rob lowe 's home and the actor wore a mask as he livestreamed his family leaving on sunday . `` praying for the people in my area , '' he said on instagram . `` hope everybody 's getting out safe like we are , and thanks for the prayers and thoughts . and good luck to the firefighters , we need you ! `` talk show host ellen degeneres tweeted that neighbors were helping each other and their animals get to safety . ",
        "`` i 'm sending lots of love and gratitude to the fire department and sheriffs . thank you all , '' she wrote . meanwhile , containment increased on other major blazes in los angeles , riverside and san diego counties . resources from those fires were diverted to the santa barbara foothills to combat the stubborn and enormous fire that started dec. . 4 . fires are not typical in southern california this time of year but can break out when dry vegetation and too little rain combine with the santa ana winds . though the state emerged this spring from a yearslong drought , hardly any measurable rain has fallen in the region over the past six months . ",
        "`` this is the new normal , '' democratic gov. jerry brown warned saturday after surveying damage from the deadly ventura fire . brown and experts said climate change is making wildfires a year-round threat . high fire risk is expected to last into january . the small mountain town of ojai experienced hazardous levels of smoke at times , and officials warned of unhealthy air for large swaths of the region . the south coast air quality management district urged residents to stay indoors if possible and avoid vigorous outdoor activities . despite the size and number of wildfires burning in the region , there has only been one confirmed death : the death of a 70-year-old woman , who crashed her car on an evacuation route , is attributed to the fire in santa paula , a small city where the thomas fire began . ",
        "most of last week 's fires were in places that burned in the past , including one in the ritzy los angeles neighborhood of bel-air that burned six homes and another in the city 's rugged foothills above the community of sylmar and in santa paula . ___ follow weber at . ___ for complete coverage of the california wildfires , click here : .
