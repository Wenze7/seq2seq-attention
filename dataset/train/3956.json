        "board of deputies of british jews says mary hassell has lost confidence of jewish communityharriet sherwood religion correspondentjewish leaders have called for a senior london coroner to be sacked , saying she has lost the confidence of the jewish community in a dispute over delays in releasing bodies for burial . the board of deputies of british jews met mary hassell , the senior coroner for inner north london , after she said she would not prioritise any death for religious reasons . under jewish and islamic law , bodies must be buried on the day of death or as soon as possible afterwards . ",
        "both faiths also view invasive postmortems as desecration , preferring ct body scans and autopsies only as a last resort . hassell 's jurisdiction covers hackney , which has the biggest concentration of ultra-orthodox jews in europe , and tower hamlets , the uk 's biggest muslim community . the board of deputies and the adath yisrael burial society sought a meeting with hassell in an attempt to resolve the dispute and persuade the coroner to withdraw the protocol , issued earlier this month . `` the early release of bodies for those families who want it -- including jewish families -- is a fulfilment of the basic human rights of family life and religious practice , '' said marie van der zyl , the board 's vice-president . ",
        "`` not only is ms hassell failing to respect those rights , but she shows no inclination to do so . she has lost the confidence of the jewish community , and appears to have no interest in winning it back . '' the board plans to write to david gauke , the lord chancellor and justice secretary , and lord burnett , the lord chief justice , to request hassell 's removal from post . the relationship between hassell and the orthodox jewish community has been tense since the coroner took up her post in 2013 , but it has come to a head in a dispute over the death of a jewish man , aharon barzevski , 43 , on 21 october 2017 . ",
        "the abya and barzevski 's family accused the coroner of unnecessary foot-dragging in authorising a ct scan instead of an invasive autopsy , and therefore delaying the burial until four days after his death . hassell said the delay was due to no out-of-hours service being available and staff shortages . she also accused jewish community representatives of bullying her staff . she issued a protocol , under which `` no death will be prioritised in any way over any other because of the religion of the deceased or family '' . in a letter to lawyers for the abys and barzevski 's relatives , hassell said : `` i believe the cab rank rule is the fairest way . '' ",
        "hassell 's office has declined to comment on the dispute . the judicial conduct investigations office has confirmed it has received a formal complaint against the coroner .   "
