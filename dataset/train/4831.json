",
        "wasps were in command for virtually the entire contest and guy thompson , tom cruse , willie le roux and jake cooper-wooley sealed a the bonus-point win , eliminating ulster in the process . that victory kept wasps ' hopes of progression alive but they were soon extinguished by munster , who sealed top spot in pool 4 with an easy win over castres . ian keatley kicked 12 points and keith earls , rhys marshall , simon zebo , alex wootton and james cronin all crossed as munster cruised to a 48-3 success , leapfrogging racing 92 into top spot .
