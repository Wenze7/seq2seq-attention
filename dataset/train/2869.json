        "a lobbyist who helped stage a controversial fundraiser for lisa raitt later told associates that the minister was prepared to `` push '' their project under the federal clean energy fund . the lobbyist subsequently recanted his triumphant email as `` self-aggrandizing '' and `` very boastful . '' the details are revealed in a report by federal ethics commissioner mary dawson , who concluded thursday that raitt broke no rules . but dawson suggested new `` guidelines '' are needed to stop lobbyists and stakeholders from raising funds for cabinet ministers whose services they require . `` this does n't pass the smell test , '' said new democrat mp olivia chow , who lodged one of three complaints against raitt . ",
        "at issue were media reports that the toronto port authority helped promote a fundraiser for raitt last september that was organized through michael mcsweeney , a lobbyist for the cement association of canada . well-connected staffer other `` findings of fact '' in the dawson report : raitt personally informed janet macdonald , her former executive assistant at the toronto port authority , about the fundraiser . macdonald went on to use `` two binders of business cards , '' collected when raitt was at the port , to put together a mailing list of invitees and send it out using her port authority email . ",
        "will stewart , a principal at the conservative-connected navigator ltd. . communications and lobbying firm ensight canada inc. , sits on the halton conservative association and helped set up the raitt fundraiser . the lobbyist registry shows he lobbied raitt or her ministerial staff `` several times '' in 2008 and 2009 . after media published details of the event , the riding association refunded 22 of 41 tickets that had been sold , each with a minimum purchase price of $ 250 , `` due to sensitivities that had been raised about the fundraiser . '' his brother was raitt 's office manager . ",
        "the port authority is a federal entity that raitt previously led and the cement association had been actively lobbying raitt in her role as natural resources minister . dawson 's investigation found that mcsweeney was enlisted to help sell tickets for the fundraiser by his brother , colin mcsweeney , who managed raitt 's parliament hill office at the time . colin mcsweeney is a well-connected political staffer on parliament hill and organizer for the conservative party in eastern ontario . after helping stage the sept. . 24 event at the same downtown toronto restaurant that rahim jaffer used to meet businessman nazim gillani , michael mcsweeney emailed the president and directors of the cement association of canada . ",
        "`` mr. mcsweeney reported that he had just had cocktails with ms. raitt and that she was excited about the particular project and wanted to have a personal copy so she could ` see how to push it , ' '' says dawson 's report . project not funded the email also stated that mcsweeney would `` give a copy of the application to his brother colin , who worked for her , to give to her personally . '' raitt , according to the report , had met previously with the cement association about the project , which was `` ineligible '' for the $ 200-million clean energy fund . ",
        "but she suggested it `` might qualify as a pilot project . '' dawson found that raitt received no report and that the project was not funded . michael mcsweeney subsequently told the ethics watchdog that he `` very much regretted and was ashamed of having sent that email , which he described as ` self-aggrandizing ' and ` very boastful , ' and said he was just trying to make himself look good . '' the retraction parallels that of embattled businessman gillani , who emailed associates after a toronto meeting with former conservative mp rahim jaffer to say : `` mr. jaffer has opened up the prime minister 's office to us . '' ",
        "when the email became public , gillani recanted by saying he 'd been `` overly enthusiastic . ''   "
