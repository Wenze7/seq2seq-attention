        "rachel & shane krider 's second episode of their personal development podcast is all about gratitude . below is a snippet of the podcast where shane discusses how the mentality of entitlement is synonymous with ingratitude . anybody may say `` well i feel like i should have this and i should have that . '' that 's an entitlement mentality . to me , entitlement mentality is synonymous with ingratitude . i learned a great thing . i apologize , i ca n't remember where i found this from . it was talking about human rights , and it said : `` nothing can be a human right that requires the work and labor of another human being because it will turn the human beings who can perform that skill into a slave to the human beings who ca n't . '' ",
        "even though we would like to believe that certain things should be a human right , if it takes to work or labor of other people , it really is n't a human right because now we have people that owe their work , their labor to somebody else regardless of the ability to be compensated . now , granted , in that same breath you have to take a look at the concept of charity and the importance of charity . i would hate to live in a world where there was no charity . i feel like i 've been on the receiving end of charity more than once in my life and probably undeserving of it . ",
        "but , it 's amazing when you receive that little bit of charity . even if your heart is in the wrong place , it can help you shift it into the right place . so i 'm not saying that we should n't be charity-driven as people . but there is this whole concept of entitlement and being owed . people are going to school to get a degree , and they ca n't get a job , so they 're unemployed . they do n't think about becoming an entrepreneur . they do n't think about taking the bull by the horns . ",
        "they get pissed off at society because what they thought was gon na happen , did n't happen . but that 's learned entitlement mentality . shane krider is a successful personal development life coach , producer , speaker , author , and entrepreneur . along with his wife , shane is the co-host of born to prosper 's mind power , which is a self-help podcast which challenges its listeners to delve deep into their minds to find success . in addition , shane travels the world in luxury to speak to aspiring entrepreneurs at conferences and workshops to inspire them to find their own pathways to success .
