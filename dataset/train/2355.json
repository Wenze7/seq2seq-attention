        "`` i think today , people they do n't have time to spend time with elderly people or with children and using that is just perfect , because it looks like a human , interacts like a human , and it 's a gentle product , '' said roseline le thomas , who said she could see having a robot for her family . the costs of companion robots vary . buddy will cost about $ 1,500 . `` if you 're going to spend $ 1,000 on an iphone , you can spend $ 1,000 on a little robot like that , '' hoalst said .
