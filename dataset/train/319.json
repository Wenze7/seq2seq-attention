        "a hale and healthy mother turned in to a toddler in a few months due to dementia . a toddler could not respond to me on any context due to autism . a friend caught up with addiction and another suffering with depression . one may ask , is this scenario true ! surprising , yes it is . in fact , each one of us have people around us who go through at least one of the issues like , stress , depression , common mental disorders etc. . they need care and love to support their living and in many situations they can overcome their pain with timely help . ",
        "as an individual trying to figure out what to do , the questions that lingered in my mind were : how to help people in these situations ? how to change the perception in my peers regarding those who suffer ? how to make the society a better place for my consort who need special attention ? i got answer for these , through the website `` whiteswanfoundation . org '' . a dedicated non-profit organization which helps , those who are suffering as well as those who want to serve the suffering . this website is an archive of knowledge ; it has collection of videos , real life analysis or case studies , articles etc. . ",
        "the lack of awareness is a main cause for many issues . our neighbors may not be aware of various psychiatric disorders , even the family members of the sufferers may not know what their mother or son or daughter or father is going through . by gaining knowledge about the various issues and by knowing how to deal with them , and educating those around us , we can definitely make the world a better place for us as well as those around us . white swan foundation has taken up this hard task on them , kudos to them ; i would like to be part of their noble cause , by learning from them and implementing the knowledge gained . ",
        "i am fortunate that i came across this organization . i am looking forward for a long journey and strong bond with them .   "
