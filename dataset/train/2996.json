        "manchester city are so far enjoying a stellar season . they are yet to be defeated both in europe and in the premier league and hold an eight point lead over nearest rivals manchester united . speaking about what has changed at the club this season , captain vincent kompany said : `` i do n't think we show as many weaknesses as last season . at the same time i think we have understood what he wants a little bit better , which is normal , it 's just the process of being together longer . then i would also say we have kind of learned from the fact that nothing has happened yet , so we have to be careful . ",
        "`` we are not getting carried away , i think a lot of people around us are getting carried away , but if you go in the dressing room it 's calm and focused . we all felt what it 's like not to win anything , and we do n't want that to happen again . `` meanwhile , kompany says an unbeaten season is not on the minds of the players . `` i believe that in every game we play we have a chance to win . after that , i have my past experience , i 've been able to be part of a team that was unbeaten until the end of december , that was good going , and that was difficult . ",
        "`` the best thing is to not think about it . maybe in the last three or four games if we get near , i will happy to talk about it , but right now it does n't make any sense . it does n't make any sense to talk about winning the league yet , it 's just about winning the next game .   "
