        "it was a shame the rain could n't stay away . the weather gods were not kind to those competing in timaru 's annual boxing day criterium cycle races . cycling timaru president , darren cuthbertson , said locals probably did n't support the race as well as they normally would because of the weather and a fear of crashing . he said it also halted people from outside of timaru travelling to town to compete in the race . `` it stopped people coming down from christchurch and ashburton to compete . '' while cuthbertson said competitor numbers were at least halved compared to 2016 's race , he was happy with the numbers that turned up to compete . ",
        "`` considering the weather the turnout was n't too bad . `` there 's not much you can do . '' bailey o'donnell of ashburton took out the a-grade race . the teenager was a member of the new zealand under-19 track team , and has just been signed by team skoda racing for next year . the victory was an impressive feat for o'donnell who punctured during a race that also featured the likes of tour de france cyclist shane archbold , and waimate 's dylan kennett , who was a rio olympian . falling off during the race , gail burtenshaw was able to come back and win the d-grade race . ",
        "she was followed by barry taylor . the boxing day criterium is usually followed by the jolly potter race in temuka on december 27 , but because it had fallen on a work day , cuthbertson said the caledonian society are instead hosting a night race at claremont hall . he hoped there would be a good turn-out due to the improvement in weather . `` hopefully the race will be reasonably successful .
