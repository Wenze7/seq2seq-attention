        "the uk chapter is donning the leathers and hitting the roaddykes on bikes began in san francisco in 1976 as a motorcycle club for lesbians , and has now grown into an international movement -- with at least 22 chapters of bikers around the world . i spoke with raisy stary , president of dykes on bikes uk , for a behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to keep the club on the road . the club was founded about seven years ago , what have been some of the highlights in that time ? meeting the three australian clubs and getting to know them all at mardi gras was a highlight -- there were lots of social events around that time , and hanging out with them was special . ",
        "all of our pride rides and camping trips have always been a highlight , but last year we travelled up the m25 with 40 female riders to the world-record female riders attempt . staying at the camping ground with so many other women , hanging out around fires , and helping each other out was amazing . why is there a need for a specific lgbti bike club -- why not just join the existing bike clubs that are open to everyone ? it 's a unique tribe of people that share some issues that the straight and patriarchal world do n't have . ",
        "we all have a lot in common , and coming together unites us . how many members does the club currently have ? currently 13 patched members and several prospects . anyone is free to join us on rides , and we had up to 25 members in the summer on our fortnightly rides . in the winter it 's more like six who are n't fair-weather , however the girls still meet for our social events . rides with larger groups are more dangerous , but there 's nothing like the thrill of riding in the thunder of a pack . ",
        "is membership growing ? we always welcome new members , and are hoping to gain new members each year . we cover most of the south east of the uk , and anyone is welcome . you do n't need to be a patched member to come on our rides with us . the process of being patched means that if you attend six rides and six meetings in the space of 12 months , and you get along with everyone , then you 'll be considered for a patch which is a dedication to the club . is it just for women ? ",
        "we are mostly women , and have a couple of transgender people who are part of our club . occasionally men join us , but mostly they help as support at our events . do you have to identify as lgbti to be a member of the club ? identity is complicated these days , you can be gender-identified or sexually-identified , but the bottom line is that if you 're happy to call yourself a dyke you 'll fit in well with the other members . do you welcome people who are new to biking ? we welcome and encourage and support new riders . ",
        "our newest member haily has been riding a 125 with us , and has just passed her full licence this month . we 'll continue to be supporting her with the new machine , when she gets it next year . what are some of the biggest challenges in running the club ? it takes a lot of work and time to run a club -- invariably you have to be many roles including mother , problem solver , big bad wolf , admin , treasurer , ride leader , ambassador , press officer , ride co-ordinator , sectary , welcome committee , and events planner . ",
        "you have invest your own time money and effort and not expect anything back , including respect . you have to have the ability to not take anything personally . you have to be a counsellor to internal fall-outs , and take executive decisions . you have to plan ahead , as there are four events every month in the summer . you have to be able to delegate , and put things in place on a weekly basis , which involves a hell of a lot of communication and effort , and not get upset when no-one shows , or someone asks you what 's happening . ",
        "if you can do all of that for a couple of years , then you can be a leader . what sort of events do members take part in ? social events at this time of year include trips to watch the women 's rugby at twickenham , bowling , ice skating , visiting new places , and bbqs abroad at other chapters ' club houses . in summer , it 's anything from music festivals , camping trips , walks , games days with a competitive element , morris dancing , galleries , film festivals , women-only events , and all-biker events . ",
        "rides in summer are every week , and we try to go somewhere new every time for a pub meal or an ice cream or a coffee or to a biker caf√© . we gear each ride to the bikes coming on the ride . we do fast and slow ones , country roads , and motorways if we have no scooters with us . we also do some long ones in europe -- like riding to germany last year for a weekend . what are some of the key events coming up for the club ? some of our members hope to do the iron butt challenge this year , which is 1000 miles in 24 hours . ",
        "we have our pride events to ride in -- last year i did five . we have a long ride planned with the german chapter to come here and ride up to north wales together to coincide with lfest . we hope to go there for two weekends in may . we have the worlds largest all-female track day and record attempt to look forward to , and plenty of rallies and rides -- including the 1066 run , brightona , and the ace run to brighton . we have route 66 and a tour through 10 states , with lots of chapters of dykes on bikes internationally , and san francisco pride . ",
        "does the club take part in any community activities or outreach , or is the primary focus the biking ? we participate in biking events mostly , but have done some charity events every year . dykes on bikes uk . image courtesy of dykes on bikes .   "
