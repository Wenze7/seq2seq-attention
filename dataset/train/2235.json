        "whatsapp has revealed that it plans to drop support for the blackberry os , blackberry 10 as well as windows phone 8.0 and older by the end of the year . that means some capabilities of the facebook-owned instant messaging app may no longer work as usual on those os versions once support is ended on december 31 , 2017 . keep in mind , however , that you will still be able to use the app on devices running those operating systems , though whatsapp will no longer allow you to create new accounts or re-authenticate existing ones .

        "while the whatsapp support for the blackberry os , blackberry 10 and windows phone 8.0 will retire by new year 's eve , the app will still continue to work on android versions 2.3.7 and older until february 1 , 2020 as well as on nokia s40 until december 31 , 2018 . the extension of support for android 2.3.7 gingerbread and older versions of google 's mobile operating system until 2020 was announced in june of this year . the latest move is part of a broader effort to get users to upgrade to a newer os version , including android 4.0 and later , ios 7 and newer , or windows phone 8.1 and higher , as the instant messaging platform intends to expand the features of the app in the future .
