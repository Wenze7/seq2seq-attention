        "newcastle united have been installed as clear favourites to sign liverpool striker danny ings in the january transfer window following a dramatic drop in the bookmakers ' odds . sky bet have priced the north-east giants at 1/3 on saturday morning to land ings , 25 , before 3 february next year . newcastle have stretched a long way ahead of their premier league rivals to take a firm pole position in the betting race , ahead of west brom , southampton and huddersfield . newcastle were priced at 3/1 a fortnight ago to complete the signing of ings in january . ",
        "ings ' two-year spell at anfield has been ruined by two serious knee injuries but he has returned to the matchday squad this month and was used as a late substitute in the recent premier league fixtures against everton and bournemouth . good move for newcastle ? yes , definitely . ings has an impressive scoring record and was one of the most in-demand strikers in the country before quitting burnley , where he scored 43 times in 130 matches . his liverpool career has not got going due to injury and horrible luck but he is still young enough and , crucially , good enough to make a big impact in the premier league . ",
        "joining newcastle in january would enable him to play regularly and rediscover his mojo . he would be an upgrade on the current striker options available to rafael benitez such as joseulu , dwight gayle and aleksandar mitrovic . it is a move that could suit both parties to a tee . this is futbol rating : 8/10likely to happen ? ings is contracted to liverpool until 2020 and it has been reported that he could be allowed to leave on loan in january in order to build up his fitness and play first-team football . he is behind roberto firmino , dominic solanke and daniel sturridge in the striker pecking order at anfield and that is unlikely to change any time soon . ",
        "there is the possibility that sturridge could leave next month , but that is unlikely given the team have so much to play for in the second half of the campaign and he is too good to let go . this is futbol rating : 6/10 .   "
