        "despite some old school bodybuilders calling powerlifters fatties and powerlifters calling bodybuilders weak , the two sports can actually complement each other more than you 'd think . not only this , we are starting to see a new kind of hybrid athlete emerge that are able to compete at the highest level of both sports and the trend is rising -- think stan efferding , johnny jackson , susan salazar , eva dunbar , and myself . these days , it 's not unusual to go to a powerlifting meet and see jacked , lean , hard lifters , and you can find bodybuilders throwing around real weight . ",
        "the late dallas mccarver had a nearly 900 lb deadlift , and everyone knows that the legendary ronnie coleman could rep 800 lbs in both squats and deadlifts . here are a few tips for those interested in competing or training in both sports as a compliment . 1 . do heavy weights in hypertrophy rep rangespowerlifters know they need to lift heavy but think everything over 5 reps is cardio . hypertrophy work builds muscle tissue , and not only does that give you a better foundation of actual muscle for your powerlifting work , it also helps in terms of stability . ",
        "the bottom line is that muscle moves weight and no matter how neuro-efficient you are , you will always benefit from having more muscle mass . bodybuilders understand high reps but often forget that hard , dense muscle and real 3d thickness is built with heavy weight . compare ronnie coleman and phil heath : both genetically gifted athletes , one lifting very heavy and the other not . to me , the difference is clear .
