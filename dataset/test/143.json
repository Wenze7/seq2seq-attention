        "if the blackhawks ' were opening training camp this weekend , corey crawford would n't be on the months after sustaining what would turn out to be a season-ending injury , he 's not months after an ill-advised attempt to practice in arizona , the last time crawford skated , he 's still not ready to matter how badly hawks fans want him to play or how much his coaches and teammates support him , the goaltender is still not ready even to begin skating time will come , he assured the media before the opening ceremonies of friday 's 11th annual blackhawks convention , but he 's not yet .",
        "`` i 'm feeling pretty good right now , '' crawford said . `` i 'm not 100 percent , but we have come a long way in the last couple of months and worked really hard to do whatever i can to get better . i 'm excited to be here right now and see all the guys and get that feeling of being back in it . `` crawford 's injury is believed to be concussion-related , though the hawks have referred to it steadfastly as an `` upper-body injury . '' when asked specifically what has kept him sidelined , he declined to say . ",
        "`` we ca n't disclose that , and i ask you just to respect that , '' crawford said . `` there have been a lot of rumors -- people tend to do that speculation . that 's normal . but we 're not going to discuss any of that . what 's important right now is getting better and getting prepared for the start of the season . `` the hawks ' season took a dive when crawford got hurt . they were 17-13-5 when he got hurt dec. . 23 at new jersey and went 16-26-5 the rest of the way , ending up in last place and missing the playoffs for the first time in 10 thought he was making enough progress in mid-february to join the team for a trip and face shots during a morning skate . ",
        "he has n't been back on the ice since . `` we tried that to see where i was at , and it did n't work out , '' crawford said . `` i would have liked to have come back at that time or even before that , but it really was n't in the cards to do that . it was n't smart to do that and maybe create something worse . `` nobody knows how important crawford is to the blackhawks more than coach joel quenneville , who said he has no doubt the two-time stanley cup winner will be back in the net . ",
        "returning from a serious injury and having to prove himself again seems consistent with how crawford has been perceived over the years . `` he gets counted out a lot of times , '' quenneville said . `` he does n't really get the accolades a goalie who has proven he can win at that elite level . we all believe in ` crow , ' and i think he 's excited about getting ready and being crow like we always have seen . `` when crawford got hurt , the hawks turned to unproven goalies jean-francois berube , anton forsberg and jeff glass . ",
        "general manager stan bowman did n't want that to happen again and signed veteran goalie cam ward , whom he expects to serve as crawford 's backup . `` now everybody realizes what we have been saying for six years now , '' bowman said . `` this guy is overlooked often . when people are talking about the best goalies in the nhl , i never understood why he was n't in that discussion . now with him not being here it seems like he is getting noticed for how important he is . we 're excited . we 're hopeful . ",
        "`` blackhawks goalie coach jimmy waite has been in contact with crawford during the offseason , texting with him and checking in on his progress . he said crawford wo n't return to the ice until he 's `` 100 percent , '' and he 's just not there yet . `` getting back on the ice , it 's not a big deal right now , '' waite said . `` we 're still six weeks away from camp . i think if he can get back on the ice a couple of weeks before camp that first week , maybe he 's going to be rusty , but that comes back real quick . ",
        "he 's working in the gym off ice , so he 's going to be ready . i 'm not worried about it . `` crawford did not seem at ease talking to reporters , choosing his words carefully . in addition to declining to disclose his injury , he also declined to share what types of treatments he was getting . `` it has n't been easy , '' he said . `` but i 'll be back . '' "
