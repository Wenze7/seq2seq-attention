        "scientists last month deployed two new buoys in lake michigan that have begun recording and publishing lake conditions in real-time -- for the first time -- near a north suburban harbor and buoys , placed about a mile offshore waukegan harbor and winthrop harbor 's north point marina , are taking a variety of measurements , including wind speed , surface current , wave height and water temperatures , giving scientists and the public the first look at conditions at either location . equipped with webcams , the buoys will also transmit a photo and a short video clip each hour during the hope the data from the nearshore buoys , which are curated by illinois-indiana sea grant and great lakes observing system , will help them better understand coastal erosion along the northern illinois army corps of engineers and state scientists have also been intensively studying how sand moves along the shoreline , a process that is correlated with winds and the current . ",
        "historically , sand has drifted south along the lake michigan shoreline and accumulated in the present-day indiana dunes . however , coastal development , namely harbors and marinas , have disrupted this natural process and caused unprecedented erosion in some areas . ",
        "`` nearshore waves and currents are a primary driver of shoreline erosion and accretion , thus it is critical that we have high-resolution measurements of these processes that we can compare to the other data we are collecting along the shoreline and in the nearshore , '' state coastal geologist ethan theuerkauf said in an the buoys were funded by a grant to research this issue , they will also provide observations that will be helpful to boaters , beachgoers and fishermen who head to north point marina -- the largest marina in the great lakes -- and waukegan harbor , the only commercial harbor between milwaukee and these buoys were positioned , there were no real-time observations in these locations .",
        "boaters could use estimates of lake conditions in areas based on a computer model provided by the national oceanic atmospheric administration . there were some land-based webcams and weather stations . some ships share reports of lake conditions in real-time on their routes across lake michigan , providing perhaps the most reliable measurements , albeit only during a brief window . `` you can kind of get a feel for the wind if you see a wind sock or something blowing , '' ed verhamme , project engineer with limnotech , an environmental engineering and science consulting firm , who designed the buoys . ",
        "`` you ca n't get a feel for if it 's choppy or which way are the waves coming from . fisherman who are hard-core , they have an intuition for the waves . but most people , they got off work at 5 . they want to run out to their boats before the sun sets . so , just checking the conditions is so , so useful . `` however , even with the installation of the new buoys , some boaters have complained they would 've liked for the buoys to be placed farther out . because the buoys are located closer to shore , these shallower waters might be more sheltered from westerly winds and would n't be indicative of how rough the water is farther buoys have long been in place in deep water for the benefit of commercial shipping . ",
        "a noaa buoy moored at the center of southern lake michigan , 43 miles east of milwaukee , has been in operation since 1981 . in recent years , it has reported the highest wave heights since its of the five highest waves recorded by the mid-lake buoy have occurred since 2011 . most recently , during the halloween 2014 storm , 59 mph winds whipped up a wave , tied for the second highest recorded by the buoy . the tallest wave reported by that buoy was feet on sept. . 30 , 2011 when the midwest was rocked by a strong storm new buoys will join a growing network of floating weather monitors across the great lakes placed closer to the shore and yielding their own interesting chicago park district have six buoys that record water temperature , water depth , and waves . ",
        "but the data are largely used for forecasting water quality concerns for beach designed three buoys for northern michigan university that were placed in lake superior between 2015 and 2016 . one of them , positioned near marquette , mich. , recorded a nearly 29-foot wave in october , the highest ever recorded for any of the great nearshore buoys could be spared from tall waves when winds are blowing toward deeper waters , verhamme said waves recorded by midlake buoys could be even taller closer to shore if winds are blowing inland . the new lake michigan buoys are expected to remain out on the lake from april to november in hopes of recording conditions during powerful fall storms . ",
        "`` these could measure larger waves than ever before , '' verhamme new north suburban buoys were custom-made by limnotech and are the `` smartest , smallest '' buoys on lake michigan , verhamme said . they are equipped with a cellular modem to transmit data real-time . the solar-powered devices also feature webcams similar to the security cameras installed in atms . and perhaps their most notable feature is that they only weigh about 300 pounds , whereas the chicago park district buoys weigh about 600 pounds and the noaa 's midlake buoy weighs roughly 2,000 pounds . `` these two are the smallest , most efficient for their size , '' verhamme winthrop harbor and waukegan buoys were funded by a grant from noaa awarded to the illinois state geological survey at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign and the illinois department of natural resources coastal management public can access the buoy data and current observations online or they can text the buoy 's assigned number to 734-201-0750 to get the latest measurements .
