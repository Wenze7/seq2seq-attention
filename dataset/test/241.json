        "as the stock market claws its way back toward the january peak , inflationary pressures and subtle market divergences continue to mount . the federal reserve is walking a tight rope between too much and too little restraint , and the inflationary backdrop depicted in this issue shows how precarious that balancing act may turn out to be . if underlying pressures in the form of manufacturing costs and wage increases continue to rise , the fed 's strategy of `` gradualism '' in interest rate increases could go by the wayside . another risk that will surely blindside investors when the final market turning point comes is the excessive concentration of assets and recent gains in large-cap growth stocks , courtesy of today 's indexing phenomenon . ",
        "although the advance-decline line continues to hit new highs , indicating that a broad number of stocks are participating in this recovery , investors are concentrating on the large-cap favorites , driving them further into momentum territory . yet , these high-growth stocks -- like netflix , facebook , and amazon -- are clearly priced on lofty expectations , and history tells us that the current momentum-driven leadership wo n't last . ultimately , value stocks will come back into vogue , and perhaps sooner than anyone thinks . as warren buffett stated back in the heady days of the 1990s tech bubble back in november 1999 , `` the fact is that markets behave in ways , sometimes for a very long stretch , that are not linked to value . ",
        "sooner or later , though , value counts . '' and he was right . while technology stocks and large-cap growth funds dominated the landscape during the late 1990s , the tables turned abruptly in march 2000 . over the next 31 months , the s&p 500 growth index lost half its value , dropping % - nearly twice the decline in the value index . although value holdings wo n't come through a severe bear market unscathed , it 's a historical fact that momentum stocks , which typically lead prior to market peaks , will be among the first and the hardest hit when the music finally stops . ",
        "consequently , with this bull market likely in its ninth year , this is not the time to reach for excess profits , particularly with companies where growth projections rely on a booming economy . it 's fine to have growth-oriented sectors in the portfolio , but they should be kept to less than market-weighting and be balanced with a healthy allocation to defensive sectors . most importantly , the overall portfolio allocation to the stock market should be in line with the current risks , with an emphasis on traditional late-stage and less cyclical sectors . over my decades of investing experience , i have found that every bull market has `` a hook '' that keeps even the most intelligent and diligent investors fully committed and invested at the top . ",
        "in 1972 it was the `` one-decision '' nifty fifty stocks that you could buy and hold forever . in the tech bubble of the 1990s , it was the almost universal belief that `` this time is different '' in that valuations did n't matter . and at the last market top in 2007 , bullish market pundits clung to the fact that the federal reserve had already made their first interest rate cut before the market peaked , and that a bear market had never started when interest rates were falling . after listening to charles schwab 's top domestic and international strategists at a recent schwab conference for principals of money management firms , we may have found the hook that traps even the brightest minds this time around . ",
        "the dangerous relationship between a flattening yield curve and a probable bear market has become widely known on wall street . in fact , it has all the top analysts watching for the inevitable inversion of the 10-year t-bond yield minus the 3-month t-bill rate that would confirm the next bear market and recession . theoretically , we would have to see this yield spread turn negative before the next bear market or recession . at least that is what everyone on wall street believes . as devoted market historians , we have to question whether this misplaced confidence could turn out to be the ultimate hook in this current bull market . ",
        "if so , there are going to be a lot of very perplexed and frustrated analysts , money managers , and investors on the bear market ride down ! by : jim stack , money managers and editor of investech research . via moneyshow . "
