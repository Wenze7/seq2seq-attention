        "last season provided a number of nfl landmarks that remind us why the game is so popular . new orleans quarterback drew brees recorded the highest completion percentage for a single season . buffalo 's stephen hauschka connected on his 13th consecutive field goal of 50 yards or more , which had never been done before . at 40 , tom brady became the oldest man ever named most valuable record , however , was a reminder of the serious challenges to the popularity and long-term viability of professional football . in the 2017 season , 291 concussions were diagnosed -- affecting one out of every 11 players . ",
        "in other words , of the 22 players you see trot out onto the field for the first play from scrimmage , you can expect that two of them wo n't finish the season without an acute traumatic injury to the the offseason , the nfl acted to reduce this alarming risk . its new rule is simple and stark . any player who `` lowers his head to initiate and make contact with his helmet against an opponent '' will be flagged for unnecessary roughness at a cost of 15 yards . for severe violations , players will be is stricter than college football 's targeting rule , which bans any hit to a defenseless player 's head or neck and typically involves a receiver leveled by a defensive back . ",
        "and the nfl ban applies to offensive as well as defensive players , including rule is at issue in the contract negotiations between the bears and their first-round draft pick , linebacker roquan smith . he has held out demanding a provision that if he is suspended for violating the rule , the team wo n't take back some of his guaranteed pay . he fears he will have trouble adapting his aggressive style to fit the new rule . the bears have refused , and with good reason : it makes no sense to protect a player from the consequences of making illegal lot of grumbling has been heard from players about how the league is changing the game , forcing them to unlearn techniques that have long been standard . ",
        "what they and smith should appreciate is that the reform is for their health and safety . of the concussions last season , the nfl determined , 57 came on plays that would have drawn a flag under the new change addresses just one part of a broader malady : the epidemic of chronic traumatic encephalopathy among former professional players . dr. ann mckee , a neuropathologist at boston university 's medical school , reported last year that she had examined the brains of 111 deceased nfl veterans -- 110 of them had cte . preventing concussions would be helpful , though the ordinary blows to the head that football entails are believed to be enough to cause this debilitating and incurable human consequences of cte -- memory loss , depression , dementia and more -- are enormous . ",
        "even the nfl 's financial health is at risk . it entered a settlement that obligates it to compensate hundreds of former players , with the total amount expected to surpass $ 1 billion . the league is under intense pressure to find ways to minimize the risk to its implementation of this rule may be messy . expect the preseason to feature a lot of confusion and a lot of yellow laundry on the turf . expect a lot of griping from people accusing the nfl of becoming a refuge for the game has undergone many changes to make it safer , and the need for this one is hard to deny . ",
        "barring a retreat by the nfl , players will have to stop using their helmets as weapons . atlanta falcons ceo rich mckay , head of the competition committee , emphasized the need `` to teach it out of the game '' and `` get it out of the game . `` that achievement will protect not only those being blocked and tackled but those who do the blocking and tackling -- roquan smith included . like others , he will need to adapt . facing the possibility of swift , stern penalties , we 're confident he 'll learn to operate under the new important reform creates a certain amount of disruption and discontent . ",
        "in the end , though , professional football will be safer than before . "
