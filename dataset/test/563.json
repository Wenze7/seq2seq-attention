        "when the tech museum of innovation opened its hackworth imax dome theater in 1998 , it was the first of its kind on the west coast . now , the four-story theater with a wraparound screen is getting ready to blaze a new 280-seat , downtown san jose theater has been closed since the beginning of july to undergo a $ million , four-month renovation that will replace its giant 70mm-film projector with a state-of-the art 4k laser projection system . the tech will have the first imax dome in the world to use the new technology . `` it 's going to be different , but it 's also going to be better , '' said michelle duncan , the tech 's director of imax theater operations . ",
        "the theater is scheduled to be used during the tech for global good program in november before re-opening to the general public with `` oceans : our blue planet , '' a new documentary narrated by `` titanic '' star kate new projection will provide a sharper picture and deeper colors than the old system , and that meant replacing the theater 's screen -- made up of 469 individual coated aluminum panels -- with a new one . this time the panels will be installed in a way that the seams and rivets holding them together do n't says she knows some people will miss those seams in the same way they feel affection for a dent in the family car or a popping noise on a favorite lp . ",
        "`` i 'm sure people will feel that for a moment , but we hope they 're just blown away by the image after that like in the old memorex commercial , '' she said . `` it 'll pull you into the environment that much faster . `` the improvements have actually been on the drawing board at the tech for years , but they had to wait for the technology to catch up , especially with the challenges a dome theater presents compared to a flat screen . imax had to re-engineer its regular dual-laser projection system to a single laser and developed a high-resolution `` fish eye '' lens and image-processing software for the dome 's geometry . ",
        "`` it really is awesome because we 've updated everything , '' said brian bonnick , chief technology officer and executive vice president for imax . `` we 've created a radically different projector that does n't have the limitations of other systems . it produces brighter and sharper images with substantially higher contrasts . the images are much more in line with what the human eye was designed to see . `` to create that sharper image on the screen , a lot of chaos and change has to happen behind the scenes . films used to be brought in on massive reels that were placed on platters before being threaded through the 2,000-pound projector , which had to be lifted up by an elevator to the oblong projection booth -- called `` the doghouse '' -- that jutted between seats in the theater . ",
        "the film soundtrack was handled separately , synced up with the image and carefully monitored by a technician using a special 's going to be all gone . the reel platters have been removed , and the digital projector -- which weighs 3,000 pounds -- wo n't need to be lowered except for maintenance , and the soundtrack comes as part of the digital package and will be pumped into the new , six-channel sound said the new format will open up a new range of possibilities for programming since more and more imax movies are being released digitally and not on film . ",
        "ironically , though , it also means the tech will lose some perennially popular movies , including `` everest , '' the breathtaking macgillivray freeman documentary that both opened the theater in 1998 and was the last movie shown in june . '' ` everest ' has never been rendered digitally , so we wo n't have access to that , '' duncan said . `` and others , like ` lewis & clark ' and ` forces of nature ' are not available in a high-enough digital capacity to run and look good . `` unlike the metreon in san francisco , which has the capability to run imax programming both digitally and on 70 mm film , there was just no room at the tech for two projectors . ",
        "that means special 70 mm film presentations like `` dunkirk '' or the upcoming re-release of `` the dark knight '' would have to pass san jose a fan of film and the projection system she 's worked with for so long , duncan says it was very emotional letting go . she took pictures as the last two film prints were shipped off , and she began to tear up as she introduced the very last film that would be run on the old projector . `` it 's like your child is leaving home , '' she said . ",
        "`` it 's the end of one era , and the beginning of a new one . `` but if there 's a silver-screen lining to the dark cloud , it 's that the tech museum 's imax projector will not be going to the trash heap . just as the tech was getting ready to say goodbye to film last month , huge storms battered des moines , iowa , causing the roof to leak in the iowa science center 's imax theater . its projection equipment and all its movies were ruined , and the theater is closed for repair . ",
        "`` all of our parts are packed up in our lobby with address labels ready to get that theater back up and running , '' duncan said . `` i 'm happy that projector 156 can breathe life back into that theater . '' "
