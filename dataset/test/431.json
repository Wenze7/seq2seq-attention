        "after the chicago bears first week of training camp , the team has released their first unofficial depth chart . are there any depth chart surprises ? per the chicago bears team website , here is how the first unofficial depth chart shakes and daniel at the top are no surprise here . both backups to trubisky have experience playing in this offense and both can provide insight to trubisky . whether head coach matt nagy activates three quarterbacks on game days remains to be and cohen may be the best running back duo in the nfl . behind them , there is a lot of competition . ",
        "both mizzell and cunningham have special teams experience . however , mizzell has the speed and agility to be very valuable like cohen in nagy 's offense . meanwhile cunningham , serves as more of a jordan howard type of is one of the worst fullbacks i have ever seen . at times , he appears to shy away from contact , which defeats the entire purpose of the position . i would like to see nall , who is almost 240 pounds , be the fullback . he could give you some emergency production at running back , while playing full back on occasion . ",
        "is nall willing to make contact at the fullback position ? i have no idea , but what i do know is that he 's an undrafted guy that plays with heart . i 'd think he 'd do whatever he could to help the team . "
