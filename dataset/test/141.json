        "homeownership is one of the primary ways americans accumulate wealth with buyers building equity as the home 's property value increases , yet a recent study shows black homeownership rates in chicago have dropped to levels not seen since the 1960s . and even years after the fair housing act passed , memories of housing discrimination of these issues are present in arlen parsa 's latest documentary , `` blueprint for bronzeville , '' a selection of the black harvest film festival that will air on wttw-ch . 11 thursday . parsa takes viewers back to the origins of that south side neighborhood in light of the city 's aspirations to host the 2016 olympics . ",
        "chicago lost its bid for the olympics in 2009 , but when it was still in the running , the city wanted to put a stadium in bronzeville 's washington park . the plans were supposed to bring economic development to the area , but bronzeville residents also wanted to see the city-owned vacant lots in their area taken care of before gentrification took place . a group of bronzeville residents fed up with the number of vacant lots in the community wants to remedy the situation by making sure potential developers build affordable housing on a fraction of empty lots . ",
        "according to the film , politicians and city administrators did n't address the issue until the olympics were a possibility , but the community organization housing bronzeville drew the line in the sand . the documentary follows residents ' journey against the backdrop of the city 's history of racial segregation and ongoing fight for talked to parsa prior to the broadcast premiere as the south side is dealing with concerns about the obama center . this conversation has been edited for space and : why this film now ? was it part of the plan to come out amid the decision-making around the obama center ? ",
        "a : it 's certainly a topic that 's on people 's minds . we 've held screenings of this film in different neighborhoods around the city , and in certain neighborhoods people are asking the question , `` well what about displacement over the library ? '' anything that comes into a neighborhood that 's been ignored historically could be a double-edged sword . people are asking the very same types of questions with the olympics as they are the library , and i also heard the same questions about `` what if amazon comes here ? '' i do n't know what 's going to happen , but i think a lot of people are looking at it cautiously and : how did you choose the project ? ",
        "a : this was sort of a passion project that started off as a school project many years ago at columbia college . my co-producer tristan hanson and i were looking for a film to make about gentrification in chicago , and we became fascinated with the bronzeville neighborhood because at the time , there was a lot of talk about maybe this neighborhood could gentrify because they could put a lot of olympic infrastructure in there , and there was concern that people might get displaced , historic residents might be priced out of the neighborhood . so we decided to go down , and we met with a bunch of different community groups and activists , and we fell in love with this group housing bronzeville because they were charming , they had had a couple successful referendums and they seemed like they were n't shy about speaking the truth for fear of getting their funding cut off . ",
        "we were fascinated and kind of jumped in : as an outsider looking in , what is your reaction to the city 's segregation ? a : i 'm from new hampshire , and my fellow filmmaker is from the west coast . we met in chicago and we started asking questions like : `` why is this city still so segregated in some places , and what 's the history behind that ? '' we started asking questions that led to some uncomfortable truths . it 's easy for somebody like me to think in the north , we did n't have segregation , we did n't have some of these problems . ",
        "it 's very easy to forget some of this history that is in many ways tragic and still impacts the shape of our city today . so learning about some of this history and really taking a deep dive really opens your eyes about the way neighborhoods are shaped today . it 's a tragic history and one that 's uncomfortable to talk about and think about , but i think it 's important history and to me as an outsider , it was a privilege to come in and gain trust with the local community residents and hear their stories from the ground level . ",
        "bronzeville is a neighborhood that has had lots of other people decide what 's going to be best for it from the top down , so we wanted to give this neighborhood a voice that in some ways has been : you left viewers on a good note with the documentary , but what 's transpired since then ? a : they have been working with a developer and an architect , but the financing piece of the puzzle is the piece that is missing . however , in the past couple of weeks , the city announced this pilot program to provide vacant city-owned lots for new , affordable homes for people within a certain income range that would be subsidized . ",
        "it 's almost what this group wants , the only problem is bronzeville is not included in the six neighborhoods that they 're doing this in . it 's extraordinarily frustrating for the group because they want this , and they 've come up with this plan and it 's getting implemented , but just in other neighborhoods . `` blueprint for bronzeville '' airs 10 thursday on .
