        "oakland -- it 's the same rotation that has helped the a 's to a 64-46 record , virtually tied with the seattle mariners for the second american league wild-card spot heading into thursday . but it 's also the same rotation that ranks 22nd in the majors with a era . perhaps more concerning is that sean manaea is really the only starter who can be counted on to go somewhat deep into a game . the last time a starter other than manaea completed seven innings was june 9 when chris bassitt did it against the kansas city a 's have been able to overcome a rotation that has seen 12 pitchers make a start with great hitting and a lights-out bullpen , but it 's clear that the starters will need to pick it up . ",
        "so of course , most of the questions in this mailbag were focused on that glaring weakness . @moneyballworks : do you expect that we 'll target a starting pitcher in august or just call up mengden/naile/internal guys ? martin gallegos : i fully expect david forst and billy beane to be keeping a close eye on the waiver wire for all pitchers , and even position players , looking to add a spark in these final two months . matt harvey is the `` big name '' pitcher expected to be moved in august , though i already have heard the front office is not a fan of bringing in the former mets ace . ",
        "sonny gray might also get moved , but i do n't believe the a 's want to go down that road again either , at least not this starters who i think could be had are twins pitcher ervin santana , a 2017 all-star who is just returning from injury , and white sox pitcher james shields . neither represent a huge boost , ala justin verlander with houston last year , but both can give you innings , which the a 's will need down the stretch with a bullpen that is already likely scenario ? the a 's stick with what they have in the rotation , with daniel mengden and bassitt available in the minors as reinforcement . ",
        "@johnknepper : if the season ended today and we made the wild-card playoff against the yankees . is sean manaea the starter or someone else on the rotation who has postseason experience ? gallegos : this is a tricky one . if manaea is available , he would be a lock to start that game . but there 's a chance manaea is pitching in those few days before that game in order to help the a 's clinch that wild-card spot . if manaea ca n't go , i think 2011 world series winner edwin jackson is the best bet . ",
        "trevor cahill also is an option , but his poor numbers on the road would be a concern . @jimmerdmc : currently , jed and marcus have the middle infield locked up . if i remember correctly , barreto experimented with center field in triple a for a bit . any thoughts on potentially using him there in the majors this season ? he looks to have the potential of a really solid : the a 's briefly revisited this in april when the team was in los angeles for a two-game series against the dodgers . barreto was working in the outfield pregame both days , but nothing ever came of it . ",
        "perhaps the club could again try him there in the spring , but i do n't see him getting any playing time there in the majors this season . @bubbatyuos45 has martini taken over joyce 's spot for good ? gallegos : martini is looking like the best leadoff hitter the a 's have had all season for his ability to get on base and tremendous bat control , though it is a small sample size . he 's probably going to continue as the starter until he falters , and who knows if joyce will recover from his back issues any time soon . ",
        "if joyce is healthy , i think his veteran presence has a spot on this team . @realtorbb : any truth to the rumor that the a 's triple-a team is moving back west to replace the team that is leaving las vegas ? makes a lot of sense to have a pcl team out west and closer to : not the first time i have heard this . the a 's four-year player development contract with nashville is done after this season , and i would think the club would love to find an affiliate closer to home . ",
        "whether it 's vegas or somewhere else , i think the a 's triple-a club leaves nashville . @thisisjinwoo : what will the pitching staff look like for the stretch run in september ? what options are likely for the a 's for trades with waiver trades ? gallegos : sean manaea , edwin jackson , trevor cahill , brett anderson and frankie montas are the current starting five . other than daniel mengden overtaking anderson 's spot , i do n't see much changing for september . forst pretty much shot down the idea of calling up super prospect jesus luzardo , and the only options i see as far as trades are the names i mentioned a few questions ago .
