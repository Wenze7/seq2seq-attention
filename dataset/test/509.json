        "espn just released their list of top-20 remaining free agents so we understandably ponder , `` do any fit the needs of our beloved cowboys ? '' just because training camp has begun does n't mean it 's all sunshine and rainbows in cowboys country . dallas came into this preseason with plenty of question marks . and many of those question marks remain unanswered after the first few days of question marks are understandable the first week of training camp , they ca n't be taken for granted . because the longer dallas tests the waters with their own players , the more likely these options remaining on the market will dry the question at hand is do any of these top remaining free agents fit the needs of the cowboys this season . ",
        "the answer seems to be , `` yes '' . who fits the cowboysrather than recite the list , let 's point out dallas ' needs and who espn listed as available options . after all , the list itself is espn 's so let 's let them have the honors of the complete dallas cowboys have needs at a few places , primarily at defensive tackle , free safety , and tight end . lucky for them a couple of those fellas are available right now ... with the loss of david irving for the foreseeable future the cowboys are thin in the starter maliek collins recovering from injury only further exasperates the problems at dt . ",
        "so with such little depth on the roster , why is dallas completely ignoring proven options like hankins ? while they have n't said anything it 's become glaringly obvious they have all but eliminated the traditional 1-tech roadblock from their defensive scheme . more on that here : while hankins is undeniably good , he 's not what dallas is looking for in an interior dallas cowboys are in need of a safety with some coverage ability . it 's been my contention tre boston , who signed a cheap deal late in free agency with arizona , was the best bang for the buck -- dallas thought leaves reid as the best available option . ",
        "unfortunately , he appears to be unofficially blackballed from the nfl and does n't seem to be an option for `` america 's team '' . other than reid , there remains ward , mike mitchell , and kenny vaccaro on the free agent scrap heap . the only problem with them is they 're better fits as in-the-box strong safety than a centerfielding free jason witten and james hanna retired , dallas a clear need at te . no matter how highly they think of geoff swaim , blake jarwin , or dalton schultz , the cowboys are clearly gambling on the gates and julius thomas are two proven options . ",
        "both are over-the-hill and without much upside , but both provide insurance in case dallas ' undeveloped options dry ' t hold your breath on any of these options because the dallas cowboys seem determined to make their own players work out . scheme changes are a big factor as dallas looks to phase out the need for 1-tech dts and extra defensive backs . tight end is the real wildcard here but even there it appears the cowboys are intent on changing the role of the dallas good news -- free agents are still available . the boring news is -- the cowboys do n't seem very interested .
