        "in this analytically changing world of baseball , cubs manager joe maddon maintains the components of playing exceptional defense and displaying astute baserunning still matter when considering a most valuable player hopes javier baez 's overall skills will weigh more heavily on the minds of national league mvp voters than his . 329 on-base percentage and 16 walks , which pale in comparison with other candidates whose numbers are more statistically pleasing . `` there have been a number of anomaly players that are able to put the fat part of the bat on the ball , even when it might not be within the parameters , '' maddon said . ",
        "`` that 's an easy discussion . it 's part of the times we live in . i do n't think anyone wants to believe somebody who does n't have at least 50 higher than his batting average should be worthy of an mvp . `` but look at what he 's doing . it gets very weird , watered down too much for me sometimes . it 's just a batting average being worthy of an mvp . back in the day , some relievers won cy young , and they pitched once in a while and threw not nearly the number of innings that a starter pitched . ",
        "i just think that 's the moment we live in now , where it would n't have been as big of an issue 20 years ago . `` unfortunately for baez and the cubs , his supporting cast has struggled recently . they mustered only three hits thursday night in losing 6-1 to the padres at wrigley almora jr. . is in a 1-for-20 rut , and anthony rizzo was 0-for-11 before collecting an infield hit in the eighth . `` we have n't been overly sharp with the bat on any kind of consistent basis , '' maddon 's streak of getting at least one extra-base hit and driving in at least one run ended with an 0-for-4 mike montgomery was pulled with a 1-0 lead after walking eric hosmer with one out in the sixth .

        "newcomer jesse chavez , who had not allowed a run in his first six games with the cubs , surrendered a three-run homer to austin hedges . `` i wanted to go farther , '' montgomery said after throwing 79 pitches . `` that 's not up to me . that 's how the game works . so i 'm fine with the decisions makes . `` said maddon : '' was n't overly sharp but got out of jams . `` meanwhile , left-handers justin wilson and brian duensing failed to keep the game close , fueling the expectation that carl edwards jr. .

        "and brandon kintzler could be used more often against left-handed hitters in high leverage the three mvp candidates mentioned most frequently -- braves first baseman freddie freeman , rockies third baseman nolan arenado and baez -- freeman has the highest batting average and on-base percentage and is second to arenado with 54 trails both with a . 296 batting average , but he leads the nl with 83 rbis and is second to arenado with 224 total bases . in addition to playing gold glove-caliber defense at second base , baez has filled in capably at third in place of injured kris bryant and at shortstop when addison russell was nagged by leg soreness and an irritated knuckle .

        "`` he 's playing with so much confidence right now , the point i want to make is just do n't evaluate based on batting average as being an mvp-worthy number , '' maddon said . "
