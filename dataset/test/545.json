        "is the end near for moviepass , the popular subscription movie-going service with more than 3 million subscribers ? moviepass experienced `` technical difficulties '' that prevented many subscribers from using the service thursday , with its twitter account saying it was related to its `` card-based check-in process . `` but the real reason for the technical difficulties ? moviepass ran out of money to buy tickets , according to an sec filing its parent company made on parent company , helios and matheson , then borrowed $ million -- $ 5 million of which was cash -- from hudson bay capital management in order to restore its service . ",
        "the $ 5 million cash was used to `` pay the company 's merchant and fulfillment processors , '' the sec filing said -- in other words , to buy the movie tickets subscribers order on the app . `` if the company is unable to make required payments to its merchant and fulfillment processors , the merchant and fulfillment processors may cease processing payments for moviepass , inc. . , which would cause a moviepass service interruption , '' wrote helios and matheson ceo ted farnsworth in the sec filing . `` such a service interruption occurred on july 26 , 2018 . ",
        "such service interruptions could have a material adverse effect on moviepass ' ability to retain its subscribers . `` helios and matheson issued a statement on friday afternoon about the technical difficulties -- but did not address the loan or the cash shortage : `` we apologize for the inconvenience caused by a temporary outage in our app over the past day , '' said helios and matheson . `` we have handled the issues on the back-end , and our app is now up-and-running with stability at 100 % . we thank our members and our community for their patience and ongoing support , and we appreciate their commitment to our vision as we revolutionize the movie industry . ",
        "we 've also posted a letter to subscribers on our social media channels and in our app communicating adjustments to the service and our plans for the future . `` the company 's financial difficulties come as no surprise to many who have watched its business . its three million subscribers pay a fixed amount per month -- currently the price is $ -- in exchange for tickets to an unlimited number of movies . it does n't take too many movie outings per user before moviepass is losing money on a subscription . still , the popularity of the service has rocked the movie theater industry , and many chains are offering their own subscription services , although none is as good a deal as of helios and matheson 's loan sent its stock price spiraling down friday . ",
        "when friday 's trading closed , helios and matheson 's share price was at $ -- more than 70 percent lower than when it wednesday , helios and matheson completed a reverse stock split -- a move in which multiple shares are coalesced into a smaller number of shares -- to avoid being delisted from the stock exchange . on tuesday 's closing , helios and matheson 's shares were at cents ; the nasdaq stock exchange sometimes removes company shares from its exchange if they are below the $ 1 threshold for more than a the reverse stock split , where every 250 shares in the company became one single share , helios and matheson 's new share price would have been around $ 21 . ",
        "however , when wednesday 's trading began , helios and matheson shares immediately lost a third of its value , starting at $ two days since the reverse stock split , helios and matheson share prices have dropped 86 percent . "
