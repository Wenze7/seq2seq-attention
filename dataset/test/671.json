        "danbury -- residents can now buy recycled paint for the first time in connecticut -- but they 'll have to travel to danbury to get it . the new paint is created by mxi environmental services using paint collected in connecticut . the habitat for humanity restore in danbury is currently the only place where the paint can be purchased in the state . `` these are the types of stewardship programs we need more of and connecticut has been a leader of that , '' said rob klee , commissioner of the state department of energy and environmental protection . ",
        "the recycled paint stems from a law that was passed in 2011 and established a paint stewardship program two years later . under that program , 72 cents was added to every gallon of paint sold that then allowed unwanted and leftover paint to be recycled for free at 146 collection points across the state . most of these sites are at paint and hardware stores . paint is also collected at local household hazardous waste events . that 's where the paint mxi environmental services , the contracted household hazardous waste vendor for western connecticut , collected its paint for the new product . ",
        "nearly 17,000 gallons of paint were collected at household hazardous waste events the housatonic resources recovery authority held last year , said jennifer heaton-jones , the authority 's executive director . the authority covers 11 towns in the danbury area . she credited state sen. craig miner for his work in helping the first legislation pass . miner also unsuccessfully introduced a bill that would require paint sold in connecticut be made with recycled product . `` my thought was when i bring a can to be recycled , i hope it can return in some fashion that we can reuse , '' said miner , whose district includes new milford and kent . ",
        "`` until now , that was only a thought . '' mxi , which is based in virginia , collects the paint and separates it by color and base . it is then re-blended and made into the new paint . the wall paint , full circle , is made of 99 percent recycled material and old man potter , the furniture chalk paint , is made of more than 95 percent recycled material . so far , the company has a gray and a tan option available for wall paint because that is the highest volume of paint collected . ",
        "it also has three colors for the furniture chalk paint . more colors are expected for both , said craig potter , mxi 's vice president . potter said he likes how the furniture paint can be used to help reuse other items , such as furniture . he had an end table he picked up on the side of the road that he re-painted and distressed on display . `` old man potter is n't only recycled itself , but it can take something most people consider junk and turn it into a shabby chic item , '' he said . ",
        "so far , the mxi paint is only sold stateside in connecticut and raleigh , they have 1,000 gallons of each color already prepared . this recycled paint is seen as a necessary way to close the recycling loop , by reusing materials and not have to take them out of the ground to make more paint . `` this is very important , '' heaton-jones said . several officials applauded the partnership with habitat for humanity , which focuses on reusing materials as well , at an event held friday to unveil the product . john gonski , a member of the housatonic habitat for humanity board of directors , said the sale of the paint at the store will help fund its building projects , its brush with kindness program and administrative costs . ",
        "klee said he would like to see the sale of recycled paint expand and saw the partnership with habitat for humanity as a possible way to do that . he said both programs ' missions are similar . every little thing people do to help the planet adds up , whether it 's recycling , composting or using electric vehicles , he added . `` the decisions we 're making now and the things we 're doing for the planet now have that inter-generational impact , '' he said .
