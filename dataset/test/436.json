        "in its greatest moments , the chicago theater has invented entirely new forms of creative 1955 , for example , david shepherd created a comedy-cabaret group called the compass players . shepherd wanted to be as artistically reactive as possible to societal change . he ended up parenting what is now known as the early 1990s , lookingglass theatre created a very distinct visual aesthetic for its ensemble-driven shows ; a crucial addition to a midwestern theater scene that mostly had been trapped in domestic if you lived in chicago in the 2000s , before redmoon theater flamed out , you 'll recall that company being almost impossible to describe to someone who never had seen their work . ",
        "it was that distinctive -- spectacle-oriented but not quite circus , homemade but hipster-friendly , kid-simple but not , story-based but never fully comfortable with narrative brings me to manual cinema , which has a very cool show right now at the chopin theatre , `` the end of tv . '' it 's a very tough cinema also feels like a completely fresh direction -- the company hand-makes a movie right before your eyes , combining live actors in front of a green screen with cutaway images , music and puppetry . you watch the film , and you watch it being made . ",
        "that 's the is very stimulating , which is a good thing in our present moment , when i sometimes think that most theater does not offer enough stimulation of the senses , especially for a generation z audience now used to watching several screens at a time . how will live performance compete with that ? at `` the end of tv '' , if you get bored with the story , you can turn your attention to how the story is being i watched the show the other night , it felt to me that manual cinema was really on to something important : the need not only for audiences to find lots of different ways into a show but also for transparency of manufacture . ",
        "`` the end of tv '' is the perfect piece of theater for people who spend a lot of their time listening to podcasts . it actually feels like a podcast -- except there is somewhere for your eyes to theater has been very slow to understand this seismic change in how we consume the arts : most companies still conceal their backstage areas from the public , as if any revelation thereof will spoil the illusion . you 're only supposed to watch what the artists want you to watch . this has been the theater 's historic role for at least 200 years , of course , but it 's showing its age . ",
        "these days , people like to be involved in their own curation , they do not necessarily want to consume their culture at the whim of an artistic director other than the marriott theatre last weekend , i watched something go wrong in a show called `` murder for two , '' and what the actors did to cover up the technical glitch was far more entertaining than the show itself . for it was the most cinema has been around since 2010 , when it was founded by drew dir , sarah fornace , ben kauffman , julia miller and kyle vegter . ",
        "i have reviewed its work before -- the show prior to `` the end of tv '' was `` the magic city '' at chicago children 's theatre . there has also been several collaborations with such groups as hubbard street if you really look at how much manual cinema has produced , you realize that there really has not been all that many pieces . that 's because they are fiendishly time-consuming and complex to create . they are not built and rehearsed in a month . the other thing that has happened to the company is that the word is very much out about its work -- manual cinema now is spending most of its time touring to other markets . ",
        "most chicagoans have never heard its 'd also add that manual cinema , unlike many of its peers , has never engaged in much the company , which has affiliated itself with the university of chicago at various points , is an obvious candidate for civic spectacles of a distinctive kind -- it could be the natural successor to it wants to work certainly is ideal for kids , especially since manual cinema encourages you to come backstage after the show and see how the images are `` the end of tv '' is very much an adult show , given its inherent sadness and thematic complexity .",
        "moreover , you can appreciate manual cinema without understanding the english language ; this is not work dependent on words , but on the building of images and the expression of poignant and profound ideas about how we build and then mess up our great the lives of the people who inhabit them .
