        "granit xhaka holds a unique skillset not always akin to his defensive midfield position , how unai emery therefore structures a midfield to accommodate his strengths and hide his weaknesses will be key to arsenal 's success this things stand , granit xhaka will go down as one of the most divisive arsenal players of his generation . it is rare to find a player who is so highly rated by some sections of a support base and so disregarded by others . his core strength is in controlling the pace of a game from deep , utilising an exceptional passing range that affords him the luxury of either short passes to retain possession or longer passes to spring counter attacks and a more direct style of attack . ",
        "in the past players deployed as a ` pivot ' were nearly always constructed with a skillset that prioritised excellent defensive positioning , proficiency in the tackle and general ball recovery xhaka possesses the requisite aggression and reading of the game , he lacks the aforementioned basics of a true holding midfielder . the catch-22 is deploying him higher up , in a box-to-box or attacking capacity , diminishes his value as he struggles with the reduced space and time , most notably the requirement of quick feet . the only option is for him to be deployed from lucas torreira , arsenal have signed the required complimentary skillset for xhaka . ",
        "torreira is expert at ball retrieval and when combined with a defensive mind-set is perfect to offset xhaka 's weaknesses and provide much needed balance . he even adds the energy and pressing ability which are two further accusations around xhaka 's competency . on the face of it , deploying these two together , in deep-lying positions , as part of a 4-2-3-1 appears a well-rounded and well-constructed , this suggests that aaron ramsey would be deployed in a no . 10 role with ozil and mkhitaryan flanking him and arsenal 's full backs providing width . the issue with ramsey in such a role , as we saw in the 2013-2014 season , is that it does not lend itself to his strengths . ",
        "when you consider ramsey is about energy and running box-to-box combined with an uncanny knack of arriving late to take advantage of scoring opportunities , a number 10 role will not act as the catalyst for a high level of performance , you would never for example consider employing frank lampard in this type of most likely outcome is that arsenal will deploy a 4-3-3 with xhaka as the pivot , ramsey in his ideal box-to-box role and torreira in a symmetrical role with licence to hunt the ball higher up rather than waiting to intercept from deeper positions . ",
        "he certainly has the aggression and energy to perform such a role whilst he has the perfect role model in n'golo kante who has performed a higher and more proactive role previously , despite admittedly playing in an out-an-out holding role during the most recent world cup . the structure of xhaka , torreira and ramsey provides combativeness , energy and athleticism with a reliance on xhaka to dictate the game from deep , it will however add pressure on ozil and mkhitarian as the sole creative forces from wide . given this , one suspects we might require more creativity centrally throughout the season and in which case one of the trio will need be a lack of creativity within such a midfield structure , the obvious imbalance between defence and attack has been addressed with the signing of torreira , and will introduce a defensive efficiency that will not only elevate pressure but also offer more control over games . ",
        "our new look midfield , in conclusion , is a step in the right direction however not without questions that will need answering . "
