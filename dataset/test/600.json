        "outfit : jing unlimited dressjing unlimited heelsceline sunglasseschanel bagdoes it look like i 'm ready for spring ? i am looking forward to wearing light airy pieces . body con dresses have to be my favorite these days . i love how flattering they make your body look . my tip is always go for a longer dress when wearing a body con dress to avoid looking too promiscuous . this dress color from jing unlimited is everything . i do n't wear much color , but when i choose to , i always wear this fiery red . it goes extremely well with black for the ultimate contrast . ",
        "you really do n't need to do much with this dress , but you do have the option of layering a jacket on top . i kept this look super modern and edgy by pairing this sleek dress with sock heels also from jing unlimited . let me tell you ... these heels are amazing and surprisingly comfortable even though they do n't look like it . these heels are so flattering on and give the illusion your ankles are slimmer than they actually are . these heels are wearable with basically everything and i ca n't wait to create more looks with them . ",
        "this was a very cool outfit to wear out . "
