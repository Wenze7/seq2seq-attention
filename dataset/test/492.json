        "do n't give up on trading asia . between 2009 and 2018 , the value of annual dividends paid out by asian companies tripled , while payouts from the rest of the world doubled in value , according to a recent study . i believe asian stocks have more potential for long-term dividend growth than their counterparts for a number of reasons . despite the trade war rhetoric , earnings growth among asian companies has maintained the momentum that started in late 2016 , which reversed a three-year trend of deflation and earnings declines for many companies . asian companies have also weaned themselves from an over-reliance on debt , and today are less leveraged than those in the united states . ",
        "and of course , the broader asia growth story and rise of the consumer class is still alive and well . valuations among these companies are also far more attractive than they are in the , thanks to fund selling driving down the prices of most asian stocks . in other words , markets have already built huge earnings expectations into many stock prices and valuations are at historically high levels . by contrast , many asian stocks have already had the worst case trade war scenario built into them . if you are interested in capturing some of that dividend growth potential from asian stocks , there are several ways to do it . ",
        "my preference would be to buy a broad-based fund or etf that has a number of dividend-paying companies in the portfolio . the first is an old-fashioned , but effective , way . you can buy a mutual fund from a company whose sole focus is asia - the mathew asia dividend fund . its top holdings include well-known blue chips such as taiwan semiconductor and hsbc . but it also includes less well-known names to american investors including shenzhou international group holdings , which is the largest knitwear manufacturer in china and makes clothing for nike and others . ",
        "its stock soared an incredible 4,200 % over the past decade . the next way for you to access asian dividends is through exchange traded funds . there are several that focus on asian dividend payers , including the ishares asia/pacific dividend etf , the wisdomtree asia pacific ex-japan fund and the o'shares ftse asia pacific quality dividend etf . by : tony daltorio , editor of growth stock advisor . via moneyshow .
