        "minnesota wild fans are very familiar with jared spurgeon and his value to this team . preseason puck drop is 46 days away , so there is no better time to preview # spurgeon is entering his 9th season at the nhl level , as a defensive mainstay where he has spent the majority of the last couple seasons on the top defensive pairing alongside ryan suter . spurgeon has developed his game to be a consistent piece of the back 6 for the minnesota wild , providing a reliable 30 points per season over the last 3 seasons while taking minimal penalty minutes and being responsible defensively as well . ",
        "historyspurgeon followed up his 2016-17 career year with a very comparable 2017-18 for the minnesota wild . the major downfall to his game last season , was a drop in plus/minus . this drastic drop was not localized to spurgeon however , as a large number of wild players saw career high plus/minus stats from 2016-17 take a drastic fall last season . this is likely attributed to better overall team preparation of opposing teams following an outstanding spurgeon has provided a reliable and consistent offensive and defensive presence whenever he takes the ice , his biggest detraction has been overall durability . ",
        "jared has never played more than 77 games in a single regular season , and only twice has managed more than by injury or sickness , it has become an expected occurrence for spurgeon to miss at least a handful of games every season . these missed games disrupt team chemistry as well as spurgeon 's personal game consistency , as it takes both the team and himself time to adapt to periods away from the ice . season previewthis could be a very telling season for jared spurgeon and his future with the minnesota wild . as an undersized player with durability concerns on a team with an increasing amount of defensive prospect depth , spurgeon could soon find his place on the team changing . ",
        "jared spurgeon has become accustomed to spending the majority of his ice time alongside ryan suter on the top pairing . however , during suter and spurgeon 's injuries at the end of last season , mathew dumba performed admirably in an increased role on the top pair and may see a promotion to fill the spot beside suter . i would not be surprised to see spurgeon relegated to the second pairing alongside jonas brodin over the course of this season , if he does n't start the season there . second pairing may actually benefit jared , though , by taking him away from the defensive responsibilities of matching up with opposing top lines and allowing him room to use his offensive abilities more . ",
        "as an undersized , offensively gifted defenseman with a great outlet pass , vision to hit his targets in stride , and the hockey awareness to jump into plays in the opposing zone there is still a ton of upside to jared spurgeon maintaining his spot on this team . spurgeon will turn 29 this season , which is amazing to think since it feels like he has been a member of the minnesota wild for so long . he still has plenty of time left in his career , but it may not be as a member of the wild for too much longer . ",
        "offensive skill , defensive capability , and the young players coming up from the minors could be pushing spurgeon out the door . if he is unwilling to waive his no-trade clause , then he is guaranteed to remain for 2 more seasons still . should he waive it to allow gm fenton to move him , we should see a solid return for a reliable , productive , team-first your voice heard ? join the gone puck wild team ! i would personally love to see jared adapt to more of a veteran leadership role , and possibly take on some additional offensive responsibilities on a bottom pairing . ",
        "he is well liked among the minnesota wild fan base and has earned the franchise 's trust in him , but i do n't know if he has a long term place on this team anymore . "
