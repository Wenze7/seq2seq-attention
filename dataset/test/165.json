        "lisa brennan-jobs , the 39-year-old daughter of apple co-founder steve jobs whose difficult childhood has been the stuff of silicon valley legend for decades , is now sharing her story with the for release on sept. . 4 , brennan-jobs ' coming-of-age memoir , `` small fry , '' is a story full of heartbreak and emotional turmoil , products of her upraising amid a tumultuous relationship between her mom , chrisann brennan , and her biological father who initially denied the girl was his daughter . brennan-jobs has been written about in walter isaacson 's best-selling steve jobs biography and was depicted in films such as aaron sorkin 's `` steve jobs . ",
        "`` grove press , the publisher , is calling book the `` poignant '' story of growing up in conflicting worlds and dealing with the emotional ups and downs that come with having a famous and unpredictable genius for a dad . this is the first time brennan-jobs has written at length about her father , who initially refused to pay child-support payments to her mother . jobs died in 2011 at 56 of complications from pancreatic excerpt , published in vanity fair 's september issue , opens with a literary rendering of jobs ' final days , presided over by a buddhist monk who instructed a visiting lisa to `` touch his feet . '' ",
        "jobs converted to buddhism at a young age . brennan-jobs describes visiting her sick father every weekend and trying to fit in around her stepmother , laurene powell , and her three are some notable passages from the excerpts featured in vanity fair , a piece entitled `` growing up jobs '' that contains this teaser : `` steve jobs and chrisann brennan were 23 when their daughter was born . lisa brennan-jobs remembers the pride and pain of a childhood spent navigating the vastness between her struggling single mom and apple 's mercurial founder . `` the opening `` three months before he died , i began to steal things from my father 's house . ",
        "i wandered around barefoot and slipped objects into my pockets . i took blush , toothpaste , two chipped finger bowls in celadon blue , a bottle of nail polish , a pair of worn patent-leather ballet slippers , and four faded white pillowcases the color of old teeth . after stealing each item , i felt sated . i promised myself that this would be the last time . but soon the urge to take something else would arrive again like thirst . `` the monk '' was propped up in bed , wearing shorts . his legs were bare and thin as arms , bent up like a grasshopper 's . '' ",
        "` hey , lis , ' he said . `` segyu rinpoche stood beside him . he 'd been around recently when i came to visit . a short brazilian man with sparkling brown eyes , the rinpoche was a buddhist monk with a scratchy voice who wore brown robes over a round belly . we called him by his title . near us , a black canvas bag of nutrients hummed with a motor and a pump , the tube disappearing somewhere under my father 's sheets . `` a stranger in her father 's house `` later , i would put everything back . ",
        "but now , between avoiding the housekeeper , my brother and sisters , and my stepmother around the house so i would n't be caught stealing things or hurt when they did n't acknowledge me or reply to my hellos , and spraying myself in the darkened bathroom to feel less like i was disappearing -- because inside the falling mist i had a sense of having an outline again -- making efforts to see my sick father in his room began to feel like a burden , a nuisance . `` the rose-flavored facial spray `` for the past year i 'd visited for a weekend every other month or so . ",
        "`` i 'd given up on the possibility of a grand reconciliation , the kind in the movies , but i kept coming anyway . `` before i said good-bye , i went to the bathroom to mist one more time . the spray was natural , which meant that over the course of a few minutes it no longer smelled sharp like roses , but fetid and stinky like a swamp , although i did n't realize it at the time . `` as i came into his room , he was getting into a standing position . i watched him gather both his legs in one arm , twist himself 90 degrees by pushing against the headboard with the other arm , and then use both arms to hoist his own legs over the edge of the bed and onto the floor . ",
        "when we hugged , i could feel his vertebrae , his ribs . he smelled musty , like medicine sweat . ' `` i 'll be back soon , ' i said . `` we detached , and i started walking away . ' `` lis ? '' `` yeah ? '' `` you smell like a toilet . '' ' `` not my kid '' `` in the spring of 1978 , when my parents were 23 , my mother gave birth to me on their friend robert 's farm in oregon , with the help of two midwives . ",
        "the labor and delivery took three hours , start to finish . my father arrived a few days later . ` it 's not my kid , ' he kept telling everyone at the farm , but he 'd flown there to meet me anyway . i had black hair and a big nose , and robert said , ` she sure looks like you . ' `` the kid and the computer `` during the time my mother was pregnant , my father started work on a computer that would later be called the lisa . it was the precursor to the macintosh , the first mass-market computer with an external mouse -- the mouse as large as a block of cheese . ",
        "but it was too expensive , a commercial failure ; my father began on the team working for it , but then started working against it , competing against it , on the mac team . the lisa computer was discontinued , the 3,000 unsold computers later buried in a landfill in logan , utah . `` a dna test and an ipo `` until i was two , my mother supplemented her welfare payments by cleaning houses and waitressing . my father did n't help . she found babysitting at a day-care center inside a church run by the minister 's wife , and for a few months we lived in a room in a house that my mother had found on a notice board meant for women considering adoption . ",
        "`` then , in 1980 , the district attorney of san mateo county , california , sued my father for child-support payments . my father responded by denying paternity , swearing in a deposition that he was sterile and naming another man he said was my father . `` i was required to take a dna test . the tests were new then , and when the results came back , they gave the odds that we were related as the highest the instruments could measure at the time : percent . the court required my father to cover welfare back payments , child-support payments of $ 385 per month , which he increased to $ 500 , and medical insurance until i was 18 . ",
        "the case was finalized on december 8 , 1980 , with my father 's lawyers insistent to close . four days later apple went public and overnight my father was worth more than $ 200 million . `` and then this `` but before that , just after the court case was finalized , my father came to visit me once at our house in menlo park , where we had rented a detached studio . it was the first time i 'd seen him since i 'd been a newborn in oregon . '' ` you know who i am ? ' ",
        "he asked . he flipped his hair out of his eyes . `` i was three years old ; i did n't . ' `` i 'm your father . ' ' `` i 'm one of the most important people you will ever know , ' he said . '' "
