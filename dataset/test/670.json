        "let buffett guide you into a play on autos . credit acceptance corporation offers financing programs that enable automobile dealers to sell vehicles to consumers . its financing programs are offered through a network of automobile dealers . the company has two dealer financing programs . the portfolio program advances money to dealers in exchange for the right to service the underlying consumer loans while under the purchase program , the company buys the consumer loans from the dealers and keeps the amounts collected from the consumer . a bedrock principle for warren buffett is that his type of company has a `` durable competitive advantage '' as compared to being a `` price competitive '' or `` commodity '' type of business . ",
        "buffett likes companies to have solid , stable earnings that are continually expanding . this allows him to accurately predict future earnings . buffett would consider this firm 's earnings predictable . in fact earnings per share for credit acceptance have increased every year . the company 's long term historical earnings per share growth rate is % , based on the average of the 3 , 4 and 5 year historical earnings per share growth rates . the company is expected to grow earnings % per year in the future , based on the analysts ' consensus estimated long term growth rate . ",
        "the buffett checklist buffett likes companies with above average return on equity of at least 15 % or better , as this is an indicator that the company has a durable competitive advantage . corporations have , on average , returned about 12 % on equity over the last 30 years . the average roe for credit acceptance , over the last ten years , is % , which is high enough to pass . buffett also requires , for financial companies , that the average return on assets be at least 1 % and consistent . return on assets is defined as the net earnings of the business divided by the total assets of the business . ",
        "the average roa for credit acceptance , over the last ten years , is % , which is high enough to pass . buffett likes companies that do not have major capital expenditures . credit acceptance 's free cash flow per share of $ is positive , indicating that the company is generating more cash that it is consuming . this is a favorable sign , and so the company passes this criterion . buffett also likes to see if management has spent retained earnings in a way that benefits shareholders . to figure this out , buffett takes the total amount of retained earnings over the previous ten years of $ and compares it to the gain in earnings per share over the same period of $ credit acceptance 's management has proven it can earn shareholders a % return on the earnings they kept . ",
        "this return is more than acceptable to buffett . essentially , management is doing a great job putting the retained earnings to work . why to buy the second stage of buffett 's analysis asks `` should i buy at this price ? '' the buffett strategy favors companies in which the initial rate of return is around the long-term treasury yield . currently , the long-term treasury yield is about % . compare this with credit acceptance 's initial yield of % , which will expand at an annual rate of % , based on the analysts ' consensus estimated long term growth rate . ",
        "the company is the better choice , as the initial rate of return is close to or above the long term bond yield and is expanding . the buffett-style strategy calculates the expected rate of return based on the average return on equity method and also based on average earnings per share growth . based on the two different methods , you could expect an annual compounding rate of return somewhere between % and % . to pinpoint the average return a little better , we have taken an average of the two different methods . investors could expect an average return of % on credit acceptance shares for the next ten years , based on the current fundamentals . ",
        "buffett would consider this an exceptional return , thus passing the criterion . by : john reese of validea . via moneyshow . "
