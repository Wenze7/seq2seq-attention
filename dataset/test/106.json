        "new teammates og anunoby and kawhi leonard are remarkably similar on and off the court -- versatile defenders , gym-rats and stoic by nature . who better to teach the raptors rookie sensation the path from role player to nba superstardom ? here 's a crazy idea : og anunoby is the second coming of kawhi leonard . at least that 's what toronto raptors executives want to believe and it 's easy to see origin stories are strikingly similar . on the court , leonard and anunoby are both long and athletic players with great defensive instincts , capable of guarding multiple positions . ",
        "many teams passed on them in the nba draft because of their offensive limitations . however , from humble beginnings , each player proved themselves with their defensive versatility to play significant minutes as rookies on a contending team . during the playoffs , they showed great poise , elevating their game to new , they 're like two peas in a pod . leonard shies away from media attention , rarely shows emotion and is practically mute . while anunoby shows a bit more flair , he too keeps his sentences short and emotional flourishes to a that they 'll share the court together , the rookie sensation has a great opportunity . ",
        "here are three things that anunoby can learn from the silent superstar to take his game to the next his shooting strokelet 's start with the obvious . og anunoby needs to improve his jump shot to become an all-around threat in the nba . in his rookie season , he shot 47 percent from the field and 37 percent from three but on limited attempts . in january , he hit the proverbial rookie wall , when he averaged his lowest points per game and three-point percentage , before recovering to finish off the season . anunoby has decent form on his shot but it appears a bit rigid and leonard . ",
        "coming into the nba during the 2011-12 season , his shooting mechanics were suspect . in his two college seasons at san diego state , he made 41 3-pointers on 164 attempts . there was no fluidity , with the ball resting over or behind his head when shooting and his body snap decisions last season , anunoby 's role on offense was fairly limited . spot up in the corner for threes , run in transition , grab offensive rebounds and occasionally drive to the basket . part of this was by design . while raptors ran a more egalitarian offense than years past , lowry and derozan tended to dominate possessions , especially in the clutch . ",
        "they handled the ball , made key decisions and created opportunities when plays broke , the main reason was that anunoby was n't ready to accept that sort of responsibility . his ball handling and playmaking skills are still subpar and he needs to learn to read the situation on the floor and react appropriately . to his credit , anunoby has shown flashes of improvement during the summer league and he 'll get plenty of opportunities this coming he wants to accelerate the process , he can look at leonard 's evolution into a playmaking forward . under the tutelage of greg popovich , leonard added an arsenal of moves , tightened his handle , increased his assist rate , decreased his turnovers while improving his scoring out of the pick and roll . ",
        "with repetition and encouragement , kawhi honed his decision-making abilities and now regularly finds the most efficient shot for himself and others . the key is that he never seems to force things , a valuable lesson for on defensewith the nba shifting to small ball , players like leonard and anunoby are invaluable on defense . they fit the profile of a versatile player who can do pretty much leonard 's doppelganger , anunoby has the potential to be just as suffocating . with large hands , a 7 ' 6 '' wingspan , chiselled frame and quick feet , anunoby is built to be an elite defensive stopper . ",
        "while defense is already his calling card , he still needs to improve his understanding of small details like angles and spacing to take the next ethic over everythingnot everyone gets better . as any successful person knows , raw talent without work ethic equals no , og anunoby has both in spades . just like leonard , he is on track for a quiet , almost invisible ascendance to superstardom . and who knows , as a kindred spirit he might be the edge the raptors need to convince kawhi leonard to stay in toronto long term .
