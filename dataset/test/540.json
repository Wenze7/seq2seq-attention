        "the pleas for help range from the unintentionally comical to eerily evocative to inescapably common . but however you read the city of chicago 's odor complaints , one thing is clear : the city is never more apparent than on hot summer days . we practice shallow breathing while packed into `` l '' cars , cross the street to avoid those mysterious `` stink corners . '' it 's the one time it 's nice to be second to new york city -- everybody knows they outrank us in summertime again , maybe we 're all just being closed-minded when it comes to smells . ",
        "what if we smelled without judgment , but with curiosity and a sense of discovery ? what if , instead of scuttling down a rote set of streets on your daily rounds , you could smell your way to work ? scientists and researchers say you can -- which is why they 're looking at how smells have shaped cities , and working to create smell maps of cities around the world . `` smells form a significant component of human knowledge about local environments , '' says kate mclean , program director in graphic design at canterbury christ church university in the , in an email interview . ",
        "`` smells act as markers of change , as ambiance and also act as personal markers of place-indexing activity . smells are both a survival tool and an element of emotional relationships with place . `` mclean is a smell collector , someone who routinely sticks her nose into , say , dog fur or a random hedge , just to catch a scent . she began studying smells as a part of an alternative way to know the city of edinburgh , scotland , while pursuing her master of fine arts there . `` i started deconstructing the city through sensory approaches , '' she says , `` and representing the findings as maps which deliberately withheld information and encouraged the map reader to actively experience for themselves . ",
        "`` cities , she quickly realized , were a rich stew of smells . `` the first smells i was curious about were those encountered in the contemporary city . in the case of edinburgh , they included brewery fumes , penguins at the zoo , fish and chip shops , cut grass , cherry blossom . '' mclean developed a method of `` smell walking '' through city neighborhoods to document odors , then plotting that data on maps , which she presents in colorful , artistic quercia , a scientist at nokia bell labs in cambridge , , takes another approach to smell and colleagues luca maria aiello , also of nokia bell labs , and rossano schifanella , a professor at the university of turin , create smell maps of cities using data mining . ",
        "specifically , they use a set of words that have been recognized by scientists as language that humans use for smells , then cross-reference that with geolocated social media posts and come up with maps that tie reports of smells to physical streets , blocks and neighborhoods in cities around the their website , , you can click on your chicago street and get a nifty graphic that shows you the predominant smells people have reported at that location . `` there are devices which can measure particles in the air , '' says quercia , `` but this is complementary . ",
        "devices give you a number , but what social media can give you is another layer to that number , an emotional reaction . '' so scientists will one day be able to know , for instance , the exact particle threshold of emissions from a factory that will tip the scale from `` hmm , weird smell '' to `` that stench is searing my brain . call somebody ! `` the somebody on the other end of those calls in chicago is dave graham , the city 's assistant commissioner for environmental permitting and inspections . graham 's department investigates odor complaints made by citizens of our city -- sometimes as few as nine per month to more than 20 per month in the of the calls are voicing concern about industrial smells : petroleum , chemicals , spray paint , smelly smoke billowing down an alleyway , sewer gas . ",
        "city inspectors follow those complaints like smell detectives , trying to chase down the source and make sure there 's no public health hazard or code violation . `` they 're going to have to poke around , snoop around and figure out what 's causing it , '' says graham . `` sometimes , these odors , you do n't necessarily find the source . '' if it 's a really tough case , graham , who is a former environmental consultant , might have to come out and take a look himself , though he notes his own sense of smell is less than sensitive . ",
        "`` the only thing that bothers me is my wife 's hand lotion . i do n't know why , but it drives me crazy . `` many of the smells graham 's team investigates turn out to be `` more of a nuisance issue '' than a public danger , he notes . but smells and health concerns have been linked in the human mind for centuries . in fact , early worries about smells helped shape chicago into the city it is today , says melanie kiechle , an urban smell historian and author of `` smell detectives : an olfactory history of nineteenth-century urban america . ",
        "`` kiechle chose chicago as one of the major subjects of her research , she says , partly because `` chicago definitely stunk . '' the rapid rise of the meatpacking industry in the city , combined with explosive urban growth that outstripped the capacity for public sanitation , created a ready environment for a world of heady scents . `` it was what we call a ` shock city ' '' says kiechle , `` and not just because its growth was a shock to the environment , but also because when people arrived , they were literally shocked by the conditions . ",
        "`` obviously , we had a long way to go before the architectural boat tour made the town safe for chicagoans , kiechle says , paid a lot of attention to smells . `` people believed that bad airs caused disease . they called them miasmas . and one of the ways they knew the air was bad was the way it smelled . `` germ theory did n't rear its reasonable , scientific head until late in the 19th century , so chicago 's citizens had to rely on their noses to tell them that something nasty might be brewing . ",
        "then , as now , laws allowed for citizens to complain about public nuisances and ask the city to regulate industry to tamp down the smells . eventually , after some political maneuvering and a whole lot of citizen complaints , the `` stink trials '' of the 1870s marked the first time courts ordered the regulation of powerful packing houses and fat renderers until they agreed to install odor , kiechle says , also influenced another major historical moment : the decision to reverse the flow of the chicago river . `` today we think that it was to protect the city 's drinking water , '' kiechle says , `` and that was true , but they did n't understand that in the 19th century . ",
        "in 1865 , when the project was started , the point of redirecting the water flow was to direct the stench of the water away from the city . `` basically , it worked : today , on quercia 's smell map of chicago , the predominant smell reported along the riverwalk is `` nature . '' depending on how close you 're standing to lower wacker drive or island party hut , the smell of nature might vary . but the beauty of tracking smells , quercia says , is that you can choose which part of the riverwalk you 'd prefer to walk down , based on scent . ",
        "`` if you see that a certain street smells like the poo of dogs , '' he says , `` you might go another way . `` in the future , quercia and his team hope that urban planners might be able to put their data to good use to make cities smell better and , since smells are closely tied into the emotional centers of the brain , even less stressful . `` if you are placing a bench for people to sit and relax , '' he says , `` maybe you want to include plants with a restful smell , like lavender . '' ",
        "until then , you can have a little fun by walking to the train by way of , say , baked goods rather than car , like mclean , you can start to explore the city via smells . she has created a downloadable smell walk kit , that explains how to use specific techniques to both passively and actively catch and document smells as you go . `` participants leave with a new understanding of their city , '' she maybe a little more acceptance . `` odors are odors , '' says graham . `` you 're in the city , you 're smelling maybe the restaurant on the corner , a car shop , a nail salon , whatever . '' ",
        "on his own commute , he says , `` i pass one building , and every so often i catch a whiff of something really bad . '' diagnosis ? `` it 's just the sewer . it might be something decomposing down there . `` maybe he should map that . "
