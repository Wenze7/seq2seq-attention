        "danbury -- local foresters are examining dozens of potentially dangerous trees across danbury after a massive tree fell and killed a 45-year-old man tuesday along padanaram road . the city 's forestry division has identified 46 trees along city roads this summer that could pose a risk and need to be removed , public works director antonio iadarola said wednesday morning . crews are in the process of removing those trees this week , in addition to 40 others that were taken down shortly after severe thunderstorms rolled through the area in may causing a macroburst and a tornado that toppled hundreds of trees , damaged dozens of homes and killed two , he added . ",
        "but officials are still trying to determine who has responsibility for the large tree -- which was at least 3 feet in diameter -- that fell on a pickup truck on padanaram road around 9 tuesday killing the passenger , walter cardenas salinas . padanaram is owned by the state of connecticut and does n't fall under the city 's responsibility , iadarola stressed . kevin nursick , a spokesman for the state department of transportation , said state officials are aware of the accident and investigating whether the tree was on the state 's right of way or if it was located on private property . ",
        "`` we have to have the area surveyed to know for sure , '' nursick said . he added that area supervisors for the department are responsible for assessing roadways in their section for any safety concerns that might arise . but when the area surrounding panadaram road was last assessed by state officials was n't immediately available tuesday . the crash shut down the road for most of tuesday after bringing down power lines and a brief fire . edgar nugra , who was identified by police as the driver of the 2014 dodge ram , said he saw the tree falling but did n't have time to react before it slammed into the truck . ",
        "nugra received minor injuries while salinas was declared dead at the scene . matt bartelme , the owner of danbury-based bart 's tree service , said two people told him after the accident they saw the tree prior to the crash and that it had already been compromised and leaning against another tree in the area . if the tree had been partially uprooted , he said , saturation from the more than 3 inches of rain the city received in the past week or so alone could have impacted the strength of the tree and contributed to it falling . ",
        "but scott clifford , who lives in the neighborhood , said it was only a matter of time before the tree fell . several trees on the western edge of the road , which sit near the bank of the padanaram brook , have been undermined and are leaning over the roadway , he said . `` that area has very unstable soil that 's been eroding and eventually all those trees are going to fall , '' he said . erosion near the brook was a concern raised by residents when cotswald of danbury , a local developer , had proposed building 37 single family units on property it owns near the brook that runs along padanaram road . ",
        "while the project was approved three years ago , the homes have yet to be built . an official with the city 's assessors office said tuesday that it appears the property near where the tree was located is owned by costwald . the developer had originally proposed giving the city the 6-acre parcel as open space , the official said , but land records indicate that a transfer has yet to take place . barteleme said it will likely be another six months or more before all the trees and branches impacted by the may storm have been addressed .
