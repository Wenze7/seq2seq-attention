        "until there 's a clear winner in the trade war with china , jim cramer told his mad money viewers , investors should expect a lot more volatility in the stock market . the forecast , he said , is still likely to be delicious gains followed by maximum pain . it 's clear that president trump is willing to sacrifice some of our best industrial companies , at least over the short term , in the name of fair trade , cramer said . with the chinese economy showing signs of slowing , trump may be willing to increase the stakes even more for maximum pressure . ",
        "what would a win on trade look like ? cramer said allowing companies to operate in china without the need for a joint partnership that steals our trade secrets would be a good start . with the industrial stocks in limbo , the market turned to apple , an action alerts plus holding , for leadership . cramer said while apple marches towards a $ 1 trillion valuation , the stock offers little pin action for the rest of tech . while problems at facebook may have implications for the rest of the industry , what 's good for apple is largely just good for apple . ",
        "but that does n't mean there are n't buying opportunities out there . the banks are a superb investment with more interest rate hikes on the horizon , as are the retailers going into the back to school shopping season . investors who ca n't handle the volatility should consider investing in index funds , cramer added , because once the trade wars are over , the entire market will see a terrific bounce to the upside . what consumers really want what lessons could procter & gamble learn from apple ? both companies reported earnings yesterday , and cramer said the differences between the two were stunning . ",
        "cramer has long said that apple is not a technology company , but rather a consumer goods maker , just like procter . but while procter struggles with changing consumer behaviors and declining customer loyalty , apple is the exact opposite , with a 98 % customer satisfaction rating on its latest iphone and a services stream with accelerating growth . organic growth is the truest metric by which to value consumer stocks , cramer explained , but while procter delivered just 1 % organic growth , apple 's remains in the double digits . yet despite the disparity , shares of procter trade at 17 times earnings while apple remains at just 15 times earnings , and that 's before factoring in the company 's massive cash hoard .
