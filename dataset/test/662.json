        "walmart is moving ahead with its plan to create a video streaming service . it has apparently hired the former ceo of cable company epix to kickstart development . earlier this month , tech times reported that walmart was considering its own video streaming service to compete with the likes of netflix , amazon , and hulu . at the time , however , it was n't clear whether the retail chain was serious about such out it 's very serious , indeed . walmart , according to new reports , has apparently enlisted the services of mark greenberg to help develop the streaming platform . ",
        "it 's a smart hire -- greenberg is more than capable of what 's being asked of him , having been the ceo of epix , a premium cable and satellite television network . he left the role in september about walmart 's video streaming servicewalmart 's streaming service will allegedly run separate from vudu , the video service it purchased in 2010 as a bid to make its smart tv offerings more robust . as per variety , this service would be firmly targeted at walmart 's core demographic , with content primarily targeted at `` middle america . ",
        "`` it will also be inexpensive . the retail company is said to be targeting a monthly subscription price of around $ 8 , which would put it $ 2 below netflix 's standard asking price . it 's not clear whether or not walmart plans to offer original content , as virtually each of its would-be rivals does . original movies and tv shows are the bread and butter of any streaming service since it 's a huge part of what 'll convince people to pay for a monthly subscription in the first in the early stagesreports say walmart 's plans are still very much in the early stages . ",
        "so it 's no surprise walmart and greenberg are keeping mum on the whole affair . the company certainly has its work cut out for it , though . netflix wo n't be a piece of cake to compete with -- it 's responsible for 73 percent of all streams , according to comscore . toppling it would require massive amounts of effort , an undertaking even a company like amazon ca n't achieve for now , and it has jeff would also be interesting to see how walmart plans to differentiate itself from the rest of the pack . ",
        "since netflix , amazon , and hulu offer all kinds of viewing pleasures , walmart could make its video streaming service a niche option , much like how shudder is all about horror films . that will greatly limit its potential audience , you subscribe to walmart 's streaming service ? what do you think about this trend of companies launching their respective video platforms ? as always , feel free to sound off in the comments section below !
