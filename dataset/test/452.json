        "with lollapalooza upon us , this marks the start of an awkward , yet delicate dance familiar to white rap music those pivotal festival moments when the cool , swaggering young rapper dips his mic toward the crowd in a gesture for them to finish the verse , lily-white patrons have an important decision to make : do they repeat the verse that contains the most vilified word of our time , or quickly mumble it and avoid an awkward moment with any black fans ? by `` it , '' of course , i 'm talking about the conversation-killing , the topic has gotten a lot of attention as hip-hop acts continue to diversify the largely-white music festival circuit at events like coachella , south by southwest , union park 's recent pitchfork festival and this week 's rapper noname addressed the issue at pitchfork when she presented a new song that included the n-word as part of the chorus , but she included an alternative for white fans . ",
        "`` i wrote this part so that you white people would have something to do , since y ' all ca n't ever say that word , '' she told the they do say magic word brought last may 's hangout festival in alabama to a screeching halt when a young white fan dropped the n-bomb while rapping on stage with kendrick lamar during a set of his hit , '' city . '' `` you got ta bleep one single word , '' the pulitzer prize-winning lamar told the fan , according to published reports . `` oh i 'm sorry , did i do it ? '' ",
        "she was quoted as asking , surrounded by an angry , booing a lifetime of being spoon-fed negative black images , the `` to pimp a butterfly '' star would like white america to let black people exclusively have the word , he recently told vanity the word is enjoying something of a pop culture renaissance in these early years of the 21st century , well beyond its origin as the soul-crushing racial invective . in the last five decades the word has become a piece of performance art by black icons from richard pryor and dave chapelle to drake and childish gambino , morphing it into cool slang for some young white rap-loving hipsters and , too may have heard two white teenagers using the word when speaking to one another . ",
        "i was certainly reminded of this when i fell in with a diverse group of 20-somethings at the recent wicker park fest . there , i met a group of friends whose ethnic backgrounds included white , african-american , latino and middle music from a car radio droning in the background , i listened to the friends pepper their sentences with the n-word when referring to ex-boyfriends , bosses , authority figures or any troublesome presence . it was n't , however , used in any racial sense . one of the friends , a young woman whose family came from palestine , told me that she was n't trying to be offensive , but expressed herself that way , she said with cardi b 's using that word has real world consequences , especially from older african-americans who still bristle at its casual use and support its retirement . ",
        "social media is awash in videos of whites and non-african-americans saying the word , then follow-up videos of them losing their careers or being otherwise publicly scorned . last year , an friend who is also african-american , told me of how a young white co-worker tried used the n-word with him , not as a slur , but as two black friends did not feel that love and complained to supervisors . her attempts to connect with him were a failure and she was quickly year writer brian joseph wrote for spin magazine about how some rappers had begun scaling back use of the n-word as more hip-hop acts joined the white festival stars like lamar and chance the rapper are in the `` it 's our word '' camp , the same article also interviewed younger rappers , including chicago star g herbo , who suggest that younger stars are n't taking the same stance . ",
        "`` if a white person says and he 's saying my lyrics , i do n't take it for nothing but that , '' he told the complicating matters is how the word 's original racial use has been usurped to become a friendly term , expressing shared struggle , or just a general one . `` sometimes there may be a situation where i call a white person , '' g herbo told carson , an assistant professor of hip-hop for the university of virginia 's music department , knows this native of downstate decatur who performs under the name aydee the great , carson both rejects the notion of the n-word as cool slang , though he has used it and does n't dissuade his own uva students from using it in his rap songwriting course . ",
        "`` i do n't know if the word is losing its negative connotation . my instinct says no , but i know there are all kinds of layers being continually added , peeled back , folded into others , and hopefully forcing us to think critically , '' he said . `` context is , and always will be , important . the further we get from that , i think , the more reckless we get with our understanding of word work . `` so should we kill the word and bury it once and for all , or keep it around for scientific and artistic purposes ? ",
        "whatever decision we make , those kids rapping along this weekend should remember that word , whether sang , rapped , or yelled , still has power . "
