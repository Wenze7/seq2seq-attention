        "when sophia de oliveira left her post as general manager at devereaux last november , she was n't sure if or when she was going to return to the restaurant world . she 'd worked in hospitality her whole life and despite the deep connections she 'd made , she felt like she needed to step away . `` it was just not my scene , '' de oliveira said . `` the gold coast sort of luxury , i was just very much like , ` wow , this is such a wrong fit . ` it was n't until she met jeff zappone that she felt like there was finally a project she could see herself committing to . ",
        "on thursday , she 's opening a punk rock-themed bar named good measure in river north that 's not only focused on providing an inviting space , but is also committed to creating a positive environment for its employees . `` my employees are my bottom line , '' de oliveira said . `` if they 're happy and well taken care of , they 're going to take care of our guests and we 're all going to pay our bills . '' to that end , de oliveira and her team are intentionally hiring fifty-percent persons of color and fifty-percent women , along with paying staff above industry standards for hourly wages . ",
        "health insurance offerings will also be made after contiguous employment , plus paid vacation for full-time staff , paid training workshops , and an intentional approach to work-life balance in the form of 40 hour weeks with three full days off , unheard of for many hospitality employees . `` you can treat people with respect and integrity , and have a diverse workplace and build something really special that makes people feel safe and proud . `` in addition to devereaux , de oliveira has done stints at swift & sons , cold storage , osteria langhe and benny 's chop house , and was encouraged by friends to meet zappone , now her partner and director of operations . ",
        "he approached her with the idea of a burger and beer bar , and she was less than impressed . `` i told him straight up , ` i think it 's great you can do this but quite frankly , the last thing i think this industry needs is another place to get a burger and beer . ' `` the name pays homage to the space 's former use as a tailor shop , but it also nods to the simplicity of the drinks , precision of the food and the musical component . good measure is not merely a burger and beer bar , although it will have both , de oliveira said , who loves simple , straightforward cocktails . ",
        "expect classics like a cosmopolitan with a modern twist , made with aronia berry liqueur , mandarine napoleon , fresh lime juice and a housemade citrus-infused oliveira is particularly excited about the toki whisky highball machine , which she called `` an incredible piece of craftsmanship . '' `` i love using good products and using new , fun things to work with , but a lot of us are just sick of the pretension , '' de oliveira said . `` for me , is so much more about the people than anything on a menu . `` matt troost , partner and chef , will be helming the kitchen . ",
        "mussels will be prepared `` lowbrow , '' with pbr , shallots , thyme and spam , or `` highbrow , '' with saffron-guajillo broth , hominy , jalapeno , cabbage and cilantro . pork ribs will be served withblack bean chakalaka , a south african curry dish made with cabbage , jalapeno and tomatoes . and of course , troost has created a simple bar burger , named the & 14gm burger , made with an onion bun , smoked american cheese , aioli , lettuce , tomato and conventional items include nashville hot duck livers , sweet corn and salt cod brandade , and a devil honey fried oliveira says the bar 's punk theme is less about punk 's anarchic roots , but rather the idea of the restaurant and bar being open to anyone , regardless of who they are and where they came from . ",
        "the moody red-and-black interior , designed by siren betty design studio , will feature a lot of leather and studs , but is more polished than gritty . `` we 're all like lost puppies in the world , and we 've finally found this little home and it 's really , really awesome and totally worth everything that we 've all gone through to get here to this point .
