        "bye , bye autonomous semi . just under two years ago , uber bought otto , a startup focused on developing self-driving trucks . now , uber is bidding adieu to its plans for autonomous shipping , at least for the time being . on monday , the company revealed in a statement that it 's closing its self-driving truck 's self-driving trucks were seen on the road as recently as march , where they were contracted to deliver freight in focus . the move wo n't affect the employees of uber 's self-driving truck division -- they 'll just move to the self-driving car division , eric meyhofer , head of uber advanced technologies group , said in an email statement to techcrunch . ",
        "the hope , according to meyhofer , is that focusing all of uber 's self-driving expertise and energy on its cars will help that division build momentum . `` i know we 're all super proud of what the trucks team has accomplished , and we continue to see the incredible promise of self-driving technology applied to moving freight across the country , '' meyhofer told employees in an email reviewed by techcrunch . `` but we believe delivering on self-driving for passenger applications first , and then bringing it to freight applications down the line , is the best path forward . ",
        "for now , we need the focus of one team , with one clear objective . '' frankly , uber 's self-driving car division could probably use the help . in march , one of the company 's vehicles struck and killed a pedestrian in arizona , and the incident put a halt on testing all self-driving cars nationwide . if uber wants to stay competitive in the autonomous car space , it really ca n't afford any more bumps in the trucking . with uber out of the picture , its former competitors -- google subsidiary waymo and tesla -- are poised to duke it out as they continue to develop their own vehicles . ",
        "the timing of the announcement is particularly good for tesla -- ceo elon musk has a call scheduled with tesla shareholders on wednesday to update them on tesla 's q2 financial results . now he 'll have a little positive news to include . "
