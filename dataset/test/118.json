        "white sox catcher omar narvaez had to grin when asked how effective left-handed starter carlos rodon was tuesday night in the 4-2 victory over the angels . `` from the very beginning ? '' narvaez said before the sox resumed the series wednesday night . `` he could n't throw a strike in the bullpen before the game . `` rodon threw strike after strike during the game , however , as he took a no-hitter into the sixth inning . rodon frequently got ahead in the count and did not allow anyone to get too comfortable against a fastball that topped out at 95 mph and breaking balls that dipped at the knees . ",
        "he made pitching look like the easiest task in got the first two outs of the game , walked mike trout and then retired 15 straight batters , many on ground balls . the string was broken when david fletcher drew a two-out walk in the simmons then broke up rodon 's no-hitter with a bouncer up the middle , but sox third baseman yolmer sanchez made a nice defensive play to end the inning , popping up after taking a throw from the outfield and catching simmons taking too wide of a turn around worked a clean seventh , then gave up a leadoff double to ian kinsler in the eighth . ",
        "rodon got two more outs before a walk ended his night with two hits and three walks allowed in 7 2/3 innings . `` he was pitching very free and easy , '' manager rick renteria said afterward . `` he went deep into the game and had a good mix of pitches . he stayed efficient as the game went on before getting a little tired . `` said rodon : `` it was fun . there were a lot of balls hit at guys and they got me into the eighth . i was in a groove early . ",
        "the no-hitter was in my head , but i got a fastball out against simmons . `` narvaez was n't concerned after the errant warmup . `` that 's the way it works sometimes , '' he said . `` he got ahead of hitters all night . he pretty much did whatever he wanted to do . `` rodon has put together three straight quality starts , allowing just 10 hits in 21 innings with a era and . 141 opponents average . this is the rodon the sox remember from his first two seasons , when he went 18-16 with an era below four before injuries took their toll in was shut down early in '17 with bursitis in his left biceps and inflammation in his left shoulder . ",
        "rodon returned and made 12 starts before the shoulder inflammation returned and he was shut down again . he had offseason shoulder surgery and missed the first two months of 2018 while rehabilitating his last three starts are indicative of rodon 's overall talent , and they have come at the same time lucas giolito has had back-to-back solid outings and improved efforts were delivered by reynaldo lopez and dylan covey as members of that quartet are all 26 or younger and represent a large part of the hopes for the sox in 2019 and beyond . for the moment at least rodon and co. . ",
        "seem to be renewing hopes for a late surge this for sale : the sox were very active last season at the trade deadline . this year , they are n't expected to seek out any large trades , but four veteran pitchers likely are available as teams in pennant races look to fill a rotation or find bullpen shields , who started wednesday night against the angels , has pitched better than his 4-11 record indicates , and the 36-year-old could fill a fourth or fifth rotation spot on a 's more trade talk about relievers , and the sox have three who could be moved for prospects . ",
        "joakim soria , 34 , has 16 saves in 19 opportunities this season and has n't allowed a run in 21 of his last 22 appearances . he had saves in both victories over the angels this week and has a career era of gomez and xavier cedeno , both 30 , could fill key roles in a pennant race and losing either would n't have a major impact on the sox because many pitching prospects are performing well in the teams are looking for bullpen help , including the cubs and dodgers . the dodgers have lacked a bridge to kenley jansen all season and a one-inning semi-closer such as soria could be that keisser is a freelance reporter for the chicago tribune .
