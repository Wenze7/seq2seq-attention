        "outfit : topshop bomber jacketbrandy melville t-shirtzara faux leather pantsair jordan ` banned ' retro onessaint laurent bagi found myself back in familiar territory this past weekend when i stopped in la for dinner with the family . i almost feel like i 've lived more than one life when i visit my past surroundings . it reminds me of what i want in my life . my style lately has been a bit bipolar . i 'm always down for a girly dress with heels , but then again a laid back outfit with sneakers sounds just as nice . ",
        "i 've gotten so much out of this topshop bomber jacket this past year . it 's one of the few pieces i own that is color . army green really does compliment a lot of neutral colors . i wore an oversized brandy melville t-shirt to get my hype-beast vibe on . this shirt is extremely comfortable and gives you the tomboy look instantly . underneath i am wearing my zara faux leather pants . i remember last year when leather pants were all the rave . yeah i was n't dropping $ 1k on pants , so these faux leather pants will do . ",
        "i love how well they compliment my new air jordan one ` banned ' sneakers . i put off buying these for the past few months and then finally got around to buying them . these are my third pair of air jordan retro sneakers ... and funny enough , they are all red / black colorway . i love the contrast of the red and black . they compliment so well together ! this is one of my go to outfits for days i want to be casual , but still dressed up .
