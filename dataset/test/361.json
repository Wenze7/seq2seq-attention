        "reliever jesse chavez returns tuesday to pnc park , where his 11-year major-league career began with a perfect inning of relief against the cubs . chavez 's nine-team odyssey included one curious trade deadline detour eight years ago . `` i was walking from the visitor 's clubhouse to the bullpen in cincinnati , '' recalled chavez , believing at the time he would stay with the braves with the deadline minutes away . `` i was literally behind home plate as the umpires were convening . `` then i was called back and told i was traded to the royals . ",
        "`` but chavez wo n't need to worry about a similar occurrence this season after making a favorable impression in the short time he has been with the cubs since arriving in a trade from the rangers on july 19 . `` he knows what he 's doing , '' manager joe maddon said saturday after chavez pitched his fifth consecutive scoreless outing . `` he 's very resilient . he 's an interesting add . `` chavez immediately established his value : he pitched two scoreless innings to preserve a 7-2 victory in his cubs debut on july 21 , and he pitched a scoreless sixth that allowed the cubs to rally from a 6-1 deficit to a 7-6 walk-off win over the diamondbacks on thursday . ",
        "`` he 's got a slow heartbeat , '' said cubs special assistant david ross , who played with chavez with the braves in 2010 . `` he leads by example . he knows how to pitch and have a good time . `` right fielder jason heyward , who was a rookie when he played with ross and chavez , added that chavez has `` withstood the test of time . '' `` there 's a guy who started , relieved , started , and now relieved , '' heyward said . `` to me , that embodies how he can figure how to help a team win in any role . ",
        "`` in the last eight seasons , chavez has persevered by pitching aggressively , staying healthy and polishing four pitches -- particularly a changeup -- that more than compensated for a blazing chavez was surprised by his recent trade , he was pleased he was dealt well in advance of tuesday 's deadline . `` i 've been on teams that have been on the fire sale side , and i think it 's beneficial to get it out of the way for a player to get there , get to know the team , before it gets to crush time , '' chavez said . ",
        "`` the earlier you get to a new team , the better the acclimation you can make to the club -- from the catchers , scouting staff , pitching coaches , the manager . it goes down the line from the players to the clubhouse guys , getting them comfortable with you and their well-being , and help you in your own element . they want you to be comfortable . `` with all the moving chavez has experienced , providing support for his family is just as essential . his family accompanied him from texas after the trade and will stay with him through next weekend 's home series before they return to riverside , 's daughter christe will start freshman orientation next week at riverside poly high chavez has no intention of retiring , especially with his continued effectiveness and his services in demand . ",
        "`` as long as i 'm healthy , i do all i can to stay out of that trainer 's room , '' said chavez , who has pitched in 338 games -- including 70 starts . `` as long as i can do that , i do n't see why i should hang them up . if i did , i know i 'd go home healthy and still get a job . '' "
