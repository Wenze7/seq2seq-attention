        "early morning surprise . at around 6 am pt thursday morning , virgin galactic , the aerospace company founded by richard branson , took to twitter to casually announce plans to test one of its spaceshiptwo three-and-a-half hours later , the spaceplane , named the vss unity , took off from the mojave air and space port in mojave , ca . about 20 minutes after that , it touched down . no livestream , no press release -- just a dozen or so twitter posts , and it was spaceplane . launching a ss2 is pretty different from a typical rocket launch . ",
        "instead of launching vertically , a jet-powered craft called a white knight two takes off horizontally like a plane , carrying a ss2 up to its launch altitude of 15 kilometers . the ss2 then separates from the carrier vehicle and flies into the upper atmosphere . both craft later landing on a runway just like thursday 's launch , the wk2 was named vms eve . this was vms eve 's 252nd flight and vss unity 's 14th , but it was only the third rocket-powered test flight for vss unity . according to virgin galactic 's twitter posts , the goal of today 's test was to `` gather more data on supersonic flight , aerodynamics , as well as thermal dynamics , '' as well as analyze the conditions within unity 's launch closer . ",
        "on wednesday , bloomberg published a video interview with virgin galactic ceo richard branson in which he asserted the company is closing in on its goal of sending people to space . `` before the end of the year , i hope to be sitting in a virgin galactic spaceship , going to space , '' he told interviewer david rubenstein . if and when that happens , expect to hear a lot about it .
