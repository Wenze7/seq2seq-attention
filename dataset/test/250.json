        "london mayor sadiq khan got a water taxi tour of it . famed architect santiago calatrava sipped coffee along it . and tech magnate elon musk strolled down visiting dignitaries and corporate ceos come to town , mayor rahm emanuel takes many of them to the same place : chicago 's , though , brings them to the stretch between state street and the riverwalk 's western end near wolf point -- the new sections with bars , cafes and fountains that the mayor built into the river a few years ago , thanks to a large federal loan . ",
        "the older , quieter and more weathered stretch of the riverwalk from state street east to lake shore drive does n't get the same attention -- from the mayor , tourists or the downtown business emanuel is planning a $ 10 million facelift for the stretch that would include new landscaping , seating , play areas and walkways . the goal is to entirely revamp what he 's dubbed riverwalk east to better match the newer western gateways would welcome visitors on either side of michigan avenue , along the river 's south bank . the walking path will be moved closer to the river . ",
        "public art would mask much of lower wacker drive 's underbelly . more trees would be planted . a glass elevator would be installed . new restaurants and bars would be built . and a new walkway under wacker would connect the riverwalk to the lakeshore east neighborhood and vista tower , when what will be the city 's third-tallest building is addition to the city money , four businesses on the eastern end are chipping in more than $ million toward the riverwalk redo in exchange for long-term leases along what quickly has become a top outdoor destination downtown . ",
        "`` the riverwalk has kind of almost a split personality . there 's a before , and there 's an after , '' emanuel said in an interview . `` the whole goal : two years from now , you wo n't think of it as two separate parts , and both will be inviting , and both will be good for the city . `` emanuel rarely makes a public appearance without finding some way to mention the riverwalk and its success as an attraction . businesses such as city winery and tiny tapp easily are exceeding original revenue projections , and scores of people also regularly visit the riverwalk to relax , read a book , hold an impromptu meeting or eat their the mayor , refurbishing the older stretch of riverwalk is the latest phase in what has become an obsession of he has a meeting or appearance nearby , emanuel frequently walks along the riverwalk back toward city hall , making his police detail delay his return to the city suv . ",
        "he 's been known to drop in on weekends for a drink . some mayoral visits are followed by emails from emanuel to top staffers , demanding faster garbage pickup or better signage to direct visitors to nearby disconnect between the riverwalk 's new and old sections is the mayor 's latest pet peeve for his pet project . `` if you said to any of your colleagues , ` i 'll meet you at the riverwalk , ' this is n't where they would say , '' emanuel said , turning to point to the older sections and its worn asphalt mayor 's decision to spend now on the riverwalk , though , is sure to draw some criticism as emanuel faces 10 challengers in his bid to win a third term in the february 2019 election . ",
        "the race comes while the city struggles with ongoing violence , and his detractors regularly say he 's not doing enough for the south and west sides ' economically depressed along a grassy stretch of the riverwalk as tour boats chugged by , emanuel dismissed that type of criticism by rattling off a long list of the other projects he has funded . `` my view is these are n't either-or choices , '' emanuel said , repeating his go-to response when he 's asked about spending in one area and not another . `` i do n't look at this cavalierly . ",
        "we 're also making investments in our parks , playgrounds , our schools , community colleges , mass-transit system , road paving , summer jobs program , mentoring ... governing is to choose . i get that . and i think the riverwalk has been a good investment for the city . `` city improvementsthe portions of the riverwalk emanuel wants to overhaul have a varied long section between lake shore drive and michigan avenue dates to the early 1970s , said michelle woods , the riverwalk 's project manager for the city . the piece between michigan and state that includes the vietnam war veterans memorial was completed in the mid-1990s under former mayor richard m. daley , who had a vision of continuing the walkway managed to make that happen in 2013 , when he secured a $ 99 million interest-free loan from onetime chicagoan and then-president barack obama 's administration . ",
        "the loan cleared the way for city hall to embark on the expensive work of building the riverwalk further into the chicago river by altering the seawall and bringing the walkway down to the water 's edge . the city will repay the federal government over 30 years with its share of proceeds from riverwalk riverwalk 's older section is more elevated at 12 to 15 feet above the water 's surface . while emanuel eventually would like portions of the eastern riverwalk moved closer to the water , that 's not planned in this project . with no heavy infrastructure changes , a lot of the city 's work will focus on what emanuel called `` cosmetic '' changes , while businesses will install upgraded facilities , including near lake shore drive , dozens of trees would be planted and a tiered seating area would be installed , according to renderings from the city 's hired design firm muller2 . ",
        "the walkway , which currently runs closer to wacker drive , will be brought to the seawall 's edge , with mature trees planted near the roadway to muzzle some traffic noise . `` right now , there 's just some grassy areas but not really any defined public spaces , so you have just people sitting all over the grass and dirt , '' said aaron gershenzon , a co-owner of urban kayaks , which operates on that end of the riverwalk . `` having some designated areas where people can sit and have a nice time will be great . ",
        "`` farther west , a space is conceived for a monument recognizing submarines that were manufactured in wisconsin after the attack on pearl harbor . the submarines passed through lake michigan and the chicago river , down the mississippi river , out to the gulf of mexico and eventually to the pacific for use in world war ii . a private group is working on raising money for a statue there , reynolds , there will be `` beefed up '' landscaping , with some trees getting removed . `` a lot of the trees down there , they 're green , but they 're weeds , '' reynolds said . ",
        "`` and so , the way we 're going to approach this is , if we can clean them up and save them , we will . otherwise , we 'll get rid of them and put in new so we can give it a much more cultivated look . `` aaron zacharias , one of the proprietors working to open the northman beer & cider garden on the eastern stretch , said he hopes the city does n't rip out too many trees and just uses a few modern design elements to tie both ends together . `` i really like the appeal of having more of a park area on the river . ",
        "i think it was just lacking in having some basic infrastructure , which hindered the tenants ' abilities to really expand and realize their visions , '' zacharias said . `` i personally hope it retains its character where you can sit under the trees on the water , which is remarkable in a city with the size and density of chicago . ... we do n't want to sit on a parking lot . there is all the concrete you can dream of west of michigan avenue . `` near columbus drive is a long stretch of beams as part of the wacker drive structure that also includes a city impound lot . ",
        "reynolds said the vision for that area is for the city 's department of cultural affairs and special events to lure a corporate sponsor to pay for large art installations that would mask that portion of city plans two gateways on either side of michigan avenue , welcoming visitors and enticing them to venture down from upper michigan avenue and wacker drive , reynolds said . one gateway is envisioned near where mercury launches its boat tours through its first lady cruises fleet , just east of michigan avenue . emanuel wants the other to span over the top of a large staircase that descends from the west side of michigan avenue to the michigan and state , the city plans to make the walkway more efficient , put in more mature landscaping and cut into a ramp leading down from lower wacker drive to provide more walkway space . ",
        "the city also would build a series of retail stands to feature restaurants from chicago 's various neighborhoods for three or six months at a businesseswhile the city plans to spend $ 10 million for the upgrades , it 's requiring nearby businesses to make significant investments to improve their sections of the part of the city 's approval of the vista tower on the south side of wacker drive , the developers agreed to build a walkway that will connect the tower and the lakeshore east development with the riverwalk . the developers also are on the hook for building a glass elevator structure that would take pedestrians from upper wacker drive down to the riverwalk , which currently has three handicap-accessible ramps but no businesses also have signed contracts with the city committing millions of dollars to spruce up the greenway 's eastern end . ",
        "they 'll be on the hook for path improvements and new fencing along the seawall in addition to building restrooms and paying for water and sewer connections , among other improvements to help their businesses thrive . `` we 're really trying to leverage our vendors . within their footprints , it 's clearly their responsibility and then we 're filling in the gaps , '' said reynolds , the facilities commissioner . `` so , yeah , $ 10 million is going to be skinny , but i think if we 're creative , we can do it in a way that really stretches a buck . ",
        "`` when the city built the new stretches of riverwalk to the west , it had to build the space and persuade businesses to open on shorter-term deals . that includes chicago brewhouse , which opened near wabash avenue last month on a three-year the eastern side , the city is granting 10-year leases with the possibility of two additional five-year extensions . in exchange , it is asking the businesses to pay for public improvements to the path and its illustrate what he called the desirability of locating along the river , emanuel said city winery did $ 1 million in business for july alone , a new record for the riverwalk . ",
        "that type of upside , he said , is why the four businesses on the eastern end have agreed to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars each on public improvements . `` they 're willing to invest that money , because this is now part of chicago 's cultural landscape , '' emanuel said . `` this is not that risky of a business proposition as it was five years ago . `` on the end near lake shore drive , urban kayaks has been open for business over the last eight years , gradually making improvements after a series of year-to-year leases and finally a three-year agreement with the city . ",
        "the company just signed a new 10-year lease that will allow it to make longer-term investments while also building the urban kayaks cantina , which will serve up tacos and margaritas to visitors . `` having a constant power source , dedicated internet , running water , sewer lines , public restrooms -- all of that is such a game-changer for us , '' said gershenzon , the urban kayaks co-owner . `` we 're very excited about this , very eager for the process to start . `` as part of its lease , urban kayaks has agreed to spend $ 750,000 for riverwalk improvements , separate from any upgrades it will make to its business and the construction of its restaurant , according to a city contract . ",
        "that includes $ 375,000 to renovate the riverwalk path , $ 75,000 to build the new railing , $ 150,000 in new utilities and $ 150,000 in landscaping , records city 's annual licensing fee for the kayak business will increase from $ 15,000 to $ 30,000 over the length of the deal , while the cantina will pay $ 50,000 by the end of the 10-year agreement . the city estimates the two urban kayak businesses eventually will produce more than $ 2 million per year in annual revenue , with the city taking a 10-percent cut of the restaurant business and a 7-percent cut of the kayak rental business by the end of the deal . ",
        "if urban kayak signs on for the two five-year extensions , the city 's cut increases to as high as 14 hall has struck a similar deal with island party hut , which operates a boat cruise , bar and restaurant on the eastern end . the restaurant plans to build a new , year-round glass structure with a roof that retracts and doors that slide all the way open , said woods , the city project its contract , island party hut has committed to spend more than $ 1 million in improvements for its riverwalk section , including $ 250,000 on its dock wall . ",
        "the improvements also include utilities , landscaping and costs associated with building a new kitchen , restaurant and public restrooms . by the end of the 10-year deal , the city estimates island party hut will do more than $ 10 million per year in business with the city getting a 7-percent cut , increasing to 10 percent if an extension is signed , records northman , a north center establishment that dubs itself chicago 's first cider bar , is opening up a spot on the riverwalk 's eastern end later this year . under its 10-year deal , it will build a bar and restaurant , committing $ 600,000 in improvements , including landscaping , a children 's play area and green screens and a mural to cover lower wacker drive , according to the contract . ",
        "the city estimates the northman will do $ 3 million in gross revenue annually by year 10 and will collect 3 percent of revenues in the front half of the contract and 10 percent in the final five years , in addition to annual licensing fees . `` it had to be a 10-year deal . we could n't have taken the risk on a three-year deal , and the city knew that and that 's why the city offered it to entice people to put that type of capital investment , '' said zacharias , the northman owner . ",
        "`` remember , in 10 years , if we do n't re-sign , this is all city property . `` like island party hut , zacharias said the northman also is looking at building a structure that could operate all longest-running business on the eastern side of the riverwalk is the 83-year-old boat tour business run by mercury 's first lady cruises . mercury is planning to install new ticket windows clad in wood , new landscaping and large wooden bench seating that screens a portion of wacker drive . mercury has agreed to make improvements to the riverwalk as part of its current city contract , but the company and city officials are still negotiating the final president holly agra said she did n't have the specifics on how much the company might spend , but said it looked forward to all the long-time riverside tenant 's improvements along the river . ",
        "`` we 're in the process of planning the modernization of the appearance of our box office and operational facilities to bring them in step with the aesthetic of the newer sections of the riverwalk , '' agra said . `` we 've been an anchor tenant with the city for so many years , and we 're thrilled to see so many new vendors and activities that are bringing more people down to the riverwalk . `` future expansion ? the book of renderings for the city 's $ 10 million in riverwalk improvements is labeled `` short-term improvements , '' which begs the question : what is the long-term plan ? ",
        "emanuel acknowledged the city would like to build into the seawall and bring the walkway closer to the water east of michigan avenue . the mayor said that when he attended a recent meeting in washington with federal transportation officials about high-speed rail to o'hare international airport , he raised the possibility of refinancing the city 's existing loan or getting an extension to make that additional riverwalk work mayor raised the issue at a time when he has continued to rail against republican president donald trump on a wide range of issues including immigration and gun laws . `` i told them what was going on here , and then i offhandedly said , ` i do n't imagine this administration doing a loan for this mayor , ' '' emanuel said , adding that the response he got was , `` do n't assume anything . '' ",
        "so , the mayor said he has directed his aides to start tallying up estimates for more riverwalk additions to present to the trump the meantime , as emanuel ramps up his re-election efforts , expect to hear him regularly tout the riverwalk 's progress and the planned improvements -- even if it may open him up to critiques on what he has or has n't done outside of downtown . `` in 2011 , i said we 're going to make the river the next recreational park of the city , '' emanuel said . `` and the truth is , on a lot of levels , it has totally surpassed -- in a quicker time -- anything i could have , or any of us , could have imagined .
