        "uncertainty about how hard the white house may crack down on the controversial h-1b visa appears to be behind a drop in demand for foreign mbas graduating from universities , said the head of the non-profit that runs business school admission employers in the plan to hire international mba graduates this year than last , according to the graduate management admission council , which runs the gmat and conducts research into mba-hiring trends . while 55 percent of companies last year said they planned to hire foreign mba grads , only 47 percent said the same this year , according to the council 's 2018 corporate recruiters survey report , which is based on responses from more than 1,000 firms world-wide . ",
        "`` this dip in stated intent by employers to hire international graduates is potentially a response to the changes -- or potential changes -- to visa and immigration regulations , '' said council ceo sangeet chowfla . `` even though h1-b visa rules have n't yet changed , there is a perception that they might change in the near future , and some employers may be waiting to see what will happen . the jobs market in the right now is robust , and companies are constantly having to evaluate their prospects and how best to fill their available roles with strong talent . ",
        "`` the h-1b visa , intended for highly skilled workers , has become a flashpoint in america 's immigration debate , with tech companies lobbying heavily for an increase in visa numbers and critics pointing to reported abuses and arguing that h-1b holders take jobs from administration of president donald trump has taken aim at the visa program . in january , citizenship and immigration backed away from a proposal to kick h-1b visa holders out of the country after six years . but the government has been laying a much heavier hand on the visa-granting process , denying more applications and more frequently demanding additional information from council 's findings fit with those of the mba career services and employer alliance , which determined that 68 percent of schools noted a decline in hiring so far this year for foreign full-time mba students compared to the same period last year . ",
        "`` as a result , many schools are more actively promoting a global job search as well as creating connections with employers in students ' home countries , '' said jamie belinne , board president for the 's crackdown on immigration also appears to have led to slower growth last year in the number of `` optional practical training '' work permits , which are often used by foreign students and graduates as an alternative to the h-1b .
