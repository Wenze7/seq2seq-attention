        "chances are you 've owned or ridden in a toyota corolla . maybe you 've forgotten . the world 's best-selling car has done a historic job of blending in . that 's not the case with the 2019 toyota corolla hatchback . especially in blue this paint job would be like missing a rainbow . it 's bright and arresting , and the return of the hatchback to the corolla family comes at the perfect time in a world awash in had a similar hatch last year in the corolla im , but that was a vestige of the discontinued scion brand . ",
        "the 2019 corolla hatchback is all new and reflective of toyota 's makeover from boring appliance cars to something -- edgier , if not sexier . and it comes loaded with standard technology to appeal to that youthful demographic or to boomers who have come to rely on toyota 's reliable 's bold x-wing grille , with squinting eyes and a gaping mouth , looks good . on larger vehicles it seems to be something it is not : sporty . the hatch rides low , and with wheels pushed to the edges it looks much better than its taller sibling , the compact tester came in toyota 's sportiest xse trim , with 18-inch alloy wheels and a front-wheel-drive powertrain that is not quite as sporty as it looks . ",
        "the 168-horsepower four-cylinder engine could use a boost from a turbocharger , which is something toyota has avoided while the rest of the industry adopts turbo fours . the horsepower is competitive , but the 151 pound-feet of torque lags top-trim segment leaders such as the volkswagen golf and honda yourself -- toyota also uses a cvt , which has never not once been known for sport . but this is no ordinary cvt . it essentially has a first launch gear you can hammer up to about 20 mph before it moves to the bands and pulley of the cvt . ",
        "this `` dynamic-shift cvt '' then has a 10-speed , umm , simulator that can be drawn out for higher revs with small paddle shifters . a sport mode also enhances more urgent driving . it does not drone like other cvts . it would have been fun to test the six-speed manual , but the vast majority will opt for the 's not fast , but it 's not dull . and we averaged 33 mpg . the handling was pleasantly surprising . it can be pushed , and the uncluttered design of the cabin puts the driver in a pushing state of interior is where the xse stands out . ",
        "the light gray and black trim pieces soften the sharp blue exterior , and the climate controls are one narrow line of buttons . the 8-inch touch screen is embedded like an ipad in the dash , but it has a volume and tuner knob and a super clear backup camera . the steering wheel controls and 7-inch display in the instrument cluster let you avoid the touch screen for the most safety sense comes standard . the suite of advanced driver assistance systems such as adaptive cruise control , automatic emergency braking and lane keep assist would cost anywhere from $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 from other includes all the dings , pings and zings for free as well . ",
        "if you go over the speed limit , you get a ding . if your passengers do n't buckle up , ping . if you leave hands off the wheel long enough , about 15 seconds , the car will drive itself as long as it can read lines in the road . the tech does a pretty good job , though at one point over a bridge it swayed far to one side of the lane , then far to the other before righting itself . in construction with zagging lanes , we were more comfortable having hands on the wheel , which is pretty common for such advanced driver assistance systems . ",
        "otherwise tss works really well and you ca n't beat the only toyota invested as much in its outdated , frustrating entune infotainment system . it 's one of the worst systems on the market ; try using the voice commands to `` call akio toyoda '' and tell him to scrap it , and it 'll show a list of three-digit numbers to call for any contact . the layout is cramped even on full screen mode ; the buttons flanking the larger screen feel like something on a dollar store toy . hate entune . but it finally comes with apple carplay , which is a 's not much to hate about the corolla hatchback . ",
        "the front is spacious , the rear seats fit two teens without complaint , and we were able to fit four carry-ons in the back . there are sportier hatches such as the volkswagen golf , mazda3 , hyundai elantra gt and honda civic , but the corolla undercuts them on price with a loaded package . it 's enough to stand out amid crossovers , hatchbacks and fading memories toyota corolla hatchback xsevehicle type : hatchbackbase price : $ 19,990 as tested : $ 24,090 mpg : 30 city , 38 highwayengine : 168-horsepower 2-liter four-cylindertransmission : dynamic-shift cvtparting shot : value play with civic , golf , and .
