        "the midwest has lots of strange and wonderful regional dishes , and i feel safe saying no person has documented them as exhaustively as titus his website , smokin ' chokin ' and chowing with the king , he posts about nearly everything he 's eaten , from barbecue in austin , texas , to jerk chicken in jamaica . but the bulk of his posts are about cruising around the midwest in search of the best local a favorite burger joint in the small midwest town near where you grew up ? ruscitti has probably been there . that was definitely true for me when he wrote about the tiny hamburgers at hinkle 's . ",
        "i sat down with ruscitti at b'el bar + kitchen , which specializes in serving regional midwest dishes like pork tenderloin sandwiches and cincinnati chili , to get his opinions on what you should look for on your next road trip . the interview has been edited for clarity and : what 's the one midwest food that you 're surprised is n't more popular ? a : three or four years ago , i would have said smashed cheeseburgers . they originated in central illinois . that 's where steak 'n shake started . but now those are everywhere . ",
        "the detroit coney dog is also great . the best places use koegel brand natural-casing hot dogs . it 's a really good hot dog . the coney sauce is sort of like chili , but it 's so : are you surprised that detroit pizza is so popular now ? a : i 'm not surprised because it 's so good . i love it . buddy 's pizza is my stop . every time i 'm in detroit , i make sure to swing by buddy ' : explain to me the appeal of pork tenderloin : honestly , it 's the whole regional food thing . ",
        "if i 'm in iowa or indiana , that 's what i get . i mean , it 's just fried pork . sure , it 's not the most exciting thing , but when done right , it 's not much different from great fried chicken . i just like checking out the local spots . when i was in budapest , i tried a version of pork schnitzel , because it is really popular : is there any difference between the pork tenderloin sandwiches in indiana and iowa ? a : iowa is better . or the better ones in iowa are better than the best ones in indiana . ",
        "in iowa , they are so juicy . it 's not as much about being the biggest one ; it 's more about the juiciness . they use great pork , and it 's thicker . that said , it 's still only a once - or twice-a-year thing for : you 're an admitted fan of the detroit coney hot dog . what about coney dogs elsewhere in the midwest ? a : the chili cheese dog is so american . i actually love this thing called the spanish dog in rochester , ind. . you 'll find it at b & k drive in , which used to be a larger chain in the area . ",
        "spanish sauce is its thing . i do n't think it has anything to do with spain . basically , it 's a chili sauce , but with more tomato . they do spanish burgers : what 's an overrated midwest food ? a : honestly , the one i 'm done with is the horseshoe . i 've had a bunch in springfield , and they are always ok , but good luck enjoying the rest of your : what about springfield chili ? a : i actually like it . but you can only have one cup . ",
        "there 's so much grease . i like it with cheese and crackers . when in : and cincinnati chili ? a : i really do like the combination of chili and pasta . it 's great . last time i was in cincinnati , i went to price hill chili . the shop is so old-school , and i love that vibe . you know , the classic stools and long : you 've spent some time recently in st. louis . what do you think of the food there ? a : it definitely has some of the weirder stuff . ",
        "the st. paul sandwich is so : yeah . it 's egg foo young on white bread , and it 's named after a minnesota city , though it originated in st. : i love those regional american-chinese : what else can you find ? the brain sandwich . it 's sort of like a pork tenderloin , but slightly more tender . over the river in illinois , there 's buffalo fish . it 's a very flaky fish . it 's sliced and then fried , and you rip it off in pieces . i always look for toasted ravioli , and it 's not exactly weird , but how can you enjoy more than two of them ? ",
        "and then they put provel cheese on : what do you think of provel ? a : honestly , i think it kind of tastes like : people might not immediately think of fried tacos as something prevalent in the midwest , but you 've found a surprising number of : i think people think of fried tacos as definitely big in california and arizona , but they are also in the midwest . and i do n't mean places like taco bell that buy fried shells , but places that fry the whole taco to order . surprisingly , racine , wis. , has so many fried taco places . ",
        "you 'll also find them in the quad cities and east st. : what about further up north ? a : minnesota has the juicy lucy , where they put cheese in the middle of a burger patty . upstate has fry bread tacos . it 's sort of an american-indian thing . obviously , they serve a lot of fried walleye , which i absolutely : where is your favorite place to travel in the midwest ? a : wisconsin is my favorite . it 's just a beautiful state . it has two great lakes and the mississippi river .
