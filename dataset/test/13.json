        "until a couple of days ago , i had never heard of nia introduction to her came from an unexpected source -- the academy award-winning actress anne a single instagram post last week , hathaway was able to push the story of this young african-american woman 's tragic death onto the radar of mainstream america more quickly and with greater impact than anyone of wilson 's own race 's the astounding power of white privilege . and hathaway , one of the most influential members of the club of young hollywood elites , seems to understand that better than news of the a-list star lashing out at white people for ignoring the injustice of a black woman being `` murdered in cold blood by a white man '' made headlines . ",
        "a byproduct of the media attention was the story of an innocent young woman who died before she had a chance to experience 18-year-old student was standing on a subway platform in oakland , calif. , with two of her sisters a week ago when a white man wielding a knife followed her off the train and brutally stabbed her to death . wilson 's older sister was also bay area rapid transit police chief called the unprovoked violence one of the `` most vicious attacks '' he 'd seen in his nearly 30-year lee cowell , a 27-year-old homeless man with a long criminal history , has been charged with murder and attempted murder . ",
        "his family issued a statement saying that cowell had been found to have bipolar disorder and schizophrenia , and that `` the system '' had failed to provide him with adequate wilson 's family and many other african-americans see , though , is a hate crime -- plain and simple . authorities said they are still investigating cowell 's background and are n't ready to make that vigil for the teenager turned into a protest that drew hundreds of people into the streets of oakland . she has become the latest face of the #sayhername movement that recognizes black women who are victims of racial violence by police and another point in america 's history , the racial component of this killing might not have been enough to thrust it to the forefront of our country 's contentious struggle with race . ",
        "but in this modern era of heightened tensions , race quickly becomes the central element of nearly every conflict between blacks and is the divisive nation we have created for ourselves . ",
        "whether we choose to acknowledge it or not , race boils beneath the surface of every major disagreement we is one thing for african-americans to try to explain the imbalance of power that too often puts blacks at the receiving end of a police officer 's gun or , in wilson 's case , a stranger 's african-americans talk about race , many white people tend to write it off as race baiting , passing the buck or playing the race is impossible to get some white people to even listen when blacks talk about the fear of a loved one being stopped for a simple traffic violation .",
        "african-americans have never been able to convince enough white people that black lives why do african-americans keep trying to drill this point ? it 's not simply because blacks want all white people to like them . it 's because regardless of the changing racial and ethnic demographics in america , white people always will have the balance of power weighted on their side -- as it always has 's the white privilege hathaway was talking about on her instagram . `` the murder of nia wilson -- may she rest in the power and peace she was denied here -- is unspeakable and must not be met with silence . ",
        "she is not a hash tag ; she was a black woman and she was murdered in cold blood by a white man , '' hathaway wrote underneath a photo of wilson . `` white people -- including me , including you -- must take into the marrow of our privileged bones the truth that all black people fear for their lives daily in america and have done so for generations . white people do not have equivalence for this fear of violence . `` given those givens , we must ask our selves - how ` decent ' are we really ? ",
        "not in our intent , but in our actions ? in our lack of action ? peace and prayers and justice for nia and the wilson family . `` she ended the post with the hashtags #blacklivesmatter #antiracist #noexcuse #sayhername # course , hathaway is n't the only celebrity to speak out about wilson 's death . several african-americans , including viola davis , common , janelle monae and jada pinkett smith , have expressed their sentiments on social too often , black celebrities end up preaching to other black is more powerful than a privileged white person talking to white people about white hathaway might not have had any luck getting those who adamantly deny that white privilege exists to change their minds , she got further than any african-american got white people talking about white privilege with other white people . ",
        "and in the process , they were forced to say nia wilson 's name . "
