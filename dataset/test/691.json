        "welcome to clout street : morning spin , our weekday feature to catch you up with what 's going on in government and politics from chicago to springfield . subscribe : as mayor rahm emanuel stood with illinois attorney general lisa madigan on friday and declared their agreement to reform the chicago police department would `` stand the test of time , '' mayoral challenger lori lightfoot was watching once had appointed lightfoot to serve as president of the chicago police board , the civilian panel in charge of making the final decision in police disciplinary cases . the mayor also appointed the former federal prosecutor to co-chair his police accountability task force , which issued a series of recommended police reforms after the laquan mcdonald police shooting as she served as an emanuel appointee , lightfoot at times challenged the mayor 's commitment to police reform . ",
        "that was especially true after emanuel had agreed in the final days of president barack obama 's administration to allow a federal court to oversee and enforce reforms to the chicago police once obama left office , emanuel sought to reach an out-of-court agreement with the president donald trump 's administration . the mayor submitted a so-called memorandum of understanding to trump 's attorney general jeff sessions , but refused to release it publicly . lightfoot slammed it in june 2017 as `` fundamentally flawed '' and leaving the chicago police department `` set up for failure . `` a few months later , madigan sued emanuel 's city hall and forced the mayor back into negotiating what he had committed to with the obama administration -- a federal consent decree ensuring the police reforms . ",
        "`` let 's recount the history . this is the same guy who was perfectly content to not have the new trump justice department do anything , and who came up with a document -- that so-called memorandum of agreement -- that was n't worth the paper it was written on , '' lightfoot said in an interview after emanuel and madigan 's news conference . `` we are here in this moment because of lisa madigan 's courage , let 's make no mistake about it . rahm emanuel was drug kicking and screaming down this path , and i thank goodness our attorney general had the intestinal fortitude to see a need and step into a void . ",
        "we are going forward because of her , not him . `` in an emailed statement , emanuel campaign spokeswoman caron brookens said the mayor had `` first worked with the obama justice department to move forward with reforms that would improve public safety and policing .
