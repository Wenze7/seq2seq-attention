        "`` safe houses '' by dan fesperman , knopf , 416 pages , $ baltimore-based spy master dan fesperman 's latest , the past eerily overlaps with the present via two artfully linked 1989 , helen abell , a lowly 23-year-old cia worker stationed in berlin , witnesses a high-ranking agent sexually abuse a woman in a safe house and comes out of hiding to stop the attack . though warned by her superiors to back off the case , abell becomes determined to make the agent pay for what she learns is only the latest in a series of such assaults . ",
        "she goes rogue from the company and the compromised cia operative with whom she was having an years later , while living in a farmhouse on the eastern shore of maryland , she and her husband are shotgunned to death . the murder is pinned on their mentally challenged 24-year-old son , willard , but his older sister anna knows he never could have committed such an act . she hires an investigator to help her uncover the truth , not knowing anything about her secretive mother 's the best espionage novels , `` safe houses '' brilliantly traces the distance between high moral ground and low . ",
        "part of the fun of the book is reading it for a second time and seeing how the narrative seeds of the first part enrich and deepen what occurs in part two . `` the throwaway '' by michael moreci , forge , 318 pages , $ known for his comic books and sci-fi fiction , chicagoan michael moreci makes a serious foray into espionage fiction with this brisk and timely odd man out is mark strain , a sometimes shady washington lobbyist whose happy future with his pregnant wife , sarah , is upended when federal agents invade their bedroom , accuse him of being a russian spy and hand him over to russian intelligence -- supposedly as part of a prisoner exchange . ",
        "this comes after a done-deal with a client of strain 's to provide the pentagon with its security software is unexpectedly scotched . what cutthroat sold him out ? what state secrets are so at risk that he is expendable ? he has plenty of questions that need answering after he escapes the clutches of the russians and fights his way back to washington . `` the throwaway '' boasts a wide assortment of cliches and stock characters , and strain pulls off at least one unlikely `` mission : impossible '' - type scheme . but moreci is good at action scenes , a friendly female double agent livens things up , and you can bet the russkies are going to go after sarah after losing their man . ",
        "moreci 's unassuming style also pays dividends : this is that rare contemporary thriller that is happy to treat the reader to a clean , linear narrative -- no parallel plots or time jumps to slow things down . `` rip the angels from heaven '' by david krugler , pegasus , 336 pages , $ year is 1945 . rarely has a double agent been in more over his head than naval intelligence man ellis voigt . he is being targeted not only by the russians he has infiltrated -- they suspect he had something to do with the disappearance of the head of their washington spy ring -- but by the fbi , which thinks he 's a commie who murdered a navy the heart of the plot is the passing of crucial intel about the atomic research going on in new mexico . ",
        "as in `` the throwaway , '' the hero hooks up with an attractive female playing both sides of the street . before luring the russians into a disinformation scheme in los alamos , he must endure a grueling torture session you may want to skip past . he also is tormented by his failure to save a young boy from getting shot . `` rip the angels from heaven '' has its own cliche problems , not to mention unfortunate lines such as , `` my mind raced as i tried to keep my composure . '' but author david krugler , who acquired his doctorate at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign , is terrific at period details and atmosphere , and makes a complicated plot tick -- and go sachs , a freelancer , writes regularly about crime fiction for the tribune .
