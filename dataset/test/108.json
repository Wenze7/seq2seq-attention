        "devices running android p ca n't have more than two notches , according to google . also , manufacturers ca n't place a notch on the left and right sections , only the top and bottom . google has now laid down the law of the land when it comes to phone notches -- a mobile device should n't have more than two , the company mountain view , california , search company developed notch support for android p fairly recently after phone makers started copying the iphone x design . so now it wants to enforce some ground rules in case anyone is planning to go crazy with their respective notch phone ca n't have this many notches , according to googlein a blog post addressing developers , android ui product manager megan potoski said that google is working with device partners to `` mandate a few requirements '' for app compatibility purposes . ",
        "notch limits are among those p devices ca n't have more than two notch cutouts . manufacturers are only allowed to put a single notch on each side of the device , and they 're not allowed to put them on the left and right portions of a surface -- only the top and , no manufacturers have come out with more than one notch thus far , so google 's preemptive strike on the notch craze is all theoretical . even still , there 's reason to believe multi-notch phones are going to happen eventually , so google 's thought process must have been , `` they 're going to go insane with notches ; might as well set ground rules now . ",
        "`` the restrictions do n't mean that google intends to interfere with manufacturer 's design ideas for smartphones . rather , they want to make sure android p will run smoothly and look user-friendly on any device , notch or no notch . companies are welcome to design phones with more than two notches . heck , they can even go completely bonkers and put 23 notches in there , but they will have to find another operating system that can support that because android p simply wo n't accommodate that kind of google is laying down notch restrictionsthe real point to these restrictions , as the verge notes , is to make sure apps run properly no matter which device they 're installed in . ",
        "it 's necessary for google to enforce these rules because some notches cut into the actual content on screen , making it hard to see them clearly . android p wants to make sure that never happens . `` the good news is , for the most part your app should work as intended even on a cutout device , '' according to final version of android p is supposed to roll out near the end of summer , though it likely wo n't make its way to commercial devices until the end of fall . google says android now runs on 16 phones with notches from a number of different companies , and that is likely to grow in the coming year .
