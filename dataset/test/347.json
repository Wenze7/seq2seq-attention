        "san francisco -- the giants reinstated third baseman evan longoria thursday , adding a key hitter to the lineup just in time to replace the bat of brandon belt , who 's headed to the 10-day disabled list after hyperextending his right knee in seattle wednesday addition , the giants recalled right-hander chris stratton from triple-a sacramento and sent down infielder kelby tomlinson . amidst the flurry of moves , the team also optioned left-hander ty blach to triple-a sacramento only to recall him giants ultimately decided to place belt on the disabled list because an mri revealed a bone bruise in his knee thursday . ",
        "`` he 's going to be down for a few days , probably five days before he can start doing some activities , '' giants manager bruce bochy said . `` we decided to put him on the disabled list to give him time to get ready . it 's hard to go short when he probably wo n't be playing for 10 days . `` longoria , who 's been sidelined with a fractured hand since june 15 , will hit in the no . 5 hole and play third against the milwaukee brewers thursday giants are hoping that longoria will give the middle of the lineup some much-needed pop . ",
        "the team 's heavy bats are n't getting the job done right now . belt was 1 for 33 before he injured his knee while legging out an infield single wednesday . all-star shortstop brandon crawford is batting . 162 with just three extra base hits in the month of july , outfielder andrew mccutchen is hitting . 212 with two extra base hits over the same period and catcher buster posey is stuck on five home runs and 32 rbi through 85 , meanwhile , has been somewhat of a disappointment since he joined the giants in a trade with the tampa bay rays last winter . ",
        "before he broke his hand six weeks ago , longoria posted a . 711 ops with 10 home runs and 34 rbi in 67 giants are hoping his bat catches fire as they attempt to chase down the los angeles dodgers , arizona diamondbacks and colorado rockies in the national league west standings . `` i assume he feels fine at the plate , '' bochy said . `` he better because he 's in there . `` the giants are also hoping that thursday 's moves will provide some relief to the , who started 18 games in the first half , will serve as a long man from the right side while blach tackles the same duties from the left side . ",
        "having a pair of arms available in the middle innings could ease some of the burden placed on the shoulders of reyes moronta and ray black , who 've combined to throw 14 2/3 innings this month . `` that 's the idea , '' bochy said . `` go with the extra pitcher , lighten the load for them . if we 're in a situation where we 're in the fifth , i can get one of those two up and not worry about not having a long man later . `` bochy said belt 's placement on the disabled list allowed the club to keep blach on the roster . ",
        "if the team had received a more optimistic prognosis on belt 's health , blach would have been reassigned to the minors , which is why he was optioned and recalled thursday . -- joe panik will start a rehabilitation assignment with triple-a sacramento thursday . "
