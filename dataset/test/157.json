        "a : five years ago , we were just coming out of the great recession . clearly the downtown has covered a lot of ground since then . we have probably had 2,000 residential units built downtown since then . there are probably another 1,500 in the pipeline . we are hoping to see more of : what has caused this increased activity ? a : office and residential rents are a little lower here in san jose . rents in places like cupertino , sunnyvale , palo alto and mountain view have gotten so expensive due to a lack of supply . ",
        "for whatever reason , those cities have chosen not to continue with housing development as aggressively as they have with office : how important is the proposed google village and development to what you are trying to accomplish in downtown san jose with the graduate residential tower and other projects ? a : we saw cisco 15 years ago try to move into coyote valley , which did not happen . i believe it will happen downtown with google , but it 's still not a lock . if google does come , there clearly will be many enterprise companies that will : how much of an effect would google have ?

        "a : san jose is the technology capital of silicon valley , but for some reason , google chooses to be based 15 miles north of here . but google and bart coming to downtown would be a game : what are the key uncertainties with google ? a : the question is : are they preserving this property for the future , or is google going to aggressively develop ? q : what is the next big thing that has to happen for downtown san jose to take a major step ahead ? a : it would need to be an enterprise company . ",
        "amazon has just moved into the wework space . that was a lot bigger step than just 20,000 or 40,000 square feet of offices . the fact they are here , and people want to work there , is clearly going to spur other enterprise companies to come into downtown san jose . i thought adobe was going to do it for us . adobe was the pioneer . we are so thankful adobe is here . but it 's going to take one or two more tech companies to show that san jose can be the technology capital of the world and that downtown can be the focus of : would more tech companies in san jose , including the downtown , help with the commute ? ",
        "a : people who work at apple every day , 55 percent of them come from the south , places like san jose . so more tech companies downtown and in san jose would make it easier for people to get to work . there are really not enough people working downtown to spur all the retail and restaurants we want here . you really need the foot traffic to make all the retail work , all the housing , the medical , the restaurants ; every single industry needs to be a part of the infrastructure that is already here : you recently expressed a grand vision for the guadalupe river and what it could mean for the downtown area . ",
        "how could the river area evolve in your view ? a : the guadalupe river is very underutilized , whether it would be for parks or some type of industry . a portion of those open spaces should be developed to a world-class level , parks , soccer fields , baseball , skateboard parks , kayaking , everything you could imagine in a recreational : what was the thought process that brought forward that guadalupe river proposal ? a : really , the idea was to catch people 's attention about the type of development that could be done at the guadalupe river .

        "unfortunately , you have to sacrifice a bit of the natural surroundings . but you have to look at the big picture . clearly , there is gold at the end of that : even before google , do you see the start of a vibrant downtown san jose ? a : bart is the key for downtown san jose . bart is more of a key even than google . to be able to live anywhere off a bart line and get to downtown san jose without your car would be huge . and you could combine that with uber or lyft .

",
        "this is no disrespect to the mechanical industry . but a lot of those companies are running their crews seven days a week , 10 hours a day . we have iron workers on our graduate job that have worked for the last 22 days straight , not one day off . being an iron worker is one of the toughest jobs in : how much have construction costs risen ? a : it 's been about a 30 percent increase since : have you ever seen increases of this type during your decades in the business ? a : no .

",
        "a : the most important part of that is it 's a different type of project . it 's student housing , with four bedrooms per unit , all within 800 square feet . so that changes the financial model by paying per bedroom as opposed to per : is that the type of flexibility that you apply to leading the swenson company ? a : if housing does n't work at a location , what about office , what about medical , what about assisted living ? i like to go into a different industry that is n't as saturated .
