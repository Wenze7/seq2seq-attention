        "the big apple . apple dodged a major financial bullet tuesday night , and the reason may have something to do with the hyperloop , the futuristic mode of high-speed transportation first proposed by tesla ceo elon calls the city of cupertino , ca home and , as the company has grown , so has its strain on the city . ",
        "to address one of its major apple-caused problems -- transportation -- the city proposed creating a `` head tax '' -- a tax that would charge any cupertino-based company with 100 or more employee a flat fee per it had passed , apple would have seen its tax bill jump from $ 17,000 to $ million , according to a report from the cupertino city council -- money cupertino would have used to fund new transportation the council voted down the tax on tuesday , and it could be because they think a cupertino hyperloop might be a better solution to their transportation the waters .",
        "according to a report by the silicon valley business journal , cupertino mayor darcy paul has met with hyperloop transportation technologies about the possibility of building one of the high-tech systems in cupertino . he also thinks apple might be willing to `` heavily subsidize '' its , however , has yet to comment directly on a hyperloop project , though the company 's director of state and local government affairs , michael foulkes , did suggest during tuesday 's meeting that cupertino officials work with apple on `` forward-thinking solutions '' to `` really be creative and find solutions for the long-term . '' ",
        "it takes a village . so far , all plans for a hyperloop in the are just that : plans . there still is n't anywhere in the nation a person can actually hop aboard a hyperloop . part of the hold up , according to htt ceo dirk ahlborn , is getting everyone to sign off on the project . `` democracy is n't friendly to these kinds of things . it 's a very large infrastructure project requiring a lot of people to work together , '' he told business insider in july . `` if you want to do this in the , you have tedious right-of-way issues . ",
        "in china or russia , however , all it takes is someone powerful to decide that they want it , and it happens . '' a win-win situation . in cupertino , getting everyone to work together might not be so hard . the city wants a solution to its transportation issues , and apple has made it clear it does n't want to pay the proposed head tax . presumably , apple would have to pay that tax every year . if it agrees to subsidize a cupertino hyperloop like paul thinks it might , the company may have an opportunity to trade that recurring fee for a one-time construction no one can seem to agree on exactly what that cost might be , apple is now worth a whopping $ 1 trillion . ",
        "so if any company can afford to take a risk on building a hyperloop , it 's probably apple . and with the city 's government already warmed up to the idea , it might not be long before apple employees get to enjoy the novelty of riding the cupertino hyperloop to work every day . "
