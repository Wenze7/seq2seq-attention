        "after experiencing a crash course in handling the likes of jake arrieta in helping lead the cubs to the 2016 world series title , catcher willson contreras is anxious to learn from newcomer cole hamels . `` for me , the most exciting thing is the experience he has in the big leagues , '' contreras said after the acquisition of hamels , a four-time all-star left-hander , from the rangers . `` that 's going to help me and the starters a lot . i think a lot of guys can pick his brain . `` contreras will listen closely to hamels ' preferences to accelerate the learning process as quickly as possible , and he does n't anticipate the cubs having four left-handers in the rotation being a problem . ",
        "`` the most important thing is the communication and to find out what wants to do and how much he pitches to the scouting report , '' contreras said . `` i think the communication will make the difference . i have to learn a lot of things about him , and i have a lot of questions . `` hamels , 34 , seemed just as eager to work with contreras . `` that will be exciting in itself , '' hamels said saturday . `` we 'll try to get our lingo down , our mannerisms and the anticipation of what we want to do . ",
        "`` hamels added that he often watched video of jon lester when he scouted a team he was about to face . '' cliff lee showed me the way , '' hamels said . `` i 'm sure lester and i can play off each other . '' "
