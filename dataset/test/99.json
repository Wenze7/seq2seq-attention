        "far less than the $ million grant he 'd have gotten for the primary if he qualified for state financing under connecticut 's clean election laws . `` i appreciate that perspective , '' ganim said to lamont as the two combatants sat inches from each other , side-by-side in a hot hall . ganim talked about regaining trust , a theme he repeats at every appearance - and portrayed himself as david vs. a financial goliath in his bid against lamont , who listed his family wealth at $ 90 million to $ 300 million in federal filings 12 years ago . ",
        "lamont had raised $ 189,000 from contributors and spent $ 924,016 as of june 30 -- and is also not participating in the public financing program , so he can spend as much of his own money as he chooses . `` i 'd like to think that even without public funding , with a grassroots effort , both for votes and for money , that it will be people over power , '' ganim said . earlier wednesday , at a meeting of the hearst connecticut media group editorial board , ganim said he considered limiting his fundraising to $ 100 increments to meet the public financing requirements even after he was rejected - which might have set him up to mount a legal challenge to collect $ 6 million in public funding for a general election if he were to win the primary . ",
        "now , he ca n't bring such a challenge even if he wins because he did n't adhere to the fundraising limits . `` we had to make a decision , was it to try and be competitive in a court case and probably ineffective in a campaign , '' ganim said , `` or move forward ? '' with the specter of a months-long court case , he gave up on public financing . he again called for financial disclosures and criticized lamont 's wealth , which is both earned and inherited - a bit that plays well with urban audiences such as the `` greater new haven votes 2018 '' forum sponsored by the community foundation for greater new haven . ",
        "`` i 've got nothing to hide , i 'm proud of how i 've earned my money , i work my heart out every day , '' lamont said . `` i 've created businesses , i 've created jobs ... and my wife has worked her heart out , so i 'm proud of what we did , i 'm not going to apologize for that . '' his wife , annie huntress lamont , is a longtime venture capital investor who founded her own firm to finance health care and financial technology startups . lamont called for unity . ",
        "`` you want a democrat fighting to make sure everybody of color , immigrants in our society , are protected and we do n't want the trump onslaught coming through . '' "
