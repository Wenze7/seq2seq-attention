        "san francisco -- the charge pg&e took in the second quarter alone for northern california wildfire-related costs nearly equaled the company 's $ million penalty in 2015 for a natural gas explosion that killed eight and wrecked a san bruno neighborhood in 2010 . ",
        "that was the largest regulatory punishment ever imposed on a utility , and the company was later found guilty of crimes it committed before and after that explosion , a verdict that branded pg&e a convicted the net loss on the company 's bottom line , pg&e 's shares soared about 4 percent and closed at $ after it posted profits from operations of $ a share , which topped wall street 's forecast of 95 & e has waged a campaign to change the state 's legal framework for determining whether utilities and their shareholders -- or the companies ' rate-paying customers -- ultimately pay for costs associated with wildfires sparked by the utilities ' infrastructure .",
        "a state legislative conference committee is considering various proposals from gov. jerry brown and lawmakers , but pg&e on thursday labeled the governor 's plan as `` insufficient . '' brown 's proposal would ease utilities ' future potential wildfire-related liabilities , but would n't apply to costs for the october 2017 francisco-based pg&e told analysts during the conference call that it may have to slash spending on maintenance , equipment and clean energy , unless it receives favorable outcomes from legislative proposals the utility supports in sacramento . pg&e also said insurance premiums and its costs have jumped in the aftermath of the brown 's plan , if adopted , could dramatically ease the potential wildfire-related financial burdens on large utilities such as pg&e -- and potentially shovel more costs onto ratepayers ' shoulders . ",
        "`` the governor 's proposal is constructive , but it is insufficient , '' said geisha williams , pg&e 's chief executive officer , during a conference call `` it is an important input , but more work is necessary . the time for action is now . `` other proposals include altering the use of a legal principle known as inverse condemnation , which holds utilities strictly liable if their equipment was a factor in starting a wildfire , even if the utility properly conducted maintenance and facilities upgrades ; efforts to ease the financial burden from liabilities pg&e faces for the october 2017 fires ; and a move to reduce potential costs from future the one-time costs associated with the october wildfires , pg&e would have earned $ 601 million from its operations in the three-month period that ended in june . ",
        "operating profits were percent higher than in the second quarter of last utility 's equipment and facilities were determined by state fire investigators to have caused 16 wildfires last fall , including 12 of the october wildfires in northern the 16 fire incidents , state investigators alleged that the company violated the law in 11 blazes in pg&e succeeds in , its effort to get the state to change how liabilities are assigned and paid , it could pass wildfire costs on to its effort has prompted opposition , however , from insurance companies . `` the insurance industry is saying hold your horses in terms of getting rid of inverse condemnation , '' said paul patterson , an analyst with glenrock equities . ",
        "`` a whole ecosystem related to inverse condemnation has been built up over the decades that may be tough to change in a month . `` pg&e said it must navigate an increasingly challenging landscape for insurance coverage in the wake of the fires . `` some carriers have significantly reduced their exposure by reducing limits or excluding events that were previously covered , and all have significantly increased their premiums , '' said jason wells , pg&e 's chief financial officer , during the conference call . `` we are seeking to transfer approximately $ 1 billion to $ billion of financial risk to the insurance and capital markets . ",
        "`` the cost of this new insurance coverage is expected to be $ 350 million . ",
        "at present , pg&e customers are covering , through a portion of their monthly bills , $ 50 million in costs for wildfire-related means higher monthly bills loom over customers just to cover higher insurance proposals under discussion in sacramento include wildfire safety and prevention , forcing utilities to upgrade their aging electricity systems , vegetation control , changing how liability for wildfires is assigned , using a bond measure to ease pg&e 's financial exposure to the october 2017 fires , and creating a path to alleviate cost burdens from future & e warned it might have to chop capital spending if the legislature fails to adopt wide-ranging reforms that are to the utility 's liking .",
        "it also raised the specter of higher monthly gas and electricity bills for customers . `` we will never sacrifice safety-driven work , but as long as these flawed policies remain in place , we must carefully evaluate whether we can support our current level of capital expenditures , '' williams & e appears to be under intense pressure , said state sen. jerry hill , a frequent critic of pg&e whose legislative district includes san bruno . `` we are hearing a level of desperation from pg&e leadership , '' hill said . `` they know they are responsible for much of the fire damage and they desperately need to change the liability laws . ",
        "pg&e wo n't rest until it changes the laws it keeps breaking . '' "
