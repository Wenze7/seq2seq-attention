        "`` this album was about letting go of what people say is cool-sounding , what people think is cool-sounding , even what i think is cool-sounding , '' said actress and singer brittany `` stay gold , '' her third album , campbell made a conscious decision to abandon some of the conventions that define contemporary r&b to return the genre to its rightful origins . `` there was something about making electronic sounds that was n't really doing it for me , '' campbell said . `` i really wanted some live elements in there . it was just so important to me with this one . '' ",
        "campbell added her live band to the studio recordings , giving `` stay gold '' a richer vibe of its record was made with intention . it is an album of deliberate , delicate decisions . album opener `` mean '' may begin with synthetic keys and campbell 's slow , warm , honeyed vocals , but it soon builds into a lush , multilayered wonder . for the average listener , it may be difficult to decipher the electronic accompaniments from the live ones , a balance campbell said she spent a good amount of time trying to figure out . ",
        "`` figuring out how to mesh the analog sound with the digital was also sort of tricky . it was something i had to take my time with to still maintain the coolness of the music , '' she a beat-maker and producer in her own right , campbell needed to leave behind her natural instincts to `` make beats all the time , '' quickly craft her album on her computer and release it on soundcloud . `` this time , i wanted to be deliberate with every aspect : production-wise , songwriting-wise , '' campbell acknowledged . `` it was a lot of trial and error , with just me alone editing it all together and me picking and choosing what works and what does n't . ",
        "`` but before the editing process even began , campbell said , the album had been a work in progress dating back nearly two years . like many artists , campbell said the 2016 presidential election affected how she made art and the type of art she wanted to make in the future . `` i remember that day . i remember my friends that day , and i remember the aftermath of people being so angry on social media and just in the world , '' campbell said . `` it made me think about people and about humans . ",
        "our ability to disassociate with one another so easily and disconnect . my feeling , even in the face of the election , is that i 've never been a human being to disconnect from others . `` for campbell , `` stay gold '' was an opportunity to communicate with others on a more intrinsic level . `` i 'm a dreamer and sort of utopian in a way and i did n't want the record to feel like a statement . i wanted it to be something people could connect to , '' she help her in the creation process , she spent a lot of time listening to albums she knew could help her shape what she wanted to accomplish with her album . ",
        "one record in particular -- marvin gaye 's `` what 's going on '' -- was especially poignant . `` that album is the pinnacle of all albums to me . it finally gave me the motivation and bravery to even put my assurance on myself , '' campbell result of campbell 's studying and slow craftsmanship is an accessible record sure to appeal to even the most finicky of listeners . `` i wanted it to be an honest , honest album , '' campbell said . `` i wanted to make sure all of the messages were clear .
