        "the chorus is growing around wrigley field , though javier baez is trying not to unless he starts wearing headphones 24/7 , it 's going to be impossible to shut out the mvp talk attached to his game like friday 's 5-4 victory over the padres , in which baez homered , tripled , pulled out his swim move and threw a runner out at the plate , provided yet another example of his value to the cubs on offense , defense and the basepaths , not to mention the overall buzz factor at wrigley he is hitting . 407 with four homers , a triple , three doubles and 10 rbis over his last seven games , leading the league with 84 rbis and head-turning moments . ",
        "`` it makes me nervous , to be honest , '' baez said . `` i do n't want to play with numbers . we 'll see at the end , in september . and when we get to september , it 's going to be about playoffs . we 'll see . when things come up and when the numbers come up , we 'll see in the offseason what i get for this season . `` the cubs eeked out a victory over the padres despite a shaky ninth inning from pedro strop , who gave up a pair of runs but was saved with one out and a runner at third when third baseman david bote fielded a grounder off manuel margot 's bat and nailed cory spangenberg at the plate with the tying run . ",
        "strop then struck out austin hedges to end it , gyrating on the mound and pumping his fist twice to celebrate . `` too many times in our industry we get hung up on offensive numbers but we won the game based on defense , '' manager joe maddon said . `` two plays at the plate , two outstanding plays . one by javy , and one by bote at third base . to me , that 's the game . `` jose quintana earned his 10th victory with a dominant six-inning outing , allowing one run on four hits with six strikeouts and no walks . ",
        "it was the quintana the cubs thought they got when he was acquired last year for top prospects eloy jimenez and dylan cease . with the arrival of cole hamels , the improvement of quintana and kyle hendricks and the demotion of tyler chatwood , the cubs rotation finally is beginning to build some momentum . `` everybody knows cole , and we know how much experience he had and how much he can bring , '' quintana said . `` i 'm really happy to be a part of a rotation like that . `` the cubs took an early lead on baez 's opposite-field home run in the second and ben zobrist 's third-inning sacrifice fly , and led 4-1 in the seventh on anthony rizzo 's solo home run down the right-field line . ",
        "the padres pulled to within two on steve cishek 's throwing error in the eighth and had the tying runs in scoring position when baez , who had moved from shortstop to second base to start the inning , threw out kevin jankowski at the plate . `` that 's javy being javy , '' bote said . `` that 's a baseball play . he read it , saw it was a line drive so kind of froze had to read it , make sure he did n't catch it . he noticed that and in a split-second made the adjustment to go home , and he was out by eight feet . ",
        "it was n't even bang-bang . he saw it , he read it . i do n't think he was pre-planning that . i think that was just him playing baseball and recognizing the situation . `` brandon kintzler got out of the inning by inducing christian villanueva to line out , and baez started the bottom of the eighth lining one to the right-field corner and beating the throw with his matrix-like slide into third . `` i do n't plan it , i just react to it , '' baez said . '' `` i just switch my hands . ",
        "i do n't know how i do it to be honest . it has happened more than three times this year , i keep thinking the ball is going to beat me and if i can do it i will do . hopefully they do n't catch me . `` maddon said `` you can never coach instinct , '' adding baez `` sees things '' no one else does . `` we kind of have this sign language communication going on during the game , '' maddon said . `` he sees things and i 'm back with him . ",
        "i would not mess with that kid 's head . he plays on the highest level mentally , and you do n't want to interfere with that . `` that 's what mvps do . but just make sure it 's whispered so baez ca n't hear it . `` if he continues to do what he does ... '' rizzo said . `` i 'm sure other guys around the league are having tremendous years as well , but he 's on a first-place team with a lot of expectations and he 's carrying the load . '' "
