        "`` a few fans , a few light bulbs , you ca n't turn on your ac , so you 're sweating like an animal , just dripping . '' it 's not what maria grubb had in mind five years ago when she and her brother opened gallo negro , an upscale restaurant in san juan , puerto rico . but that was before hurricane maria , before the farms she sourced from were destroyed , before her employees left the island . `` there 's no power , there 's no roads , everything 's flooded , '' grubb recalls . ",
        "`` mold covered everything , grease everywhere . we had to take everything out , repaint , redo the roofs . '' still , grubb counts herself lucky to have reopened at all , when many of her friends were forced to close their doors for good . she had a small generator , and used it to power a few light bulbs , and a weak fan she pointed toward her kitchen . before the hurricane , grubb was known for her modern cuisine , dishes she learned to make while training in new york restaurants . and this week , she returned to the city in hopes of spreading the word about her restaurant , and puerto rico . ",
        "in reality , grubb never had plans to cook professionally . growing up , grubb helped at her parents ' hot-dog cart , and remembers their seemingly endless shifts at the restaurants where they worked . food was a central part of grubb 's life , but it was as much a chore as anything else . by the time she was 8 , grubb was helping her mother in the kitchen even though she could n't reach the stove . `` she made me cook rice and beans , '' says grubb . `` we did n't have that normal childhood of like , ` can we go to the movies after school ? ' ",
        "` cause we had to go home and help cook . '' but when she and her husband moved to new york in 2002 , with her sights set on attending law school , cooking did n't feel like a chore . `` i just discovered so many amazing things here , like my first experience with truffles , all these things that really got me into cooking . '' at first , she was content to shop at her local markets , and cook elaborate meals at home . but the longer she was in new york , the more she wanted to cook professionally . ",
        "so grubb , who was 26 at the time , put her plans for law school aside , and enrolled at the international culinary center . she had a newborn son , and juggled culinary school and a job cooking at the currently closed french restaurant pastis . after grubb graduated with honors , she spent ten years working the line at new york 's fine-dining restaurants . she learned the names of every spice and vegetable at the modern when she cooked there with gabriel kreuther , and was part of danny meyer 's opening team at maialino . ",
        "she loved the 14-hour shifts , and learning about korean , vietnamese , and mexican food from the other cooks at family meal , and never tired of mastering new techniques . but she had a 12-year-old son with nonverbal autism at home , and the crazy shifts and sleepless nights were becoming too much . `` my husband is very supportive , but we had no other family to help us , and my son requires a lot of attention , '' grubb says . her parents still lived on the island , and her brother was talking about transforming the cafeteria he ran into a fancy restaurant . ",
        "only , he could n't cook . so grubb moved her family back to puerto rico , and took up the position of head chef at her brother 's restaurant . from the beginning , gallo negro was a huge hit . it also filled what grubb says was a gap in diversity when it came to dining on the island . `` there 's no vietnamese , there 's no korean , there 's no moroccan , there 's no ethiopian , '' grubb noticed . there was little she did n't already know how to cook , and her menus were full of inspiration and technique she 'd learned in new york , both on the line and from fellow cooks during family meals . ",
        "young puerto ricans and tourists filled her dining room , and she was able to hire more cooks and waitstaff . then the hurricane hit : `` the restaurant was a disaster , '' she recalls . `` a third of the island was still without power , and farmers were struggling to rebuild . not a single one of grubb 's waitstaff or cooks showed up for work on their first day reopening in january ; they 'd all left the island since the hurricane . a third of the island was still without power , and farmers were struggling to rebuild . ",
        "before the hurricane hit , grubb was known for her goat , rabbit , and fish dishes . after , however , all the local farms were destroyed , and their stands were shuttered . `` the only thing that we had was costco . it became a 100 percent costco menu . '' she found ground beef , tomatoes , spaghetti , pita , olives , and chicken . her new menu consisted of bolognese , `` greek nachos '' , chicken parmesan , and a brussels-sprouts caesar salad . `` i immediately just went to comfort food . ",
        "that was the menu i could put forward with no staff . '' it was how her parents cooked when grubb was growing up , and she no longer had the capacity to produce her technical , modern french and italian dishes . she 'd haul her day 's groceries back from costco , and prepare them alone in the swelteringly hot kitchen . `` you ca n't turn on your hood , or your ac or anything . i did n't expect to be cooking with just a few light bulbs and a fan blowing into my face .
