        "chalk comes off asphalt pretty quick . a little rain and it 's 's my concern about the chalk-drawn slogans and statements that protesters fed up with daily carnage on the south and west sides left behind on the safe streets of the city 's north shore drive , which the protesters managed to shut down on a busy thursday afternoon , was marked with dusty phrases . black lives matter . help my community . no more with the streets outside wrigley field , where the protesters finished their march . big blue letters with a chalky yellow outline : `` enough is enough . ",
        "`` good messages . important messages , delivered right into a part of the city where few could even begin to grasp the daily stress and pain that exist in the violent parts of chicago walled off from the they were messages in chalk . and they 'll be gone quickly . the breeze of passing cars , a quick summer storm or a street sweeper will erase them , and no visible reminder of thursday 's protest will remain . life on the north side will go on as usual and the routine murders in swaths of the south and west sides will continue , and i 'm not at all convinced that memories of the roughly 200 people who marched , hoping to force fellow chicagoans to pay attention to their plight , will 's why i hope the rev. gregory livingston , one of the protest 's organizers , meant it when he stood outside wrigley field and prayed : `` god , you are with us , and god , we have only just begun . ",
        "`` thursday 's traffic-snarling protest , like the larger anti-violence protest in july that shut down the northbound dan ryan expressway , needs to be only the beginning . both events drew national attention to chicago and its violence epidemic . national attention like that tends to rattle powerful people , and this city 's powerful people deserve ample phrase organizers of thursday 's protest used to distill their goal was brilliant and precise : `` redistribute the pain . `` they wanted to come to the part of chicago that is n't plagued by violence and peacefully create some inconvenience . ",
        "were you frustrated sitting in traffic on lake shore drive ? that stinks , but try living in a neighborhood where the routine sound of gunfire leaves children with post-traumatic stress it difficult for you to get to the cubs game ? probably not as difficult as living in poverty in an area with no economic opportunities , high crime and little in the neighborhoods many of the protesters came from is hell , daily , and those neighborhoods are as much a part of chicago as wrigleyville . that was kind of the point of this novel years on end i 've seen protests , prayer vigils and marches around the scenes of deadly shootings in north lawndale and englewood , austin and back of the yards . ",
        "nobody with the power to act listened . few paid fact , those who look on chicago 's poor communities with disdain would often trot out the line : `` why do n't people in those neighborhoods ever protest the violence ? `` they do , often . but the ignorant few who raise such questions never bother to see it bringing the protests out of the violent communities and into the safe ones is a logical next step . it 's going to make some people mad , and that might be good . it 's going to make some people more aware of the depth of this problem , and that would certainly be the only way these peaceful protests are going to work is if they persist . ",
        "a one-day interstate traffic jam makes a fleeting statement . a thursday afternoon lake shore drive detour is n't redistributing enough pain to leave a bruise on anyone 's communities being ignored have blood on their streets , not chalk . blood can be washed away just as well , but it leaves a memory of what happened in that spot . a community does n't forget where a child was murdered , or where a brother or sister , husband or wife , took his or her last 's so much pain in these neighborhoods you could never redistribute it all , nor would you want the activists and preachers and organizers who have started bringing their protests out of the shadows , the ones prepared to make life difficult in places where things are easy -- they 're on to something . ",
        "for too long , this violence has endured . for too long , powerful people in this city have ignored it while politicians have offered up wildly incomplete solutions to win who has tuned out the deadly day-in-and-day-out toll on the streets of our city needs to be rattled , needs to be made to feel uncomfortable . cries of help from street corners most will never pass have , of course , gone choice remains but to get louder , to force others to notice ? those white and yellow chalk slogans on lake shore drive will vanish i hope , as the rev. livingston said , that these protests have only just begun .
