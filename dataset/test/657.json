        "we 're searching for a description of the chinese government 's behavior and ca n't decide among bullying , extortion or coercion . the white house went with `` orwellian nonsense . '' geopolitical chutzpah also comes to beijing did was demand international airlines -- including united , american and delta -- change their websites to pretend taipei is no longer the capital of china claims taiwan as chinese territory , it does n't want to see any references contradicting that assertion . therefore , book a flight on united and taipei seems to float in space because `` taiwan '' has been deleted from the listing . ",
        "at some foreign airlines , including british airways and air france , china 's conquest of taiwan appears complete . both carriers list taipei as a city in `` taiwan , china . `` this is a symbolic power move by china . it has the feel of cold war-era propaganda , but let 's not dismiss it as simply playing games with maps . china is a rising military power with long-term ambitions to challenge the united states in the pacific . look at the south china sea and you 'll find the chinese have done more than monkey with place names : the people 's liberation army dredged sand to create islands with military installations in order to bolster claims of sovereignty over an expanse of ocean with crucial shipping as a potential flashpoint dates to the 1949 chinese revolution . ",
        "as communist forces took control , the nationalists -- led by chiang kai-shek -- fled across the strait to taiwan , which developed separately . beijing never relinquished its claim , while taiwan never proclaimed independence , leaving the island with an intentionally fuzzy identity . taiwan is a self-ruled democracy , a key trading partner with both the and china , and it has a security relationship with the united states . but officially , washington has diplomatic relations with beijing , not taipei . the status quo is odd , yet it every once in a while china tries to assert dominance , by , say , demanding that airlines change their references to taiwan . ",
        "europeans meekly obliged . carriers tried holding out , but china could strip them of landing rights on the mainland or banish them from websites there . fighting back would take a bigger effort by the government and china believes so strongly in symbolic actions , then let 's make the message clear : bullying airlines into fudging taiwan 's identity is an act of political aggression . american executives trying to do business on the mainland know they should be mistrustful of the chinese government . now they 'll get an extra reminder each time they consult a route map of asia .
