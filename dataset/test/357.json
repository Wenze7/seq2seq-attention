        "have you ever felt stuck in a relationship that went sour or trapped in a job that no longer rewards you but you just ca n't seem to quit ? meet the sunk cost effect . this is the same reason we have trouble getting rid of clothes we no longer wear or moving out of places we used to love that now drive us crazy . a new paper published in the journal psychological science explores our tendency to stay all in on a botched plan even when it flies in the face of rational decision making . why do we insist on throwing good money after bad ? ",
        "`` the sunk cost effect is the general tendency for people to continue an endeavor , or continue consuming or pursuing an option , if they 've invested time or money or some resource in it , '' christopher olivola , an assistant professor of marketing at carnegie mellon 's tepper school of business tells time . `` that effect becomes a fallacy if it 's pushing you to do things that are making you unhappy or worse off . `` one of the reasons we get snared in this psychological trap may be because we hate experiencing regret and admitting that we messed up , experts suggest . ",
        "sticking with the plan , even when it no longer works , is a way to avoid cognitive dissonance : the mental disconnect between paying for something and not getting the expected return on investment , olivola tells time . `` after we commit , we humans tend to shackle ourselves to our own decisions , '' as smithsonian magazine puts sunk cost fallacy might also be a self-defense mechanism , a way to reinforce our confidence in the effort we 've already put in -- basically , a way to save face with ourselves , as university of minnesota neuroscientist brian sweis told romance is an iconic example of `` sunk cost '' thinking . ",
        "sometimes people chain themselves to an unhappy relationship just because they 've already wasted so much time on it . if they cut and run , they will have to face the failure . `` romantic relationships are a classic one , '' olivola says . `` the longer you 've been together , the harder it is to break up . `` one of the most fascinating aspects of this tendency to stick with the plan , even when it 's a total bomb , is that it appears to happen in other species , such as mice and rats as the university of minnesota has studied . ",
        "like us , they have a hard time walking away from something once they have invested too much time in alex kacelnik , a behavioral ecologist at the university of oxford , told the scientific american : `` if you find that one species makes a systematically bad choice , you can argue it 's an accident of history . but if you find a very different species does the same thing -- then , come on , there must be some reason why evolution does n't eliminate this form of behavior . `` perhaps the most compelling reason to study the `` sunk cost '' phenomena is to be able to catch ourselves when we are unwittingly succumbing to it , despite our best interests . ",
        "it might help us let go of whatever is holding us back . `` what 's done is done , '' as olivola puts it . `` there 's nothing you can do to regain money that 's lost -- and pursuing something that makes you unhappy not only is n't going to get your money back , but it 's also going to make you worse off . you 're just digging a deeper hole .
