        "napa -- gruden was animated and right back at home after six weeks away from his whole team . asked if he had any flashbacks to his first training camp go-round with the raiders , he joked , `` i did when i saw jerry walk up , '' referring to our own veteran raiders beat man jerry mcdonald . `` my role at the beginning of practice is to let the assistant coaches do the fundamentals , a lot of the techniques that we 're coaching , '' gruden said . `` i had a hard time standing and watching , but it 's just awesome to be here ... i know i have a lot to prove and i 'm eager to do the best i can to do it . ",
        "`` the raiders ' best player , khalil mack , obviously was n't in attendance amid his current contract raiders proceeded with day 1 nonetheless , and here are 10 things to know from opening day in who 's on the first-team offensive line ? with donald penn on the physically unable to perform list to begin camp , rookie kolton miller is seeing first-team snaps at left tackle . as expected , kelechi osemele , rodney hudson and gabe jackson are manning the inside while 32-year-old breno giacomini starts at right tackle for the time being . the raiders ' offensive line took a step back in 2017 after a dominant 2016 , and they 'll need better showings from the tackle spots to return to that know osemele , hudson and jackson will always play like one of the best interior offensive lines in the league . ",
        "left tackle remains a big question mark with the 35-year-old penn still recovering from december lisfranc surgery and miller having yet to play in a nfl game . on the other side , giacomini lacks in pass protection , and young tackles brandon parker and david sharpe are unproven . one of those three will start at right tackle , where the raiders need something far better than what marshall newhouse gave them a year ago . `` tom shaw and the training staff have done an excellent job with our young linemen on both sides , '' gruden said . '' ",
        "... offensive tackles , we need a lot of work in that area and so far we 're very pleased . `` miller may have the most eyes on him of any player at camp given his first-round billing and potential need to step in at derek carr 's blindside right away . the raiders took him 15th overall in april 's draft for a reason . especially with penn sidelined for the time being , the spotlight will shine brighter on the youngest member of a unit hoping to return to its old bruce irvin already causing havocon friday alone , irvin recorded an interception and a forced fumble , shouldering the responsibilities of the defensive line 's leader without mack in easily picked off ej manuel and took it the whole way , finishing his pick-six with a backward fall into the end zone and airborne crotch grab a la marshawn lynch 's from his seahawks days . ",
        "irvin also forced a lynch fumble , which the defense recovered , teasing lynch by playfully punching him after he lost the has n't been shy about his excitement switching to defensive end . he 's publicly stated his preference of getting after the quarterback instead of dropping back in coverage , and made a goal of reaching double-digit sack totals for the first time in his career . if friday 's strong start was any indication , we might see an even more dominant irvin in 2018 . `` bruce irvin 's playing his natural position on an every-down basis , '' gruden said . ",
        "`` i think he 's a heck of a player . `` 3 . each quarterback throws an interception on day 1it was n't the best day for oakland 's signal-callers . first shaquille richardson picked off connor cook over the middle . then irvin plucked a terrible manuel pass out of mid-air and took it the whole way . then tevin mitchel , a 2017 practice squad defensive back , snagged a carr pass on the sideline . maybe mitchel did n't get both feet down before tumbling out of bounds , but it 'll certainly be talked about like an interception in the quarterbacks meeting 's no secret oakland 's qb play was subpar to say the least in 2017 . ",
        "carr tied his single-season career high with 13 interceptions , seven more than he threw in 2016 . manuel lost the only game he played and cook , the only quarterback on the roster with playoff experience , did n't see a single snap . the raiders better hope carr does n't go down again because cook and manuel constitute a sizable drop-off from no . so , carr needs to be miles better if the raiders want any chance at the playoffs . `` i ca n't say enough about him , '' gruden said of his starting quarterback . ",
        "`` he 's special . that 's all i 'll say . i could n't be more pleased . i 've worked with a lot of great quarterbacks in the past , but this man is as into football as any guy i 've met . and he 's talented , man . and how defensive line shook out without mackthe raiders ' first four defensive linemen during team drills without no . 52 were tank carradine , irvin , mario edwards jr. . and justin jr. . seems like he 'll play defensive tackle instead of defensive end this season , and ellis is back as a hole-plugger after re-signing on a three-year deal in the offseason . ",
        "maurice hurst will see plenty of time , too , as the staff is sky high on the rookie fifth-rounder from michigan . gruden loves third-rounder arden key from lsu and he looks to be the third or fourth defensive end behind mack , irvin and maybe raiders ranked last in the nfl with 14 sacks through 10 games at the time of ken norton jr. 's firing and finished tied for 24th with 31 sacks after john pagano took over . with a happy mack after he 's paid and a rejuvenated irvin , among others , the raiders are hopeful those numbers will make a jump in timetable for penn , hallhall hit the pup list with an undisclosed injury earlier this week , which gruden confirmed friday to be a pectoral strain . ",
        "the head coach said his rookie second-round defensive tackle will be out a couple days before returning to action . penn , who we knew was still recovering from foot surgery , will be back `` soon , '' gruden said . gruden wants his incumbent starting left tackle to prove he can swiftly change direction on a day-to-day basis before he returns to the mack , alexander placed on reserve/did not report listwe knew mack would end up on this list , but vadal alexander 's presence on it is unexpected . the third-year guard/tackle is suspended for the first four games of the regular season for violating the league 's policy on performance-enhancing substances , but that does n't mean he 's suspended from camp or preseason action . ",
        "both players do n't count against the 90-man how the secondary lineup looked at first glancein 7-on-7 drills , the first four defensive backs on the field were gareon conley and rashaan melvin at cornerback , with karl joseph and reggie nelson at safety . new raiders marcus gilchrist and leon hall slid into the slot position early in drills , and gilchrist 's versatility may allow him to start at safety this season , know what you 're thinking : how can the raiders start a 34-year-old nelson at safety after his performance last season . answer : he knows guenther 's defense from their time in cincinnati , and that gives him a leg up at the start of camp . ",
        "who knows if he stays in that leading role come week 1 . daryl worley and dexter mcdonald were the second set of outside cornerbacks , with shareece wright also seeing time in the play of the dayi think i have to go back to irvin on this one . we know he prefers putting his hand in the ground as opposed to dropping back in coverage , but his interception came when he ... you guessed it , dropped back in coverage . it might 've been a relatively easy pluck of manuel 's pass , but irvin added some flare by bringing the whole defense with him to the end zone and topping it off with an emphatic player quote of the dayderek carr on his good friend khalil mack : `` i have been on contact with him . ",
        "he 's my brother . we came in the same class . we 're gon na leave together some day ... he was over at the house and we did n't talk about one time . we played pool basketball and i dunked on him . `` 10 . jon gruden quote of the dayasked if he likes having fans watching camp or if they 're a distraction : `` as long as they 're fans . i love fans that are rooting for the raiders . the more the merrier . but all the critics , they have to sit over there in the cheap seats .
