        "when dreams become reality ... finally revealing my chanel small boy in black lambskin and ruthenium hardware . this is by far the best combination for this bag . after years of this bag on my `` dream wishlist '' of bags i 'd never thought i would own , here i am ! never did i imagine i would own this stunning bag so early on in my life . i worked extremely hard for this bag and it symbolizes how hard i 've worked this past about the bag ... i originally wanted the black caviar leather , but after finding out it was last season , i quickly converted to black lambskin . ",
        "however , i have to admit , i 'm happier i went with the lambskin . although the caviar might be more durable , the lambskin definitely looks better in my opinion . i did not like the look of the caviar on the boy bag , i like it way more on the flap bags . i went for the size small , not just because of price , but also because this bag looks way cuter in the small size . besides i do n't care much just anyways . with this being one of the hardest combinations to get , i am so ca n't wait to wear this bag out and share with you guys how i style this bag . ",
        "this bag will never leave my collection . be sure to watch my full unboxing video below or here . "
