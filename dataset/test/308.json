        "minneapolis , mn -- august 31 : torry mctyer # 5 of the miami dolphins carries the ball against the minnesota vikings in the preseason game on august 31 , 2017 at bank stadium in minneapolis , minnesota . the dolphins defeated the vikings 30-9 . there are sure to be at least a few surprises to come out of training camp . it looks like one is already emerging at dolphins camp and it 's a pleasant three days of miami dolphins 2018 training camp , we have been closely following a few position battles . one of the closest followed and most important is the starting cornerback job opposite xavien howard . ",
        "this battle is particularly important because , if you do n't win this job , you likely fall almost right out of the rotation since bobby mccain is locked into the nickel corner slot with minkah fitzpatrick most likely the next guy up in the battle seemed to be between second year man cordrea tankersley and the returning tony lippett off a lost season due to injury . we now have a new participant making waves in this undrafted free agent torry mctyer has entered the mix after a hot start at camp . it 's fair to say almost nobody saw this coming , at least not from the outside looking in . ",
        "we did see him get on the field last season , but there was nothing particularly memorable about his limited , he worked tirelessly this offseason and packed on eight pounds of muscle . when you combine his bulked up frame with his 40-yard dash speed , the dolphins may really have something coach adam gase has taken notice to mctyer 's development as he was given first-team reps on day 3 of training camp saturday . he has impressed with tight coverage , rare speed and outstanding anticipation leading to big plays on defense . no one is going as far to say that he is going to win this job over lippett and tankersley or that he is even close to being a favorite . ",
        "nevertheless , he has turned heads and almost certainly earned himself a spot on the 53-man roster . "
