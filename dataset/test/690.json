        "orange is the new black has some amazing characters that we adore , but let 's not forget about the ones we love to hate ! orange is the new black has introduced a slate of new characters in the sixth season following the location change to max . and while many of our favorites are still around like lorna , taystee , nicky , piper , alex , and red , there is now an emergence of some characters that we can not stand ! it 's hard to adjust to the drastic change in season 6 but it has been a welcome change in scenery as we mix the old characters with the new .
