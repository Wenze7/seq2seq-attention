        "in the annals of vicious black comedies whose theme is failing upward , `` the captain '' is surely among the most chilling and improbably fact-based . writer-director robert schwentke 's german-language picture , acquired for distribution by chicago-based music box films , is based on the bizarre true story of willi herold , a german paratrooper . separated from his unit in the chaotic final weeks of world war ii , herold came upon the abandoned car of a luftwaffe a back-seat suitcase , herold found his temporary salvation : the papers and uniform belonging to another man . ",
        "identify assumed , herold embarked on a fiendishly effective long-form improvisation , impersonating the officer in one tense situation after a prison camp for german army deserters , herold ordered the execution of more than 100 soldiers . he claimed he was specially designated by hitler to report on conditions behind the lines , and then do as he pleased . these bloody exploits continued for a while . desperate , inhumane times , the movie says in every single scene , breed the worst survival instincts known to humor settles like dust over the picture , which begins with a man alone , and gradually acquires more ancillary characters , in an ever wider sphere of slaughter . ",
        "early on , another private , also a deserter , requests that he be attached to capt. herold 's unit . the request is granted , and the ruse begins in sets of eyes dominate the film : peschel 's wide , soulful stare , embodying the appalled conscience of the piece , and the icy , opaque gaze of max hubacher , the striking young actor who portrays herold . he 's riveting , even though the conception of herold as written keeps the man at a remove . he 's an actor playing an actor , working without a script or a net or with cinematographer florian ballhous , and shooting mostly in pristine black-and-white , schwentke treats much of `` the captain '' as the blackest of comedies , as fortune and outlandish coincidence give herold a helping hand time and time again . ",
        "there 's a limitation , however , and it 's significant . the movie risks only so much . many of the flourishes come off as callow , superficial . you watch `` the captain '' with a sick feeling in your stomach , but probably not sick enough . `` the situation is always what you make of it , '' says the most bloodthirsty of the deserters who fall into herold 's makeshift unit . as herold transforms himself into the horror he 's playacting , we 're meant to cringe at the seductive qualities of fascism , as gathered up , on the fly , by this one man . ",
        "deliberately , schwentke allows himself various ahistorical and stylistically anachronistic elements , from the techno-throb of the musical cues to the sardonic , slangy tone of some of the dialogue . in his own mind , herold becomes `` the avenging angel of our sacred german honor , '' as he says late in the game . or is he just pretending ? the movie 's an artfully sustained guessing game , tense and rarely dull . it 's also afflicted with a jokey , jaunty tone as deliberate as it is limiting .
