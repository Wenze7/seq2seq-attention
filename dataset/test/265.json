        "former journalist , documentarian and now democratic congressional candidate leslie cockburn has pulled out all the stops in her race against virginia republican opponent denver , she 's pulled out one very large stop : bigfoot 's sex lifein a political attack that has observers across the country and on both sides of the aisle scratching their heads , the san mateo-born cockburn has accused riggleman of being unfit for office because he is a `` devotee of bigfoot erotica . `` we 'll give you a moment for that to sink in . . . cockburn , who along with her husband has produced award-winning if controversial documentaries such as one that suggested the cia was in the drug-trafficking business , said on twitter that riggleman fetishizes the mythical ape-like giant . ",
        "`` this is not what we need on capitol hill , '' cockburn said in a tweet . her posts included pictures from riggleman 's instagram account showing nude drawings of bigfoot with his -- assuming that the made-up creature is male -- genitalia covered with a black rectangle . ",
        "`` these images are very disturbing , i think everyone should just look at them to see who this candidate is , '' cockburn said in an interview with the associated press , presumably with a straight dismissed the allegation that he 's into sasquatch 's sex life , even though the air force veteran has admitted that he and his military buddies have long had an interest in bigfoot believers ; riggleman is listed as a co-author of a short online book detailing a bigfoot hunt in 2006 , though he says the drawings on his instagram account are jokes .",
        "oh yeah -- he 's also writing a satirical book called `` the mating habits of bigfoot and why women want him , '' so perhaps cockburn could be forgiven for misinterpreting her opponent 's obsession with the sexy hairy the bizarre back-and-forth continues between the candidates , the rest of the world is weighing in with their own observations , via twitter , on the brouhaha now consuming the contest to decide the next representative for virginia 's 5th congressional district , which stretches from northern virginia to the north carolina border .
