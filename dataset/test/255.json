        "the needle on the mitch-o-meter has bounced wildly from one end of the spectrum to the other over the first seven practices of bears training camp at olivet nazarene as second-year quarterback mitch trubisky dives deeper into directing coach matt nagy 's new offense , the bears remain steady in their assessment that the mistakes and the triumphs are part of the process . `` as coach nagy likes to say , test ourselves , see what throws we can make , test the defense and challenge them every day like they 're challenging us , '' trubisky said . ",
        "`` you just have to find that balance and move on to the next play when there is a mistake . `` trubisky was talking to the media friday for the first time since camp began -- and after another couple of days of highs and one point friday , trubisky threw a bull 's - eye to new wide receiver allen robinson between defensive backs bryce callahan and eddie jackson for a touchdown in a red-zone drill . ",
        "another moment , his pass was tipped near the line and deiondre ' hall picked it thursday , he made a pretty pass to connect with leaping tight end adam shaheen for a touchdown , but he also threw a pair of interceptions to cornerback prince and trubisky are keeping perspective , especially given the `` tornado '' of information nagy said he 's throwing at his offensive all , while the bears may be six days away from their first exhibition game of the summer -- when they face the ravens in the hall of fame game in canton , ohio -- they are still 44 days away from the season opener against the packers in green bay .",
        "`` i 'm always mad when i throw an interception , but at the same time i do n't care what anybody thinks , '' trubisky said . `` i know what i have to do . i made a lot of great throws . i made some bad throws , and we 're testing and we 're getting better every day . as long as coach nagy is ok with it and he sees my growth and development just getting better every day , and my teammates know that my mind and my spirit is in the right spot , then we 'll be just fine . ",
        "`` those mistakes are going to come as long as we learn from them . it 's not a game , so it does n't really matter what everybody thinks and what everybody sees . hopefully enjoy practice , but there 's a lot going on that we just need to improve and get better at , and we 're taking care of that . `` some of the strides trubisky makes are noticeable to the coaching staff and his teammates more than the crowd . for example , nagy said trubisky had three plays friday where he made protection checks and route adjustments at the line of scrimmage . ",
        "`` i told him out there , we 're building this puzzle right now , and each day we 're trying to take one piece of the puzzle and put it up there and then before you know it , at the end of this thing , you have that puzzle put together , '' nagy said . '' was a day where there were two or three pieces that he put together on that puzzle . `` tight end trey burton has liked what he has seen from trubisky in the huddle thus far . `` i 've been extremely impressed how long our play calls are , and you have n't had to see us reset too many times because he 's messed up the play call or anything like that , '' burton said . ",
        "`` i also feel he 's the guy you can go up to and ask a question . he 's the first guy down there congratulating you if you catch a tough ball or a bad throw , he 's the first guy down there leading . `` nagy said trubisky 's ability to bounce back after mistakes also has stood out to him , and trubisky 's band of mentors is helping him to avoid making the same error initial assessment might be a few words with backup quarterbacks chase daniel or tyler bray between plays on the field , but it 's in the ensuing film session when nagy , the quarterbacks , offensive coordinator mark helfrich and quarterbacks coach dave ragone dig in to correct the mistake . ",
        "`` he 's so competitive that he wants to be perfect on every single play , '' nagy said . `` it 's impossible . ... so that 's my job , to make sure he understands you ca n't be perfect every single play and let 's try to be as good as we can and then understand the whys . '' "
