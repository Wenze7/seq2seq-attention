        "last year in cologne , germany , archeologists unearthed the remains of what they thought was a public assembly hall . however , it turned out that the structure might actually be the oldest known public library in the country . an ancient library believed to have contained as many as 20,000 ancient scrolls have been unearthed in the middle of cologne , had discovered the walls of a roman-era structure last year , which they initially thought was the ruins of a public assembly hall . however , they found that the tiny wall niches were far too small to hold made them think twice : what if the assembly hall is actually the country 's oldest known library ? ",
        "when a public assembly place turns out to be a library `` it took us some time to match up the parallels -- we could see the niches were too small to bear statues inside , '' according to dirk schmitz , from the roman-germanic museum of cologne , as the guardian reports . `` they are very particular to libraries -- you can see the same ones in the library at ephesus . `` it is unclear just how many scrolls the library is believed to have held , but experts say it would have been quite huge , and schmitz says 20,000 . ",
        "the actual building would have been slightly smaller than the library at ephesus , which was erected in 117 was quite fortunate that the niches were intact when archeologists discovered the walls , according to schmitz . had they unearthed only the foundations , they would not have been able to tell that it was a library . he adds that there could be a lot more libraries in roman towns just waiting to be ancient public library in cologneevidence shows that the library in question was used by the public , according to schmitz . for one , it stood right in the middle of cologne , either in the marketplace or forum : the public space of the city center . ",
        "what 's more , it 's built with strong materials -- and such buildings , because of their massive size , were public was built sometime between 150 and 200 ce , says martin oehlen of german news outlet k√∂lner stadt-anzeiger . the city of cologne was founded about a century earlier in 50 ce . it served as the capital of the germania inferior province and housed some of rome 's influential imperial governors . cologne soon became a center for trade and library was discovered while conducting construction work on a protestant church in cologne 's city center , according to oehlen . ",
        "it will be integrated into the new building 's underground garage , with two planned parking spaces instead of displaying the structure 's walls and three niches . "
