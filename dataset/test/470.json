        "things were going so well for lucas giolito and the white on the scoreboard . brilliant defensive plays . timely then , in the eighth inning , things stopped going well for giolito and the shortstop daniel robertson grounded sharply up the middle , hustling into second . that initiated a chain reaction that started with giolito being pulled , manager rick renteria summoning three relievers and the rays tying the game on a suicide the rally died and the sox retook the lead for good in the 10th , emerging with a 3-2 moncada , hitting just . 167 from the right side , lined jose alvarado 's knee-high fastball over the left fielder 's head to score pinch-runner adam engel . ",
        "engel replaced nicky delmonico , who hustled into second on a line drive to right . `` i went to swing in that at-bat , '' moncada said . `` that was the mindset . i had a very good pitch and i made good contact . `` it was a nice victory for the sox , who improved to 3-3 in extra-inning games . the organization is looking for moncada and giolito to emerge as standouts in their was cruising along until robertson 's double . he had allowed just two hits and three walks over seven innings , striking out abreu made two dynamite plays at first , making a rolling stop of a ji-man choi in the fifth and a diving stab of a michael perez grounder in the sox employed a shift for nearly every left-handed rays hitter . ",
        "that paid off , renteria just could n't wait to use the sox bullpen , which entered with a era -- ranking 25th in the fry gave up what looked like a routine grounder , but this time the shift backfired . third baseman yolmer sanchez was playing closer to shortstop and could not make the diving run was charged to giolito , but at least he was able to get his era below -- its lowest since april 12 -- to said he pulled giolito at 99 pitches because he felt the right-hander was tiring . `` he gave us a great outing . ",
        "why put him in a situation where he gets into more trouble , '' renteria said . `` you might say : that 's his game to win . but he did a great job for us as a team . `` and at least he lasted longer than the rays ' starter . not that it was his ryne stanek faced five sox batters -- and struck out each one . but he 's a reliever . the rays have few bona fide starting pitchers , so they 're trying something new -- relievers as hit his 18th homer for the sox , a two-run blast on a 1-1 breaking ball from jaime schultz in the sixth . ",
        "that 's all the sox got until the 10th . but that third run came just in danish , pitching 45 minutes from where he grew up , helped kill a rays rally in the ninth by striking out jesus sucre . he earned the victory . `` what more could i ask for ? '' danish said . `` it 's an amazing feeling . and my phone is kind of blowing up right now . '' "
