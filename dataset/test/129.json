        "the white sox on saturday night drew their best crowd since opening the 29,442 fans came because of the iron man bobblehead giveaway . maybe it was the promise of postgame fireworks , the ideal mid-70s temps or the fact that the sox had been playing better of late -- six victories in their last 12 games . the real fireworks wo n't come until michael kopech and eloy jimenez reach chicago , but the crowd was rewarded with a sweet rally after the sox trailed 4-0 after three innings and 5-1 heading into the seventh-inning stretch . `` the boys gave them a show , '' manager rick renteria said . ",
        "`` they 've gone through the ups and downs with us . they love this team and we want to give them something to cheer about . `` that they south siders pulled out a 9-5 victory thanks to a six-run eighth inning -- their most productive inning of the season . and they did all that damage before the blue jays recorded a second big moments : jose abreu doubled . daniel palka came through with a bases-loaded single to right . leury garcia cleared the bases with a triple . in between , both nicky delmonico and catcher kevan smith got hit by pitches . ",
        "`` it was an electric moment , '' garcia said . `` one of the keys for us was the feel of the crowd . `` news flash : maybe it was n't the best idea for the blue jays to start john axford , a career relief pitcher . axford did not allow a run in his first big-league start , but he lasted just three tepera was the jays ' sixth pitcher of the night , and he was sox 's bullpen , meanwhile , produced 42/3 innings of scoreless only bummer for the sox was the performance of lucas giolito , who had provided recent hope that he had turned the corner and would pitch more like a former phenom and less like the wildest pitcher in the american league . ",
        "but giolito had a brutal time of it saturday , from the first batter he faced to the last . `` i thought i threw the ball well , '' giolito said . but i was getting too much of the plate with my heater , especially with two strikes . and maybe pitch selection throughout the game . i could have done a better job of keeping them off balance , utilizing my off-speed stuff a little more . `` at least giolito was n't wild , walking just one of the 23 batters he as he said , many of his pitches caught too much of the plate . ",
        "he threw a fastball to catcher russell martin in the third that tailed over the plate . martin hammered it 406 feet to the seats in left inning earlier , shortstop lourdes gurriel jr. . stroked his second hit of the night . it marked his 10th consecutive multi-hit game , breaking toronto 's franchise record . the streak is tied for the seventh longest in mlb history , last achieved by the yankees ' bernie williams in might have deserved a standing ovation , but the sox crowd was understandably more into the home with jace fry on the hill and two outs in the ninth , the majority of the robust crowd rose to their feet . ",
        "some even held up their phone and hit the little red record struck out kendrys morales , and the sox celebrated on the field with a handshake a season of frustrating losses , this game provided a satisfying end . `` it makes me look to the future when we have a lot more games like this , '' giolito said . `` when we 're winning and playing well , it 's going to be a really good time .
