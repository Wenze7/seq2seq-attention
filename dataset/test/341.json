        "netflix vp , cindy holland , is teasing a great return for daredevil in the show 's third is dead . at least that 's what his fellow heroes think . if you watched the defenders , you know how it ended and we know a little more than danny rand , luke cage and jessica jones do about matt murdock 's closing scene for matt shows us the influence that `` born again '' will have on the show 's third season . the story arc is one written by frank miller in 1986 and the graphic novel includes daredevil # 227 -- 233 . ",
        "that 's two issues more than the initial run and they were added to tie up some loose ends . if you want to know more about the general direction it looks like they 'll take with season three , be sure to go read those 2 of the show dropped way back when in may 2016 , so aside from his role in the defenders , it 's been a while since we 've had a matt murdock-centric story . even in the second season , there was a big focus on elektra and introducing the speaking with deadline , netflix vice president cindy holland mentioned that the new season would be a return to form . ",
        "`` the biggest issue was the timing of production and launching of the defenders because what that meant is we had to shut down all of the shows , so all the actors be available for the defendersso it 's more function of that , '' holland told deadline . `` there is no problem with this season , i think it 's fantastic , it 's real return to form in my view . '' as someone who loved the first season of daredevil , this is something i 'm excited to hear . the second season was more cluttered than it needed to be . ",
        "while i 'm still not sold on most of these seasons needing to be 13 episodes , i understand that it 's that way because of the initial deals they `` return to form '' does n't necessarily mean we 're going back to the all-black `` suit '' that matt initially wore . that one is n't quite as protective as his updated , red suit , so let 's all hope he keeps that one . however , i 'm hoping that this means we 'll get back to the great storytelling that we had in season 1 as matt went up against wilson fisk . ",
        "it 'll still be hard to top that season , but `` born again '' is a classic story and i hope they use it now , there is n't a release date set for the third season , but it is expected to release in march of 2019 , like the first two seasons . you can watch the first two seasons on netflix now , though , if you need a refresher on what was going on with matt before the defenders released .
