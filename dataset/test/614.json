        "outfit : revolve clothing dress ~ on sale ! saint laurent bagchlo√© bootsi spent part of my weekend at the 3rd street promenade for a little christmas shopping . by far my least favorite place to go because it 's always so packed . but , we decided to make a day out of it and go ice skating as well . the weather 's been very random due to the california fires so i wore a dress with long sleeve 's to keep me somewhat warm as the day went on . i purchased this revolve clothing dress on sale during black friday week . ",
        "it 's slightly too big for me , which is unfortunate because i ca n't return it . however , i tried to make it work without looking like a sack of potatoes . i 've wanted a dress like this for the longest time . i love anything off the shoulder , but the leg slit and button details made this super cute . this is n't really a dress you can wear with other fashion items it 's more a stand alone piece . then i gave the outfit some contract with gold and black accents for my accessories and shoes . ",
        "overall , happy with this dress and i will definitely wear it for more casual days like when i go sure to watch my vlog of full day shopping below or here . "
