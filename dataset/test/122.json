",
        "hudson , a pro bowl performer in each of the last two years , is the definition of low practices every day , and either legitimately loves it or has convinced himself that training camp drudgery is fun and games . when hudson takes the podium or talks with the media one-on-one , there is no fear that he 'll step into has started all 32 games over the last two seasons , even playing through a kidney stone last season . the only games hudson missed were three in 2014 , his first season with the raiders , because of an ankle hudson 's durability , go ahead and assume it was a significant even compared hudson to the indestructible franchise standard for the center position .

        "`` jim otto was here for the alumni and i was talking to him about rodney , '' gruden said . `` there is a lot of similarities in terms of toughness and passion for football , communication and all-out effort . `` communication , in the form of relaying blocking assignments and being simpatico with quarterback derek carr , is one of hudson 's best qualities . it 's a quality that does n't exist with the media , where hudson is agreeable and friendly but very good at keeping specifics out of the , hudson said he 's talked with otto , but he 's keeping the details to throws a lot at an offense , his quarterback and center in particular .
