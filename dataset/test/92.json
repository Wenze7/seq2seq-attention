        "outfit : fashion nova toprevolve clothing pantssam edelman bootssaint laurent bagsephora lipstickapparently la does n't know what season it 's in ... so that leaves me to dress how i please . i did a little christmas shopping this pass weekend with this outfit . not really sure what i was going for with this look , but i ended up really liking it . i purchased these striped pants off of revolve clothing and love them . they are extremely comfortable and a nice change from the usual denim jeans . they fit really nice around the hips and i love the laced up detailing in the front . ",
        "the pants also flare out at the bottom giving off a 70 's vibe . not at all hard to style . i wanted to balance the outfit with a crop top from fashion nova . this top is not only super cute , but extremely affordable . it 's got cute ruffle detailing throughout . the long sleeves are nice because the rest of the top is revealing . styling these pants with the right pair of shoes was the most difficult . i did n't want to wear heels or sandals so my sam edelman boots were my only option . ",
        "i kept my boots low-key as i did n't want them to compete with my pants which were the focal kept this outfit pretty monochromatic with not introducing any other colors besides white and black , but you could totally through some color with your top or accessories . bag of course is from saint laurent . seriously the best mini cross body bag i 've come across and the gold chain always ties in the outfit together nicely . now my favorite part of this outfit is definitely the red lips ! i think i 've finally found the perfect red lipstick that feels and looks great . ",
        "surprisingly enough , it was sephorawho sold me . sephora 's cream lip stain in 01 ` always red ' is the perfect shade of red to wear to all your holiday parties . this liquid lipstick is extremely long wearing and comfortable on the lips . highly recommend this hope you enjoyed this outfit post . be sure to check out my `` holiday makeup look '' down below !
