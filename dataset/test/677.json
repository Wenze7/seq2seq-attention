        "outfit : pink floyd shirtre/done denimchloé bootssaint laurent bagbalenciaga braceletargento vivo necklacesi only ever visit rodeo drive once or twice a year when i plan on making a big purchase . usually for my birthday i always spoil myself and this year i wanted a bag . before i get to that ... let 's talk about my outfit . i kept it casual , but still stylish as always . i picked up this vintage pink floyd tee off melrose a few weeks back and i 'm obsessed ! i do n't have any rocker tee 's like this . ",
        "and yes i grew up listening to my dad 's pink floyd records so i thought this was appropriate . i finally wore my new re/done denim jeans . yes i actually caved into buying these . unfortunately , i looked far and wide for the perfect vintage levi 501 's and could not find a brand that makes them fit quite like re/done does . i love these and i do n't regret buying them . these are the ` it ' jeans every fashionista needs ! they will literally make any outfit . and to top it off ... of course my chloé susanna boots . ",
        "i 'm glad i 've been wearing these more lately . they are hard to style in my opinion because i usually go for a simplistic look , but lately i 've been on this ` dgas ' vibe . i 've also been layering my argento vivo jewelry a lot lately . they have been my favorite brand for affordable jewelry . i 'm wearing both their slip on and gothic choker .
