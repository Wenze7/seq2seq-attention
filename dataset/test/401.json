        "who would have thought ... and these fashionnova pants are extremely comfortable but stylish . i feel that the textured print gives these pants some dimension otherwise these would n't be so flattering . of course my favorite part of this outfit is the sneakers . these air jordan bred 11 's are one of my favorite shoes of all time . what i love most about the shoe is the patent material . this makes the shoe stand out even know a shoe is well designed if it can look good on a variety of people , both men and women .
