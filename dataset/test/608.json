        "the decadence of college football 's facilities arms race boggles the 's practice palace is outfitted with mini-waterfalls that pour into a hydrotherapy pool . clemson 's has a nine-hole miniature golf course . oregon 's has an auditorium with seats covered in ferrari now , here comes northwestern , once the laughingstock of big ten football , with a jock taj mahal whose $ 270 million price tag reportedly makes it the conference 's most expensive practice facility . you wonder what goes through the mind of kids struggling to pay off their student loans . does it make sense to spend more than a quarter of a billion dollars on a facility that only a small fraction of the university 's students will enter on a typical day ? ",
        "whatever the answer , this much is clear : the new field house and athletics center , which will be dedicated wednesday , is a distinguished , sometimes-breathtaking , work of architecture . its calling card is not shiny toys designed to lure recruits , but structural drama that takes full advantage of its spectacular lakefront site . lithe arches support a futuristic dome that spans a vast indoor practice field . towering glass walls reveal jaw-dropping views of lake northwestern football coach pat fitzgerald told an interviewer last spring , `` why do you need waterfalls inside when you have waves outside ? ",
        "`` designed by the chicago office of perkins + will and located at the northeast corner of northwestern 's evanston campus , the completed structure houses the training facilities of seven sports besides football . it should be nicknamed `` the house that pat and pat built . `` in 2011 , with michigan threatening to poach fitzgerald , northwestern committed to replace its aging football practice facility , inconveniently located a mile and a half northwest of campus . the other pat -- billionaire former aon executive patrick ryan , whose name graces the stadium -- pledged millions of dollars for a top-drawer new facility . ",
        "fitzgerald rose the new building , which is actually two interconnected structures : the patrick g. and shirley w. ryan fieldhouse , which contains the practice field and had a soft opening last spring , and the brand-new mark and kimbra walter athletics center , home to an athletes ' dining hall , coaches ' offices and meeting rooms . mark walter is ceo of the guggenheim partners financial services firm and chairman of the los angeles the buildings form an l-shaped structure that interlocks with the l-shaped henry crown sports pavilion , a stolid recreation and athletics building that was partly demolished to make way for the new facility . ",
        "the combined buildings have an enormous footprint , not unlike a small convention center . buildings like these tend to be massive , monolithic and inward-turning -- in short , deadening to everything around them . but in the skilled hands of perkins + will 's chief designer ralph johnson , who worked with design principal bryan schabel and senior project manager chris hale , the ryan-walter center is anything but a hulking , whose portfolio includes the international terminal at o'hare and the boeing headquarters along the chicago river , has long excelled at turning out modernist buildings that sensitively respond to their sites , but introduce something fresh . ",
        "he does it again here with materials that relate well to surrounding campus structures . ",
        "to break up the building 's mass , he employs tried-and-true elements of his visual language -- among them , cantilevered window bays , stiltlike columns and facade wrappers that resemble mobius center may be futuristic , but , unlike the flying saucer addition to soldier field , it does n't look like it parachuted in from outer big event , the domed practice field , is something fresh in johnson 's catalog , responding to the need for a ceiling that would be high enough for field goal kicks and punts yet low enough to adhere to evanston 's height limit .",
        "its rhythmic steel arches -- set 30 feet apart , like the major yard lines of a football field -- span an impressive 240 feet . to the north , a curtainlike wall of glass , 44 feet tall , hangs from the roof , opening stunning views of lake michigan and an adjoining public fitzgerald said , who needs waterfalls ? besides `` wow , '' the words that come to mind are power and if you never set foot inside , the towering glass walls let you witness the structural drama from the building responds equally well to its natural setting . ",
        "part of its second floor cantilevers beyond the rest of the facade , making way for a new stretch of lakefront trail that links to an existing campus trail . pedestrians and cyclists already are using it . tall , handsomely sculpted concrete walls protect the path and the building from the pounding of lake michigan . seating is nicely integrated into the lower parts of the the practice field , interior highlights include a tall , south-facing entry hall to the walter athletics center , which is outfitted with a large video display panel and a monumental flight of stairs . ",
        "the building also contains a two-story athletes ' dining hall with fabulous views and the offices of coaches and athletic director jim phillips , which overlook adjacent practice fields and the distant chicago skyline . throughout the clean-lined interior , adjoining spaces share natural light and views , enhancing the sense of there 's a weakness , it 's the profusion of long , narrow corridors . but they 're spiffed up with attractive graphics that use lots of northwestern purple and spell out messages like `` win our bowl game . `` for all its strengths , the facility is filled with the carefully composed , metal-and-glass facades project an image of openness , the aforementioned southern entry is reserved for athletes , coaches , athletic administrators and recruits . ",
        "the practice field is intentionally placed on the second floor , not just to fit onto the tight site , but also to keep the field out of eyeshot of other teams ' while the building is far more integrated with the campus than the remote ryan field practice facility , it forms a kind of parallel universe to the campus proper , with its athletes-only dining hall and study center . in the crown pavilion , the running track and basketball courts , which were open to recreational users , had the prime lake views . in the new building , the courts are underground and the track is at ground-level .

        "they have no windows , a shift that speaks volumes about who sits atop the campus administrators insist that the field house will be used for campuswide events like a dance also remains to be seen whether the center helps the university recruit better athletes and improve its on-field performance . but the building itself performs beautifully , despite the fraught issues it raises about the rising influence of major college have n't been to every noteworthy football facility in the country , but pete thamel of yahoo sports has . last spring , after a preview of the field house , he wrote , `` in terms of size , spectacle and spending , northwestern has sprinted past the biggest names in the facilities arms race .

        "`` the high quality and creativity on display in the completed field house and athletics center add weight to that your heart out , alabama , clemson , oregon . "
