",
        "`` this opportunity , it was amazing for me , '' worley said thursday after day 6 of training camp . `` just to be able to get another opportunity because many people do n't get a second chance . i was just blessed to be able to get another chance and just make the best of it . `` honestly , i just took it as a learning experience , '' he said of his arrest . `` it 's something that happened . you ca n't change the past . just like plays on the field , you ca n't change what happened . ",
        "you just have to move on to the next one . i was thankful when i talked to coach gruden on the phone . it was a very passionate conversation . he was understanding . i mean , people make mistakes in life . it 's not about the mistake , it 's about whether you learn from it and what you do continue to go forward in future . `` worley said he has n't heard anything from the nfl regarding potential discipline . he 'll proceed as the raiders ' no . 2 cornerback with conley out , starting opposite rashaan melvin in a defensive backfield that underwent serious overhaul this offseason after an abysmal worley 's arrest , gruden consulted a handful of people to gauge worley 's character , including college teammate and current raiders safety karl joseph . ",
        "the two spent three years together at west virginia and both entered the league in 2016 . joseph and others vouched for the 23-year-old cornerback , so gruden felt comfortable bringing him on board so soon after a potentially concerning incident . `` i knew he could come in and help us at that position , '' joseph said in june . `` we need some help in that position , so when asked me about him i was excited . that 's my brother . we played almost all of our years in college together . so when he asked me , i co-signed for him immediately . ",
        "he 's a heck of a player . `` joseph eased worley 's transition at the start , catching him up to speed on what gruden and co. . expected even if joseph only met the staff a couple weeks before worley did . `` he 's a savvy guy . i think he 's put what happened to him behind , '' gruden said monday . `` i think he 's focused now . '' `` he 's played a lot of football . he 's an experienced guy . he 's big and long , '' defensive coordinator paul guenther said sunday . ",
        "`` he 's really starting to pick up the system the last couple of days . `` worley played in a similar defense with the panthers , he said , so the majority of his learning curve has dealt with terminology . he feels most comfortable at outside cornerback , which is where the raiders have played him while marcus gilchrist and shareece wright get looks in the he adjusts to guenther 's defense , worley has leaned on the likes of cornerback leon hall and safety reggie nelson , two veterans who played under guenther in cincinnati . `` not only have they played in coach guenther 's defense , they 've played in the nfl for a long time , '' worley said . ",
        "`` guys that have double digit years , you have to soak up the knowledge whenever you can . ask them questions even when you may not have necessarily a question , just being able to see how they see it and does it relate to yours . `` worley is with his third team entering his third year . he 's already spent more time with the raiders than he did with the eagles , and would like to keep that evidently has a chance to make an immediate impact in the secondary if training camp reps are any indication . ",
        "if conley ca n't get healthy , the raiders will count on worley to not only show up on the field , but stay out of trouble off it . `` i 've been an open book , '' worley said . `` really just letting the coaches and the players around me just make their imprint . and i adjust accordingly . just go out there and show them that i am for the team , being able to continue to work , make the plays that come my way , continue to compete and show the guys that i am here to work .
