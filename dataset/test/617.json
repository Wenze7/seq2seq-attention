        "two weeks after the brightest batch of homegrown artists commanded attention at pitchfork music festival , fellow local femdot is ready to claim his own space at lollapalooza -- which will again take over grant park thursday through sunday . `` saba and i played ball yesterday , we play ball all the time , and we were talking about it , '' the rapper , born femi adigun , says of his friend -- who played pitchfork 's red stage july 20 . `` he said it was crazy . he said the crowd was big as hell and the energy , they just feed off each other . ",
        "`` saba gave his friend a bit of advice too -- on how to be in the moment even though things leading up to the festival slot can be stressful , especially for independent artists , how to best set up the stage and make the most of your time 's lollapalooza set marks his debut on the festival scene and biggest stage to date , having previously performed red bull sound select shows alongside the likes of mick jenkins and smino . he says organizers were looking for local talent and his name kept coming performance also arrives just two months after the release of his debut lp , `` delacreme 2 '' -- a collection of 13 tracks built on layers of sound oscillating between drill and neo-soul , vivid spoken word and slick rhymes , as heard on tracks like `` ryu '' and `` 0 somethin' . '' ",
        "at lollapalooza , the young rapper hopes to bring it to life -- enlisting a band of nine , which includes keys and accompanying vocalists to lay down the album 's smooth harmonies and gospel-inspired , however , are not part of his an interview with the tribune only a year ago , he said he never thought he `` really sounded like a rapper for a long time . '' now , his vocal approach sounds seasoned -- with a mix of brash emphasis and playful theatricality . ",
        "lyrically , he 's channeled what he says speak to his `` chicago experiences '' -- growing up in evanston his first eight years , then rogers park , and spending time traveling the south and west sides with his siblings -- in storytelling that is flavored with ambition and ego , as well as redemption and many of the city 's hottest musical exports , adigun sharpened his skills while participating in young chicago authors ' louder than a bomb spoken word and slam poetry events -- and will impart what he picked up along the way on the american eagle stage on saturday .",
        "he remembers seeing poet/activist malcolm london on his first visit -- and the day its director , kevin coval , finally called him up to perform his piece , `` straight-a failures '' in 2012 . `` it 's chicago , so there 's this part of feeling like you need to prove yourself , but was n't like that . it 's constructive , '' adigun says of his early visits . `` they 're not gon na gas you if you do n't got it , but they 're not gon na tear you down either . `` he says it was one of the first spaces he felt welcome , his expression as a budding artist heard and respected . ",
        "`` it 's motivational , it pushes you . you want to keep up with everyone else , '' he continues . `` instead of feeling discouraged by everyone doing great things , you see they 're your peers and that you can do that too . `` adigun also credits louder than a bomb for showing him the importance of stage presence and crowd interaction -- and for the built-in community and audience the platform aids in cultivating for all artists who grow out of it . `` being there and learning how to do call-and-responses , seeing people exchange energy in the room and engage with the crowd -- you know , just having a lot of fun on that small stage . ",
        "rap , like doing spoken word , you have to sell that , '' he says of how it helped him begin to develop his performance style . `` now i try to incorporate that into music , to try and capture that same feel with other singers and the set-up . the reality is the best shows are always the intimate ones . so how do you make each show seem as intimate as possible regardless of how many people are there ? you have to win people over , you ca n't turn to every person in the seats and introduce yourself to make a fan . ",
        "maybe they 'll become a fan after you get off . `` such fans were at local label , closed sessions -- one that was quick to start curating the new `` chicago sound , '' and also houses like the likes of kweku collins , jamila woods and ajani jones among finishing a series of ep 's , `` no , '' `` to , '' `` thr '' and `` for '' within a year , closed sessions approached femdot and his team in 2017 , offering help with distribution and promotion of his next project . after talks , adigun signed based on the label 's willingness to help and support letting the artist keep the team he 'd built around team , in true chicago fashion , is largely made up of friends such as engineer/producer mike wavvs , dj charles lauste and others ; friends that femdot says are integral to his artist 's approach to crafting his sound is unique in that it feels closer to one that leans toward science-based experimentation than romanticized notions of songwriting and composition . ",
        "femdot 's nature of precision -- a trait he 's carried since graduating from depaul university with a degree in biology , drives him to re-create what he hears in his head exactly -- or it does n't see the light of 's still constantly `` studying '' -- testing his own rhymes over instrumentals by some of his biggest influences like j. dilla and jay z. dissecting different parts of songs he likes to figure out why he likes them and if he 'd like them if he tried them his way , trying to get into the minds of other artists to understand the psychology behind all of it .",
        "`` i was always jealous of people who could just kind of write things , '' he says . `` for them it just comes together . i literally ca n't do that . it 's annoying how much i think everything out , but they 're like ` no i wish i could do something like that . ' but science has a finish line , this is about not having a finish line . `` the first time i 'm performing this project is at lolla . i 'm gon na have a ball . '' "
