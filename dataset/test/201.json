        "if `` mindfulness '' was n't on your 2018 new year 's resolution list , you 're doing it wrong . it seems to be the self-help buzzword of the year -- and science backs it 2005 , the national center for biotechnology information studied the brains of 20 people who regularly meditated and found the layers of the cerebral cortex was thicker than in nonmediators . a thicker cortex is associated with greater cognitive ability and intelligence in to the book `` mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for depression , '' written by a trio of doctors specializing in mood disorders , clinical psychology and brain sciences , not only does mindfulness help combat a variety of physical and mental health conditions such as depression , it 's specifically helpful in combating the recurrence of these is a form of meditation with more emphasis on being immersed in the present moment rather than focusing on a particular subject . ",
        "it 's grown into a multibillion dollar industry that includes apps , books , workshops , retreats , coaches and classes -- the latter of which can be great for those in need of a little guidance . and with several failed self-guided attempts in my past , i decided to give it a 's the deal ? chill chicago markets itself as a space for `` incense-free modern meditation '' and `` no-need-to-get-naked massages . '' the interior looks like a spa -- it 's quiet and modern with neutral colored walls and details . the front sitting room leads to an area with massage stations and two studios where classes take has several types of classes , including rest , which is held at night and focuses on transitioning from stress to sleep . ",
        "the breath class uses the lungs as an anchor point for staying in the present moment . out-of-town wellness retreats , as well as workshops that range from helping cancer patients and their caregivers to combating screen addiction , are also opted for insight , a class centered on awareness of the thoughts , ideas and beliefs that are consuming brain was a lunchtime class with only three other people , all of whom were dressed in casual attire or work clothes -- i was in workout gear . there were no yoga mats or windows in the studio , which would fit around 20 people at capacity , and only candle lighting and large cushions with pillows and blankets to sit instructor started off by explaining that for 30 minutes we 'd go through breathing , sitting , checking-in and simply 'd use around 10 long breaths to focus , then sit with our thoughts . ",
        "he urged us to not blindly bounce from thought to thought , but rather recognize exactly what we were thinking about and why -- and maybe even think deeper into it . at other points in the class , we 'd think about our heartbeats and try to manipulate our brains into feeling the beats in our hands and hard was it , really ? i have never really been able to meditate . i 've tried audio meditation , yoga classes , even a food-based meditation practice -- nothing worked . i 'm a fast-thinking , multi-tasking ruminator , and the closest i 've come to single thought during a workout or class is exhaustion while running on the treadmill . ",
        "not exactly in the class , given the novelty of the space and the experience , i found it surprisingly easy to close my eyes and think about where i was and what it felt twice did i think about what i had planned after work or what i 'd eat for dinner , which is more than i can say for any of my self-meditation attempts . when my mind did wander , the instructor was there reminding us to check in with the thought , explore it briefly , then refocus on the present some classes are good for things like regulating emotions , improving your sex life and exploring dreams , insight was focused on self-reflection , sorting through issues and finding felt a sense of peace after the class and maybe for a few hours after , but i 'm not sure how long it lasted . ",
        "i 'm told this is normal -- mindfulness is something you have to practice . but every moment of peace counts in this noisy , stress-inducing 's the cost , and who should go ? anyone can find mindfulness useful -- no physical fitness required , no age limit , just a brain . if your ' e in search of healing for a more specific purpose -- trauma , mental health concerns , etc. . -- consider doing research or scheduling a consultation to find the right type of mindfulness thought of the session as a sort of therapy or workout for the mind . ",
        "so if you 're not looking to delve into counseling , mindfulness may be a good 'd considering attending a regular class , especially if money were no object -- mostly because the guided approach was so much more effective than trying to focus my scattered brain core classes at chill chicago cost $ 22 . a $ 150 monthly membership includes unlimited core classes and use of recorded meditation , as well as a discount on massages , retail , retreats and workshops . chill chicago is also available through are a number of places that offer guided meditation throughout the city , ranging from four-week courses to psychotherapy .
