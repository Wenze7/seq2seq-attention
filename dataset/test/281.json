        "las vegas , nv -- march 07 : mckinley wright iv # 25 of the colorado buffaloes fouls kimani lawrence # 14 of the arizona state sun devils as namon wright # 13 of the buffaloes reaches for the ball during a first-round game of the pac-12 basketball tournament at t-mobile arena on march 7 , 2018 in las vegas , nevada . the buffaloes won 97-85 . it is no secret that pac-12 basketball has n't been as deep in recent years . could the lack of top-heaviness be a promising sign for the conference 's future ? when looking at each high-major conference 's presence in the ncaa tournament , it is quite clear that the pac-12 has struggled to make a good impression on the selection pac-12 's total of 24 bids in the last 5 seasons is fewer than the big east , big 12 , big ten and acc . ",
        "while it is equal to the sec 's total , the pac-12 has not been moving in the same positive some of this can be attributed to the overall mediocrity of the pac-12 's middle , it could be argued that the top-heaviness of the conference has made the middle teams look worse . in fact , this became an issue for the big 10 , which had a decade low four bids last teams in the pac-12 have taken steps this offseason to improve and compete for more ncaa tournament bids . the three teams predicted to be at the top -- oregon , ucla , and washington -- are excellent , but the gap between them and the rest of the league is not as wide as in the past two for the ncaa tournament are based on overall team performance , not just their competitiveness in the conference . ",
        "however , pac-12 teams on the edge coming out of the non-conference should have a good shot at making a positive the other high-major conferences may still be stronger top-to-bottom leagues , the pac-12 has a good chance of turning their reputation around . there is still a long way to go , but the conference of champions is heading in the right direction .
