        "one of the nation 's largest sources of industrial lead pollution is just 20 miles down the lake michigan shore from chicago , churning more than twice as much of the brain-damaging metal into the air each year as all other factories in the region a baltimore galvanizing plant emitted more lead during 2016 than the nearly 18,000 pounds released by arcelormittal 's steel mill in burns harbor , ind. , according to a tribune analysis of federal records that raises new questions about the oversight of big lakefront polluters by the indiana department of environmental management and environmental protection burns harbor plant also emitted 173,000 pounds of benzene during 2016 , the newspaper 's analysis revealed , making the sprawling steel-making complex by far the nation 's largest industrial source of a volatile chemical known to cause and benzene pollution from the steel mill rose sharply during the past decade as airborne levels of both toxic substances dropped nationwide .",
        "more pollution could be on the way if luxembourg-based arcelormittal , the world 's largest steel-maker , ramps up production in response to president donald trump 's controversial tariff on imported regulators ca n't explain where the steel mill 's pollution ends the days when lead pollution is monitored just west of the steel mill , levels are well below federal standards . a state analysis of local wind patterns suggests the toxic metal could be blowing north and west over the lake , toward chicago , or south of the mill toward the chesterton area . `` it definitely requires some work to solve a mystery like this , '' said miriam rotkin-ellman , a senior scientist at the nonprofit natural resources defense council who researches air pollution and reviewed the newspaper 's findings . ",
        "`` but there are plenty of scientific tools available to the epa to figure this out if they want to use them . `` industrial lead emissions , combined with decades of exhaust from vehicles that were fueled by leaded gasoline until the mid-1980s , can build up in the top few inches of soil and linger for years . even tiny amounts of the toxic metal ingested or inhaled can damage the brains of young children and trigger learning disabilities , aggression and criminal behavior later in life . the epa concluded years ago there is no safe level of 38,000 people live within 5 miles of the burns harbor steel mill , including 2,338 children age 5 and an email response to questions , the epa 's regional office in chicago said it launched a computer-assisted analysis this summer to estimate where the steel mill 's lead pollution spreads . ",
        "the agency confirmed it has not looked for contaminated soil in nearby residential areas , unlike the testing it has conducted recently in two other northwest indiana communities where factories emitted lead pollution for key difference is the testing in east chicago and hammond has been conducted near abandoned industrial properties with well-documented hazards . it is relatively unusual for the epa to sample soil outside factories still data from the monitoring station next to the burns harbor steel mill , where samples of airborne lead are collected every six days , arcelormittal said there is no evidence its air pollution exceeds regulatory standards or poses a threat to public health . ",
        "the company has invested millions of dollars in pollution-control equipment , spokesman bill steers said in an email , `` and will continue to look for opportunities to strengthen these measures . `` experts note that one monitor periodically collecting data ca n't fully assess the hazards of air pollution , in particular for lead and other metals that still pose risks after settling into soil and tribune analysis relied on data from the epa 's toxics release inventory , an annual tally of industrial pollution required by congress in response to a 1984 chemical catastrophe at a union carbide plant in bhopal , india , that killed at least 3,797 people and by some estimates as many as 16,000 . ",
        "with a few clicks through the online database , anyone can find information about specific industries , factories and chemicals . ",
        "the data can be ranked nationwide or by state , county , city and zip companies to make public their annual pollution data `` empowers communities to protect their environment , creates a strong incentive for companies to reduce pollution and helps companies learn from each other 's best practices for reducing emissions , '' the epa says on its the mid-2000s , when residents of chicago 's pilsen neighborhood wanted to know if metallic-tasting smoke rolling through the streets was dangerous , they turned to the epa database for they found while scrolling through the list of polluters alarmed them : at the time , the h. kramer and co. .",
        "smelter at 21st and throop streets was the largest source of airborne lead in into a small but tenacious group , the plant 's neighbors badgered regulators and enlisted academic experts who trained them how to use hand-held devices that revealed high levels of lead in several backyards . h. kramer dramatically reduced its lead emissions after the epa cracked down on the company in response to neighborhood complaints . as part of one of its legal settlements with the epa , the company also financed the removal of lead-contaminated soil in dozens of yards near the smelter . `` it 's a constant fight , '' said james fabisiak , a toxicologist and director of the center for healthy environments and communities at the university of pittsburgh , which in recent years has worked with other institutions to draw attention to hazardous air pollution from steel producers and other industries in southwest pennsylvania . ",
        "`` once you 've got lead in the soil it can end up in people 's vegetable gardens and kids can track it into the house after they are outside playing , '' fabisiak said . `` that 's why i would definitely want to know more about how far the lead from this particular steel mill travels . ",
        "`` in contrast to the nearly 18,000 pounds of lead emitted by the burns harbor plant during 2016 , about 8,000 pounds combined were emitted by 86 other industrial facilities in cook county , the five collar counties in illinois and lake and porter counties in northwest emissions from the h. kramer smelter had dropped to 11 pounds by then , down from 3,400 pounds in burns harbor mill was built during the mid-1960s by the now-defunct bethlehem steel corp. , which leveled several ecologically important sand dunes conservationists were attempting to protect by persuading congress to create what a few years later became the indiana dunes national lakeshore .",
        "on its website , arcelormittal , the corporate successor to another conglomerate that acquired the plant during a painful overhaul of the steel industry , dryly notes burns harbor `` is the only steelmaking facility in the that is bordered on two sides by a national park . `` one of the reasons why the burns harbor plant is such a big polluter is it makes steel from scratch . the dirtiest steps in that process generally are baking coal into high-carbon coke and processing iron ore for the plant 's blast coke production has steadily dwindled as the industry has been roiled by competition from overseas companies and from domestic manufacturers that rely on recycled steel . ",
        "coke producers , including arcelormittal , also have struggled to prevent excessive amounts of benzene and other harmful pollution from leaking into the last coke plant in chicago closed more than a decade ago . in 2015 , steel shuttered the coke plant that supplied its century-old gary works along lake michigan between the burns harbor mill and two other arcelormittal plants in east old-line steel mills now rely on independent coke producers such as lisle-based suncoke energy . but despite promises of more environmentally friendly production , most of suncoke 's facilities are under court-ordered settlements with the epa to reduce lead , soot and other types of hazardous pollution , including the coke ovens that supply arcelormittal 's east chicago plants . ",
        "`` we keep finding these big sources of lead that have been ignored for years , '' said the nrdc 's rotkin-ellman , citing a long-running battle to clean up suburban los angeles neighborhoods contaminated by a former battery recycling plant . `` the bottom line is these companies are poisoning our communities . usually nothing gets done about it unless people start asking questions and demanding answers .
