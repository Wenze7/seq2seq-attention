        "a coach is indispensable to the serious athlete -- everyone from olympians to up-and-coming youth athletes needs experts who can spot the strengths and weaknesses of an athlete 's style and cater to their personal needs . but now ai systems are almost sophisticated enough to do the job just as well as -- better in some ways -- than the old human , an iphone app that basketball players can use to track their shots , might be the first of its kind . if the phone 's camera is propped up and aimed at them while they practice , the app will track the position and success rate of each throw . ",
        "as the wall street journal reported , the free app offers users real-time feedback , complete with an automatically-spliced video recording of every single shot the athlete takes so they can check their form . at least , it does for 300 shots per month -- more than that , and a user is prompted to pay $ 8 for a are other apps that coaches and athletes use , of course . coach 's eye , for instance , lets athletes review and annotate their footage . but while many of them help athletes film themselves , none use ai to help improve performance . ",
        "without an expert there to review the footage , these athletes may not even know what they 're looking is n't yet as sophisticated as a real-life human coach -- right now , the app 's ai gets confused if there 's more than one person on the court . but david lee , the co-founder and ceo of nex team , the company behind homecourt , is optimistic for how ai will be able to serve athletes in the future . `` in the future , we believe we can provide a platform where coaches and trainers can be actively training and coaching their players through the app from anywhere , anytime , '' lee told futurism . ",
        "he added that some athletes are already using homecourt to work remotely with their coaches when one of them is on the road . that way , athletes can get feedback from coaches based on what the ai saw during a solo practice 's ai , rudimentary as it might be , represents an important first step . artificial intelligence and apps -- cheap compared to the elite coaches that kids are expected to hire if they want to break into travel leagues or thrive in a highly-competitive sport -- could democratize the way that people can train and 's ai , rudimentary as it might be , represents an important first step . ",
        "artificial intelligence and apps could democratize the way that people can train and the future , lee plans to make the app capable of new measurements so it can glean even more about a player , some of which a human coach ca n't readily discern . for basketball players , homecourt would look for things like jump height , speed , and release time , and analyze how each factor plays a role in an athlete 's accuracy . `` from the data , we can extract what shooting form has the highest consistency and success specifically for you , '' says lee . ",
        "`` the idea here is not to identify the perfect shot , but your perfect shot . '' he also hopes to bring the homecourt 's level of analysis to other sports . tennis might be a natural next step , since the court is similarly marked with clear lines that help the ai gauge where people are standing . but other sports and activities may see ai coaches in the near future as well . even some unconventional ones like yoga . `` we can track a person 's poses for something like downward dog and provide instant feedback about adjustments to help a yogi improve their poses , '' says lee . ",
        "`` simply seeing ourselves doing yoga along with actionable insights could revolutionize yoga since most people do n't currently get any feedback about their poses and how they can improve . '' while having your smartphone film you while you stretch and balance may ruin yoga 's relaxing elements for some , ai could be a great learning tool for the many yoga practitioners who only do yoga at home , instructed by a video . once people get the fundamentals down , they would presumably be able to unplug and enjoy yoga 's meditative or not homecourt reaches a given sport , it 's clear that sports technology is becoming more sophisticated than ever before . ",
        "athletes and coaches have access to an incredible amount of analytics and data , which helps them find more specific ways to improve their games in ways that would n't have been imaginable in the past . the key to improving sports through ai , of course , is to make sure that these technologies are available to everyone . otherwise , tools like homecourt will only help the privileged few who already had access to the best the premium membership to homecourt is n't unaffordable for most , it 's yet another subscription to keep track of . meanwhile , the price tags for other advanced sports technology can easily climb into the triple digits , or even 's easy to wonder whether these high-tech systems can really deliver on the promise to bring competitive sports to people who have been historically priced out . ",
        "until more competitors arrive to the artificial intelligence coaching space , we may have to wait and one ca n't expect one company like homecourt to solve the problems of wealth inequality in sports , what we can all hope is increased outreach to make sure that those who would actually benefit from smarter sports tech actually get to use it .
