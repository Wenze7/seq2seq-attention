        "the bears returned to practice thursday morning after wednesday 's day off . not only were they back in pads , they also tackled to the ground during two sessions for the first time this year . `` live is great for the run game , and then it 's also good for the perimeter-type runs and passes to see how your corners and safeties come up and tackle , '' coach matt nagy said . `` and there 's no excuse . if i get trucked , it was n't that it was ` thud ' and i was n't ready . ",
        "if i get trucked , it 's : i knew that it was live , and i got beat one on one . `` here are five observations from thursday 's practice . remember , these are just snapshots of players ' attempts to try new things and work on techniques while they try to master the offensive and defensive quarterback mitch trubisky has been intercepted in all three of the bears ' padded thursday , veteran cornerback prince amukamara got him twice in quick succession during seven-on-seven drills . one of them resulted from an off-target throw for kevin white that was tipped . ",
        "`` mitch had a couple interceptions today , '' nagy acknowledged . `` the best part of that was he came back with a completion on the next play . so we 're growing in that process . he 's testing the waters along with the other quarterbacks . `` trubisky continues to chase consistency . a pair of deep throws to running back/wide receiver tarik cohen exemplified this . early in 11-on-11 , he hit cohen in stride down the right sideline , with linebacker nick kwiatkoski close in coverage . later , though , his incomplete deep post to cohen was overthrown , and cohen was covered , anyway , by cornerback bryce course , trubisky is n't going to hit all of his throws , and training camp is the time to figure out what he can the live tackling red-zone session , trubisky threw a perfect fade to adam shaheen for a touchdown . ",
        "the ball was high and outside the defender where only shaheen could catch it , and the big tight end reminded us why he 's such a red-zone last scribbled line in the notebook : trubisky rushed through a gaping hole on a zone-read keeper , the type of play the chiefs had in their playbook for quarterback alex smith and the bears had in for trubisky last season . trubisky 's read and decision-making will always be a point of focus on those plays , and he got that one anthony miller showed off his strong hands on a touchdown grab and another highlight-reel catch , part of a standout practice for the second-round rookie slot 's steadily building a case to be the bears starting slot receiver for week 1 , although that distinction probably carries less weight when considering how much nagy moves receivers around and shuffles personnel 's touchdown was a fade that he caught above his head . ",
        "the other catch was a spectacular leaping grab that he snatched off the back of cornerback marcus cooper 's head . cooper was face-guarding him near the left both receptions , miller secured the ball away from his body . phil savage , former ravens director of player personnel and browns general manager , described miller 's hands as `` sticky '' in a tweet after he attended practice . `` it 's a really big part of my game ; you 've got to have strong hands , '' miller said . `` especially at this level , there 's going to be a lot of traffic catches with a lot of guys around you . ",
        "you 've got to be able to catch it away from your body . `` to help his hands , miller sometimes squeezes grip strengtheners when he 's sitting around . and he kneads rice in a bucket in the bears training for the fade , it was n't a high throw that enabled miller to show off his hops . instead , he won the ball with good body position . `` you want to make sure you get your position , first of all , either parallel or in front of him , '' miller said . `` and then you want to stack him so you have position over the ball when it comes over you . ",
        "`` his rushing touchdown was an example of how the bears ' speedy receivers can threaten defenses on the perimeter . it 's a dimension to the running game that opens all sorts of misdirection and options for rookie sixth-round draft pick kylie fitts to seize his opportunity to earn time in the outside linebacker rotation , he must prove he can effectively rush the bears liked him in the draft mostly as a run stopper . as a pass rusher , they considered him to have upside . refining his pass-rush techniques in camp is his path to the field , especially because the bears ca n't count on aaron lynch , who 's injured for the third time since , in one-on-one pass-rush drills thursday , used his right arm -- and only his right arm -- to push back tackle rashaad move is called , appropriately enough , the `` long arm . '' ",
        "fitts never used it at utah , but bears outside linebackers coach brandon staley is big on it , fitts said . `` rookie camp , otas , i 've just been trying to work on the long arm , '' fitts said . `` you 're a lot longer that way than with two arms . there are so many things that can come from that . you can chop . you can snatch them by . you can keep powering through . `` fitts ' work with the move centers on timing and hand placement on the offensive lineman . ",
        "it 's especially effective if the blocker 's hands are down . and placement in the chest area is of the utmost importance . `` if he 's over-setting , now i want to go inside , '' fitts said . `` if kind of short in setting , i want to go outside . `` those are all very quick reads and movements . fitts prepares himself by watching bears offensive linemen 's movements and tendencies on video . `` it 's a lot to learn , '' he safety eddie jackson stopped a run for no gain during the live tackling appeared to fit his gap perfectly by coming downhill aggressively and meeting the second-string running back in the a defense with so many known quantities , jackson is one of the more intriguing bears need him to make his biggest impact in pass defense , particularly in forcing turnovers . ",
        "but he 's mindful of how important run defense is to what he offers the came to the bears last season with questions about his tackling , which were acknowledged by alabama coach nick saban . jackson was intent on improving his angles , and there were signs of progress amid growing pains throughout his rookie appears fully willing to tackle and be physical , which is an important component of playing safety . jackson told reporters july 22 that he put on weight in the offseason , although he did n't say how much or what he weighs now . ",
        "he appears fuller than his wiry frame from last undrafted rookie ryan nall 's 30-yard touchdown run featured a hesitation move that made cornerback jonathon mincy miss in is worth keeping an eye on in the second half of exhibition games next month . the bears really like the undrafted rookie from oregon state because he does many things well . this could help him sneak onto the 53-man roster as the fourth running back or at least hang around on the practice squad as injury insurance at the running back his touchdown in live-tackling drills , he changed his pace as he reached the second level , and mincy whiffed when nall cut 6-foot-2 , and 232 pounds , nall moves relatively well . ",
        "on one carry in live tackling team drills , he adjusted his path behind the line of scrimmage without breaking stride or slowing down , demonstrating good vision and nimble feet . `` the nice thing with ryan is that he 's versatile in that he can run the ball , block , go out and run routes , can do different things , '' nagy said . `` so , being a rookie coming in here as an undrafted free agent , he 's done really well . we were excited to get the pads on him , and you saw in the live period that he was making plays .
