        "the dallas cowboys are currently underway with training camp and there are a few players who have stood out . let 's take a look at some camp dallas cowboys are knee deep in training camp and are beginning to work out which players belong on the 53 man roster . while this camp has been more interesting than those in the past for several reasons , the most important factor would be how much opportunity is available to younger players . this camp has been about letting the youth on this team shine especially in the secondary and defensive line . ",
        "with such potent competition , this year let 's take a look at three players who have turned heads during training jones : for some time , dallas cowboy fans have wanted to see byron jones finally grow into an elite piece of the secondary , it appears that time is now . we have seen players have good camps and falter during the regular season but jones has something this year . jones has more of an edge and less hesitation in man to man situations as he has shown significant growth during this years camp . could that be because of kris richard 's new approach with jones ? ",
        "that definitely has something to do with it as richard has seemed to have a plan for jones in this defensive scheme all along and is finally being able to utilize it . jones is expected to be the dallas cowboys top cornerback this season so it makes sense that his development has been paramount to the defensive coaching staff . this is a contract year for jones so expect some fireworks from the former first-round pick . tavon austin/michael gallup/allen hurns : this group of wide receivers has been interesting to watch , to say the least . everyone expects them to do very little this season but in reality , they are a group of productive players looking for their place in the nfl . ",
        "the release of dez bryant has overshadowed just how surprisingly good this wide receiving corps has been . deonte thompson , tavon austin , michael gallup , and allen hurns have all impressed at times . gallup had an incredible day where he looked like a number one wide receiver . hurns shows his veteran instincts mixed with some powerful physicality . he has dominated a couple of defensive backs this offseason and should be worth the money the dallas cowboys paid for him . austin has been incredibly fast and efficient when targeted . he looks like the fastest player on the field and has been running some interesting intermediate/deep routes and finding a modest amount of success . ",
        "gallup 's skills far surpass those of a rookie and he could make more of an impact than originally thought . this could be the season that one of these players breaks through to superstardom . jihad ward : the dallas cowboys would be in a real bind if not for trading ryan switzer for jihad ward during the 2018 nfl draft . david irving 's suspension put this team behind the eight ball and a replacement was hard to come by until the front office acquired ward . since then he has been a wrecking machine on defense , proving to be one of the best defensive tackles on the roster . ",
        "ward is actually looking like one of the best defensive linemen on the roster so the team could have gotten a secret weapon to add to their arsenal . if ward is as productive as he shows during practice then it will be hard for david irving to win back his starting job . so far this camp has been pretty eye-opening in terms of just how far this team could grow in terms of time will tell if this optimism and growth will translate into on the field success .
