        "lakeport - when they yelled `` fire '' in the theater , it was for real . moviegoers at the lakeport cinema 5 , near the shores of clear lake , were watching the sequel to the romantic comedy `` mamma mia ! '' this week when fire officials rushed into the playhouse and announced that the town of just over 5,000 residents was being evacuated because of the river fire . `` we were almost through the movie and they flipped on the lights , '' said resident annette hopkins , who on monday had been out of her house for more than 24 hours , staying with friends . ",
        "`` we did n't even get to see the cher part . '' as dozens of wildfires ripped across the state this week , the lives of tens of thousands of californians have been upended in big and small ways . the latest disruption was to the several communities along the western shore of clear lake , where the river fire was one of two major blazes burning in the hills high above water 's edge . the fires , dubbed the mendocino complex , were the most recent to threaten lake county , a rural region 100 miles north of san francisco . ",
        "over the past four years , the county has been ravaged by wildfires , the most destructive of them the 2015 valley fire that wiped out nearly 1,500 homes and left four dead . `` i 've been saying that lakeport is going to be next , '' hopkins said . `` we 're the only place here that has n't burned . '' the evacuation of town residents charity and andrew hansen was a bit less hasty , if not anticlimactic . the couple had driven an hour to santa rosa on saturday , the day before their city was declared off-limits , to escape the smoke . ",
        "before they could get back in , fire officials had shut them out . `` our neighbors called to tell us that we 'd been evacuated , '' said charity , 40 . fortunately , their friends broke into the hansens ' home behind the courthouse before their own departures and grabbed the couple 's two rottweilers , panzer and puppyloo . after reuniting with their dogs , the hansens set up a tent that they happened to have in the trunk of their car at an evacuation center at kelseyville high school . late monday , they had to uproot again after fire officials ordered an evacuation of kelseyville and its approximately 3,000 residents . ",
        "they were directed to evacuation centers in the nearby towns of lower lake and middletown . fire officials said kelseyville , 6 miles south of here , was not in immediate danger , but winds were erratic and things could change . but in lakeport , the thought of evacuating was just too much for some . kenny ridgeway , 48 , runs a nutritional supplement business on the edge of lakeport and was n't about to risk losing it . he lined up garden hoses and buckets of water behind his warehouses to douse any spot fires that might spark up from the larger inferno that billowed in the distance . ",
        "`` if our inventory burns , it would take us six months to a year to replace it , '' he said . `` i 'm not taking any chances . "
