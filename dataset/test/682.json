        "for would-be parents who are unable to have children without medical assistance , one possible option is to use an egg donor . this method involves a donor anonymously giving her eggs to an infertile patient to help them give birth . but after undergoing the decision to have fertility treatment , hopeful-moms-to-be are faced with a second question : `` will my kid look like me ? '' ovobank , a pioneering egg bank in spain , has a high-tech answer to the conundrum -- and it involves using facial recognition to match up patients to similar-looking donors . ",
        "`` in spain , where both fiv marbella and ovobank are based , egg donation is anonymous , so the patient ca n't choose the donor as it is done in some countries , '' dr. enrique criado scholz , general director of the two companies , told digital trends . `` it is the medical professionals that have the responsibility of finding a donor that matches the patient 's phenotypic characteristics . '' until now , this process was achieved by looking at the patient 's phenotypical characteristics -- referring to their height , hair color , eye color , and skin color . ",
        "the facial matching part was then a subjective decision made based on the doctor 's choices . what ovomatch offers instead is a facial-recognition matching algorithm , which allows the patient to find their idea donor by snapping a quick selfie through a mobile app . `` the patient to take a selfie and scans over 100 facial points , which it will then compare to the donors that already match that patient phenotypically , '' scholz said . `` ovomatch will then come up with the number of donors that not only match the patient 's phenotypic characteristics , but also have a close resemblance to her . '' ",
        "after this process is carried out , the app sends out two reports : one to the collaborating ivf center so they can begin to program the treatment , and the other to ovobank so that it can prepare the necessary paperwork related to the egg donation . finally , ovobank will get in contact with the collaboration center , and arrange shipment of the eggs . `` this service is already being rolled out internationally , '' scholz said . `` it is available for download on both android and ios platforms .
