        "a team of scientists confirmed that the sun was once a juvenile being just like the other stars . the confirmation came after analysis of ancient blue crystals called the hibonite . astronomers have previously identified stars to be extremely energetic during their early lives , but they were not sure about the sun 's behavior during its juvenile , ancient and rare blue crystals called the hibonite from about billion years ago confirmed that the sun used to be as hyperactive . think of the sun with the energy of a three-year-old kid , except that the sun was just a newborn when it behaved like a a juvenile star , the sun erupted habitually , churning out voluminous high-energy particles . ",
        "the ancient blue crystals trapped in meteorites revealed this rowdy behavior . these minerals may probably be the first minerals formed in the solar system , according to the scientists with the university of chicago , the field museum , and eth zurich , who performed the study on the blue hibonite crystalsfor their study , published in nature astronomy on july 30 , the scientists examined the chemical reactions that took place in the creation of the microscopic ice-blue crystals . their analysis revealed that as the sun spewed loads of energetic particles , some of the protons hit the calcium and aluminum in the blue hibonite crystals . ",
        "the force caused the atoms to split into tinier atoms of neon and neon and helium particles were trapped inside the hibonite for billions of years , merging in the space rocks where scientists have discovered larger mineral grain found in space rocks are usually only a few times larger than the diameter of a human hair , said andy davis , co-author for the study . when the team examined these particles , the hibonite stood out as the tiniest light blue kööp , the lead author of the study , explained that hibonite crystals measure less than 100 microns across . ",
        "even with this minuscule size , however , kööp said the ancient blue crystals were able to retain the highly volatile gases produced by the young sun 's erratic behavior billions of years hyperactive juvenile sunthe young sun , in its days before the planets were formed , contained a massive disk of gas and dust that spiraled around the solar system . the sun at this time was hot , more than 2,700 degrees fahrenheit . venus , in comparison , can already melt lead with its temperature of 872 degrees the sun 's disk of gas and dust calmed down , the blue hibonite crystals were eventually formed . ",
        "unlike the more tranquil adult sun that people knew now , the juvenile sun had , however , kept on shooting its loads of high energy , hitting the crystals over and over again , causing the chemical reactions to happen for numerous times . `` it 'd be like if you only knew someone as a calm adult -- you 'd have reason to believe they were once an active child , but no proof . but if you could go up into their attic and find their old broken toys and books with the pages torn out , it 'd be evidence that the person was once a high-energy toddler , '' explained philipp heck , one of the authors of the study .
