        "santa clara -- shanahan sees training camp as a fertile ground for players to hone their crafts without fear of social-media rebuke and public ridicule . make mistakes now and correct them , rather than during the season , akin to a cy young winner testing out a new pitch in spring richard sherman got burned by marquise goodwin to start sunday 's one-on-one drill , video of it sparked concerns web-wide over sherman 's comeback from achilles repair . shanahan saw it differently , and he replayed the video to his team tuesday , commending sherman for aggressively testing himself without fear of failure on a training-camp 's thesis , as presented in wednesday 's media briefing : `` i just used it as an example . ",
        "you guys have got to put yourselves in these players ' shoes . we did n't used to get reports of stats on our practices and i do n't get the reports and judge our guys off of them . `` you tell everyone to ignore them , but i guarantee people hear it , their wives hear it , someone hears it . you know jimmy 's completion percentage every day , how many picks he threw and i just try to put myself in players ' shoes . `` you 're going out trying to practice and get better at stuff , trying new things , stuff you do n't always do in games and you 're getting reports on stuff that you had a bad completion percentage or you ca n't do this . ",
        "`` that stuff worries me for players because now i 'm afraid they 're going to go there and be like , ` man , i know you want to try this new thing , but i do n't want this to go viral for the next week , i do n't want people to say i ca n't throw this type of ball . ' `` then they do n't get better and they just try to survive the day so they can please people who do n't really know what they 're working on . it takes a very mentally strong person to not care about that . ",
        "`` that 's what i liked about sherm on that play . i 've been around a lot of successful corners who have a name that everyone knows and they get beat on a go-route and they hold their hamstring or they just ease up a little bit . i get it , that 's probably what i would do , or i 'd back up and be very scared . i 'm not going to go try to jam one of the fastest guys on the planet on my first rep back knowing what 's going to happen . ",
        "`` i respect sherm because he does n't care . he 's not worried about anything . he 's out there working on his craft trying to get better and not caring what people say . that 's why you get better from that rep. `` it 's a good example to show young guys , to show everyone that that stuff does n't matter . you getting better is what matters so you can do it on sunday . `` shanahan , in 18 months on the job , continues to win over players , fans and , yes , media with communication skills . ",
        "he arrived with a reputation as a young , arrogant , know-it-all . answers such as wednesday 's help rewrite that reputation , in that he 's verbally outlining his thought process rather than dismissing those who do n't know 's not to say jimmy garoppolo 's completion percentage in camp should n't be reported to stat-thirsty fans . it 's just that everyone should know such stats and reports come with vast interpretation in a camp setting , where quarterbacks are not sacked , receivers run wrong routes and shanahan may want to test a defender 's again , it 's a stretch to say sherman does n't care about failure . ",
        "since that first rep against goodwin , sherman has been on top of his game , especially in the full-team drills , eager to reestablish himself as a top-notch cornerback , only one week into the forgivable classroom setting known as training camp . "
