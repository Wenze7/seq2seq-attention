        "david casarez came west to silicon valley with his life in a van and startup dreams in his eyes . ",
        "within months , the web developer and would-be entrepreneur was hugging apple ceo tim cook and interviewing at the legendary tech no job offer came , from apple or any other company , and casarez found himself sleeping in stairwells and on park benches , surviving on pouches of tuna and ramen-noodle cups , twitching at every night-time noise and weeping over his plight , he , after a random photo of casarez standing with a job-search sign beside a mountain view intersection went viral , he 's fielding expressions of interest from some 200 companies , more than 70 in the bay area .",
        "`` i was just out there at the intersection hoping that somebody at least would take my resume and give me a job offer in the bay area , '' said casarez , austin , texas , to rock bottom in california , and back up to his current perch sifting through the many missives from potential employers , casarez embodies the classic silicon valley reinvention tale of dreams pursued , dashed , and dreamed again . he has , in tech-talk , failed casarez arrived in california from austin in september , he was already working to develop a food-service startup . ",
        "he figured he 'd get a job at another startup while he continued to build his own . he had three years ' experience in tech jobs at general motors , a bachelor 's degree in information-systems management from texas a&m , an old iphone , a strong faith in the `` lean startup '' method , and $ 20,000 from cashing out his 401k , he said in an interview this week . `` i felt very confident , '' he a networking event , he met an investor interested in his startup idea , but a budding deal fell through over differences in vision , he said . ",
        "the hoped-for job interviews were n't happening . he lacked connections , and concluded outsiders have a tough time getting tech work in silicon valley . then an idea arrived , a way to make valuable industry connections by making a splash at a high-profile three days in november , casarez camped out in front of an apple store in palo alto to be first in line to buy the just-unveiled $ 1,000 iphone x . he succeeded , and made a very powerful connection when ceo tim cook wrapped his arms around casarez in a congratulatory hug . soon , casarez was invited for an interview at apple 's campus . ",
        "but the job , he said , went to someone already working for the downward slide began . casarez was sleeping in his van in mountain view to save money , and had calculated the `` burn rate '' at which his cash reserves were dwindling . he 'd figured his nest egg would last six months , maybe seven . `` i was barely scraping by in march , '' he said . he started to miss payments on his van . in early june , the vehicle was repossessed , and he was on the streets , sleeping in a park , he said . ",
        "`` it was very hard , because when i was living in the van i had the safety of knowing i was enclosed , '' he said . `` i was literally at the very bottom . `` he 'd never imagined his own choices could bring him so low . depression took hold . `` i was crying a lot -- ` how did i let it get to this point ? ' '' he said . `` it really got to me . `` he held onto a gym membership so he could shower , but as his savings vanished , he had to sell the iphone x. deep inside , he held onto hope . ",
        "and he decided to fight back against his self-created disaster . `` i told myself , ` i 'm not going to let this break me , ' '' he 's when he decided he needed to do something new to stand out . so he stood out , on the sidewalk where el camino real and san antonio road come together in mountain view , and held up a sign saying , `` homeless hungry 4 success take a resume . '' he was not taking money , he was on friday , when passerby jasmine scofield asked permission to take his photo , and posted it , along with a photo of his resume , on twitter . ",
        "the social media platform went mad . as of tuesday evening , scofield 's tweet had been shared more than 138,000 times . `` i did n't think people were going to think anything of it -- there 's people who stand at corners all the time , asking for money , asking for beer , asking for whatever , '' said casarez , whose twitter profile now features his `` hungry 4 success '' mantra and includes an email for media 's life was instantly transformed . television and newspaper reporters were calling , and he had to limit his media availability after monday so he could devote himself to responding to prospective employers who contacted him , he said . ",
        "`` i really want to make the right decision , and take the time to do that , '' casarez said . `` for it to have turned out the way it has , it 's just been a blessing . it 's just given me hope to move forward . `` one of those who saw scofield 's tweet was austen allred , ceo of lambda school , a pleasanton company that trains software engineers at no up-front cost , and operates a fund for homeless students in its program . casarez 's story struck a chord with allred , who in 2016 spent months living out of his car in palo alto after arriving from utah in pursuit of a tech job . ",
        "`` i view it as my responsibility to help the people who are in the same position that i was , '' allred said , adding that he admires anyone like casarez who `` searches for a job a just hustles . `` lambda is providing casarez with up to three months in an airbnb and mentoring for his interview 's story appears headed for a happier ending than he imagined when he was sleeping in stairwells , but his struggle is not unique , said carl guardino , ceo of the silicon valley leadership group , which represents businesses in the region . ",
        "`` people desperately want to come here , work here , innovate here and succeed here , yet we 're pricing out the folks who already live here and making it much more difficult for folks who want to come here , because for 20 years we 've under-invested in the fact that workers and their families actually need a place to live , '' guardino said .
