        "a fledgling network can invest heavily in a campaign to raise its profile and break into public consciousness , or it can do what it does and hope people state 's urban meyer saved chicago-based stadium a lot of wednesday was a pivotal moment for meyer and his highly ranked buckeyes football program , so too was it for multiplatform , jerry reinsdorf-backed sports network that 's not quite a year old had the tv interview helping drive the news the absence of their own video , espn and others had to keep running stadium 's clip as they sought to catch up to the news concerning meyer 's suddenly uncertain future as ohio state 's was courtney smith detailing allegations of domestic abuse by her ex-husband , recently fired buckeyes assistant coach zach spoke of the fears that for so long kept her silent and said she believed meyer knew of her predicament as it was unfolding , although he had publicly denied it as recently as last of it ran with stadium 's logo and the word `` exclusive '' in the upper-right corner of the screen everywhere the clip was shown -- which was almost everywhere , it seemed .",
        "`` i just tried to get out of her way and let her tell her story for the most part , '' stadium 's kristen balboni , who recorded the piece the day before in ohio , said thursday . `` she was very forthcoming in terms of what she was willing to tell us , and i made sure she knew the stakes of talking about all this and that there could be negative backlash . she just felt now was the time for a variety of different reasons . she was very forthright , very open ... about everything . ",
        "`` coming out within a couple of hours of a damning report posted wednesday to facebook by brett mcmurphy , a laid-off espn reporter making optimal use of his supposed downtime , the one-two punch precipitated ohio state placing meyer on paid leave while it investigates and weighs conducted his own interview with courtney smith and obtained text messages between her and other wives of buckeyes coaches , including meyer 's spouse , this too was a score for 's because mcmurphy -- who joked on twitter that the meyer story gave him more face time on `` sportscenter '' on wednesday than he had enjoyed in his previous five years at espn -- reportedly is headed soon to stadium once freed of the constraints of his old espn , a one-time researcher for espn 's `` mike & mike '' and host of fox sports ' `` at the buzzer , '' joined stadium earlier this year as a sideline reporter and host .",
        "she said others at stadium had pursued the interview , and she came aboard the project only in recent days . `` for me , it came together very quickly because i was brought on once they had secured the interview , '' balboni said . `` i do n't have a ton of experience with this type of journalism , but i 've never felt more supported . `` we had a lot of meetings . everybody , the head of each department , was there . we really talked about tone and ... we talked about the best way to approach this because this is the first time stadium has done anything in terms of an exclusive like this . ",
        "`` stadium 's first courtney smith clip came out on twitter , clocking in at 2 1/2 minutes . ",
        "an 11-minute version of the interview was part of its `` campus insiders '' program before a full-length 19-minute clip was 's consistent with the `` as you like it '' approach stadium favors , in which its content can be consumed in various formats and platforms , from over the air as a digital subchannel in many markets to its website , as well as social media outlets and platforms with which it has perhaps the biggest push this time came from rival media outlets eager to put a human face and voice to the allegations at the center of a significant story .",
        "`` i was conscious it could be a really big story and certainly could have big implications , but i do n't think i expected it to be of this magnitude , '' balboni said . `` everyone here is really proud of how we did the interview . this is a very sensitive subject and we 're proud of how we handled it and got her story across . `` it did n't do badly getting stadium 's story across either .
