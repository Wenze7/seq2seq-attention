        "zenobia , queen of palmyra is not an official member of the new-soul band durand jones & the the circa 1859 marble bust , be-robed and beatific , looked the part of a backup singer , more or less , as the band that formed at indiana university performed in a row with her in the art institute of chicago 's classical sculpture court in a surprise lollapalooza-museum event thursday sad part , art institute painting conservator allison langley noted , was that the otherwise transcendent mini-concert did not find a way to incorporate the nearby 1874 statue jephthah 's daughter , a depiction of a young woman who is literally holding a tambourine .",
        "`` how did we not get that in the shot ? '' ",
        "langley minor art historical lament is one of the few that could be spoken about the event , which saw jones and his band bring their version of the classics to the sculpture court a few days ahead of their scheduled sunday appearance at the big festival outside museum doors in grant much of suburban teendom scurried around outside , the few score people who happened to notice the band setting up in the museum , or who saw the @artinstitutechi teaser tweet at about 10:30 thursday , were treated to two indications tunes , performed entirely without amplification , against those hard surfaces , in that open-to-the-ceiling room , the sound was lush and gorgeous : two different band voices , jones and his drummer aaron frazer , plus trumpet , saxophone , percussion and chicagoan blake rhein on guitar , simmering in a slow groove .",
        "`` it was so beautiful , '' said frazer , who sang falsetto lead on `` is it any wonder ? '' `` it makes everything , like , extra dreamy . `` rhein said that for the first time in a band performance he played -- entirely appropriately -- classical guitar . `` oh , man , '' added jones , who opened things with a resonant `` make a change . '' `` it reminded me of , like , a really big church . i just wanted to fill it up . `` lollapalooza being the entertainment machine that it is , there were festival videographers on hand to record the performance . ",
        "they hoped to cut the video right away and have it up on the lolla website and/or youtube channel fairly quickly , a staffer performance came about at lolla 's suggestion to the museum , which has a partnership with the event , said a spokeswoman -- a much better and more workable idea than bringing a painting out onto festival art institute tie-ins , of sorts , to lolla have included showing the art video `` a lot of sorrow '' during the summer of 2016 . in it , the band the national , a headliner this year , is filmed playing its ballad `` sorrow , '' over and over again , for more than six hours 's show was more succinct . ",
        "`` can you keep a secret ? '' said the morning tweet . `` we 've got something special happening in the galleries with our friends from @lollapalooza . '' then it showed an image of picasso 's `` the old guitarist , '' a fixture in the modern wing and a clue to the type of event rather than its and some curatorial staff were on hand to make sure the artworks were treated right , or for a break in the museum routine , or both . having the band play acoustic helped , as did the fact that the public was asked to watch from up above , peering into the court from the surrounding railings . ",
        "in such a circumstance , the biggest worry , langley said , would be `` visitors bobbing and weaving '' and maybe getting a little too close to a work . but all ended without incident , and those who happened to see it were treated to a different type of art filling their and band are also playing one of the lolla aftershows , friday night at thalia hall , the singer said . and considering that lollapalooza is a multi-day event , music fans might want to keep an eye on the museum 's twitter feed , just in case the crossover inspiration strikes again .
