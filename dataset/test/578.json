        "outfit : tobi toptopshop denimchinese laundry sandalsgucci bagi recently visited a place i always grew up going to when i was younger . the brentwood country mart is as nostalgia as it gets . i used to come here after getting off school back in middle school . i remember it being a great place to hang out with friends and share a basket of reddi-chick . so that 's exactly what we did . i brought my boyfriend here for the first time . it was definitely more crowded than i remember , but could n't pass up on a basket of chicken tenders and fries . ",
        "it certainly has n't changed much besides the people . we ended up at the beach after leaving with a nice iced coffee and chocolate chip cookie to go . we 're always on the go these days thanks to my busy schedule ! it 's so nice to start wearing more summer clothes . this top from tobi is perfect for a weekend afternoon . you can also never go wrong with stripes . i dusted off my white denim jeans from topshop and paired with my nude sandals from chinese laundry and gucci bag for a complete summer look .
