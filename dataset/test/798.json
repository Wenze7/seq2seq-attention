        "fear the walking dead returns shortly for the second half of season 4 and a new teaser hints that morgan might be heading back to the walking dead guide has an exclusive teaser for season 4b that indicates morgan might be heading back to the communities that he left at the end of season 8 . alicia appears to be out on her own killing walkers . she 's drawing walkers on a solo mission when morgan finds is concerned about her , and he tells her that he is heading back east to the place where he came from . ",
        "that means morgan is heading back towards alexandria , the hilltop , and the kingdom . he tells alicia that she should come too . since she seems to be on a mission to help others morgan tells her that she could do a lot of good back among the survivors that he knows . and she could . she is a capable fighter and a leader , like her mother was . but alicia seems determined to finish whatever mission she is worried about her killing walkers on her own , especially since she 's deliberately seeking them out . ",
        "when he tells her that she could get hurt out there on her own it 's hard not to think about carl and what happened to him . he and siddiq were together and he still got bit , so alicia is definitely playing with fire to seek out groups of walkers to kill . you can watch the teaser morgan go back to ? morgan says that he is leaving for the other communities in the morning . but , that does n't mean he will actually get there . thanks to the creative use of time in this season we do n't know when this exchange between morgan and alicia takes place . ",
        "is it before the big storm ? if it is then morgan could be delayed by the hurricane or he could end up in a situation that makes him abandon his plans to return to the would be interesting to see what the survivors would make of alicia . but with the coming time jumps in season 9 it would be difficult for the two shows to line up again to allow more crossovers to only reason that morgan 's timeline met up with the timeline this season was because of the time jump in that was part of the rebooting of the story . ",
        "with going through it 's own reboot further crossovers in the present time are crossoversthat does n't mean that fans wo n't see characters that are dead on timeline appear in the timeline thanks to althea 's tapes . in the first half of season 4 there were several tapes in althea 's collection that could have belonged to some of survivors like abe , rosita , and eugene . there was also a tape that could be daniel salazar ' was confirmed that daniel salazar would return in season 4 but so far he has not appeared . maybe he will be appearing on one of althea 's tapes . ",
        "more answers will be revealed very soon when returns for season 4b on august 12th on amc . "
