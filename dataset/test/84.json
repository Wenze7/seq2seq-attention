        "the blackhawks have had so much success over the last decade fans have enormous expectations , even for a team coming off a last-place kane is ok with that . `` look at a team like colorado , '' kane said . `` finished in last place and then last year they 're one of the hottest teams in the league , they make the playoffs and have a great season . that can happen with any team . `` i think that gives us a little bit of a positive outlook but as far as the fans go you want those expectations , you want the fans to expect you to win and that 's the culture that has been created for the past 10 or so years . ",
        "that 's a good thing . `` there is n't the same concern for kane as there is for jonathan toews , duncan keith and brent seabrook , all of whom are older than 30 and had noticeably subpar seasons . but kane , who turns 30 in november , had a good season though he failed to average a point per game for the first time since the 2011-12 being named tournament mvp while leading usa to a bronze medal at the world championships , kane started to get his body in shape for the upcoming season with an emphasis on lateral movement , speed and explosiveness . ",
        "`` the way players train now it 's unbelievable the amount of preparation and work that goes into an offseason , '' kane said . but you 're definitely going to see results . `` growing expectations for debrincat : last preseason , alex debrincat experienced little fanfare . at the blackhawks convention on friday , an image of him adorned an elevator door and fans were quick to recognize no . 12 . `` it was a little more low key coming in as a rookie , '' he said . `` there were n't many expectations for me . ",
        "now the expectations are there , but those are n't something i 'm really looking at . i 'm more looking to just improve in any way and be a better player . `` debrincat , 20 , made a strong impression during his rookie season with the hawks , scoring 28 goals with 24 assists . the 5-foot-7 forward starred at lake forest academy before going on to star with erie in the ontario hockey league . the hawks selected him in the second round of the 2016 nhl draft . `` i think you just ca n't let it get to your head , '' he said . ",
        "`` you keep competing and being a student of the game . '' "
