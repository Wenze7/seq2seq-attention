        "a new shape could explain why epithelial cells are able to pack tightly together as they turn into the linings of our organs . it all has to do with scutoid , a prism-like cell that acts like lego pieces . researchers may have just discovered a brand-new shape called the scutoid . ",
        "the discovery occurred while they were studying epithelial cells , the building blocks of embryos that eventually form the linings of many organs , including the , they have defined these cells as having the scutoid shape , and it could explain why they 're able to pack tightly together and form complex , covered geometric shape discovered : here 's what it looks like '' are like pieces of tente or lego from which animals are made , '' said luis escudero , a developmental biologist from the university of seville in spain and one of the authors of the study , which was published in the nature communications the development of embryos , their tissues bend as they start forming into organs .",
        "previously , scientists thought they were able to remain tightly packed if they were bottle-shaped or column-shaped , but advanced computer simulations have revealed that a more complex shape is did the researchers arrive at such a shape , though ? well , they first used a computer model that predicted which cell shapes would be most efficient in staying in contact with fellow cells in both flat or curved layers . the resulting shape ended up looking slightly similar to a prism , with six sides on one end , five on the other , and a bizarre triangular surface on one of the is what it looks like : after finding the shape , the researchers closely studied fruit fly salivary glands and zebrafish cells via microscopy and computer imaging , and they found out that these cells were indeed shaped like a scutoid . ",
        "the scientists believe cells that exist in any curved sheet of epithelial cells are scutoid-shaped -- even those in 's in a name ? bear in mind that the scutoid is a completely new shape in the field of science and geometry , so when the researchers found it , they were shocked . `` it was such a surprise ! '' according to did the name come from , though ? well , the researchers decided to base it on the scutellum of a beetle since the two look somewhat similar , the most prominent marker of which being the triangular shape at the center of a beetle 's outer 's not every day a new shape is discovered , so systems biologist javier buceta , who 's credited as a co-author of the study , was grateful for the opportunity to name a new shape . ",
        "`` it 's not going to be the circle or the square , but we have been able to name a new shape , '' buceta told gizmodo . "
