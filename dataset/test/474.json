        "paul konerko is making a long list of topics he wants to cover when he joins hawk harrelson for an upcoming white sox broadcast . `` it might be the only game ever that i hope goes to extra innings , '' konerko said tuesday during a visit to guaranteed rate field before the sox 's game against the royals . `` it 'll be awesome . `` i have n't seen hawk in a while . i 'm going to try to cram as much as i can in . i 'll say it now -- forgive me if i go off on some tangents that have nothing to do with what 's going on on the field . ",
        "`` konerko spent the last 16 years of his career with the sox , retiring after the 2014 season . he loves harrelson 's passion for the game and huge personality . `` when i think of hawk , i just think of how on almost a daily basis there was conversation about hawk on that left-field line stretching or sitting in the dugout during a game : ` i wonder what hawk said about that one ? ' '' konerko said . `` it was always , so yeah , it 's kind of an end of an era , a big long era . ",
        "i do n't think guys are going to get to do it as long as he has done it , and i do n't think guys will be allowed to be like he is anymore , right ? `` konerko said his only goal for that aug. . 19 telecast with the royals back in town is to avoid being fined by the fcc for saying something deadline : sox general manager rick hahn did n't have much to say to reporters after the trade deadline passed tuesday , but he did say in a text that he was deadline for non-waiver trades drains baseball executives , even if they 're only monitoring the activity of other clubs most of the time . ",
        "that appears to have been the case with the sox , who long ago indicated they did n't expect to trade either of their two biggest chips , avisail garcia and jose could imagine the situation being different a year from now if garcia and abreu have remained unsigned beyond 2019 . hahn is content to let their situations play out over time , with the offseason perhaps the most logical place to extend their contracts -- believed to be a significant possibility with abreu at least -- or trade innings : the sox did make a small transaction tuesday , acquiring class a left-handed reliever hunter schryver from the rays for international signing bonus pool money . ",
        "he was a seventh-round pick in the 2017 draft from villanova . ... omar narvaez is becoming james shields ' personal catcher . he worked with shields for an eighth consecutive start even though kevan smith normally starts against left-handed pitchers . ... the royals arrived without mike moustakas , whom they traded to the brewers last friday . he has hit 20 home runs versus the sox , his most against any opponent .
