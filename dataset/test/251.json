        "is it me , or is being kevin durant not as much fun as it used to be ? the instagram feud with a high school contentious appearance on mccollum 's podcast that spilled over into a twitter running insult-fest with chris paul 's brother during game 2 of the western conference 75 percent increase in technical fouls last 's a lot to like about durant . his philanthropy . his game . his skills , and the way he applies them in a team context . and for good measure , his is it me , or did durant transition from utterly unflappable during his first season with the warriors to slightly flappable in season 2 ? ",
        "fox sports ' chris broussard , speaking on first things first on wednesday morning seems to sense durant evolving as well . `` he 's a conflicted guy , '' broussard said . `` there 's a part of him that 's religious . he has ministers come visit him and hang out with him during the season . then there 's a big part of him that 's doing things that do n't match up with his faith . '' `` and then on the court ... the guy we saw in oklahoma city was not cursing all the time , was not being as aggressive in terms of arguing and maybe fighting with guys or getting technicals . ",
        "`` it seems only fair that we hear from the man of the hour at some point . here 's how durant replied to broussard : this dovetails nicely with a comment he made to the athletic last week : `` i know you think i 'm sensitive . but i 'm just somebody who is tired of holding in . `` durant went on to tell the athletic that he does n't understand why people have to parse and react to everything he says and can help him with that one . durant is a fascinating study , a 7-footer who can handle and bottom 30-footers . ",
        "he 's willing to get sweaty on defense . he 's willing to get remember watching a warriors-seattle sonics game on tv in durant 's rookie year . the sonics were a hot mess that season . durant was the best player on that team the day he walked through the door for the first practice . consequently , he got as many shots as he remember warriors tv analyst jim barnett saying something along the lines of , `` this kid is a big-time scorer , and that 's ok for now . but if this team ever grows into a contender , he 's going to have to play a more well-rounded game . ",
        "`` people have been watching him grow for the past 11 years . the same as people intently watched michael jordan , magic johnson , larry bird , wilt chamberlain , mickey mantle , joe dimaggio , babe your brain picked is part of the package . from the outside looking in , durant seems to tolerate the noise as well as anyone can . and speaking of `` noise '' : same as it ever was .
