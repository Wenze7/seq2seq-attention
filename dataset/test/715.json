        "greetings , lollapalooza goers , and welcome to chicago , the city whose large lakefront park you 're about to 're delighted you chose to come to our fine city , and we 're inspired by your desire to spend four days standing in a writhing mass of perspiring humanity while listening to nearly 200 bands you 've never heard of and four bands you actually like play music while strangers step on your feet . if you 've never been to the annual music festival in grant park , congratulations . ",
        "you have made a wise if you 're throwing that perfectly wise decision away and attending this year 's epic , outdoor celebration of rock and questionable life choices , there are a few things you should know to minimize the regret that will set in as you 're trampled by glitter-covered teenagers who heard jaden smith was spotted reading poetry to a unicorn near the `` glamping lounge '' at the toyota sienna festivan may want to laminate the following lollapalooza survival guide and keep it tucked in the fanny pack that you 're wearing an age check : before departing , make sure you stop and look at the birth date on your driver 's license .",
        "if you were born any time before aug. . 1 , 1978 , take your lollapalooza tickets and smack yourself in the face with them are you thinking ? if you 're even in the ballpark of 40 years old , you 're going to look ridiculous standing among throngs of gyrating youth and pretending you know that lil pump is a rapper and not a thing you use to inflate your kid 's pool matter how you dress , no matter how well you know the lyrics to every song by the flarps , everyone will assume you got lost on your way to a jimmy buffet just to show how unhip you are , there is n't a band called the flarps . ",
        "but you thought there was , did n't you ? now tear up those tickets and go see a movie or run to target or a sanity check : you have your tickets , you 've applied sunscreen , and you 've taken your preferred hallucinogen . now you just need to sit back for a moment and consider what you 're getting yourself 's summer in chicago , which means it will be hot and muggy . you are making a conscious decision to go and stand in the sun for at least 10 hours surrounded by about 100,000 other sunscreen-slathered human meat will be making noise . ",
        "they will be in a wide array of altered states of mind . and some , invariably , will attempt to urinate on your foot . if you 're fortunate enough to not have someone urinate directly on your foot , you will absolutely , at some point during those long 10 hours , step in urine that is not your will also be vomit . lots and lots of will find that a number of your lollapalooza colleagues are somehow morally opposed to using deodorant . the experience of dancing to a band called rainbow kitten surprise will be made slightly less fantastic by the guy in front of you who is jumping up and down with his arms up , each time brushing your nose with his armpit and smacking you in the face with his white-guy dreadlocks . ",
        "so before you get to grant park , consider all these things , and remember : you can sell the tickets you paid $ 34,000 for and then spend the day relaxing in an air-conditioned room listening to music on your phone and not being jostled by glazed-eyed , shirtless bros with unnecessary facial have fun ! : if you 've made it through the age check and the sanity check , there 's no hope for you , so you might as well as get to the park and start having what people who add marijuana buds to their wheatgrass smoothies call `` fun . ",
        "`` the good news is you will be surrounded by thousands of other people who are excited to spend four days listening to a diverse array of artists perform in a decidedly non-indoor environment , thus increasing the risk of heat stroke , dehydration and skin cancer ! the bad news is the same as the good news , but you probably do n't care because you 're still riding high from your wheatgrass smoothie and ca n't wait to chug a few bud lights before sticky mop nixon takes the stay hydrated . be nice to other people . ",
        "and if you need help , go to one of the over-40-year-old people you see standing around looking ridiculous and out of place . they 'll know what to they wo n't know that sticky mop nixon is n't actually a 're so unhip it 's a wonder their cargo shorts do n't fall off . "
