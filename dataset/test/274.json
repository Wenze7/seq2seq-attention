        "tariffs are a good-news bad-news story . tariffs can help off-price retailers , such as tjx cos. . , ross stores inc. . , burlington stores inc. . , and the dollar stores , dollar tree inc. . and dollar general corp. . and hurt full-price retailers like nordstrom inc. . , macy 's inc. . and target corp. . . nordstrom is a holding in jim cramer 's action alerts plus member club . want to be alerted before jim cramer buys or sells jwn ? learn more now . at least , that 's according to ron friedman , a partner at marcum llp , an accounting firm , and a long-time consultant for clothing manufacturers , who spoke with thestreet on monday , july 30 . ",
        "friedman believes with the current upbeat economy shoppers are heading to full-price retailers rather than discounters such as tjx , the industry leader , or ross stores , because they have more money to spend . `` the economy is good . people are going out to restaurants , clubs , movies and they 're shopping at the nordstrom 's and macys of the world , '' said friedman . if tariffs kick in and retailers need to pass them on to consumers , he said , it may send them into the arms of off-price retailers for bargains . ",
        "however , analyst simeon a. siegel , of nomura instinet equity research , told thestreet on monday , `` that will last about a week , before full-price retailers start discounting . '' he takes a long view of tariffs in that they are one of the many elements , like the costs of labor , cotton and other materials , and freight , that retailers and manufacturers must circumvent to make their operations more efficient . as for what determines whether consumers face higher prices , he said , generally depends on the pricing power of retailers and manufacturers . ",
        "john gold , vice president , supply chain and customs policy of the national retail federation , said all retailers and customers will feel the pinch from higher prices if tariffs , which so far have sidestepped broad categories of clothing and footwear , are put in place . `` as the president further escalates tariffs against china '' he added , `` those categories will most certainly be on the list and subject to a tariff . '' as for the off-price retailers , siegel thinks off-price retailers have nothing to fear because their business is up and will continue . ",
        "year to date , tjx is up 26 % , and ross , up % . "
