        "* the following commentary appeared recently in the hotline newsletter ... many months ago ... before the supreme court legalized gambling and the pac-12 released its financial data ... before the conference banned 5-7 teams from the postseason and declared olympic sports success matters as much as football success ... a curious thing happened in the sec : commissioner greg sankey squashed attempts by alabama to hire former mississippi coach hugh freeze for a staff was a surprising , if unprecedented move in that commissioners typically do n't wade into the campus hiring process . but an sec bylaw gave sankey the authority to influence hiring decisions in extreme circumstances : when a potential employee has been involved in major ncaa violations , as was the case with freeze during his tenure at ole development prompted me to consider the role of commissioner authority in pac-12 hiring practices , particularly in the wake of the basketball corruption case that engulfed two schools , usc and the conference be involved in hiring coaches , to some degree ? ",
        "put another way : can the athletic directors be trusted to hire clean head coaches and , just as critically , can the head coaches be trusted to hire clean assistants ? the standard to activate commissioner authority within the pac-12 would have to be high , just as high as it is in the sec . it would have to involve candidates with serious , proven by the topic , i reached out to every athletic director in the pac-12 . most declined to comment for the record , and no one thought the conference office should have a formal role . ",
        "`` i think it 's worthy of robust conversation , '' arizona 's dave heeke said . `` hiring an employee at the university level must be under the purview of the university , but i hope the conference office could be used as a source of information and consultation . it can play a role . `` i took that idea to chris hill , who , at the time , was in his final days as utah 's athletic director . `` more pressure has to be put on the president and the athletic director , '' hill explained . ",
        "`` we know who the coaches are that have the potential to cause you trouble . we ca n't look at each other and say , wink-wink , ` he 's found the lord ; he wo n't cause us any problems . ' we need to make sure the coaches are fully vetted . `` that 's when the idea coalesced : could the pac-12 office play a formalized role in the vetting process in football and men 's basketball ? head and assistants coaches with sketchy reputations are hired all the time across in the country because the dirt , so to speak , does n't always reach the eyes and ears of the search firms and the campus committees who advise athletic all , it took an fbi sting , complete with undercover agents and wiretaps , to expose a handful of assistant coaches . ",
        "how in the world would the suits running an executive placement firm know who 's really dirty ? and when it comes to hiring assistant coaches -- the staffers perhaps most susceptible to moral and ethical transgressions -- there are no committees or search firms ; there are n't even athletic directors . the head coach alone makes the , the same head coach who 's job security is tied to winning , and who knows that winning is tied to recruiting ... and who knows that recruiting often requires a trip to the timing involved in formalized vetting at the conference level would be tricky , because hires often unfold at a moment 's notice and end in a flash : candidate a says no , so let 's go with candidate b . ",
        "there would n't always be time for a full background check , for lengthy something would be better than nothing , especially on the men 's basketball should n't the conference retain a hiring specialist -- perhaps a former coach who has seen the filth unfold before his eyes -- in order to advise the campuses on who 's known to be clean and who 's thought to be dirty ? that specialist would consult with the athletic director hiring a head coach , or with the head coach hiring an assistant , and notify him/her if there are red flags from the sport 's conference should be as proactive as possible , because unless players get compensated for their services and skills , the corruption is n't going away .
