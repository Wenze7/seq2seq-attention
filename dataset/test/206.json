",
        "users can also save events for later or proceed to buy tickets via third-party vendors . everything is handled directly within search , meaning users do n't have to put up with unnecessary pop-ups and results for events in google searchthere 's also a dedicated tab called `` for you '' that brings up personalized suggestions and trending events . that means a person who frequents wine and cheese festivals will see similar search results from time to time . categories include running , cooking , photography , and every events site will work with search , however . google says they must properly format their content first to ensure that their results show up correctly .

        "`` we 've made it easy for sites to mark up their event listings to appear in this experience , with new listings updated quickly . event sites can follow these guidelines to ensure events are discoverable , '' google said in a blog post . sites can visit google 's event developers portal to learn stuff such as formatting , content guidelines , and search events feature : when will it roll out ? google says it 's rolling out the feature over the next few days . `` give it a try to find the perfect dog meetup , local festival or must-see summer concert for you .
