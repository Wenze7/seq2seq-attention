        "the buffalo sabres acquired jeff skinner from the carolina hurricanes . here 's why the sabres won the trade in a on thursday night , the buffalo sabres made an unexpected addition to their roster . desperately needing a left wing , the sabres traded for carolina hurricanes forward jeff skinner . he has one year remaining on his deal , which makes it an even more interesting trade from buffalo 's remains to be seen precisely what they will do with skinner . do the sabres intend on extending the 26-year-old forward ? or are they thinking outside the box , potentially looking to increase his value a bit and then trade him for a larger haul in february ? ",
        "either option makes sense , though the former is more few exceptions , nothing good in life is free . the sabres gave up cliff pu , a 2019 second-round pick , a 2020 third-round pick , and a 2020 sixth-round pick . getting skinner without forfeiting any roster players or any of their three 2019 first-round picks is highway is a very promising prospect , but will likely max out as a third-line wing . his stats in junior hockey have been solid , but not overwhelming , especially given his age . the sabres have been rebuilding for long enough , so it 's easy to see why they would be willing to part with a second-round pick , a third-round pick , and a sixth-round pick . ",
        "especially when the last two are n't even until , why would a rebuilding team want to extend skinner ? first of all , he 's quietly been one of the league 's better scorers . since joining the league in 2012-13 , skinner 's 153 goals rank 17th in the nhl among forwards . even in a down year , he put up 24 goals . by comparison , the sabres leading scorer among left wings scored 20 despite being traded at the trade some point during a rebuild , you have to surround your centers with talented wings . ",
        "skinner will be the best wing star center jack eichel has ever played with in buffalo . likewise , eichel will be , by a wide margin , the best center skinner has played with in recent your voice heard ? join the puck prose team ! trade grade : a + . it 's hard to see this trade ending badly for the sabres , no matter what their logic is in making the trade .
