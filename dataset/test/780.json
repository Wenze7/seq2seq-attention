        "danbury -- police officers made almost 400 complaints against the city 's own 911 dispatch center in the first 18 months after it was outsourced to a private company in early 2015 , new court records show . the complaints illustrate a pattern of behavior that is `` likely beyond a mere accident '' and could have contributed to problems in the dispatch center 's response to the assault of officer joe pooler two years ago , according to the most recent filing in pooler 's ongoing lawsuit against the company . pooler was beaten for about 90 seconds in downtown in july 2016 while dispatchers managed by ixp corp. . ",
        "-- a new jersey firm hired the year before to oversee the dispatch center -- struggled to get the right information to nearby officers . the error re-ignited concerns raised by police union leaders and officers over mayor mark boughton 's decision to outsource dispatch duties traditionally handled by sworn officers and firefighters to civilian ixp staff . the move to privatize the dispatch center was designed by boughton to save the city money and allow leadership to redirect those trained officers and firefighters who had been working dispatch to positions in the field . despite the initial issues , the transition has worked and complaints have dropped off , said boughton , the republican-endorsed candidate for governor . ",
        "he faces a primary challenge aug. . 14 . pooler sued ixp last summer alleging the dispatchers ' errors -- including assigning pooler to respond to his own assault -- caused him to be hurt even more in the incident . the complaint log underscores that the company knew of a number of issues and failed to properly train staff to fix them , according to the newest filing in the lawsuit by pooler 's attorney , pat tomasiewicz . police staff wrote 363 dispatch complaints in ixp 's first five months alone plus another 35 through september 2016 , according to the court memorandum . ",
        "`` a reasonable person could well conclude that failing to resolve the issues surrounding dispatch communication and services in potential emergency situations creates an unreasonable risk of bodily harm to others , '' tomasiewicz wrote . the sheer volume of complaints elevates the issue from negligence to reckless indifference , tomasiewicz argues . ixp chief operating officer larry consalvos disagreed monday , although he would not discuss the lawsuit in detail . he acknowledged there were a series of technical issues after ixp took over the dispatch center and said those either have been corrected or implemented into the company 's policies and procedures specifically for the danbury center . ",
        "but officer bryan reed , the police union president , said officers continue to have problems with the service but `` did n't bother '' reporting them because officers feel they will not be addressed . reed blamed high employee turnover in the dispatch center for ongoing issues . `` as soon as these people become certified , they leave for more lucrative jobs elsewhere , '' reed said . `` but it 's unfair that we have to take the brunt of it and we 're part of their learning process . it puts all the civilians in danbury in jeopardy , plus us going out on these calls . '' ",
        "it is true that there was turnover because ixp promotes from within to its other offices , but he dismissed the accusation that there are remaining problems with the danbury operation , consalvos said . he declined to discuss in detail how the company will respond to the latest lawsuit filing . `` obviously , it 's unfortunate that officer pooler was attacked , '' consalvos said . `` but we 'll probably throughout the ligitation process point out a number of things that may have been done incorrectly . '' ixp was to be paid $ million its first year , which officials estimated would have saved the city $ 1 million in dispatch costs , according to previous reports . ",
        "the city has since expanded its relationship with ixp to include it support and answering the city 's 311 hotline , although neither ixp nor city staff could immediately provide the amount the company is paid each year . `` we have not had a significant amount of issues with ixp , '' boughton said monday . `` there were some initial start-up issues , but now the system runs smoothly and those things have been ironed out . no system is absolutely perfect .
