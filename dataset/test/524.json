        "ranging from product mix in the with mercedes and how close we are to fully autonomous driving with nvidia . but one thing that overlapped in our discussions ? mercedes ' mbux infotainment system . this bad boy is an - powered system like you 've never seen before . it enhances the elevated user experience you get from a company like mercedes that 's powered by a tech-juggernaut like nvidia . this is not a `` puff piece '' - but this work of art is not only incredibly functional , it 's gorgeous . i would n't be surprised to see all high-end infotainment systems migrate in this direction over the next few years . ",
        "all of this is to say that with a leading tech company like nvidia teaming up with `` the best or nothing '' mercedes , the two companies working together on autonomous driving did n't come as a shock to us when the news hit the wires earlier this month . you know when you 're somewhere really nice and you 're afraid to touch/move/do anything ? sort of like that / mepps0qzcv -- bret kenwell january 18 , 2018 self-driving in silicon valley is just the start as it stands , the trio plans to start testing the service in a yet-to-be-determined city near silicon valley . ",
        "given mercedes ' r&d location in sunnyvale and nvidia 's santa clara headquarters , the location of this service is again no surprise . in the bigger picture , bosch , daimler and nvidia are looking at a larger rollout of the service in `` the beginning of the next decade . '' however , just this week daimler announced it will adopt a new corporate structure . shareholders will vote on the restructuring almost a year from now , in may 2019 at the next annual meeting . `` the new structure involves re-assigning more than 700 subsidiaries in over 60 countries . ",
        "with this new structure , we will sharpen our focus , increase entrepreneurial responsibility and protect our synergies and economies of scale , '' said board member and head of finance bodo uebber . however , it 's how the company is restructuring that caught our eye . daimler will break into three groups : mercedes-benz ag , daimler truck ag and daimler mobility ag . that last one - daimler mobility ag - would suggest that daimler management has much larger plans for its mobility and mobility-as-a-service efforts than just launching a few robo-taxi services across the country in a few years . ",
        "assuming shareholders approve , it will be a while before this restructure takes place . but given nvidia 's role with mercedes so far , it looks like the company could be on the receiving end of some big autonomous driving orders next decade . if mercedes makes as big of a push into mobility , autonomous driving and features as it appears it will , nvidia is one great way investors can play it . while it 's hard to tie a timetable or revenue figure to the potential at this point , keep in mind that daimler is no small player in the auto business .
