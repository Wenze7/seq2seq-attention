        "fans were shocked to learn andrew lincoln would be walking away during season 9 of amc 's mega-hit , the walking began circulating last spring that the walking dead star , andrew lincoln , would be exiting the series during season nine . the series star , only one of three actors left from season 1 's core cast , spoke about his plans and how he came to finally walk away from the ahead ! while the walking dead has always juggled staying faithful to the comics versus going in a different direction creatively , rick grimes and his son , carl always seemed `` safe . '' ",
        "characters can come and go , but without rick grimes leading the group , it seemed there would be no show . after the walking dead killed off riggs ' carl , lincoln 's character was once again placed center stage against foe , weekend , at san diego comic-con , lincoln revealed to digital spy that he 'd been mulling over his exit as far back as season four . lincoln approached then-executive producer , scott gimple , about his exit speaking to digital spy , lincoln reflected that his conversation with gimple entailed somehow concluding a story that does n't have a conclusion in sight . ",
        "lincoln explained to digital spy : `` it was a lot to do with a conversation that scott and i had a few years ago , maybe in season four , about a shape , and finding some way to complete something that was never going to be completed . '' lincoln 's exit brings up many questions for walking dead fans : what does this mean for rick ? what does this mean for michonne ? what does this mean for judith ? how will the walking dead conclude the rick and negan feud ? the season nine trailer revealed at san diego comic-con shows a time jump and tension between rick and the first time in walking dead history , the show has begun writing characters off the canvass without killing them off : morgan walked out into the wilderness , while the actor crossed over to the prequel , fear the walking dead . ",
        "will this same strategy be employed when rick grimes leaves ? at the walking dead panel at sdcc , lincoln shared he plans to take some time off from acting before returning to work again ; he currently has no new projects in the works . season 9 of the walking dead debuts on oct. . 7 on amc . seasons 1-7 can be streamed on netflix and season 8 will be added in september .
