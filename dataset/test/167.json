        "napa -- `` i 'd rather have a sack than a pick six any day . `` maybe upon further examination , irvin would take six points over a quarterback takedown , but the point remains : irvin ca n't wait to show why he chose to switch from linebacker to defensive end . he 's already started flashing why in training camp , even if the raiders only have three full-squad practices under their star defensive end khalil mack in attendance while he awaits a new contract , irvin has taken the reigns among the defensive ends as he guns for his first single-season double-digit sack total of his career . ",
        "`` i 'm a seven-year vet , third year here . i feel like the stuff i 'm doing , i 'm supposed to be doing , '' irvin said . `` they got me back at d-end where it 's more natural . less thinking , more reaction . just me running around flying to the ball . `` irvin wasted no time asserting his presence at defensive end on day 1 of training camp friday . he returned an interception for a touchdown against ej manuel , falling backward into the end zone with an airborne crotch grab a la marshawn lynch 's famous celebration in seattle . ",
        "later in the morning , he stripped lynch of the ball during team drills and the defense recovered . irvin then playfully punched lynch after the one thing 's clear , irvin is n't just honing his craft at defensive end . he 's having a heck of a lot of fun with it , too . `` bruce irvin is playing his natural position on an every-down basis , '' raiders head coach jon gruden said . `` i think he 's a heck of a player . `` irvin does n't feel he 's leading the unit any differently than he would if mack was in napa . ",
        "nonetheless , the raiders still have a dominant veteran to follow even without their best player in attendance . `` if khalil was here , we 'd be leading the same way , '' irvin said . `` we ca n't worry about who is n't here . khalil gets tired , so when khalil goes out of the game , the guys here have to go in the game and play while he 's tired . he rarely gets tired , but when he does those guys have to be ready . we 're trying to focus on getting these young guys ready . ",
        "those things will take care of themselves . `` he 's working . i talk to him every day , '' irvin said of mack . `` he misses it , but you know how it is . he 's working his butt off and when he gets here , he 'll be ready . `` in the meantime , tank carradine has filled in for mack opposite irvin on the defensive line . we know who the starting defensive ends on the full-strength raiders will be , though , and irvin 's early showing at defensive end makes his eventual pairing with the plenty proven mack that much more enticing . ",
        "`` he 's had a tremendous camp so far , '' defensive coordinator paul guenther said . '' ... he 's been a tremendous leader for us . i 'm glad to have him on my side . `` i just think his best gift is going forward . that 's what he should be doing each and every down . so instead of playing linebacker , dropping off in coverage , we have to utilize , really his and everybody else 's talents , to the best we can . `` irvin has publicly expressed his goal to reach at least 10 sacks in 2018 . ",
        "his previous single-season totals : eight , two , six and a half , five and a half , seven and eight . the raiders were among the worst in the nfl taking down the quarterback last year , and a breakout season from irvin in that department would do that much more to free up mack on the other it 's up to mack 's camp and the raiders to get no . 52 in town , and irvin to keep showing why he and the raiders made the right call switching his position . if both happen , then the raiders might just have something at defensive end the rest of the league should be scared of .
