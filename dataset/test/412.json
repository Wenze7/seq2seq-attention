        "napa -- miller will be thrust into the spotlight , at least to begin camp , with donald penn on the physically unable to perform list . the 35-year-old incumbent starter at left tackle is still recovering from december foot surgery . enter the rookie first-rounder who the raiders took 15th overall . he posed a threat to penn 's job from the get-go , but now he really has a chance to strut his stuff as the primary protector on derek carr 's blind side with his mentor sidelined . `` kolton is awesome , '' carr said . ",
        "`` he 's really tall ... very athletic . can move , can run . he 's strong . you can tell that he put in a lot of work in the weight room before he came back . that 's for any college kid , i do n't care how strong you are , you can always get stronger . he put in all that work during that break . `` he came back and he 's strong , ready to take those bull rushes . as a tall guy , you know that 's coming . you know the bull rush is coming . ",
        "but he 's ready . he looks really good . `` miller saw first-team reps at left tackle friday during the raiders ' first full-squad training camp practice . often , he opposed bruce irvin , now playing defensive end . irvin made it his mission this season to finally reach double-digit sack totals for the first time in his career . he 's unleashing that desire on the quiet rookie just getting his feet wet in a nfl training camp . `` he 's blocking a beast over there , '' raiders ' head coach jon gruden said . ",
        "`` bruce irvin is one of our captains right now and he 's gon na test miller every day . `` i think it can only help me , '' miller said . `` he has a lot of tools that he uses , a lot of moves , which means you have to really hone on your craft . he wants you to mess up . that 's something that you have to focus on and make sure you do n't because then it can get you . `` miller and his fellow rookies , along with a few non-rookies , have been in napa since monday . ",
        "until the remaining veterans arrived thursday , miller , brandon parker , second-year guard cameron hunt and second-year guard jordan simmons were the only offensive linemen around . miller got reps calling out protections with limited numbers , which he says helped him for friday 's debut doing so with the full team on the , who admitted friday he 's not much of a talker , even saw a different side of himself emerge during day 1 . `` i feel a lot more comfortable making calls , '' he said . `` i think today i was pretty vocal out there . ",
        "`` despite the possibility of losing his job to someone more than a decade younger , penn has mentored miller as he prepares for what could be a prominent role on oakland 's offensive line . `` especially donald penn , that happened a lot in the spring , '' miller said of which veterans he 's turned to for advice . `` i 'd be in the back and he 'd tell me , ` you can be doing this and sitting back . ' he has a lot of tips for me , especially him being as experienced as he is . ",
        "`` penn worked to the side with trainers on friday , and his recovery from lisfranc surgery does n't seem like it 'll sideline him too much longer . `` i think he 's getting close . i talk to him every day , '' gruden said . `` he 's working independently with trainers right now but he 's getting close . he still has to prove that he can change directions explosively and wake up the next day and do it again and again . `` until then , it 's miller 's time to shine . penn could very well return in short order and snag his starting spot back . ",
        "but with the veteran out , now is as good a time as any for miller to show why he belongs . `` i feel really pleased with kolton , not only from an athletic standpoint but from a mental standpoint , '' gruden said . '' cable is on him every day . he 's learning how to play with derek carr , who 's doing a lot at the line of scrimmage . he 's showing a lot of poise and obviously he 's very talented . `` he 's just a pup getting started .
