        "denver -- in one corner -- rockies third baseman nolan arenado . five-time gold glove winner over six big league seasons . in the other corner -- a 's third baseman matt chapman , who in his first full big league season is already drawing comparisons to arenado as he leads virtually all defensive categories at third base this it goes deeper for these two , all the way back to high chapman and arenado were dropping jaws at major league stadiums around the country , the two were teammates at el toro high in lake forest , california . ",
        "chapman , two years younger than arenado , spent most of his time as the elder 's back up until arenado graduated following the 2009 season . both were shortstops at the time , with matt sitting back , observing , waiting for his might have the most impressive physique on the a 's these days to go along with his hustle . arenado remembers the hustle from their teen years , but not the body . `` he was a good player who worked hard . he was a little guy , was n't very big , '' arenado said of chapman . ",
        "`` he 's really big now . he 's probably way better than me now . `` chapman might not have the resume , but the numbers say he 's better this year . chapman is ahead of arenado , and every other player in baseball for that matter in defensive runs saved with has no idea what all these new analytical defensive stats mean , but he 's watched chapman put in work at third whenever he can this season . the eye test tells him all he needs to know . `` i do n't know how that stuff works . ",
        "i know he 's saving a bunch of runs and having a great year . i do n't think i have any , so i do n't know how that works anymore , '' arenado said . `` i feel like i 've saved some runs . i just know i 'm playing a good third base and he 's playing a really good third base . i think he 's beating me by a lot in those things . `` though the numbers might say chapman is better , the young a 's star scoffed at the notion that he might be a better overall defender than arenado , who he looked up to since their days in the same little league down in southern california . ",
        "`` i definitely credit a lot of things that i do to what he does , '' chapman said . `` i kind of followed his lead . tried to throw the ball as hard as him and catch it like him . i got ta give credit where credit is due . `` one quick search of their highlight reels on youtube will show you that there 's a lot of similarities in their styles of play . that 's not be by those days backing up arenado as a sophomore , chapman used the five-time gold glover 's as a model for his style , which he later molded into his own as he went on to college at cal state fullerton . ",
        "`` he might do a little bit more of a jump throw on the back end and i 'll do a little bit more of a fadeaway throw , '' chapman said . `` he 's a little bit bigger guy , i might be a little lighter on my feet . `` friday night 's game will mark the first time the two slick defenders have shared a field in the majors , and they 'd be lying if they told you they wo n't taking a peak at how each other performs and trying to out-do each other this weekend . ",
        "`` i hope he does n't rob me of a hit , `` arenado said . `` but i hope i rob him . '' "
