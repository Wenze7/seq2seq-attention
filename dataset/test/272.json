        "the authority that oversees the region 's transit agencies is trying a new approach in its effort to sound the alarm for more government funding for new trains , buses , stations and other transit regional transit authority has produced a $ 35,000 , five-minute video , with toy wooden trains and a little comedy , to ask for the billions of dollars needed to get the transit system in a state of good video , which can be seen here , was first aired tuesday at a discussion on the region 's transit future at the metropolitan planning council , a policy research goal of the video is to make the case in an accessible , easy-to-understand way that the cta , metra and pace need a sustainable source of funding , or they are going to continue to fall apart , which will hurt the region 's economy , rta officials said .",
        "the state has been without a capital plan to pay for major infrastructure improvements since 2009 . the authority has tried making its case in springfield , at community forums and in multipage , detailed executive director leanne redden acknowledged that the average person is not going to wade through the rta 's five-year regional plan , `` so it 's good to have something that 's a little more palatable across the region . '' redden , who spoke at the forum , said the video `` succinctly makes the case . `` the video , which shows riders talking about how much they depend on trains and buses to get to work , and uses visual jokes like a shiny new toy bus being opened up like a christmas present , was made by rta spokeswoman susan massel and former chicago newscaster mary ann childers . ",
        "`` we are hoping to reach riders and nonriders with this video , '' said massel . `` we ca n't just assume our system is going to be here without making these critical investments . we have to make transit a priority . `` the video is being shared on the rta 's web site and on social media networks , including rta says that $ 30 billion of priority transit projects are not fully funded in the region , including cta projects like new buses , trains and rail-line improvements , new metra locomotives , bridges and track , and new pace buses and facilities . ",
        "the authority said that capital investment for transit should increase by $ 2 billion to $ 3 billion annually . "
