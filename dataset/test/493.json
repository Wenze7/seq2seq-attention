        "baltimore , md -- july 09 : jonathan schoop # 6 of the baltimore orioles takes a swing during game two of a doubleheader baseball game against the new york yankees at oriole park at camden yards on july 9 , 2018 in baltimore , maryland . the yankees won 10-2 . as the baltimore orioles plummet to the bottom of the league standings and toward the # 1 overall pick in 2019 , should they make even bigger moves in their tear-down ? the baltimore orioles are neck-and-neck with the kansas city royals for the honorary distinction of being the worst team in the mlb . ",
        "each team is subtracting major pieces from their club , as they make a late-season push to outdo the baseball , there is only one winner and 29 losers . with that said , there is also only one team who finishes last in the standings and gets the first overall draft pick in 2019 . orioles or royals ? do n't count out the chicago white sox just yet to fangraphs projected standings , though , the orioles are the team who will likely finish at that bottom of the barrel . after all , they do have the worst record in the majors as of this writing . ",
        "they have already cashed in on a half year of manny machado and zach britton in an attempt to replenish a desolate farm system which is devoid of international signees . to the o 's credit , it appears they got a fair package for machado . they also somehow managed to attain one of the yankees top-ten prospects for zach britton , who has not really been all that good since 2016 .
