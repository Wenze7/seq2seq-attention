        "former 49ers great dwight clark was eulogized by many in a private memorial service in san francisco on wednesday , including ex-49ers owner eddie 's what debartolo had to say at grace cathedral about clark , who passed away at age 61 in june from complications from als : good morning , was honored that near the end of his life , dwight asked me to speak i have to admit , at a time like this , it 's hard to find the right words . so i decided to begin with dwight 's own words : `` it was just a great life . '' ",
        ". . . . . . . . and you know , it really , really 's why we 're here today , to celebrate the life of dwight clark even as we mourn his course , no one has been defined by a singular moment more than is forever remembered for `` the catch . '' . . . you may have heard about the nfc championship game against the cowboys , joe montana threw the pass so high that it looked like he was throwing the ball away . but he knew dwight , at 6-foot-4 , would find a way and he leaped so high in the sky to make the game-winning play that began our 49ers was asked about it many times and always said what a perfect pass it he would tell that story , joe would always say , ` well , then , maybe it should be called ` the throw . ' '' ",
        "and flashing his trademark smile , dwight would say , ` joe , at least give me my one play . ' `` it 's one of the most iconic moments in nfl what i think all of us here today should do is remember the many , many special moments that dwight shared with us all during his i first met dwight after bill walsh selected him in the 10th round from clemson , he had this southern accent and he was so incredibly good looking with a big smile and infectious laugh . i knew we would instantly be 1979 , i was only 32 years old when dwight and joe came to the 49ers . ",
        "they were like my little brothers . i told them to call me eddie , but dwight always insisted on calling me ` boss . ` they would meet me at the airport when i would fly in from youngstown and we would go to the team hotel , sneak down to the bar with freddie solomon and have a couple of , i had the idea to try and personally negotiate their contracts without using their agents , so i invited them to my home in youngstown . my friend carmen policy , who was our general counsel and team president , did n't like the idea but he went along with it . ",
        "carmen left around 11 that night . dwight , joe and i shot pool and drank tequila -- probably way more than we should have . . . . well . . . i got the deals carmen saw us at breakfast , sort of beaten up from the night before , he learned i had paid joe a million dollars and dwight $ 500,000 carmen 's jaw dropped when he saw dwight drive off to carolina in my brand new silver looked at me in shock and asked , `` what the hell happened ? `` all i could say was `` they won . ",
        "`` i have pictures at our ranch in montana of those two . joe signed it `` thanks a million . '' dwight wrote , `` thanks a half a million . `` that was dwight , or as so many of his friends and teammates called had a nickname for everyone . jerry rice was `` world , '' because he had never seen anyone with his skill set in the world . freddie solomon was `` casper '' . and ronnie lott was always `` bo bo . `` ronnie joined our team in 1980 . he did n't say a lot as a rookie .

        "he and dwight would become extremely we won the super bowl in detroit , dwight gave ronnie one of his great big bear hugs he was known for and said , `` what 's up bo bo ? `` it was after that , ronnie said he realized there are some people who love you unconditionally . that 's how dwight loved a lot of words have been used to describe dwight . a southern gentleman . selfless . handsome . humble . caring . courageous . loving . funny . the one i think that describes him best is loyal . ",
        "dwight clark was you met him once , you felt you had known him your whole life . you never forgot that wife candy and our entire family adored dwight . my youngest daughter nikki fell for him instantly . he was her first boy crush . lisa 's office was next door to dwight 's when he was general manager , and she ran the 49ers foundation . lisa would pop into his office every day to ask a million questions about football , and dwight was so patient and gracious with would play space invaders and pac-man with him at the team hotel on saturday nights . ",
        "when uc berkeley played clemson in a bowl game , they had a bet and the loser had to shave their head if their team lost . thank god , clemson lost . tiffanie was n't going to make him shave his head , but dwight did it anyway . . . because that 's who he about moments . who can forget him wearing the coyote coat to our super bowl parade ? he was our joe namath , without the pantyhose . but he never lived down the adidas poster with the short red pants and tank actually liked playing the bad guy .

        "he loved vigilante movies and he watched a lot of them with his friend rick winters . dwight was our clint eastwood . there was a safety in atlanta , scott case , and dwight would rather hit him all day long than catch a did everything well . he was a great basketball player in high school . i think he could 've been a professional singer . i do n't know if he was as good as huey lewis , but he could 've given the news a run for their money . he was always the one who brought the cds of the latest music on the team had every gift but enough years on this earth .
