        "the baltimore ravens defense was pretty good in 2018 , but there were some key breakdowns along the way . here are five reasons the ravens defense will be better in 2018:5 . a deeper secondary : the jimmy smith injury has shattered the baltimore ravens ability to play defense against top-tier teams . it seems to happen almost every season . smith is considered an elite cornerback when he is on the field , and when is the keyword there . the ravens walk into 2018 with smith being an important member of the defense . when he 's available , the opponent 's best receiver is going to get slowed down dramatically . ",
        "the ravens have a deeper overall secondary addition to a lot of quality players at their disposal the ravens have star power at the cornerback position . marlon humphrey emerged as one of the league 's most talented cornerbacks and in 2018 he has a chance to play at an elite level . brandon carr , tavon young , maurice cannady , and anthony averett make a good core group at the position . the backup plan for the ravens is simple . humphrey becomes the number one cornerback , while the rest of the gang vies for a chance at the number two spot . ",

",
        "tony jefferson is a strong safety who is an extension of the linebacker group , eric weddle is n't afraid to lay down a hit . humphrey and smith are physical players . the secondary is the strength of the team coming into the season . it will be even better than it was last year , and baltimore led the league in interceptions , with 22 .
