        "it may not be the premiere date thrones fans have been craving , but at least it 's confirmation that the wait for closure wo n't be that 's a tease of epic proportions , game of thrones president casey bloys was on hand at tca to discuss what 's happening at the cable network in 2018 and beyond . while he would n't say much about thrones , the information he did drop is tantalizing enough to tide fans other for the time being . `` i 'm not going to say what to expect , through it 's pretty great , '' he said , according to deadline . ",
        "cool . thanks for he was n't done ! though he would n't divulge a concrete premiere date , he was able to offer something of value : season 8 will premiere `` sometime in 2019 ... first half . '' so there you have it , thrones fans . you will finally learn who lives , who dies and who tells their story sometime between january and june 2019 . it 's not worth speculating further about specific dates , though the smart money is on it showing up some time in the spring like it used to before its production became more daunting and also discussed the potential game of thrones spinoffs , specifically the confirmed one that is currently being written by jane goldman and george r. r. martin himself . ",
        "according to the same deadline report , bloys shot down rumors that the show would start production in october , but said that of the proposed prequels , `` that was the one we 're excited about . '' apparently the other four prequel concepts are , according to bloys , either not happening or being considered further , though he would n't specify which ones fit into each 's worry about why tyrion was lingering outside dany 's quarters before we start worrying about any other thrones-related television content .
