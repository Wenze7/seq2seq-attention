        "from the moment donald trump was sworn into office , about 40 percent of americans have stood steadfastly by the president 's would say that 's patriotism . others might call it of what drives their loyalty , trump can count on this group of americans to have his back no matter the rest of us denounced trump 's inhumane policy of separating refugee children from their parents , that 40 percent praised his determination to do whatever is necessary to protect our borders . `` i voted for the man because of his stance on immigration , '' one trump supporter wrote me . ",
        "`` i want that wall built , and it does n't bother me about the separation of children from their parents . we 've been too soft on immigrants . we have to let them know that we mean business . open borders will destroy our country . `` when trump publicly sided with vladimir putin at the helsinki summit and rejected the findings of intelligence agencies on russia 's election meddling , some of us thought he teetered toward treason . but that 40 percent turned on their tv sets and saw the president being strong yet diplomatic . ",
        "they easily accepted trump 's explanation that he intended to say `` would n't '' when he said , `` i do n't see any reason why it would be . `` one supporter dismissed it this way : `` of course knows they meddled , because our own cia does the exact same thing . all . the . time . but what we do n't do is talk about it . `` though the number might occasionally rise or fall by a few points , trump 's 40 percent approval rating is , for the most part , impenetrable . ",
        "and while he has never been able to get the majority of the country on his side , his base is determined and vocal enough to keep establishment republicans trembling with are these people who see america and the rest of the world so drastically different from the rest of us ? do they truly believe that trump is an economic and social policy genius who knows how to make america great ? or are they misguided misfits so afraid of the future that they are clinging desperately to the past ? those who have spent time studying these folks say they are all of the above . ",
        "perhaps that 's true , but underneath their tough exterior , i believe many of them are driven by something much more basic -- will admit that i have no scientific and , some would argue , accurate information on which to base my opinion . what i do have , though , are emails -- dozens of them a day from trump supporters across the country who happen to stumble upon my you are familiar with my writings , it goes without saying that trump supporters despise me . they think that i am , above all , racist but also biased , hate-filled and stupid -- just to use a few of their this is n't about me . ",
        "it 's about my interpretation of see politics under trump as a war between `` us '' and `` them , '' a crusade against liberals who think they are smarter than everyone else and look down on anyone who disagrees with their self-imposed ideals of it , liberals , we do get an attitude the minute a trump supporter opens his or her mouth . we come out , fists for trump 's people , this is custer 's last stand , and he is their ferocious leader . they are determined not to go down without a good fight . ",
        "`` i will stand by president trump . he is this country 's last hope , '' one reader emailed , explaining that trump stands up for american-born citizens over others . `` he is really the only one to take on the problem of illegal immigration , the unfair trade polices , the unfair way we fund nato . he is for me -- an american . `` some trump supporters think our country is no longer fair to white people . they cringe when african-americans with a career , a good education and a comfortable lifestyle complain about white privilege . ",
        "while some might think they deserve the best simply because they are white , others see themselves being trampled on by minorities and immigrants who use government handouts to get ahead much this email , for example . `` you and people like you is what 's wrong with this country . i am a white male that came from nothingness . i educated myself , no one gave me a handout ; never really had anything until i worked for it . i am an american . not a mexican-american . not african-american . `` they are as obsessed with barack obama and hillary clinton as trump is . ",
        "the president has convinced them that `` sour grapes '' is the main reason most people do n't support him . `` you 're a liberal democrat that still thinks hillary ` benghazi ' clinton should have been elected in 2016 , '' one man wrote . `` i give thanks every day that she lost for the second time . she should be in prison garb . `` and like trump , they deplore the `` liberal '' media . `` you and your ilk started beating on president trump the first day after the election because we were correct and you lost . ",
        "obama should have been voted out in 2012 . he was worthless . in closing , i can not wait to vote republican in 2018 and 2020 . `` here are a few other tidbits . the woman they hate as much as clinton is rep. maxine waters , a california democrat . they see her as the face of the democratic some agree with trump that black men mooch off society , they make exceptions for housing and urban development secretary ben carson and rapper kanye west . invoking their names proves they are not , in particular , love first lady melania trump . ",
        "in their eyes , she 's a helpless belle , and they 'll go to any lengths to protect her honor . `` you are a jealous a -- and a fat , ugly one to boot , '' one man emailed kinds of crude remarks should n't concern us . but we should take notice when they say things like what this woman emailed : `` people who voted for trump will never stop believing in his strength , intelligence and goodness . trump 2020 ! `` believe me , they mean it .
