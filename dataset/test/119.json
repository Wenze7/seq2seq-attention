        "apple 's long , litigious and messy fight with qualcomm may have reached its climax on wednesday , as qualcomm 's chief financial officer announced during an earnings call that apple will no longer use its modems for future apple-qualcomm fight centered on apple 's displeasure at forking over as much as $ 30 in royalties to qualcomm for every iphone sold . apple soon began working with intel to develop new modems -- some of which were used in iphone 7 -- starting in 2015 . in january last year , apple sued qualcomm , alleging the royalties amounted to extortion , and stopped paying the year and a half later , qualcomm seemed to have given up on apple . ",
        "`` we believe apple intends to solely use our competitor 's modems rather than our modems in its next iphone release , '' said davis , according to qualcomm executive said during the earnings call , `` if the opportunity presents itself , '' qualcomm will become apple 's supplier once again , according to 's break from qualcomm , however , may mean slower iphones compared to its android counterparts , as phones using qualcomm chips outperformed phones using its competitors , according to a recent study . apple will be switching its iphone 4g modems from qualcomm to intel , according to a study published this week by ookla , a seattle-based internet testing and analysis company , android phones powered by qualcomm 's latest snapdragon 845 ran significantly faster than non-android phones powered by intel 's xmm 7480 and 7360 chips on various cellular carriers . ",
        "the study ran more than 1 million internet speed tests to reduce possible bias , according to at&t and t-mobile phones , android phones with qualcomm chips downloaded data at least 60 percent faster and uploaded data at least 20 percent faster than its non-android said in a press release ookla 's test proved that `` real-world data supports qualcomm technologies ' claims of superior wireless performance . `` in a countersuit by qualcomm against apple in april last year , qualcomm alleged that apple throttled data speeds in iphone 7 models with qualcomm chips to match the slower iphones with intel alleged apple `` chose not to utilize certain high-performance features of the qualcomm chipsets for the iphone 7 '' and that apple `` falsely claimed that there was ` no discernible difference ' between iphones with qualcomm 's chipsets and iphones with intel 's chipsets '' even when the qualcomm-powered iphones nonetheless outperformed the intel-powered counterparts .
