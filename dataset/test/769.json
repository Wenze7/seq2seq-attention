        "the troubles with chicago policing date back at least to the days of al capone , who had a multitude of cops on the take . ancient history ? sure , the fedora 's gone out of style , but never incidents of corruption and misuse of force within the chicago police department . since 1960 , as we recently noted , city hall tried six times through a task force or commission to reform the cpd so it would deliver what the citizens of chicago deserve : a police force they trust to serve and protect . each attempt fell short . ",
        "since 2004 , city hall has paid more than $ 700 million to settle police misconduct friday , though , mayor rahm emanuel and illinois attorney general lisa madigan unveiled a draft version of a consent decree -- the framework for federal oversight of a reform process of cpd . why should a cynical city think this would make a difference ? because of that phrase `` federal oversight . '' the decree would set standards , and the city would n't be freed from the decree until a federal judge is convinced it has met the standards . think of the so-called shakman decree that has sought to reduce political favoritism in governance a consent decree relies on the agreement of several parties , something the issuance of a draft does n't signify . ",
        "so while this is a historic moment for policing in chicago , there 's not yet a deal to celebrate . do n't be surprised if the fraternal order of police tries to torpedo any agreement . and emanuel has been walking a tightrope , seeking to support police fighting crime while also fighting police 's the time for the public to absorb this lengthy document and weigh in . so can the fop , which mounted a late-inning attempt to intervene in the negotiations . we 'll go first , to the limited extent we can at this early stage : getting from draft to signed and court-monitored decree will be a heavy lift , but it 's necessary if chicago is to break long cycles of misconduct by elements within cpd . ",
        "we 're grateful to the people who 've brought the effort this far -- emanuel and those who forced him to the table , including madigan , the american civil liberties union and community voices demanding 232-page document lays out the expectations for a police force that would function efficiently and honorably for all residents , in all neighborhoods . remember , the impetus for the consent decree was the death of african-american teen laquan mcdonald , shot 16 times by a white officer . it took 14 months for the public to see a video of the incident . ",
        "many citizens say it depicts police officers operating inappropriately . a subsequent department of justice investigation faulted the police department for poor training , lax oversight and a culture that often tolerated consent decree draft won praise friday from several outside experts involved in the negotiations . they said it sets the right agenda to fix policies , training , supervision and accountability . great , but nice words , we imagine , were also said about previous efforts . this is the seventh try . the difference-maker this time would be the involvement of a federal judge who , along with a monitor , would ride herd on the other words , the problem with cpd wo n't be fixed because emanuel says it 's fixed or madigan says it 's fixed or the fop says it never was broken . ",
        "the chicago custom of addressing a problem by passing a couple of ordinances , and issuing a flurry of news releases , wo n't solve chicago a consent decree , the problem would be fixed when the judge is satisfied -- maybe 10 or more years from now . "
