        "one stock that has had just a miserable summer season so far is tesla . the reasons are multiple . pressures on the name have been felt due to the regularly erratic behavior of the ceo , to the recent headlines covering rising costs to insure oneself against a default of the firm 's debt . that came on the heels of news that the firm had asked several suppliers to refund some cash to assist with profitability . what i do know about this firm is that it has always been a cash-burn story . at times , production levels improve to the point where profitability can reasonably be spoken of . ",
        "nomura , just last week , came out to defend the firm . analyst romit shah wrote on that point : `` if tesla can execute to plan , we believe that the narrative around bankruptcy risk will go away , thereby reducing short interest and driving the stock higher . '' nomura has tsla rated as a `` buy '' with a $ 450 price target . from my neck of the woods , i only know that ceo elon musk is indeed the money man . musk seems to be able to raise dough whenever dough is needed . ",
        "as an investor/trader who usually values fundamental analysis as much as , if not more than , technical analysis , i can honestly tell you that i have lost money most of the times that i have shorted tsla over the years , and that i have made very nice gains both of the times that i have reluctantly played this name from the long side . the last one was just an experiment , because i could not get the borrow ahead of first-quarter earnings . tsla expectations tesla reports on wednesday , and the first expectation would , in my opinion , be that the ceo will not lash out at any analysts asking questions that investors want answered as the earnings call commences . ",
        "consensus view for second-quarter eps is $ - the range of expectations made public by 21 analysts spans from a low of $ - to a high of $ - whispers are in the neighborhood of $ - , and q2 2017 printed at $ - as for revenue , the average estimate seems to be around $ billion . that would be up from $ billion for q2 2017 , and good enough for year-on-year growth of % . to be fair to tsla , the firm has beaten expectations for revenue in seven consecutive quarters , and that number has increased sequentially in each of the the last six . ",
        "i see these cars every day now . they 're around . to tell you the truth , i just do n't know what counts for more on this chart , the obvious fibonacci support level that came into play last week , or the declining top-and-bottom trend lines that require the observer to completely omit wild market reactions that appear to be caused by keyword-seeking algorithmic overreaction . fundamentally , the name is a mess . it always has been . free cash flows remain badly negative , current and quick ratios scream out for help at levels that usually prevent me from even considering investment . ",
        "almost one third of the entire float is still held in short positions ... and that 's just it . no matter how ugly this name is , there is still one aggregate clocked buy ticket out there for something like million shares . hard to ignore . ideas on how to play from an equity perspective , i will likely make my mind up in the final 15 seconds of this wednesday 's trading session . we all know that the name can swing , so if i do initiate an equity position , it will be small in size . ",
        "more for the thrill of having skin in the game than for anything else . currently a august 3rd straddle will cost you $ , meaning that for a trader invested in that idea , the last sale would have to move either above $ or below $ just to do more than break even . is the risk/reward there for such activity . i 'm not sure it is . i do not think that my usual options writing strategies that i use to raise revenue apply here at all . i use those strategies as much for the raising of revenue as i do for portfolio building . ",
        "i do not want tsla in my portfolio for anything other than speculation . this name could very well run wild in either direction , causing much pain and the gnashing of teeth . i 'll probably go out a few months and buy a deeply out of the money put for some lunch money . seems silly ? that 's where the risk/reward actually makes sense for a trader on a retail budget . october $ 120 puts went out at $ on friday . october $ 470 calls went out at $ speaking for myself , that 's all i 'm willing to risk on tesla .
