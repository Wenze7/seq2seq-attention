        "oklahoma football coach lincoln riley just made things a little uncomfortable for the oakland a ' indicated friday that two-sport star kyler murray , the presumed starting quarterback for his fifth-ranked team , could play for the sooners ' football team the next two seasons . this would qualify as some unexpected news to the a ' , after all , signed murray to a reported $ million deal in june with the understanding he 'd play just one more season for the sooners before becoming a full-time baseball player . `` we 'll see if it 's his final year , '' riley told reporters friday at oklahoma 's third practice of the season . ",
        "`` that had n't been determined yet . i am not worried about if its is or if it is n't . that 's going to have no impact on this year . `` neither the a 's nor murray 's camp revealed what the contract 's language says about his commitment to , who was considered the top athlete in the mlb draft , was still considered a bit of a reach by many observers when the a 's took him with the ninth overall pick . while some compared murray 's baseball skills to those of a young rickey henderson , many teams feared murray would ultimately choose beane and the a 's had no such qualms , especially after learning murray hired scott boras as his agent . ",
        "`` the fact that scott was involved gave us a sense of confidence before the draft , '' beane said at the press conference to announce murray 's signing . `` scott represents baseball players . things moved very quickly , and it was n't very complicated at all . `` boras even praised the a 's for allowing murray to play one more year of football while taking over for heisman trophy winner baker mayfield . `` they understand the need for a player to check a box and do something he 's committed to so he can come to our game with a very full and complete understanding of his goals in his life , '' boras riley 's surprising comments friday indicate perhaps murray wo n't be so eager to leave the football field . ",
        "`` i 've stayed out of the negotiation stuff with the a 's , '' riley told reporters . `` that 's not my business , it 's his business . my hope through this whole thing is that kyler is gon na be able to do what he wants to do . and if he wants to go play baseball after this year , then we 'll wish him well and be happy for him . `` but the ball is gon na be in his court , which it should be .
