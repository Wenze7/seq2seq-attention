        "back in 1997 , i watched a guy named rick stone appear in a black ensemble theater tribute to otis redding . a few weeks later , i went back to see another show there . stone was taking my ticket . i went back again ; stone was a time , he was the theater 's in 2003 , he got his own star vehicle : `` howlin ' at the moon , '' a jackie taylor tribute to the blues great howlin ' wolf , known for numbers like `` wang dang doodle '' and `` howlin ' for my darling . '' ",
        "stone 's voice was smoother and silkier than wolf 's own instrument , but he had an innate understanding of a great bluesman always known for his `` country '' sensibility , and who often was mocked by his peers in big-city few weeks after that , i went back to another show . stone was ushering lay all that out to say that taylor 's `` rick stone the blues man , '' the loosey-goosey summer attraction at black ensemble , is a tribute to a man with a long history at this particular theater . stone has not grown any shorter with the passing years , and his famously gangly frame has not lost any of its ability to shimmy , duck , weave or otherwise move uniquely through time and space . ",
        "nor has he lost his humility . nor his voice , except that his instrument now is closer to that of howlin ' wolf . `` rick stone the blues man '' imagines that stone owns a blues club and has invited some of his closest friends , who also happen to be this theater 's most-trusted regulars , including dwight neal , theo huff , rhonda preston , cynthia carter , kelvin davis and lamont `` harmonica man '' harris . we , the audience , are at the club . there is a little light narrative tension -- one of the performers is carrying on with a younger woman in the back , another is dealing with post-vietnam stress . ",
        "but it 's mostly just artists singing blues standards under the stellar musical direction of robert 's pretty much it . if you prefer reserved comfy seats to a crowded club , and if you 've got out-of-towners here this summer who want a taste of the old-school chicago blues , roll on down to ricky 's place . you will be made most welcome . at one point , you 'll be asked to talk to all the people around you . i had a good time with that . nice , nice people 2 really gets free-form , which might explain the lengthy running time . ",
        "at one point , it seemed to be closing time for ricky 's place , but then everything opened up again . you do n't entirely get the trajectory of the night . and , frankly , the semi-fictional personas in the piece did n't interest me anywhere near as much as the life stories of the actual performers . i just wanted to hear about grew up with taylor in cabrini-green ; the two were hardly the only significant artists who grew up in that housing is stone 's place , and thus he feels free to play himself . ",
        "`` is cabrini-green in the house ? '' he asked saturday afternoon , after describing his friendship , some 40 years ago , with taylor 's brother , was . and glad to be with him . as were we all . "
