        "all-pro left guard kelechi osemele has spent most of two seasons with the raiders playing alongside a grizzled left tackle in donald penn who 's entering his 13th nfl season . so far this camp , osemele has lined up next to a player preparing for his first in first-round draft pick kolton miller . osemele , in turn , is still learning miller , but said after the team 's second full practice saturday his early impressions of the 6-foot-8 rookie have been favorable . `` kolton looks real good right now , '' osemele said . `` we 've still got a lot of work to do . ",
        "it 's our first time working together , so just knocking the rust off on double-teams and stuff like that , making sure we 're going the right way , the little things rookies go through . `` but physically , his development , his understanding of our play-calling , the game , our scheme : he 's way ahead of where i would 've been at this point in training camp my rookie year . '' miller , the no . 15 overall pick in april 's draft , is working with the first-team offense as penn works his way back from foot surgery . ",
        "it 's a notable situation given miller also represents a potential successor to penn , who is 35 and has two seasons left on his contract . the raiders have an open job at right tackle as well but had miller work on the left side for all of spring practices . penn has indicated he does not intend to hand the job to miller , tweeting the word `` motivation '' on draft night and reportedly making a piqued phone call to jon gruden . yet penn has also appeared to take a role in miller 's development while sidelined . ",
        "while the offensive line ran position drills at saturday 's practice at napa 's memorial stadium , penn stood nearby watching and spoke to miller a few times between reps. asked which teammates he has leaned on for advice , miller named right guard gabe jackson and penn. . `` especially donald penn - that happened a lot in the spring , '' miller said . `` i 'd be in the back and he 'd be telling me , ` you can be doing this and sitting back . ' he has a lot of tips for me , especially him being as experienced as he is . '' ",
        "miller played just one full season at left tackle at ucla , but the raiders were attracted to him in the draft by what gruden termed his `` huge upside '' and his mix of athleticism and size . osemele said that given that frame , miller 's ability to move `` takes you by surprise . '' `` he 's real athletic , man , '' osemele said . `` i do n't think it 's ever going to be a case of him getting beat somebody just running around him or anything like that . with a guy like that , it 's going to be him working on his anchor , just being in the weight room and getting stronger and stuff . '' ",
        "miller said he did put on weight this summer , though he declined to say how much because `` it varies . '' others including quarterback derek carr noticed a difference . `` you can tell that he put in a lot of work in the weight room before he came back , '' carr said . `` he came back and he 's strong , ready to take those bull-rushes . as a tall guy you know that 's coming , you know the bull-rush is coming . but he 's ready . he looks really good . '' ",
        "in april , gruden said one reason the raiders had drafted two offensive tackles was the glut of talented pass rushers they face in the afc west . the raiders themselves moved bruce irvin to more of a defensive end role this summer to enhance their own pass rush , and while working with the first team , miller figures to see plenty of irvin coming off the edge in practice . `` he 's blocking a beast over there , '' gruden said . `` bruce irvin is one of our captains right now and he 's going to test miller every day . '' ",
        "miller said he 'd welcome the challenge - especially after the team dons pads for the first time sunday . `` i think it can only help me , '' miller said . `` has a lot of tools that he uses , a lot of moves , which means you have to really hone your craft . he wants you to mess up . so that 's something you have to focus on and make sure you do n't do , because then he can get you . '' miller said he benefited from practicing with other rookies last week before veterans reported to camp . ",
        "he 's admittedly `` not a real talkative guy '' but said he felt more comfortable making calls and was `` pretty vocal out there '' friday . it 's part of the learning curve of a player for whom the raiders have high hopes . `` as far as the framework of being an elite left tackle , he has the tools there , '' osemele said . `` i think it 's really up to us to get him where he needs to be .
