        "colonization of the moon has been a long-time dream of science-fiction writers but , if it ever actually happens , we may turn out to not be the first life-forms to live there . at least , that is the theory laid out by researchers from washington state university and the united kingdom 's university of london . in a recently published paper , they make the case that , at some point in history , the moon 's atmospheric conditions were such that it could have been possible for life to , well , live . `` based on water being present in lunar rocks and magma , including the likely presence of a magnetic field , we at the picture of an early moon -- billion years ago -- which was a temporarily habitable planetary body with a significant atmosphere and liquid pools of water on its surface , '' dirk schulze-makuch , an astrobiologist at washington state , told digital are two periods during the moon 's formation in which these lunar conditions would have been such that life could have existed , the researchers argue . ",
        "while these were many , many , many millennia apart , though , we 're still talking about a long time ago in both instances . as noted , one was billion years ago , during the moon 's peak volcanic activity , while the other occurred even longer ago -- at 4 billion years . considering that the first sexually reproducing organisms only appeared on earth billion years ago , that means that -- even if this is correct -- there was almost certainly no crossover between earth and moon potential lunar life-forms , provided they existed , would n't have been much to write home about either . ",
        "`` life would only be on the microbial level similar to sulfur bacteria on earth , '' schulze-makuch , as jeff goldblum once said in jurassic park , `` life , uh , finds a way . '' even if that life turns out to be extinct moon sulfur rather than the promised little gray men ! the research paper , titled `` was there an early habitability window for earth 's moon ? '' , was recently published in the journal astrobiology . "
