        "with one of the main concerns for the chicago bears at outside linebacker , who could potentially help fill the void ? the chicago bears are a week away from playing in the hall of fame game . that means the regular season is right around the corner . the depth at outside linebacker remains the team 's biggest concern . the good news is that general manager ryan pace still has time to address , leonard floyd and sam acho are slated to be the team 's starters . floyd could very well put up double-digit sacks if he stays healthy all 16 games . ",
        "acho is a nice player and he does things on the football field that sacks ca n't necessarily measure . still , you do n't want him them are isaiah irving , kasim edebali , andrew trumbetti , aaron lynch , kylie fitts and elijah norris . lynch is the most proven out of any of them , but he 's been hurt three times already this offseason . once he returns from this hamstring injury , can he stay healthy all season ? despie being a sixth-round draft pick , fitts has shown a lot of potential rushing the passer thus far in training camp . ",
        "talent was not the issue for why he was drafted in the later rounds . rather , it was his injury history . well , that trend seems to have followed him to the bears as he 's currently out with a shoulder edebali , trumbetti , or norris have to see meaningful time in the regular season , the bears are in good news is that with it being the preseason , players on other teams are going to be cut and trades are going to be made . who can the bears bring onto the team in the coming weeks ?
