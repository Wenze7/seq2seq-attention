        "oakland -- rumors swirled just before tuesday 's 1 pdt nonwaiver trade deadline that the a 's had a deal in place to acquire starting pitcher mike fiers from the detroit tigers . reports then came out about five minutes later saying contract issues would prevent the deal . fiers is on a 1-year , $ 6 million deal and arbitration eligible for out it was more about asking price than money . `` no , money was not an issue , '' tigers gm al avila told anthony fenech of the detroit free press . `` really , for us , what we 're trying to accumulate is the best players and talent possible so money was never an issue . ",
        "`` fiers , 33 , would have represented a significant upgrade for the a 's starting rotation . the right-hander has been solid for the tigers : 7-6 with a era in 20 starts with 86 strikeouts and only 26 walks over 117 's general manager david forst said the club was in on several players over the past week and looking to make a deal , but the asking prices in terms of prospects were ultimately too high on some of the players targeted . `` a lot of things have to come together to make any deal . ",
        "ownership showed they were willing to take on money with the familia deal , so that was n't an issue , '' forst said . `` it 's also about getting the right guy . it has to be the right fit , and it just did n't come together today . `` the a 's find themselves in a surprising playoff race . they enter tuesday night 's game against toronto only two games behind the seattle mariners for the second american league wild-card spot and five games behind the houston astros for first place in the al than sean manaea , the a 's have not had a starting pitcher complete seven innings since chris bassitt went seven june 9 against the kansas city royals . ",
        "bassitt , currently in the minor leagues , is one of 12 pitchers who have made a start for the a 's this season . fiers had averaged just under six innings per start this to add to their pitching rotation , the a 's will continue hoping starters can provide five or six quality innings before turning matters over to the bullpen . the a 's relief staff has been dominant . only six teams in the majors have a lower era and none can match oakland 's 28 's manager bob melvin might have foreshadowed this scenario monday when asked if he thought the club would make a deal at the deadline . ",
        "`` i try not to look too much into it . i do n't want to be disappointed , '' melvin said . `` i like the roster we have . if we do n't do anything else , i 'm happy with it . if we do , that 'd be a nice surprise . `` the a 's did bolster their bullpen just over a week ago with the addition of jeurys familia from the new york mets , giving them what they believe are three closer-type pitchers to pitch the final three innings of games . but workload out of the bullpen will be an issue , especially as the dog days of august petit currently leads all al relievers in innings pitched , and back-end pieces lou trivino and blake treinen are both on pace to eclipse their highest innings pitched totals of their careers as is still the aug. . ",
        "31 waiver trade deadline , which often features teams looking to shed contracts . we saw how that worked out for the astros last year when they landed justin probably wo n't be a verlander on this year 's market , but pitchers such as matt harvey and tyson ross could be options for the a 's . `` we explored a little bit of everything . position players , starters , and relievers , '' forst said . `` i think we 'll continue to monitor the club and figure out where the best fit is . `` do n't expect top prospect jesus luzardo to make an appearance in oakland this season . ",
        "though he 's been utterly dominant this season , set to get moved up to triple-a after starting out the year at high-a stockton , forst said it 's unlikely the a 's will seriously consider him as a call up . `` it 's not something we 've discussed , '' forst said . `` i do n't rule anything out , but i do n't expect him to be here . `` luzardo , 20 , has surprised the entire organization with his rapid progress . he 's combined to go 9-4 with a era in 18 starts at single-a and double-a this season with 109 strikeouts and just 22 walks over 88 1/3 innings pitched .

        "the a 's have placed the left-hander on an innings limit of 125 for the year . "
