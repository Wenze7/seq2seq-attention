        "if wall street 's job is to provide guidance before key moments for companies , then they are falling asleep at the wheel on the volatile tesla . who can blame many analysts for being non-commital on tesla 's stock into earnings on wednesday . one outrageous comment by tesla ceo elon musk on the earnings call could send the stock in the toilet come thursday morning . that would be in addition to the inevitable concerns from the report about tesla 's cash position . why bother going out on the limb with a tesla call a mere months removed from holiday bonus season ? ",
        "here 's a great example of some last-minute mixed research on tesla into earnings via cfra : `` with the shares below our 12-month target price of $ 300 , we raise our opinion to hold . we will update our perspective on tsla after their expected report on 8/1 after the close . regardless of q2 results , we expect ongoing share price volatility , as the bulls and bears battle . we expect to see production rates progress in q3 beyond the 5,000 per week rate hit at q2-end , as the company moves towards projected sustained non-gaap profitability as early as 2019 . ",
        "we think elon musk 's short-term goal of q3 and q4 gaap profitability is neither sustainable nor necessary , but a distraction from what is really important - steadily rising production model 3 volume with improving profit margins and self-supporting cash flow . meanwhile , we still forecast a capital raise in q1 2019 to support existing operations and growth initiatives . '' among the 34 analysts on wall street that cover the money-losing tesla , 10 rate the stock a buy despite the prospect for endless losses and cash burn . the rest are divided equally among sell and hold ratings . ",
        "thanks for nothing , wall street . "
