        "the trial and error continues each day for the bears offense during training quarterback mitch trubisky has experienced growing pains and growth from play to play . he has been intercepted in all eight full-speed practices and has mixed in plenty of quality throws with inaccurate is july for a young team with a first-time head coach , a first-time nfl offensive coordinator and an inexperienced quarterback throwing to a new group of coordinator mark helfrich 's progress report monday on the offense and trubisky reflected that . `` obviously , he has turned the ball over too much , '' helfrich said . ",
        "`` some of that has been his fault , some of it not , which is usually the case . but the quarterback gets the blame . and so we 'll get it fixed . it 's so far so good . we 're nowhere -- nowhere -- near where we need to be . but we 're ... trending in the right direction . `` the bears are almost done installing coach matt nagy 's offense . soon the new plays and concepts will stop piling up on trubisky . the next stage , helfrich said , is for trubisky to develop total command of it all . ",
        "`` it 's an evolution to get to exactly who you want where by route , '' helfrich said . `` who you want where in the run game . what your strengths are . what the things you do n't necessarily want to major in are . that starts , certainly , with the quarterback and then every other position group around him . `` at this point for trubisky , when he receives a play call , coaches notice him nod his head as he processes each element of the call : the formation , the motion , the protection and the , that thought process will become `` instantaneous , '' helfrich said . ",
        "`` in a game plan situation , he 'll know what 's coming , '' he said . `` so for a quarterback , you just want an immediate picture in your head of what 's going on . one thing to think about , not seven . `` right now , we 're still at that stage where it 's , ok , who 's at this position ? what 's my personnel group ? what 's the snap count ? and all the things that take place . it is truly a process right now whereas that will be seamless . ",
        "`` and that 's just before the snap . `` he 's got a great release , '' helfrich said . `` he sees things pretty well , and that 's the thing , probably , if he has anything to just processing why we 're doing a , b , and c . that 's ongoing . it 's not slow , but it 's never immediate , which is what every coach wants .
