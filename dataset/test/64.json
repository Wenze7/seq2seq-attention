        "the mlb trade deadline is less than 48 hours away and the philadelphia phillies are still looking to upgrade a couple positions of need . one of the positions that the phillies were looking to acquire was an infielder . over the last couple of weeks , the phillies were rumored to be interested in eduardo escobar , mike moustakas , and asdrubal cabrera . all guys who can provide some offensive firepower to their lineup . the phillies missed out on escobar , who was traded to the arizona diamondbacks earlier in the week but were able to grab cabrera . ",
        "philadelphia acquired the new york mets second baseman on friday in exchange for minor league pitcher franklyn kilome . this season with the mets , cabrera was slashing . 277 / . 329 / . 488 with 18 home runs and 58 rbis . cabrera will be splitting time between shortstop and second baseman with the phillies . he made his debut on saturday night against the cincinnati reds , going 0-for-4 with a strikeout . with the infielder issue solved for the phillies , they can now turn their attention to acquiring a fourth outfielder . last week , it was reported that philadelphia was talking with the toronto blue jays about curtis granderson and considering a trade for adam jones out of the baltimore orioles . ",
        "while there has not been much discussion about granderson , we did find out something new information about jones . according to dan connelly of the athletic , the phillies , cleveland indians , along with other multiple teams have contacted the orioles to see if the 13-year veteran would waive his 10-5 rights and accept a trade . to no avail , it seems like jones will be staying in baltimore for the rest of the season . `` based on information gathered from multiple sources , it does n't appear jones is going anywhere , at least not for the remainder of this season , '' wrote connelly in his latest story . ",
        "if jones does want to stay in baltimore , then the phillies must turn their attention to other options . is joey gallo a better option for the phillies ? another one of those outfield options could be joey gallo of the texas rangers . evan grant of the dallas morning news reported that the phillies along with the indians are expressing the most interest in the 24-year-old infielder/outfielder . this season , gallo is only slashing . 191 / . 307 / . 465 , but has 26 home runs and 59 rbis . not to mention , he already has 139 strikeouts and 54 walks through 100 games . ",
        "none of these numbers are appealing and actually go against the phillies ' offensive model . however , what does have teams interested is gallo 's contract situation and his ability to play multiple positions . aforementioned , he is only 24-years-old , but could become arbitration-eligible 2020 and ca n't hit free agency until 2023 . in layman 's terms , this means that whoever acquires gallo will have him under team control for a considerable amount of years . along with his team-friendly contract , gallo has shown the ability to play left field , first base , right field , and center field this season . ",
        "with all that being said , a trade for gallo is not imminent at the moment , but the rangers have reportedly not dismissed the idea . it should be interesting to see if the phillies can grab themselves either an extra outfielder or reliever in the bullpen by tuesday 's 4:00 et deadline . "
