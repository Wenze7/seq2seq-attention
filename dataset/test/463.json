        "washington -- if you 're in the seven - or eight-figure income bracket , the report on the trump administration looking at tax breaks for capital gains is very good news indeed . but if you 're a working stiff , then it 's just another day at the office or shop floor . southwestern connecticut has plenty of both kinds -- and a lot in between as well . fairfield county , for instance , is known for having a grand canyon-sized income gap -- the `` epicenter of american inequality , '' as `` the atlantic '' once put it . ",
        "so what does the lawmaker who represents them all think of this idea ? rep. jim himes , d-conn . , certainly has feet in both camps . he has the goldman sachs background , to be sure . and lord knows his constituency includes a fair number of veteran coupon-clippers . but he also has the `` do-gooder '' box checked off as the spanish-speaking son of aid workers in peru and columbia . and he worked on housing at a new york city non-profit before running for congress . so there 's plenty of constituents at the low end of the income spectrum who need representation too . ",
        "`` the preferable treatment that capital gains receive under tax law already disproportionately benefits the very wealthy , '' said himes in a statement . `` these proposed changes , allowing individuals to adjust costs to account for inflation , would mean billions more in tax breaks , not for working americans whose money comes from wages , but for the investor class . '' take that , greenwich and westport ! at this point , the capital gains cut is just an idea percolating in the mind of treasury secretary steve mnuchin . it 's another facet of the long-held `` trickle down '' belief among republicans . ",
        "whether it sees the light of day is very much in doubt . but it is definitely good to know himes ' answer to the query posed in the old-time union anthem : `` which side are you on ? '' =============== full disclosure : the press of deadlines and an impending office move here in prevented me from getting over to the tax-fraud trial of new britain 's own paul manafort at the federal courthouse in alexandria , va. . but i 've covered a few major trials in my days here in dc . so with the help of various news outlets and sources , i managed to cobble together some impressions from afar . ",
        "we know that `` russia , '' `` trump , '' `` mueller '' or `` collusion '' are hardly mentioned in the ninth floor courtroom in alexandria , a classic row-house community just across the potomac from manafort 's defense attorney , thomas zehnle , did his best to paint manafort as a self-made success , `` a second-generation immigrant , the first in his family to go to college . '' no mention , of course , of the senior paul manafort 's political dominance in new britain as republican mayor from 1965 to 1971 , nor manafort brothers construction 's immigrant founder , james manafort , who established the new britain house wrecking company in 1919 . ",
        "the crusty judge , ellis iii , wants to keep things rolling along in what promises to be a multi-week trial . on day one , he admonished the prosecutor that being wealthy and spending a lot is not a crime . that 's too bad for the prosecution because a lot of the jury-appeal for their case rests on the parade of witnesses testifying about luxurious car and clothing purchases , all paid for by sketchy wire transfers from foreign bank accounts . for the press , it 's a retro-1980s atmosphere with no laptops and no phones allowed in the courtroom . ",
        "the caf√© across the plaza is charging $ 4 a day for reporters to stow their stuff for the day . such a windfall ! the washington post reported that during the prosecution 's opening statement , the 12 jurors appeared riveted -- with several taking notes . when the defense took its turn , jurors who had taken notes no longer were scribbling . and a few appeared to nod off a bit . so for manafort , 69 , it 's not breath-holding time . but the trial has far to go so the jury is still out , so to speak .
