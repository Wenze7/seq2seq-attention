        "if yu darvish was n't injured or tyler chatwood had pitched up to expectations , the cubs would have had no need to acquire starter cole hamels for the stretch the cubs had drafted and developed a reliable starter or two over their first five drafts under the theo epstein regime , at least one would be ready by now and they would have had no need for the rest of the rotation had pitched up to its talent level the first three months , the cubs would have had a big enough lead in the national league central and no need for of those things happened , of course , and that 's why the cubs are bringing in a 34-year-old pitcher who appears to be past his sell-by deal was made official friday , with the cubs sending pitcher eddie butler , class a pitcher rollie lacy and a player to be named to the rangers for hamels and it 's up to hamels to prove himself , and in doing so prove epstein right for making the this age of five-inning starters , it should n't be much to ask hamels to eat innings , which once was his specialty .",
        "he threw 200 or more innings in eight of nine seasons between 2009 and ' in 12 starts from april 13 to june 19 , hamels had a era and limited hitters to a . 215 average , throwing six or more innings in 11 of the 12 games . that pitcher would be slotted in as no . 2 in the cubs rotation behind jon lester , and we probably would n't be debating the merits of the 's the last five starts that are concerning . hamels has compiled a era since june 25 with a . 370 opponents ' average and a ops against . ",
        "he allowed seven runs in three of those starts and lasted only two-thirds of an inning in this were a one-month slump during hamel 's phillies days , you could shrug it off . but pitchers as a rule wear down as they age , and hamels is no different . that does n't mean he does n't have anything left , but we should n't expect him to be the same pitcher he was three or four years the cubs can say is their frustration level with chatwood is at peak levels , and they needed someone -- anyone -- to make up for chatwood 's dismal 85 walks in 94 innings is outrageous , the kind of stat that normally would lead to a demotion . ",
        "chatwood has a 21-walk lead over the next-worst offender in the category , white sox starter lucas giolito . he 's on his way to becoming the first pitcher with 100 or more walks since edison volquez and ricky romero issued 105 in fans clearly are tired of hearing about his great `` stuff '' when they can see his wildness almost every outing . he ranked fourth-worst in the majors last year with 77 walks , so it 's not exactly shocking . ",
        "but it 's now beyond annoying to course you ca n't send down a pitcher in the first year of a three-year , $ 38 million deal , so chatwood stays and likely gets another chance to redeem about darvish 's uncertain return date or the possibility of drew smyly pitching in to help , the only question that matters now is how epstein and joe maddon will fit six pitchers into what has been a five-man six-man rotation would be one way , but you would be punishing the one guy , lester , who has given you the most .",
        "for now , maddon said friday the cubs would stick with a five-man was no secret lester and jake arrieta were n't big fans of going to a six-man rotation in the past . like most starters , they like their routines between starts , and an extra day off forces them to both went along with the plan , and the bottom line is it recovering from a poor outing after the all-star break with a strong performance against the diamondbacks on wednesday , lester had an interesting remark on coming out of the game in the seventh after serving up a tying home run to pollock on his 103rd admitted he wanted to go one more batter . ",
        "`` my job is to throw the ball as long as i 'm told to , '' he said . `` i do n't make those decisions . i think in any workplace you do n't always agree with your boss , but he 's your boss and he makes decisions , so there 's nothing you can really do about it . `` there 's nothing lester can do about it if his boss goes with a six-man rotation , even if it 's not his fault the cubs are in that position . ",
        "he does have clout , but we have n't seen him exercise it like he did with the red cubs could send mike montgomery back to the bullpen , pointing to his workload and a whip in three starts in would be difficult to rationalize keeping chatwood in the rotation and putting montgomery back with the dancing relievers , other than to point out montgomery can fill any role needed and the cubs have a hole in the late-inning lefty role brian duensing was supposed to fill but has lester , montgomery might not agree with his bosses if epstein and maddon go this route , but there 's really nothing he can do about it matter how the pieces of the puzzle fit , it 's going to be fascinating to watch the last two months and in october ."
