        "cubs pitcher jon lester weighed in about the rash of ugly tweets from mlb players that recently have been of it was sage advice . `` spend the 5 minutes it takes to scrub your account . '' `` do n't say stupid things in the first place . '' it 's what every parent should tell their teenage some of his advice missed the point . `` i know some of these guys are great dudes who just had lapses in judgement . ... too many young guys are getting burned . `` lester 's perspective on these racist , homophobic and misogynistic tweets has been a common reaction . ",
        "the focus has been on the negative publicity , the embarrassment caused to the player or the supposed unfairness of having past tweets deliberately that athletes scrub their social media accounts is treating a symptom , not the too often that 's how we as a country deal with racism , sexism or homophobia . `` you ca n't say that out loud '' is something you probably have heard someone tell a friend who blurted an offensive phrase . `` you ca n't talk like that in public . `` less common is the advice to examine and try to change our biased views . ",
        "i 've heard almost nobody discuss the ramifications these tweets have on teammates or fans who are the targets of has been far less focus on the culture in baseball , which has a history of racism . there have been few calls for mlb to develop better anti-bias training for need to be more voices like nationals pitcher sean doolittle . `` it 's a privilege to play in the major leagues and we have an obligation to leave the game better than we found it , '' he tweeted monday . `` there 's no place for racism , insensitive language or even casual homophobia .

",
        "these players should n't be suspended . rather they should explain how their thinking has evolved . they should seek anti-bias training and talk to people affected by should listen to doolittle : `` we have to start caring as much about the content of the posts as we do about when they were made and how they came to light .
