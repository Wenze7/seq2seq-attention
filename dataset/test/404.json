        "mayor rahm emanuel and illinois attorney general lisa madigan plan to announce a proposed court agreement friday afternoon that would govern reforms in the troubled chicago police news conference is scheduled for 2 , and city officials are holding briefings for attorneys and other stakeholders beforehand , sources at an early friday morning news conference to address whether the proposed consent decree would be made public friday afternoon , police superintendent eddie johnson said , `` i knew someone was going to ask that . '' he then discussed the work that went into the forthcoming document . `` this is the result of a lot of negotiations with the police department , the mayor 's office and the attorney general , '' johnson said as emanuel looked on at an event to announce that a new crop of officers would be hitting the streets . ",
        "`` and look , we -- the mayor and myself -- made a commitment to you a couple years ago that we would reform the way the chicago police did business . `` we started this two years ago , '' he said . `` so a lot of what you 're going to see are things that are already in place . `` emanuel then took the mic at the central district police station in the south loop and touted the measures already taken to overhaul officer training and equipment . ",
        "`` this is a culmination of a lot of other things that have been happening with oversight , but it 's out of the commitment we 've made collectively to the public that we 're going to have a police department that reflects our community policing values and principles , '' emanuel march , city officials and madigan 's office agreed to allow groups including the american civil liberties union of illinois and black lives matter chicago to give input and criticize the proposed order , and those groups can seek to use the courts to enforce the final consent decree .",
        "the deal imposes a deadline of sept. . 1 for the city and madigan 's office to file a proposed order with judge robert dow , who will then hold hearings involving stakeholders and eventually rule on a final consent , the chicago fraternal order of police , whose leaders want the litigation over the consent decree dismissed , are seeking to intervene in the case , though dow has yet to rule on whether the union can get impending fight over the final document comes at a consequential moment in city politics and sept. . 5 , officer jason van dyke is scheduled to go on trial on murder charges in the shooting of african-american 17-year-old laquan mcdonald . ",
        "the court-ordered november 2015 release of video of van dyke shooting the teenager 16 times touched off furious street protests rooted in long-standing complaints about police abuse , primarily from african-americans and latinos . the controversy spurred efforts to overhaul the department , and an eventual consent decree likely would mark the most sweeping and long-lasting political consequence of mcdonald 's recorded the volatility that continues to surround policing in chicago , the fatal police shooting of an armed man in the south shore neighborhood july 14 touched off violent clashes between protesters and dyke 's trial and efforts to hammer out a court order are poised to fall in the last months of emanuel 's campaign for re-election . ",
        "the mayor faces multiple challengers who could use his efforts at police reform to cast him as either indifferent to police abuse or too eager to restrain police in a city riven by violent is not running for re-election , which means one of two candidates -- democrat kwame raoul or republican erika harold -- would inherit a role in the consent decree emanuel administration has traveled a circuitous route to the proposed consent the mcdonald video sparked a political crisis 2 1/2 years ago , emanuel at first rejected calls for an investigation by the department of justice but reversed himself as the concept gained support from other political officials .",
        "the resulting federal investigation led to a report released in january 2017 that described a comprehensively broken police department in which badly trained cops have practiced brutality and misconduct with little to fear from their supervisors or a largely ineffectual disciplinary report emerged in the last days of an obama administration that moved aggressively to reform local police agencies , and emanuel voiced support for a consent decree . but the trump administration has shown no interest in intervening in local police agencies , and emanuel last summer backed away from his support for a consent decree . the mayor argued he could bring meaningful reform to the department through an out-of-court agreement with the trump administration involving a monitor , but activists and former justice department lawyers blasted that proposal , voicing skepticism that significant change would come without a judge to impose august 2017 , madigan sued the city to force a consent decree , and emanuel said he would negotiate toward one . ",
        "black lives matter chicago and the aclu , meanwhile , brought their own lawsuits seeking to compel changes in the department . the emanuel administration and madigan 's office reached an in-court deal giving those activist groups a role in creating and enforcing a consent recent days , attorneys for city hall and madigan 's office told dow they 'd reached consensus on most topics but could not agree on whether chicago police should have to document incidents in which officers point guns at people . lawyers for madigan 's office wanted the incidents documented , and lawyers for the city apparently implementation of the consent decree is expected to be overseen by an independent monitor who reports to the judge . ",
        "typically , consent decrees over law enforcement agencies have been overseen by a lead monitor along with a team of deputies , often academics , lawyers and former police tuesday morning , emanuel also emphasized what he said were attempts to involve police in the reform process . `` and things like additional training , wellness , promotions , things officers for years and decades have been asking for , you will see -- when we 're ready -- encapsulated in that agreement . `` chicago tribune 's john byrne is a developing story .
