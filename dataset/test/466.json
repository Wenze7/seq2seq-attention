        "the aclu of northern california ran a test on amazon 's facial-recognition system and found something disturbing : it falsely matched the faces of 28 members of congress with the mugshots of people who have been releasing the results of its report thursday , the aclu reiterated its call for a moratorium on government use of facial recognition . `` congress should press for a federal moratorium on the use of face surveillance until its harms , particularly to vulnerable communities , are fully considered , '' said neema singh guliani , aclu legislative counsel , in a statement . ",
        "`` the public deserves a full debate about how and if face surveillance should be used . `` the aclu noted that its test also showed that `` congressional members of color were disproportionately identified incorrectly , including six members of the congressional black caucus , '' among them civil rights leader rep. john lewis , of the lawmakers whose face was mismatched by amazon 's system was one from the bay area : rep. mark desaulnier , d-concord . thursday , he and sen. ed markey , d-massachusetts , and rep. luis gutierrez , d-illinois , who were also misidentified , sent a letter to amazon ceo jeff bezos , asking him to provide details about law enforcement 's use of rekognition , among other things . ",
        "`` amazon must slow down and consider not just its profit margin , but the impact on society that this technology will have , '' desaulnier said in an email statement to this news organization has been facing other resistance against rekognition , its facial-recognition software , including from its own employees . in june , gizmodo reported that amazon workers sent a letter to bezos , urging him to stop selling facial recognition to law enforcement , among other things . amazon shareholders also asked bezos the same thing , saying , `` such government surveillance infrastructure technology may not only pose a privacy threat to customers and other stakeholders across the country , but may also raise substantial risks for our company , negatively impacting our company 's stock valuation and increasing financial risk for shareholders . ",
        "`` despite the controversy , `` we remain excited about how image and video analysis can be a driver for good in the world , including in the public sector and law enforcement , '' an amazon web services spokeswoman said added that aclu 's test did not set the confidence threshold -- the likelihood that the system found a match -- high enough . `` while 80 % confidence is an acceptable threshold for photos of hot dogs , chairs , animals , or other social media use cases , it would n't be appropriate for identifying individuals with a reasonable level of certainty , '' she said . ",
        "`` when using facial recognition for law enforcement activities , we guide customers to set a threshold of at least 95 % or higher . `` in response , the aclu pointed out thursday that amazon sets 80 percent confidence as rekognition 's default threshold , and that the company 's own website shows the company `` is recommending '' an 80 percent confidence score in ` face-based user verification . ' `` as for the aclu 's point about bias in facial recognition , especially when it comes to people with darker skin , it 's a common knock against the technology -- and one that is being addressed by microsoft and ibm , they announced recently . ",
        "`` face surveillance will be used to power discriminatory surveillance and policing that targets communities of color , immigrants , and activists , '' said jacob snow , technology and civil liberties attorney at the aclu of northern california , in a statement . `` once unleashed , that damage ca n't be undone . `` in addition , microsoft president brad smith last month called for regulation of facial recognition , saying tech companies ca n't regulate themselves on this issue , and especially if government is using the technology for various purposes .
