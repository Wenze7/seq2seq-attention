        "a new study from georgia tech revealed that dehydration affects mental performance . people who are finding it hard to focus or struggling with motor coordination may want to try drinking water to see if it helps . dehydration apparently not only affects the physical well-being of people , but also their mental performance , according to a new study from the georgia institute of technology in much water to drink in a day ? the answer to that question is not as simple as eight glasses . too little risks dehydration , while too much may lead to water intoxication . ",
        "nevertheless , people who find it hard to focus might want to try drinking water and see if it was dehydration causing their mental effects on the brainaccording to a new study published in the medicine & science in sports & exercise journal , dehydration impairs cognitive performance , particularly in tasks that involve attention , executive function , and motor coordination . these activities are affected when water deficits exceed 2 percent body mass loss , the study claimed , after the researchers analyzed data from several peer-reviewed research papers on dehydration and cognitive ability . `` we find that when people are mildly dehydrated they really do n't do as well on tasks that require complex processing or on tasks that require a lot of their attention , '' said georgia tech 's exercise physiology laboratory director mindy subjects got more dehydrated , most of them increasingly made mistakes in attention-related tasks that were unexciting and repetitive , such as pressing a button in different patterns for several minutes .

        "real-world cases of such activities include focusing during a long meeting , driving a car , or doing a monotonous job in a researchers expressed concern that dehydration may lead to accidents , particularly in scenarios where people heavily sweat in dangerous environments such as around heavy of drinking waterfor average-sized people , 2 percent dehydration , which is when mental performance drops off , is equivalent to sweating out about a liter of water . that might sound a lot of sweat , but it actually happens faster than most people would think . `` most people do n't realize how high their sweat rate is in the heat , '' said university of connecticut professor of kinesiology and korey stringer institute ceo doug casa . ",
        "`` if you 're going hard during a run , you can reach that level of dehydration in about 30 minutes . `` what this means is that , for people to maintain proper physical and mental performance , drinking water regularly , especially when outside on hot days , is a water may not have been a top result when asking how to improve mental ability , but the new study shows that addressing dehydration is a possible answer .
