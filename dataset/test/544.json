        "las vegas -- someone here asked harden how long it took him to get over the rockets loss in the western conference finals . but it was a trick question . `` it 's on my mind every day , '' harden said . `` game 6 , game 7 . that 's what drives me every day . `` while the mvp has n't forgotten , houston 's days as the warriors ' main threat are starting to feel like a distant memory . the reigning nba champions raised the bar this off-season by adding all-star center demarcus cousins , who should be healthy by playoff time . ",
        "the rockets , meanwhile , lost two key role players to free agency , trevor ariza and luc mbah a moute . `` it does n't change anything , '' harden said during the two-day team usa mini-camp , which wrapped up friday at unlv . `` we already know what the warriors can bring . obviously , demarcus cousins is very skilled and talented . but they 're still the warriors . they 've won three out of the past four championships . `` we 're right there . last year we showed we were right there . we 'll be right there this year as well . ",
        "`` ariza , who led the nba in steal-to-turnover ratio , signed a one-year , $ 15 million deal with the phoenix suns . mbah a moute , a key reserve , got $ million from the los angeles clippers . both helped fuel houston 's rapid improvement on defense as the rockets went from no . 18 in defensive efficiency to no . 6 last did re-sign restricted free agent center clint capela . `` you have to realize that was me and chris first year together , '' harden said . `` people were saying , ` can they play together ? ",
        "can they make it work ? ' we made it work . it was easy . `` harden has a point . the rockets went 42-3 when harden , paul and capela played together . they outscored opponents by an average of points in those was capela , who , after the rockets beat the warriors 116-110 on jan. . 20 , all but declared a changing of the guard in the western conference : `` we are better than them . '' and for much of the year , including the conference finals , he was right . the rockets earned the no . ",
        "1 seed with a franchise-record 65-17 regular season , and led the league in point differential . dethroning the warriors was the plan all along , as general manager daryl morey made clear on espn radio in december : `` it 's the only thing we think about . i think i 'm not supposed to say that , but we 're basically obsessed with , ` how do we beat the warriors ? ' `` but did the rockets miss their window ? with paul out because of a hamstring injury , the rockets blew a 17-point lead in game 6 before unraveling again in game 7 , when they went 1 for 21 from long range in the second 's what haunts harden . ",
        "that 's what drives him . `` i try to work my butt off and try to mentally lock in as much as i can to get back to that feeling , '' he said . `` that feeling . you 're right there . you 're one half away . and then road blockage . you have to find a way to get past that road block . it was just too tough . we have to get back there . `` getting back there could hinge on a resurgent performance from carmelo anthony , the 10-time all-star , who is expected to sign as a free agent once he clears waivers . ",
        "he averaged points on percent shooting for the oklahoma city thunder last season . anthony will likely replace ariza in the starting lineup . `` everybody in the world knows what carmelo brings , how gifted and talented he is , '' harden said . `` he still has a lot more to go . if he comes to the rockets , he 'll bring the best out of us and i 'm sure we 'll bring the best out of us as well . `` harrison barnes , the former warrior now with the dallas mavericks , agrees . ",
        "`` the rockets won 60-plus games last year , '' he said with a laugh . `` you 're not going to tamper with that . they 're a good team , regardless of losing ariza and moute . if they add carmelo or anyone else , i think they have a system in place that makes them difficult to guard . `` harden is coming off a season in which he joined michael jordan as the only players to average at least 30 points , 8 assists , rebounds and steals per game in a season . he became just the second rocket to lead the league in scoring and the first since moses malone in 1981-82 to average at least 30 points a reward ? ",
        "the warriors added an all-star center while the los angeles lakers brought in lebron james in hopes of putting together their own super team . `` nothing changes , man , '' harden said . `` the west is already a beast . so the lakers got better , but they 're still in the conference with the warriors . so no matter how you look at it , you still have go through some beasts . '' -- the warriors have the most players in this 35-man pool for the usa national team . kevin durant was the only one on the court , while stephen curry , klay thompson and draymond green skipped this camp for personal time .
