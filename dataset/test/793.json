        "legendary artist oscar chavez is 24 -- approximately 48 in internet years -- making this the prime time for his first `` fashion nova presents : carpe dm '' showing at the chicago artists coalition . a south side native with `` absolutely no affiliation '' with the school of the art institute of chicago , chavez earned his degree in studio arts from the university of illinois at chicago last year and is capping off his bolt residency with this new curation , which he says honors both queer history and youth-driven digital following is an edited transcript from a phone interview with the tribune : having a retrospective at your age is a new concept . ",
        "how did that come to fruition ? oscar chavez : i graduated from undergrad last year , and this is a show that is a retrospective of my entire artistic career , which i think is super fun . it 's spanned painting and performance , and the show itself has wearable works in it . i think of that as the medium between painting and performance . at uic , they let you do whatever you want and figure it out , which i : how did you figure it out ? a : i am from the south side of chicago , which continues to shape the way i explore the arts community here . ",
        "in college , i was making photos , i was making performances , i was making paintings , i was making everything under the sun and then really just learning how to edit it all down . i worked there and then applied to bolt . that was kind of a crazy long shot , because i do n't have my mfa or teaching experience . i had that delusional confidence of a millennial who has n't had to deal with life yet . i find that in my work , too -- i have stuff to say , and i 'm just going to keep putting it out there . ",
        "i think it 's really : i really admire the fanged femininity of your wearable pieces . where did you find the impulse to create these ? a : a lot of it began with performances . i would be making these costumes inspired by other artists with distinct personal style . i 've always loved thinking about personal style , and getting dressed every day is a long performance for me . it 's such a fun way of presenting yourself . there was a performance that i did that was inspired by a moment when a lot of luxury brands co-opted protest language for their clothing . ",
        "i explored the questions that arose : what is the real power in what you put on your body ? what does that get across ? that really pushed a ton of different works into performances . in this show , all of my wearables are going to be there on a rail for people to try on , which i think is going to be really fun . i 'm really interested in how other people are going to engage with : and your queer identity plays a big role in the : i come from a queer history and lineage that embraces camp and drag . ",
        "i think drag has become more nuanced as time goes on -- it 's less about performing another gender and more about presenting an idealized self in the world . i think we 're always performing a version of that , especially with social media and our multiplicities of identities . we 're always performing , we 're always dressing up . i did a performance in a dress that said , `` my solo show opens july 27 . '' it was about being in full drag and going to events in a wig and makeup in a way that looked ridiculous , but the text was out there and you had to deal with it when you saw : talk to me more about your aesthetic . ",
        "how did you develop it ? a : i have an investment in old-school glamour expressed in cheap ways . i feel super fortunate to come from a generation that has those queer ancestors . people usually bring up john waters and stuff like that -- this glamour that 's kind of dirty . for example , i love tulle because it 's so cheap and you can do so much with it . i love long , opera-length gloves that are glamorous and also ridiculous . coming as a queer kid from underprivileged communities where glamour was n't something i interacted with a lot , it 's something that i push now . ",
        "it 's a lifestyle . you see people when they put on a glove , and they look at the themselves in the mirror . it feels really : but , like you said , it 's not just a matter of lookin ' : i 've had people talk with me about my work and its concepts of self-autonomy -- the way that i exist and present myself in these spaces . i 've also made a lot of work in feminine and gay male : how have social media and the internet informed your work ? i think my work is much more about the cross-cultural interactions that happen because of the internet . ",
        "i 'm not making work about the internet , i 'm making work from it . i 'm making work about being raised on it . i 'm making work using the languages and the tools that the internet has made for us . in many ways , many of my paintings are memes . they do n't really look like memes , but they work in similar ways . they 're compacting all of this history onto a flat surface and asking people to unpack it . you have the tools to do it if you 've been raised on the internet , raised in these subcultures created from : there 's a total fluency -- the internet 's language is how you came into articulating your fully realized , adult : it feels very natural . ",
        "the idea of that dress -- i knew that people were going to take pictures of me , so that text got pushed even further , past the people who were actually in that space . it 's an awareness that , yes , i am a person who exists in the world , but i am also a person who exists on the internet , and i am a person who is going to exist in people 's minds past that . `` fashion nova presents : carpe dm '' is on exhibition through aug. . 16 at chicago artists coalition , 2130 w. fulton st. ; .
