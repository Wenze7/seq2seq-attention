        "outfit : forever 21 settkees sandalsasos earrings gucci bagi feel like i 'm ready to take off on another vacation with this resort wear look . take me back to the warm weather and margaritas please ! lately , i 've been finding amazing deals on the cutest clothes . it 's not always easy to find clothes that are affordable , cute and fit well . i wanted the perfect summer set that was comfortable on and flattering in all the right places . i found this two-piece set from forever 21 . it comes in three beautiful summer colors . ",
        "i chose the blue because i thought it would look nice with tan skin . i love this set because each piece can be worn separately . the ruffle detailing in the top ties nicely with the tassels on the pants . i styled with a pair of tassel earrings from asos . of course you can find tassel earrings anywhere . i thought the contrast of pink earrings and a blue ensemble made for a great look . i kept my sandals neutral to balance out my colorful outfit . i recently picked up two pairs of tkees sandals . ",
        "these are the best minimalistic sandals i 've come across ! they come in a variety of nude colors as well . my favorite part about these sandals is they do n't feel or look cheap . a lot of times wearing sandals or flip-flops can really bring down an outfit , but not with these ! definitely add to the resort vibe i was going for . highly recommend checking out their sandals .
